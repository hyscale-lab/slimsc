Okay, so I have this physics problem about the quantum rotation-vibration model of a diatomic molecule. Hmm, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would switch it to the next state with the lowest possible energy. 

Wait, I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the state of lowest energy, right? So the next state after that would be the next higher energy state, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a rotational state change. But the problem says 'lowest possible energy' next state—so I think it's the next state with the least energy increase. That would probably involve the vibrational transition because maybe that's a bigger jump than a rotational one? Or wait, no, maybe the opposite. Oh wait, the rotational states have a certain spacing, and vibrational states have a larger spacing. So the next state would be the next vibrational state, but wait, the fundamental state is the first vibrational level (v=0), so the next would be v=1. But wait, it's possible that the molecule could also change its rotational state without changing vibration. Hmm, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, wait, maybe it's a transition that involves the least energy. So maybe the first possible transition is a change in the rotational state. Or perhaps a combination of both.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The model combines both rotation and vibration. The energy levels are given by the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental state is the lowest, so for vibration, v=0, and for rotation, J=0 (since J is the rotational quantum number). The next possible state would be the next higher energy state. So the possible next states could be either increasing J, or increasing v. Which requires more energy? The vibrational energy levels have larger spacing than the rotational ones, right? Because the vibrational energy levels are quantized as (n + ½) ħω, so each step is ħω. While the rotational energy levels are (J)(J+1)ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The spacing between rotational levels depends on J, but each step is smaller than the vibrational step.

So if the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next state with the lowest energy would be either a vibrational transition (v=1, J=0) or a rotational transition (v=0, J=1). Which of these requires less energy? Let's compute the energy difference for each.

First, the vibrational energy difference. The energy for vibration is E_vib = (v + ½) ħω. So the change from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_vib = ħω.

For the rotational energy, J=0 to J=1. The rotational energy is E_rot = [ J (J+1) ] * ħ²/(2I). The moment of inertia I for a diatomic is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass. So I = (mX * mY)/(mX + mY) * r². Wait, but then for the rotational energy difference between J=0 and J=1:

E_rot at J=1 is (1*2) * ħ²/(2I) = 2 ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I)
E_rot at J=0 is 0, so ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I)

We need to compare ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot. If ΔE_rot is less than ΔE_vib, then the photon would cause a rotational transition. If not, then a vibrational transition.

So let's compute both energies.

First, compute the vibrational energy difference. The angular frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. Planck's constant ħ is h/(2π). h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ = 6.626e-34 / (2 * 3.1416) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

ΔE_vib = ħ * ω = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) = 4.218e-20 J.

Now for the rotational energy difference.

Compute the reduced mass μ. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh, wait, 20 and 2, so 20+2=22 amu. So yes, 40/22 is about 1.818 amu.

But we need the reduced mass in kg. 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that. 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ around 3.025e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 1.818 * 1.6605 = ?

1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.989, 0.018*1.6605≈0.0299, so total ≈ 3.0189e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = (3.0189e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0189e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.20756e-46 kg·m².

Then, ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34 J·s)^2 / (1.20756e-46 kg·m²)

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx (1e-34)^2 = 1e-68, but let's compute it more precisely. 1.05457^2 ≈ 1.112, so 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

Wait, actually, J is kg·m²/s², so J·s is kg·m²/s. So (J·s)^2 is kg²·m^4/s². Then divided by kg·m² gives kg·m²/s², which is J.

Wait, but regardless, let's compute the value.

Numerator ≈ (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (kg^2 m^4 s^-2). Wait, no, J is kg m²/s², so (J s)^2 is (kg^2 m^4 s^0), so when divided by I (kg m²), gives kg m² s^-2, which is J.

So ΔE_rot = (1.112e-68) / (1.20756e-46) = 1.112 / 1.20756 * 1e-22 J ≈ 0.9207e-22 J = 9.207e-23 J.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 1e-68 divided by 1e-46 is 1e-22. But wait, 1.112e-68 divided by 1.20756e-46 is (1.112 / 1.20756) * 1e-22. 1.112 / 1.20756 is approximately 0.92, so 0.92e-22 J, which is 9.2e-23 J.

Now, comparing ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot. ΔE_vib was 4.218e-20 J, and ΔE_rot is 9.2e-23 J. So ΔE_rot is much smaller. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 9.2e-23 is way smaller than 4.2e-20. So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational. So the molecule could absorb a photon that provides either of these energies, but since the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy, it would be the rotational transition, as it requires less energy.

Wait, but wait a second. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, but if it's in the ground vibrational state (v=0) and ground rotational state (J=0), then the next possible state would be the first excited state of either. Since the rotational transition is lower in energy, that's the next possible state with the least energy. So the photon's energy should match the rotational energy difference.

So the photon's energy should be equal to ΔE_rot.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Because the energy of the photon E = h f = p c, where p is the photon's momentum, and c is the speed of light.

Wait, because photons have energy E = pc, since for photons, E = hf and p = E/c. So p = E/(c).

So once we find the energy needed, the momentum is E divided by the speed of light.

So for the rotational transition, the energy is ΔE_rot ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

So p = ΔE_rot / c. c is about 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.066e-31 kg·m/s. Wait, but none of the options are close to that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait. Earlier, I thought the next state is the rotational transition because its energy is lower, but in reality, the rotational energy might not be available if the molecule is already in the lowest state. But wait, J can be 0, 1, 2, etc., so the next rotational state is J=1.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the ΔE_rot.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔE_rot. Let me redo it.

ΔE_rot = [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ] * ħ²/(2I)

Wait, no. Rotational energy levels are E_J = [ J (J +1) ] * ħ²/(2I).

So when J increases by 1, from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is:

E_1 - E_0 = [1*2 * ħ²/(2I)] - 0 = (2 ħ²/(2I)) = ħ²/(I).

So yes, that part is correct.

Wait, let me compute I more accurately.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2 amu) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that.

1.81818 * 1.660539 = 

Let me compute 1.8 * 1.660539 = 2.989, 

0.01818 * 1.660539 ≈ 0.0302.

So total ≈ 2.989 + 0.0302 = 3.0192e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = (3.0192e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0192e-27 *4e-20 = (3.0192 *4) = 12.0768e-47 kg m².

Wait, wait, 3.0192e-27 * 4e-20 = 12.0768e-47? Wait, 3.0192 *4 is 12.0768, and the exponents are e-27 * e-20 = e-47. So I = 1.20768e-46 kg m².

Then ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

So ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.20768e-46 = (1.112 / 1.20768) * 1e-22 J.

1.112 / 1.20768 ≈ 0.9207.

So ΔE_rot ≈ 0.9207e-22 J = 9.207e-23 J.

So the energy of the photon would need to be 9.207e-23 J.

Now, the photon's momentum p is E/c, since E = pc.

c is approximately 2.998e8 m/s.

So p = 9.207e-23 J / 2.998e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But looking at the options, none of them are around 1e-31. The options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C) 1.1e-27 Ns
D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, these are all around 1e-27 or 1e-28. So my earlier calculation is way off. Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Wait a second, I think I confused the rotational and vibrational transitions. Maybe the problem is actually about a vibrational transition, but why?

Wait, perhaps I should think again. Because the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be either J=1 (rotational) or v=1 (vibrational). But the vibrational transition's energy is much bigger, so the rotational transition is easier.

Wait, but why then the photon's momentum is not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, let's check the calculation of I.

Wait, no, the calculation seems correct. Maybe I should compute the vibrational transition instead, because perhaps the question is about a rotation-vibration transition or perhaps I misread the question.

Wait, the question says: the molecule is in its fundamental state. What photon momentum is needed for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, perhaps the "next state" is considering the combined rotational and vibrational energies. So the next state would be the combination of v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. Which requires less energy? Earlier, the rotational transition requires about 9e-23 J, and vibrational is 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition is lower. So the photon should have energy matching the rotational transition.

But according to the options, the given momenta are much larger. So maybe I've made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps the moment of inertia is m * r², not the reduced mass. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, in the rotational model, the moment of inertia is I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass. So that part is correct.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the problem is considering a transition where both vibrational and rotational levels change. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the minimal energy increment.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each vibrational quantum requires an energy of ħω. But if the molecule can't change vibration without rotation, but I don't think that's the case because each mode is quantized independently.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the next state as the next higher vibrational state, but that would be a much larger energy jump. But the photon's momentum in that case would be higher.

Wait, but the options don't have anything that matches 9e-23 J. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, perhaps I should compute I using the formula I = (mX * mY)/(mX + mY) * r², but in kg.

Let me compute that again.

mX = 20 amu. 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.321e-26 kg.

mY = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (mX * mY) / (mX + mY) = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) kg.

Wait no, wait: mX is 20 amu = 3.321e-26 kg, My is 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

Wait that's not right. 20 amu is 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

2 amu is 3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) kg. Wait no, μ is (mX * mY) / (mX + mY), but both mX and mY are in kg.

So mX = 3.321e-26 kg, mY = 3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) kg.

Compute numerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 ≈ 11.025 * 1e-53 = 1.1025e-52 kg².

Denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 * (1 + 0.1) )= 3.321e-26 * 1.1 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

So μ = (1.1025e-52) / (3.6531e-26) = approx 3.018e-27 kg. Which matches what I had before. So I think the calculation is correct.

So perhaps the problem is that I'm calculating for J=0 to J=1, but maybe the next state is a combination of J and v. No, the next state would be the one with the least energy.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the photon's energy for the vibrational transition instead. Because perhaps the rotational transition isn't allowed in this case.

Wait, but why would it not be allowed? The rotational transitions usually have their own selection rules. Oh, right, in rotational transitions, the dipole selection rule is ΔJ = ±1, and for vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. But in the problem statement, it just says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, regardless of selection rules. Wait, but the problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which implies that the transitions can involve both.

But maybe the question is about the lowest energy change, which would be the rotational. But the options don't match, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational transition's energy. Let's see:

ΔE_vib = ħ ω = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) = 4.218e-20 J.

Photon momentum p = E/c = 4.218e-20 J / 3e8 m/s = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is about 1.4e-28 kg·m/s. Now, looking at the options:

Option D is 1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, 1 Ns is kg·m/s. So yes, that matches.

So that would imply that the photon's momentum is 1.4e-28 Ns. So the answer would be D.

But wait, why would the molecule transition to the vibrational state when the rotational transition requires less energy? Because the rotational transition is lower in energy, but if the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state and the next state is the next possible, which is the next one in the ladder. But perhaps in the context of the model, the next state is the first vibrational state, not the rotational. Or perhaps the problem expects the photon to be the vibrational transition.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. The problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next possible state can be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. The lowest energy change is the rotational transition, but the photon's momentum in that case is about 3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't among the options. So perhaps that's not the intended path.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the transition where the molecule goes from the fundamental vibrational state (v=0, J=0) to the next higher energy state, which is a combination of higher J and higher v? No, that would be more energy than either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to take the vibrational transition, even though it's a higher energy jump, because that's the next state when considering the vibrational mode.

But if that's the case, the photon's momentum would be 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduced mass is mX * mY / (mX + mY) but used in the rotational energy formula.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the rotational energy calculation.

Wait, I think I made a miscalculation in the I value. Let me recompute I.

μ = (mX * mY) / (mX + mY) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = 40/22 amu = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

In kg, μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m. So I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

So, ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.055e-34)^2 / 1.207e-46.

Compute numerator: (1.055e-34)^2 = 1.113e-68.

So ΔE_rot = 1.113e-68 / 1.207e-46 = approx 9.22e-23 J.

Photon's momentum p = E/c = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the problem is actually about the vibrational transition.

Wait, let's compute the vibrational photon momentum.

E_vib = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s, which is 1.4e-28 Ns. Which is option D.

But why would the question imply that it's the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the rotational transition, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is intended to take the vibrational transition, even though it's a higher energy step.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rotational energy calculation. Let me check that again.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the question is about the Raman transition, which involves simultaneous change in J and v, but that's more advanced and probably not intended here.

Alternatively, perhaps when the molecule is in the fundamental state, the next state with the lowest energy is the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0). Because perhaps the rotational transitions are forbidden due to selection rules, but the question doesn't specify any selection rules, so I can't assume that.

But I'm stuck because the rotational transition's p is about 3e-31, which isn't an option, while the vibrational gives option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition as a combination of both, but that is unlikely because the question states the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think the initial assumption that the rotational transition is the next lowest is correct, but perhaps the problem expects the vibrational transition's momentum because that's one of the options.

Wait, but why would the problem expect that? Maybe I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the fundamental state to the next state, which is the first excited state. Now, the first excited state in rotation-vibration is the combination of v=1 and J=0, as that would be the next higher energy state after v=0, J=0.

But then why is the rotational transition a lower energy step?

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken about the energy levels. Let me think about the energy levels for a diatomic molecule.

The total energy is E = E_vib + E_rot.

E_vib = (v + ½) ħω.
E_rot = [J (J +1)] ħ²/(2I).

So for v=0, J=0: E = (0 + ½) ħω + 0 = ½ ħω.

For v=0, J=1: E = ½ ħω + [1*2] ħ²/(2I) = ½ ħω + ħ²/(I).

For v=1, J=0: E = (1 +½ ) ħω + 0 = 3/2 ħω.

So the energies are:

v=0, J=0: E1 = ½ ħω.

v=0, J=1: E2 = ½ ħω + (ħ²)/(I).

v=1, J=0: E3 = 3/2 ħω.

So the next state after E1 is either E2 or E3. Which one is lower in energy?

We compare E2 and E3.

E3 = 3/2 ħω = 1.5 * 4.218e-20 J = 6.327e-20 J.

E2 = 0.5*4.218e-20 + 9.2e-23 = 2.109e-20 + 9.2e-23 ≈ 2.198e-20 J.

So E2 (v=0, J=1) is lower than E3 (v=1, J=0).

So the next state with the lowest possible energy is E2, which is a rotational transition.

But the photon's momentum for this is 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a vibrational transition, but why? Maybe the model is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor model, but the question says non-rigid rotor model. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the energy difference for the vibrational transition is higher, but the question is asking for the photon's momentum for the molecule to switch to the next state, regardless of whether it's the minimal energy. But that seems counter to the question's wording.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational transitions because the molecule is diatomic and the question is in the context of the vibration-rotation model, which includes both. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the energy of the vibrational transition and see which option matches.

Earlier, the vibrational transition's momentum is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why would the next state be the vibrational one if the rotational transition requires less energy? So the molecule would prefer to transition to the lower energy state, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question expects the vibrational transition, despite it requiring more energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, let me compute the rotational energy difference again. Maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, I = 1.207e-46 kg m².

ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.207e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 = 1.112e-68.

So ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = 9.21e-23 J.

So that's correct.

Hmm, so the photon's momentum is 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s. Which is way smaller than any of the options. So perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm approaching the problem.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the question refers to the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state in the vibrational mode, which is v=1, and not considering the rotational transition. But why would that be? Because perhaps the rotational transitions are not allowed in this model or the question is considering only vibrational transitions.

In that case, the energy would be ħω, and the momentum would be (ħω)/c.

Which gives 4.218e-20 J / 3e8 m/s = 1.406e-28 kg m/s, which is option D.

So perhaps the intended answer is D.

But earlier, the rotational transition is a lower energy, so why would the molecule choose to go to the higher energy state? Unless the question is implying that the molecule is in the ground state of vibration and rotation, and the next state (regardless of energy) is the next allowed state, which might be the first vibrational state. But that doesn't make sense because the question specifies 'lowest possible energy'.

Alternatively, perhaps in the problem, the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), and the next state is the first allowed state, which could be either. But in reality, the rotational transition is lower in energy, so the molecule would prefer that. But since the options don't include the correct value for the rotational transition, perhaps the problem expects the vibrational transition.

Another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in calculation of the rotational energy. Let me think.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_J = (J (J +1)) (ħ²)/(2I). So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E= (2) * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, but I have a mistake here. Because E_J is (J (J +1)) (ħ²)/(2I).

So for J=1, E_J = 2 * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

So yes, correct.

But perhaps the problem is considering that when the molecule is in the fundamental state, it's v=0, J=0. The next state is the next vibrational state, v=1, J=0, which would require ΔE = ħω. So the photon's energy is ħω, and momentum p = ħω/c.

So p = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) / (3e8 m/s) = (4.218e-20 J) /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s.

So option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is correct.

Perhaps the problem expects this approach, even though the rotational transition is a lower energy. Maybe it's a misunderstanding, or perhaps the problem is considering only the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the correct answer in the options. Since the rotational transition's p is not present, and the vibrational is option D, perhaps the correct answer is D.

To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
1. **Masses**:  
   - \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \), \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \).  
   - Reduced mass:  
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]  
   - In kilograms: \( \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).

2. **Bond Length**: \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).  
   - Moment of inertia:  
     \[
     I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
     \]

3. **Angular Frequency of Vibration**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).  
   - Planck's constant: \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \).

### Energy Differences:
1. **Vibrational Transition**:  
   The energy difference for a vibrational transition from \( v = 0 \) to \( v = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Rotational Transition**:  
   The energy difference for a rotational transition from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.207 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

### Comparison:
- The vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \), while the rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.207 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).  
- The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. However, none of the provided options match the momentum corresponding to the rotational transition (\( p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns} \)).

### Conclusion:
Given the options provided, the problem likely expects the vibrational transition to be considered, even though it requires more energy. The momentum of the photon for the vibrational transition is:  
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
\]  
This corresponds to **Option D**.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem about the quantum rotation-vibration model of a diatomic molecule. Hmm, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would switch it to the next state with the lowest possible energy. 

Wait, I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the state of lowest energy, right? So the next state after that would be the next higher energy state, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a rotational state change. But the problem says 'lowest possible energy' next state—so I think it's the next state with the least energy increase. That would probably involve the vibrational transition because maybe that's a bigger jump than a rotational one? Or wait, no, maybe the opposite. Oh wait, the rotational states have a certain spacing, and vibrational states have a larger spacing. So the next state would be the next vibrational state, but wait, the fundamental state is the first vibrational level (v=0), so the next would be v=1. But wait, it's possible that the molecule could also change its rotational state without changing vibration. Hmm, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, wait, maybe it's a transition that involves the least energy. So maybe the first possible transition is a change in the rotational state. Or perhaps a combination of both.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The model combines both rotation and vibration. The energy levels are given by the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental state is the lowest, so for vibration, v=0, and for rotation, J=0 (since J is the rotational quantum number). The next possible state would be the next higher energy state. So the possible next states could be either increasing J, or increasing v. Which requires more energy? The vibrational energy levels have larger spacing than the rotational ones, right? Because the vibrational energy levels are quantized as (n + ½) ħω, so each step is ħω. While the rotational energy levels are (J)(J+1)ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The spacing between rotational levels depends on J, but each step is smaller than the vibrational step.

So if the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next state with the lowest energy would be either a vibrational transition (v=1, J=0) or a rotational transition (v=0, J=1). Which of these requires less energy? Let's compute the energy difference for each.

First, the vibrational energy difference. The energy for vibration is E_vib = (v + ½) ħω. So the change from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_vib = ħω.

For the rotational energy, J=0 to J=1. The rotational energy is E_rot = [ J (J+1) ] * ħ²/(2I). The moment of inertia I for a diatomic is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass. So I = (mX * mY)/(mX + mY) * r². Wait, but then for the rotational energy difference between J=0 and J=1:

E_rot at J=1 is (1*2) * ħ²/(2I) = 2 ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I)
E_rot at J=0 is 0, so ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I)

We need to compare ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot. If ΔE_rot is less than ΔE_vib, then the photon would cause a rotational transition. If not, then a vibrational transition.

So let's compute both energies.

First, compute the vibrational energy difference. The angular frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. Planck's constant ħ is h/(2π). h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ = 6.626e-34 / (2 * 3.1416) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

ΔE_vib = ħ * ω = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) = 4.218e-20 J.

Now for the rotational energy difference.

Compute the reduced mass μ. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh, wait, 20 and 2, so 20+2=22 amu. So yes, 40/22 is about 1.818 amu.

But we need the reduced mass in kg. 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that. 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ around 3.025e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 1.818 * 1.6605 = ?

1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.989, 0.018*1.6605≈0.0299, so total ≈ 3.0189e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = (3.0189e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0189e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.20756e-46 kg·m².

Then, ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34 J·s)^2 / (1.20756e-46 kg·m²)

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx (1e-34)^2 = 1e-68, but let's compute it more precisely. 1.05457^2 ≈ 1.112, so 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

Wait, actually, J is kg·m²/s², so J·s is kg·m²/s. So (J·s)^2 is kg²·m^4/s². Then divided by kg·m² gives kg·m²/s², which is J.

Wait, but regardless, let's compute the value.

Numerator ≈ (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (kg^2 m^4 s^-2). Wait, no, J is kg m²/s², so (J s)^2 is (kg^2 m^4 s^0), so when divided by I (kg m²), gives kg m² s^-2, which is J.

So ΔE_rot = (1.112e-68) / (1.20756e-46) = 1.112 / 1.20756 * 1e-22 J ≈ 0.9207e-22 J = 9.207e-23 J.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 1e-68 divided by 1e-46 is 1e-22. But wait, 1.112e-68 divided by 1.20756e-46 is (1.112 / 1.20756) * 1e-22. 1.112 / 1.20756 is approximately 0.92, so 0.92e-22 J, which is 9.2e-23 J.

Now, comparing ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot. ΔE_vib was 4.218e-20 J, and ΔE_rot is 9.2e-23 J. So ΔE_rot is much smaller. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 9.2e-23 is way smaller than 4.2e-20. So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational. So the molecule could absorb a photon that provides either of these energies, but since the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy, it would be the rotational transition, as it requires less energy.

Wait, but wait a second. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, but if it's in the ground vibrational state (v=0) and ground rotational state (J=0), then the next possible state would be the first excited state of either. Since the rotational transition is lower in energy, that's the next possible state with the least energy. So the photon's energy should match the rotational energy difference.

So the photon's energy should be equal to ΔE_rot.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Because the energy of the photon E = h f = p c, where p is the photon's momentum, and c is the speed of light.

Wait, because photons have energy E = pc, since for photons, E = hf and p = E/c. So p = E/(c).

So once we find the energy needed, the momentum is E divided by the speed of light.

So for the rotational transition, the energy is ΔE_rot ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

So p = ΔE_rot / c. c is about 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.066e-31 kg·m/s. Wait, but none of the options are close to that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait. Earlier, I thought the next state is the rotational transition because its energy is lower, but in reality, the rotational energy might not be available if the molecule is already in the lowest state. But wait, J can be 0, 1, 2, etc., so the next rotational state is J=1.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the ΔE_rot.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔE_rot. Let me redo it.

ΔE_rot = [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ] * ħ²/(2I)

Wait, no. Rotational energy levels are E_J = [ J (J +1) ] * ħ²/(2I).

So when J increases by 1, from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is:

E_1 - E_0 = [1*2 * ħ²/(2I)] - 0 = (2 ħ²/(2I)) = ħ²/(I).

So yes, that part is correct.

Wait, let me compute I more accurately.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2 amu) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that.

1.81818 * 1.660539 = 

Let me compute 1.8 * 1.660539 = 2.989, 

0.01818 * 1.660539 ≈ 0.0302.

So total ≈ 2.989 + 0.0302 = 3.0192e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = (3.0192e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0192e-27 *4e-20 = (3.0192 *4) = 12.0768e-47 kg m².

Wait, wait, 3.0192e-27 * 4e-20 = 12.0768e-47? Wait, 3.0192 *4 is 12.0768, and the exponents are e-27 * e-20 = e-47. So I = 1.20768e-46 kg m².

Then ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

So ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.20768e-46 = (1.112 / 1.20768) * 1e-22 J.

1.112 / 1.20768 ≈ 0.9207.

So ΔE_rot ≈ 0.9207e-22 J = 9.207e-23 J.

So the energy of the photon would need to be 9.207e-23 J.

Now, the photon's momentum p is E/c, since E = pc.

c is approximately 2.998e8 m/s.

So p = 9.207e-23 J / 2.998e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But looking at the options, none of them are around 1e-31. The options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C) 1.1e-27 Ns
D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, these are all around 1e-27 or 1e-28. So my earlier calculation is way off. Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Wait a second, I think I confused the rotational and vibrational transitions. Maybe the problem is actually about a vibrational transition, but why?

Wait, perhaps I should think again. Because the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be either J=1 (rotational) or v=1 (vibrational). But the vibrational transition's energy is much bigger, so the rotational transition is easier.

Wait, but why then the photon's momentum is not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, let's check the calculation of I.

Wait, no, the calculation seems correct. Maybe I should compute the vibrational transition instead, because perhaps the question is about a rotation-vibration transition or perhaps I misread the question.

Wait, the question says: the molecule is in its fundamental state. What photon momentum is needed for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, perhaps the "next state" is considering the combined rotational and vibrational energies. So the next state would be the combination of v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. Which requires less energy? Earlier, the rotational transition requires about 9e-23 J, and vibrational is 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition is lower. So the photon should have energy matching the rotational transition.

But according to the options, the given momenta are much larger. So maybe I've made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps the moment of inertia is m * r², not the reduced mass. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, in the rotational model, the moment of inertia is I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass. So that part is correct.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the problem is considering a transition where both vibrational and rotational levels change. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the minimal energy increment.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each vibrational quantum requires an energy of ħω. But if the molecule can't change vibration without rotation, but I don't think that's the case because each mode is quantized independently.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the next state as the next higher vibrational state, but that would be a much larger energy jump. But the photon's momentum in that case would be higher.

Wait, but the options don't have anything that matches 9e-23 J. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, perhaps I should compute I using the formula I = (mX * mY)/(mX + mY) * r², but in kg.

Let me compute that again.

mX = 20 amu. 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.321e-26 kg.

mY = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (mX * mY) / (mX + mY) = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) kg.

Wait no, wait: mX is 20 amu = 3.321e-26 kg, My is 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

Wait that's not right. 20 amu is 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

2 amu is 3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) kg. Wait no, μ is (mX * mY) / (mX + mY), but both mX and mY are in kg.

So mX = 3.321e-26 kg, mY = 3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) kg.

Compute numerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 ≈ 11.025 * 1e-53 = 1.1025e-52 kg².

Denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 * (1 + 0.1) )= 3.321e-26 * 1.1 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

So μ = (1.1025e-52) / (3.6531e-26) = approx 3.018e-27 kg. Which matches what I had before. So I think the calculation is correct.

So perhaps the problem is that I'm calculating for J=0 to J=1, but maybe the next state is a combination of J and v. No, the next state would be the one with the least energy.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the photon's energy for the vibrational transition instead. Because perhaps the rotational transition isn't allowed in this case.

Wait, but why would it not be allowed? The rotational transitions usually have their own selection rules. Oh, right, in rotational transitions, the dipole selection rule is ΔJ = ±1, and for vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. But in the problem statement, it just says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, regardless of selection rules. Wait, but the problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which implies that the transitions can involve both.

But maybe the question is about the lowest energy change, which would be the rotational. But the options don't match, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational transition's energy. Let's see:

ΔE_vib = ħ ω = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) = 4.218e-20 J.

Photon momentum p = E/c = 4.218e-20 J / 3e8 m/s = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is about 1.4e-28 kg·m/s. Now, looking at the options:

Option D is 1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, 1 Ns is kg·m/s. So yes, that matches.

So that would imply that the photon's momentum is 1.4e-28 Ns. So the answer would be D.

But wait, why would the molecule transition to the vibrational state when the rotational transition requires less energy? Because the rotational transition is lower in energy, but if the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state and the next state is the next possible, which is the next one in the ladder. But perhaps in the context of the model, the next state is the first vibrational state, not the rotational. Or perhaps the problem expects the photon to be the vibrational transition.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. The problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next possible state can be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. The lowest energy change is the rotational transition, but the photon's momentum in that case is about 3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't among the options. So perhaps that's not the intended path.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the transition where the molecule goes from the fundamental vibrational state (v=0, J=0) to the next higher energy state, which is a combination of higher J and higher v? No, that would be more energy than either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to take the vibrational transition, even though it's a higher energy jump, because that's the next state when considering the vibrational mode.

But if that's the case, the photon's momentum would be 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduced mass is mX * mY / (mX + mY) but used in the rotational energy formula.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the rotational energy calculation.

Wait, I think I made a miscalculation in the I value. Let me recompute I.

μ = (mX * mY) / (mX + mY) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = 40/22 amu = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

In kg, μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m. So I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

So, ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.055e-34)^2 / 1.207e-46.

Compute numerator: (1.055e-34)^2 = 1.113e-68.

So ΔE_rot = 1.113e-68 / 1.207e-46 = approx 9.22e-23 J.

Photon's momentum p = E/c = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the problem is actually about the vibrational transition.

Wait, let's compute the vibrational photon momentum.

E_vib = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s, which is 1.4e-28 Ns. Which is option D.

But why would the question imply that it's the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the rotational transition, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is intended to take the vibrational transition, even though it's a higher energy step.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rotational energy calculation. Let me check that again.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the question is about the Raman transition, which involves simultaneous change in J and v, but that's more advanced and probably not intended here.

Alternatively, perhaps when the molecule is in the fundamental state, the next state with the lowest energy is the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0). Because perhaps the rotational transitions are forbidden due to selection rules, but the question doesn't specify any selection rules, so I can't assume that.

But I'm stuck because the rotational transition's p is about 3e-31, which isn't an option, while the vibrational gives option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition as a combination of both, but that is unlikely because the question states the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think the initial assumption that the rotational transition is the next lowest is correct, but perhaps the problem expects the vibrational transition's momentum because that's one of the options.

Wait, but why would the problem expect that? Maybe I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the fundamental state to the next state, which is the first excited state. Now, the first excited state in rotation-vibration is the combination of v=1 and J=0, as that would be the next higher energy state after v=0, J=0.

But then why is the rotational transition a lower energy step?

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken about the energy levels. Let me think about the energy levels for a diatomic molecule.

The total energy is E = E_vib + E_rot.

E_vib = (v + ½) ħω.
E_rot = [J (J +1)] ħ²/(2I).

So for v=0, J=0: E = (0 + ½) ħω + 0 = ½ ħω.

For v=0, J=1: E = ½ ħω + [1*2] ħ²/(2I) = ½ ħω + ħ²/(I).

For v=1, J=0: E = (1 +½ ) ħω + 0 = 3/2 ħω.

So the energies are:

v=0, J=0: E1 = ½ ħω.

v=0, J=1: E2 = ½ ħω + (ħ²)/(I).

v=1, J=0: E3 = 3/2 ħω.

So the next state after E1 is either E2 or E3. Which one is lower in energy?

We compare E2 and E3.

E3 = 3/2 ħω = 1.5 * 4.218e-20 J = 6.327e-20 J.

E2 = 0.5*4.218e-20 + 9.2e-23 = 2.109e-20 + 9.2e-23 ≈ 2.198e-20 J.

So E2 (v=0, J=1) is lower than E3 (v=1, J=0).

So the next state with the lowest possible energy is E2, which is a rotational transition.

But the photon's momentum for this is 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a vibrational transition, but why? Maybe the model is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor model, but the question says non-rigid rotor model. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the energy difference for the vibrational transition is higher, but the question is asking for the photon's momentum for the molecule to switch to the next state, regardless of whether it's the minimal energy. But that seems counter to the question's wording.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational transitions because the molecule is diatomic and the question is in the context of the vibration-rotation model, which includes both. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the energy of the vibrational transition and see which option matches.

Earlier, the vibrational transition's momentum is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why would the next state be the vibrational one if the rotational transition requires less energy? So the molecule would prefer to transition to the lower energy state, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question expects the vibrational transition, despite it requiring more energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, let me compute the rotational energy difference again. Maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, I = 1.207e-46 kg m².

ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.207e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 = 1.112e-68.

So ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = 9.21e-23 J.

So that's correct.

Hmm, so the photon's momentum is 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s. Which is way smaller than any of the options. So perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm approaching the problem.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the question refers to the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state in the vibrational mode, which is v=1, and not considering the rotational transition. But why would that be? Because perhaps the rotational transitions are not allowed in this model or the question is considering only vibrational transitions.

In that case, the energy would be ħω, and the momentum would be (ħω)/c.

Which gives 4.218e-20 J / 3e8 m/s = 1.406e-28 kg m/s, which is option D.

So perhaps the intended answer is D.

But earlier, the rotational transition is a lower energy, so why would the molecule choose to go to the higher energy state? Unless the question is implying that the molecule is in the ground state of vibration and rotation, and the next state (regardless of energy) is the next allowed state, which might be the first vibrational state. But that doesn't make sense because the question specifies 'lowest possible energy'.

Alternatively, perhaps in the problem, the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), and the next state is the first allowed state, which could be either. But in reality, the rotational transition is lower in energy, so the molecule would prefer that. But since the options don't include the correct value for the rotational transition, perhaps the problem expects the vibrational transition.

Another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in calculation of the rotational energy. Let me think.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_J = (J (J +1)) (ħ²)/(2I). So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E= (2) * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, but I have a mistake here. Because E_J is (J (J +1)) (ħ²)/(2I).

So for J=1, E_J = 2 * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

So yes, correct.

But perhaps the problem is considering that when the molecule is in the fundamental state, it's v=0, J=0. The next state is the next vibrational state, v=1, J=0, which would require ΔE = ħω. So the photon's energy is ħω, and momentum p = ħω/c.

So p = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) / (3e8 m/s) = (4.218e-20 J) /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s.

So option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is correct.

Perhaps the problem expects this approach, even though the rotational transition is a lower energy. Maybe it's a misunderstanding, or perhaps the problem is considering only the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the correct answer in the options. Since the rotational transition's p is not present, and the vibrational is option D, perhaps the correct answer is D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
1. **Masses**:  
   - \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \), \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \).  
   - Reduced mass:  
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]  
   - In kilograms: \( \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).

2. **Bond Length**: \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).  
   - Moment of inertia:  
     \[
     I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
     \]

3. **Angular Frequency of Vibration**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).  
   - Planck's constant: \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \).

### Energy Differences:
1. **Vibrational Transition**:  
   The energy difference for a vibrational transition from \( v = 0 \) to \( v = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Rotational Transition**:  
   The energy difference for a rotational transition from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.207 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

### Comparison:
- The vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \), while the rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.207 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).  
- The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. However, none of the provided options match the momentum corresponding to the rotational transition (\( p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns} \)).

### Conclusion:
Given the options provided, the problem likely expects the vibrational transition to be considered, even though it requires more energy. The momentum of the photon for the vibrational transition is:  
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
\]  
This corresponds to **Option D**.
