Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit detailed, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 3 degrees Celsius because I remember that water freezes at 273 K. So B is probably a solid at room temperature but melts just a bit above 0 C. Hmm, water? Because water has a melting point around there, but wait, maybe it's something else.

The reaction of a certain keto acid with X produces a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acid—so I'm thinking something like a ketone, but wait, no, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like maybe something that has a carboxylic acid group and a ketone. Wait, or maybe it's an acid that has a carbonyl group in its structure. But the product of this reaction has two oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is something like CO2? No, because CO2 has two oxygen atoms. Or maybe some other compound.

Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X must be an element that has isotopes. Common ones are like carbon (C-12, C-13, C-14), hydrogen (H, D, T), oxygen, chlorine, etc. The fact that it's heavier suggests it's a higher mass isotope, like maybe Cl-35 vs Cl-37? Or maybe something else.

The product of X with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the reaction is a neutralization, or maybe decarboxylation. Wait, if it's a keto acid reacting with X, maybe the acid is losing a COOH group or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps X is a base. Let me think: when a base reacts with an acid, they usually form a salt and water. But the product here has two oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is something like CO2, which has two oxygen atoms. But how?

Wait, another possibility: the keto acid is reacting with X to form something like an ester or a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reaction where X and Y react. X reacts with liquid Y, releasing gas W. W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So the molecule is probably something like CO2? No, wait, CO2 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons (in each atom), but as a molecule, it's two atoms of O and one C. Wait, no, the molecule's protons and neutrons would sum to the same. Let me think: W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So the molecule could be something like CH4O? Wait, CH4O is formaldehyde, but that's a molecule with H and O, maybe. But let's think of the isotope possibilities.

Wait, another thought: If W is a molecule like H2O, but wait H2O has 2H (each with 1 proton) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). But the total protons in the molecule would be 2 (from H) + 8 (from O) = 10. Neutrons would be 8 (from O). So protons and neutrons in the molecule: 10 each? No, 10 protons and 8 neutrons. So that doesn't add up. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe W is CO2. CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons usually) and two O (each 8 protons, 8 neutrons). So the molecule has 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Each O has 8 neutrons, so 2*8=16 neutrons plus 6 from C-12 (which is 6 neutrons). So total neutrons would be 16 +6=22. So total protons in the molecule: 22, neutrons: 22. That fits. So W is CO2.

So gas W is CO2. That would mean that the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. So what substances react to produce CO2? Maybe a carbonate reacting with an acid, but wait, in this case, Y is a liquid, and X is a solid or another liquid? Alternatively, X might be a metal carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the reaction between a carbonate and acid produces CO2, water, and the corresponding salt. But in our case, the product is a precipitate G. So maybe it's a reaction where X is a carbonate reacting with an acid Y to produce CO2 and a precipitate.

Wait, another possibility: X could be a bicarbonate, like NaHCO3, which reacts with an acid to produce CO2.

But wait, going back to the first part: X has a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is a compound that includes an element with a heavy isotope. For example, chlorine has isotopes, so maybe X is something like HCl, but then why would it have a heavier isotope?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal with a heavy isotope. But wait, the substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So X could be something like Cl. But Cl has isotopes, but in its elemental form, it's a diatomic molecule. Wait, but perhaps X is something like NaCl, which has isotopes in the Cl part. But the problem states that X is a substance, so could be a compound.

Wait, the product when X reacts with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Hmm. Let me think. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid, which has a keto group and a carboxylic acid group. If X is a base, perhaps it's a deprotonation reaction. Or perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack.

Wait, but if X is a base, then reacting with the keto acid (which is an acid) would produce a salt and water. But the product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the product is something like a ketone, like if X is a strong base that deprotonates the acid to form a ketone. For example, if the keto acid is something like (CH3)2C(OH)COOH, and X is a base that deprotonates it to form (CH3)2C(O)COOH, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like KMnO4, but that's a strong oxidizing agent. Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the precipitate G that forms when X reacts with Y. When X and Y react, they form G, which upon heating gives B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. So B is probably water, since water's melting point is 273 K (0 C). But 277 K is about 4 degrees C, so it's just above the melting point. Wait, but if B is water, then when G is heated, it releases water. Hmm.

Wait, if G is a precipitate, perhaps it's a carbonate that upon heating decomposes. For example, if X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, the reaction produces CO2 (W), water (B?), and a precipitate. Wait, but if you have Na2CO3 reacting with H2SO4 (liquid Y), it produces Na2SO4, H2O, and CO2 gas. So in that case, W would be CO2, B would be H2O. But in the problem, the precipitate G forms, and when heated, releases B. So if G is Na2SO4, heating it wouldn't release anything. So maybe G is a different kind of salt.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrate or sulfate that reacts with an acid to produce a sulfide or something else, but that seems a bit off.

Wait, but going back to the first part: the product when X is reacted with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is carbon dioxide, which has two oxygen atoms. Wait, but CO2 has two oxygen atoms, so if the product is CO2, then the reaction would be the keto acid reacting with X to produce CO2. That could happen in a decarboxylation reaction, where the keto acid loses CO2. So if X is a base, perhaps it's a deprotonating agent that causes the keto acid to lose CO2.

Wait, a common reaction is the decarboxylation of a keto acid when heated, especially under basic conditions. For example, beta-keto acids lose CO2 upon heating. So perhaps X is a base that facilitates this decarboxylation. So when the keto acid reacts with X (a base), it loses CO2, which would have two oxygen atoms. So the product of the reaction would be CO2, and perhaps the corresponding ketone.

So in that case, X could be a base like NaOH or KOH. But why would X have a heavier isotope? For example, if X is KOH, but K usually doesn't have heavy isotopes that are significant. Wait, but perhaps X is something like HCl with a heavy isotope, but then why would it react with a keto acid?

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like D2O (deuterated water), but I'm not sure how that would fit.

Wait, another angle: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So X is a substance, probably a compound, made of two or more elements. We need to find the lightest and heaviest elements present in X, sum their atomic masses, considering all their isotopes.

Wait, but the problem says to sum the masses of the lightest and heaviest elements. So if X is, say, NaCl, the elements are Na and Cl. The atomic mass of Na is about 23, Cl is about 35.5. So the sum would be 58.5. But the options don't have that. So maybe X is something else.

Alternatively, if X is HCl, the elements are H and Cl. H's atomic mass is about 1, Cl is about 35.5. Sum is 36.5. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. Hmm, 35 is one of the options.

Wait, but the question says to consider the lightest and heaviest elements. So in the case of HCl, the lightest is H, the heaviest is Cl. So their masses would be H (1.008) and Cl (34.9688?), summing to about 36. But 35 is an option. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses, considering all their isotopes. So if X has multiple elements, we take the lightest element and its isotopes, and the heaviest element and its isotopes. But wait, perhaps the question is about the lightest and heaviest by atomic number, not by mass. Or maybe it's about the individual elements' isotopes.

Wait, no, the wording is: the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. So for X, which is a compound, the elements are, for example, in HCl, H and Cl. So lightest is H (atomic number 1), heaviest is Cl (17). So sum the atomic masses of H and Cl.

But wait, the cumulative atomic masses. So for each element in X, we sum all the isotopes' masses. But that sounds complicated because for each element, we have to sum all the possible isotopes. Wait, but natural elements have a mix of isotopes. For example, chlorine has about 75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37. So the average atomic mass is about 35.45.

Wait, but the question says, if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed. So for each element in X, sum all the isotopes' masses present.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with two elements, each having their own isotopes. So for example, if X is HCl, then for H, the isotopes are H (protium), D (deuterium), etc. Similarly for Cl, which has Cl-35 and Cl-37. So for each element in X, sum all their isotopes' masses.

Wait, but the problem says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements. So for X, find the lightest element (say, H) and sum all its isotopes' masses, and the heaviest element (Cl) and sum all its isotopes' masses, then add those two sums together.

Wait, but how much is that? Let's take H as example. H has isotopes like protium (1.007825), deuterium (2.014102), tritium (3.016049), etc. But in most cases, the majority is protium. However, if X contains a heavier isotope, perhaps it's using deuterium. So for X, if it's HCl with some D, then H in X could have D as part of it. So for the lightest element (H), we sum all possible isotopes present. Similarly for the heaviest element.

But this seems a bit tricky. Let me think: what's the cumulative atomic mass of H and Cl?

The average atomic mass of H is about 1.008. But if X has only H (without D), the isotopic masses would be mostly protium (1.007825), but D is about 2.014. So if X has H and D, then H's contribution would include both. But the problem states that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So perhaps X has more of a heavier isotope of one element.

So, for example, if X is HCl, where the H is mainly D (deuterium), then the H in X is mostly D. So the isotopes of H would be D (2.014) and perhaps a little H. So the sum of H's isotopes would be approximately 2.014 * (amount of D) + 1.007825 * (amount of H). But this is getting complicated.

Wait, but the question says that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed. So for each element in X, sum all the isotopes present, regardless of their abundance.

Wait, that can't be right because the elements are composed of multiple isotopes. So for H, that would be summing the masses of all isotopes of H present in X, multiplied by their respective amounts.

Wait, but perhaps the question is simpler. It says to sum the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, considering all their isotopes. Maybe it just means the sum of the lightest element's atomic mass (like H, 1.008) and the heaviest element's atomic mass (like Cl, 35.45). So 1.008 + 35.45 = around 36.458, which is close to 36. But the options don't have 36. The closest is option A:35, B:25, C:31, D:29.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the question is to find the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic numbers? No, that's not likely. Or perhaps it's the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest isotopes in X.

Wait, perhaps X is something like NaOH. So elements are Na, O, H. The lightest is H (1.008), heaviest is Na (22.99). Sum is about 24, which is option B:25. But 24 is close to 25.

Alternatively, if X is something like CaCO3, the elements are C, Ca, O. Lightest is C (12), heaviest is Ca (40.08). Sum is about 52, which isn't an option.

Wait, but earlier I thought X is something like KOH. So elements are K, O, H. Lightest is H (1.008), heaviest is K (39.10). Sum is about 40.1, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the reaction.

X reacts with Y to produce CO2 (gas W), precipitate G, and B upon heating G. Wait, when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (0 C). So B is likely water, but water freezes at 273 K, so 277 K is a bit above. So maybe B is something else, like a different form of water, but probably not. Alternatively, maybe it's another compound.

Wait, another thought: when you have a carbonate reacting with an acid, you get CO2, water, and a salt. But if the salt is a precipitate, then it's probably an insoluble salt like Ag2CO3, but I don't think that's very soluble. Wait, but silver carbonate is not very soluble in water, so if Y is an acid like HCl, then Ag2CO3 could precipitate.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that the precipitate is a sulfide, but that would require Y to be a sulfide, which may not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate. For example, CaCO3 (X) reacts with HCl (Y) to produce CO2, H2O, and CaCl2. But CaCl2 is soluble, so it wouldn't precipitate. That doesn't fit. So perhaps X is a metal carbonate that reacts with an acid to produce an insoluble salt.

Wait, maybe X is a nitrate, and Y is a solution of a sulfide, but I'm getting off track.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal hydroxide. For example, NaOH (X) reacts with an acid (Y, say H2SO4) to produce Na2SO4, water, and possibly some gas. But in that case, the gas would be SO2 or something else, not CO2.

Wait, but earlier I thought the gas is CO2, so let me circle back. If W is CO2, then the reaction between X and Y must produce CO2. So if X is a carbonate, Y is an acid. Then, X + Y → CO2 + H2O + salt.

So the precipitate G would be the salt. If the salt is insoluble, it will precipitate. For example, if X is CaCO3 and Y is HCl, then the reaction is CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O. But CaCl2 is soluble in water, so it wouldn't precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3 reacts with HCl to produce NaCl, CO2, and H2O. Again, NaCl is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfite, which reacts with an acid to produce SO2 gas. But the problem says W has equal protons and neutrons, which for SO2 would be 32 protons and 32 neutrons? Let me check: SO2 has S (16 protons, 16 neutrons usually) and two O (8 each). So total protons: 16 + 2*8=32. Neutrons: 16 + 2*8=32. So yes, SO2 would fit. So W could be SO2.

But earlier I thought W was CO2 because of the 22 protons and 22 neutrons. Wait, CO2 has 6 (C) + 2*8 (O) = 22 protons. Neutrons: C-12 has 6, each O-16 has 8. So 6 + 2*8=22. So W is CO2, which fits.

So, back to the reaction. Let's say X is a carbonate. X + Y (acid) → CO2 + H2O + salt.

The salt is a precipitate. So the salt must be insoluble in water. So, for example, if X is Ag2CO3 (silver carbonate) and Y is HNO3 (nitric acid), the reaction would produce Ag2(NO3)2, which is soluble. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, if X is PbCO3 (lead carbonate) and Y is HCl, the reaction would produce PbCl2, which is slightly soluble. So maybe it precipitates.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfate. Wait, but that would produce SO4^2- in solution, which is usually soluble.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfide, but that would produce H2S gas, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (each H: 1p, 0n; S:16p, 16n. So 2 H + 1 S = 18p, 16n. Not equal. So H2S wouldn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction between X and Y produces CO2, and the precipitate is something else, like a sulfide.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the product of X with a keto acid. The product has two oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is CO2, which has two O. So, the reaction is a decarboxylation, where the keto acid loses CO2. So X could be a base that deprotonates the keto acid, leading to the loss of CO2.

In such reactions, X is often a strong base like NaOH or KOH. So X could be NaOH. Now, NaOH has Na, O, H. The lightest element is H, the heaviest is Na. Their atomic masses are H (1.008), Na (22.99). Sum is about 24. So that would match option B:25. But wait, 1.008 +22.99=24.0, which is approximately 24, but the option is 25. Hmm, maybe my calculation is off.

Alternatively, perhaps X is KOH. Then, K (39.10), O (16.00), H (1.008). So lightest is H, heaviest is K. Sum is 1.008 +39.10=40.108, which isn't an option.

Wait, but perhaps X is another compound. Let me think about the options. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. So, if the sum is 25, perhaps it's H and Mg? No, Mg is 24.3, H is 1. So sum is about 25.3, which is close to option B:25.

Alternatively, maybe the elements are C and O. C is 12, O is 16. Sum is 28. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the elements are O and Cl. O is 16, Cl is 35.5. Sum is 51.5, not matching.

Wait, earlier I thought of X being HCl. So H (1.008) and Cl (35.45). Sum is 36.458. But option A is 35, which is close. But 35 is about the atomic mass of Cl-35. So if X is Cl-35, then the sum is 35.45 + 1.008 = 36.458. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with two elements, one of which is H and the other is something else. Let me see.

Wait, another thought: the product of X and the keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is something like dimethyl ketone, or another molecule with two O atoms. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester, which has two oxygen atoms. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but the key is to find the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So if X is HCl, the sum is about 36.458, but the options don't have that. So perhaps X is something else.

Another angle: the melting point of B is close to 277 K. B is the product when G is heated. So if G is a carbonate salt, heating it might release CO2 and leave a residue. Wait, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if G is a bicarbonate, heating it would release CO2 and leave the corresponding hydroxide.

Wait, perhaps X is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Then, reacting with an acid Y (like HCl) would produce CO2, H2O, and NaCl. The precipitate would be NaCl, but NaCl is soluble. So that doesn't fit. Unless Y is another acid that produces an insoluble salt.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate of a metal that forms an insoluble salt with Y. For example, if X is Ag2CO3 and Y is HNO3, the reaction would produce AgNO3, which is soluble. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfate, but that produces SO4^2- which is usually soluble.

I'm getting stuck on this part, so perhaps I should focus more on the part about the cumulative atomic masses.

Another approach: the options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Option C is 31, which is the sum of 15 (like O, 16) and 15 (like O again, but that doesn't make sense). Alternatively, 15 and 16: that's 31. 15 is for phosphorus (P, atomic number 15), 16 is sulfur (S). So if X has P and S, the sum would be 31. But I'm not sure if that makes sense.

Wait, but if X is H2SO4, the elements are H, S, O. The lightest is H, heaviest is S. Their atomic masses are 1.008 (H) and 32.07 (S). Sum is about 33.078, which is close to option C (31). Not exact, but perhaps considering isotopes.

Wait, but if X is H2SO4, which is a strong acid. If X reacts with a carbonate, it would produce CO2, but I'm not sure how that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps X is H2O, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another thought: the product of X with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is CO2, which has two O atoms. So the reaction is a decarboxylation, which is a common reaction in organic chemistry. So X is a base like NaOH or KOH, which causes the keto acid to lose CO2.

So if X is KOH, the elements are K, O, H. Lightest is H (1.008), heaviest is K (39.10). Sum is 40.108, which isn't an option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, X is NaOH: Na (22.99), O (16), H (1.008). Sum is 1.008 +22.99=24.0, which is close to option B:25. But 24.0 is not 25.

Wait, maybe X is something else. Let's think of another base. Maybe X is LiOH. Li (6.94), O (16), H (1.008). Sum is 7.948, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal carbonate, like CaCO3. So elements are Ca, C, O. Lightest is C (12.01), heaviest is Ca (40.08). Sum is about 52.09, not matching options.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let me think of another approach. The question states that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X must be summed. So for each element in X, sum all the isotopes present. For example, if X contains H and Cl, then sum all isotopes of H and all isotopes of Cl.

But wait, 'cumulative atomic masses'—does that mean the sum of each element's atomic masses, considering all isotopes? For example, H has isotopes with masses ~1, 2, 3 etc. So if X contains D (deuterium), the H contribution would be 2.014. Cl has ~35 and ~37. So the sum would be 2.014 (for D) + 35.45 (average Cl). So sum is 37.464. But the options don't have that.

Wait, but the problem says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses, considering all their isotopes. So for each element, sum all isotopes present in X. So if X has H and Cl, and X contains both H and D, then H's contribution is sum of all isotopes present. Same for Cl.

But this is getting complicated. Perhaps X is a compound with two elements where the lightest is H and the heaviest is Cl. So the sum would be average H (1.008) + average Cl (35.45). Sum is 36.458, but the closest option is 35 (option A). So perhaps the correct answer is A, 35.

But then why would the sum be 35? Because perhaps X only contains Cl-35 and H, so the sum is 35 (Cl) + 1 (H) = 36. But that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes in X. So for each element in X, take the lightest isotope and heaviest isotope, sum their masses, and then sum across the elements.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler: the lightest element is H (1.008) and the heaviest is Cl (35.45). Sum is ~36.458. So the closest option is A:35.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the correct answer is C:31. How?

Wait, another angle: the product of X reacting with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is a carbonyl compound with two oxygen atoms, like a ketone or an aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should go with the earlier thought that X is HCl, sum of H and Cl is ~36, so the closest option is 35. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, maybe X is Cl2, so the element is Cl, and the lightest and heaviest are the same. So sum is 35.45, which is close to option A:35.

Wait, but Cl2 is a diatomic molecule; the question says X is a substance, so it could be Cl2. If X is Cl2, then it's a single element, so the lightest and heaviest are the same (Cl). So the sum would be 35.45, which is option A:35.

But wait, the problem states that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope. Cl has both Cl-35 and Cl-37. So if X is Cl2, then the heavier isotope is Cl-37. But the sum would still be Cl's atomic mass, which is about 35.45.

But the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements in X. If X is Cl2, the only element is Cl. So the sum would be Cl's atomic mass, which is 35.45. So the closest option is A:35.

Hmm, that could make sense. So perhaps the answer is A:35.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, which reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W (CO₂), a precipitate G, and ultimately releases B upon heating. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, suggesting it is water (H₂O). Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope, and the reaction of X with a keto acid produces a product containing two oxygen atoms, likely CO₂.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W (CO₂):** The molecule CO₂ has 22 protons and 22 neutrons, satisfying the condition that the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. This confirms that W is CO₂, indicating that the reaction between X and Y involves the production of CO₂.

2. **Precipitate G and Product B:** The precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y, and heating G releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. This strongly suggests that B is water (H₂O), as water melts at 273 K and has a melting point close to 277 K.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid:** The product of the reaction between X and a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms, likely CO₂. This suggests that X facilitates a decarboxylation reaction, where the keto acid loses CO₂. X is likely a base, such as NaOH or KOH, which can deprotonate the keto acid and promote the release of CO₂.

4. **Cumulative Atomic Masses of X:** The problem requires calculating the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. If X is HCl, the lightest element is H (atomic mass ~1.008) and the heaviest is Cl (atomic mass ~35.45). The sum of these atomic masses is approximately 36.458, which is close to option A (35). However, if X is Cl₂, it contains only chlorine, and the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes (Cl-35 and Cl-37) would still align closely with option A (35).

5. **Options Analysis:**
   - **A) 35:** Matches the atomic mass of Cl-35, consistent with X being Cl₂ or a compound like HCl.
   - **B) 25:** Does not align with the elements in X.
   - **C) 31:** Unlikely, as it does not match the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.
   - **D) 29:** Also does not align with the elements in X.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible interpretation is that X is Cl₂ or a compound like HCl, where the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements sum to approximately 35. This aligns with option A.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit detailed, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 3 degrees Celsius because I remember that water freezes at 273 K. So B is probably a solid at room temperature but melts just a bit above 0 C. Hmm, water? Because water has a melting point around there, but wait, maybe it's something else.

The reaction of a certain keto acid with X produces a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acid—so I'm thinking something like a ketone, but wait, no, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like maybe something that has a carboxylic acid group and a ketone. Wait, or maybe it's an acid that has a carbonyl group in its structure. But the product of this reaction has two oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is something like CO2? No, because CO2 has two oxygen atoms. Or maybe some other compound.

Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X must be an element that has isotopes. Common ones are like carbon (C-12, C-13, C-14), hydrogen (H, D, T), oxygen, chlorine, etc. The fact that it's heavier suggests it's a higher mass isotope, like maybe Cl-35 vs Cl-37? Or maybe something else.

The product of X with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the reaction is a neutralization, or maybe decarboxylation. Wait, if it's a keto acid reacting with X, maybe the acid is losing a COOH group or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps X is a base. Let me think: when a base reacts with an acid, they usually form a salt and water. But the product here has two oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is something like CO2, which has two oxygen atoms. But how?

Wait, another possibility: the keto acid is reacting with X to form something like an ester or a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reaction where X and Y react. X reacts with liquid Y, releasing gas W. W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So the molecule is probably something like CO2? No, wait, CO2 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons (in each atom), but as a molecule, it's two atoms of O and one C. Wait, no, the molecule's protons and neutrons would sum to the same. Let me think: W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So the molecule could be something like CH4O? Wait, CH4O is formaldehyde, but that's a molecule with H and O, maybe. But let's think of the isotope possibilities.

Wait, another thought: If W is a molecule like H2O, but wait H2O has 2H (each with 1 proton) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). But the total protons in the molecule would be 2 (from H) + 8 (from O) = 10. Neutrons would be 8 (from O). So protons and neutrons in the molecule: 10 each? No, 10 protons and 8 neutrons. So that doesn't add up. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe W is CO2. CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons usually) and two O (each 8 protons, 8 neutrons). So the molecule has 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Each O has 8 neutrons, so 2*8=16 neutrons plus 6 from C-12 (which is 6 neutrons). So total neutrons would be 16 +6=22. So total protons in the molecule: 22, neutrons: 22. That fits. So W is CO2.

So gas W is CO2. That would mean that the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. So what substances react to produce CO2? Maybe a carbonate reacting with an acid, but wait, in this case, Y is a liquid, and X is a solid or another liquid? Alternatively, X might be a metal carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the reaction between a carbonate and acid produces CO2, water, and the corresponding salt. But in our case, the product is a precipitate G. So maybe it's a reaction where X is a carbonate reacting with an acid Y to produce CO2 and a precipitate.

Wait, another possibility: X could be a bicarbonate, like NaHCO3, which reacts with an acid to produce CO2.

But wait, going back to the first part: X has a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is a compound that includes an element with a heavy isotope. For example, chlorine has isotopes, so maybe X is something like HCl, but then why would it have a heavier isotope?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal with a heavy isotope. But wait, the substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So X could be something like Cl. But Cl has isotopes, but in its elemental form, it's a diatomic molecule. Wait, but perhaps X is something like NaCl, which has isotopes in the Cl part. But the problem states that X is a substance, so could be a compound.

Wait, the product when X reacts with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Hmm. Let me think. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid, which has a keto group and a carboxylic acid group. If X is a base, perhaps it's a deprotonation reaction. Or perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack.

Wait, but if X is a base, then reacting with the keto acid (which is an acid) would produce a salt and water. But the product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the product is something like a ketone, like if X is a strong base that deprotonates the acid to form a ketone. For example, if the keto acid is something like (CH3)2C(OH)COOH, and X is a base that deprotonates it to form (CH3)2C(O)COOH, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like KMnO4, but that's a strong oxidizing agent. Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the precipitate G that forms when X reacts with Y. When X and Y react, they form G, which upon heating gives B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. So B is probably water, since water's melting point is 273 K (0 C). But 277 K is about 4 degrees C, so it's just above the melting point. Wait, but if B is water, then when G is heated, it releases water. Hmm.

Wait, if G is a precipitate, perhaps it's a carbonate that upon heating decomposes. For example, if X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, the reaction produces CO2 (W), water (B?), and a precipitate. Wait, but if you have Na2CO3 reacting with H2SO4 (liquid Y), it produces Na2SO4, H2O, and CO2 gas. So in that case, W would be CO2, B would be H2O. But in the problem, the precipitate G forms, and when heated, releases B. So if G is Na2SO4, heating it wouldn't release anything. So maybe G is a different kind of salt.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrate or sulfate that reacts with an acid to produce a sulfide or something else, but that seems a bit off.

Wait, but going back to the first part: the product when X is reacted with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is carbon dioxide, which has two oxygen atoms. Wait, but CO2 has two oxygen atoms, so if the product is CO2, then the reaction would be the keto acid reacting with X to produce CO2. That could happen in a decarboxylation reaction, where the keto acid loses CO2. So if X is a base, perhaps it's a deprotonating agent that causes the keto acid to lose CO2.

Wait, a common reaction is the decarboxylation of a keto acid when heated, especially under basic conditions. For example, beta-keto acids lose CO2 upon heating. So perhaps X is a base that facilitates this decarboxylation. So when the keto acid reacts with X (a base), it loses CO2, which would have two oxygen atoms. So the product of the reaction would be CO2, and perhaps the corresponding ketone.

So in that case, X could be a base like NaOH or KOH. But why would X have a heavier isotope? For example, if X is KOH, but K usually doesn't have heavy isotopes that are significant. Wait, but perhaps X is something like HCl with a heavy isotope, but then why would it react with a keto acid?

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like D2O (deuterated water), but I'm not sure how that would fit.

Wait, another angle: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So X is a substance, probably a compound, made of two or more elements. We need to find the lightest and heaviest elements present in X, sum their atomic masses, considering all their isotopes.

Wait, but the problem says to sum the masses of the lightest and heaviest elements. So if X is, say, NaCl, the elements are Na and Cl. The atomic mass of Na is about 23, Cl is about 35.5. So the sum would be 58.5. But the options don't have that. So maybe X is something else.

Alternatively, if X is HCl, the elements are H and Cl. H's atomic mass is about 1, Cl is about 35.5. Sum is 36.5. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. Hmm, 35 is one of the options.

Wait, but the question says to consider the lightest and heaviest elements. So in the case of HCl, the lightest is H, the heaviest is Cl. So their masses would be H (1.008) and Cl (34.9688?), summing to about 36. But 35 is an option. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses, considering all their isotopes. So if X has multiple elements, we take the lightest element and its isotopes, and the heaviest element and its isotopes. But wait, perhaps the question is about the lightest and heaviest by atomic number, not by mass. Or maybe it's about the individual elements' isotopes.

Wait, no, the wording is: the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. So for X, which is a compound, the elements are, for example, in HCl, H and Cl. So lightest is H (atomic number 1), heaviest is Cl (17). So sum the atomic masses of H and Cl.

But wait, the cumulative atomic masses. So for each element in X, we sum all the isotopes' masses. But that sounds complicated because for each element, we have to sum all the possible isotopes. Wait, but natural elements have a mix of isotopes. For example, chlorine has about 75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37. So the average atomic mass is about 35.45.

Wait, but the question says, if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed. So for each element in X, sum all the isotopes' masses present.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with two elements, each having their own isotopes. So for example, if X is HCl, then for H, the isotopes are H (protium), D (deuterium), etc. Similarly for Cl, which has Cl-35 and Cl-37. So for each element in X, sum all their isotopes' masses.

Wait, but the problem says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements. So for X, find the lightest element (say, H) and sum all its isotopes' masses, and the heaviest element (Cl) and sum all its isotopes' masses, then add those two sums together.

Wait, but how much is that? Let's take H as example. H has isotopes like protium (1.007825), deuterium (2.014102), tritium (3.016049), etc. But in most cases, the majority is protium. However, if X contains a heavier isotope, perhaps it's using deuterium. So for X, if it's HCl with some D, then H in X could have D as part of it. So for the lightest element (H), we sum all possible isotopes present. Similarly for the heaviest element.

But this seems a bit tricky. Let me think: what's the cumulative atomic mass of H and Cl?

The average atomic mass of H is about 1.008. But if X has only H (without D), the isotopic masses would be mostly protium (1.007825), but D is about 2.014. So if X has H and D, then H's contribution would include both. But the problem states that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So perhaps X has more of a heavier isotope of one element.

So, for example, if X is HCl, where the H is mainly D (deuterium), then the H in X is mostly D. So the isotopes of H would be D (2.014) and perhaps a little H. So the sum of H's isotopes would be approximately 2.014 * (amount of D) + 1.007825 * (amount of H). But this is getting complicated.

Wait, but the question says that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed. So for each element in X, sum all the isotopes present, regardless of their abundance.

Wait, that can't be right because the elements are composed of multiple isotopes. So for H, that would be summing the masses of all isotopes of H present in X, multiplied by their respective amounts.

Wait, but perhaps the question is simpler. It says to sum the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, considering all their isotopes. Maybe it just means the sum of the lightest element's atomic mass (like H, 1.008) and the heaviest element's atomic mass (like Cl, 35.45). So 1.008 + 35.45 = around 36.458, which is close to 36. But the options don't have 36. The closest is option A:35, B:25, C:31, D:29.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the question is to find the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic numbers? No, that's not likely. Or perhaps it's the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest isotopes in X.

Wait, perhaps X is something like NaOH. So elements are Na, O, H. The lightest is H (1.008), heaviest is Na (22.99). Sum is about 24, which is option B:25. But 24 is close to 25.

Alternatively, if X is something like CaCO3, the elements are C, Ca, O. Lightest is C (12), heaviest is Ca (40.08). Sum is about 52, which isn't an option.

Wait, but earlier I thought X is something like KOH. So elements are K, O, H. Lightest is H (1.008), heaviest is K (39.10). Sum is about 40.1, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the reaction.

X reacts with Y to produce CO2 (gas W), precipitate G, and B upon heating G. Wait, when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (0 C). So B is likely water, but water freezes at 273 K, so 277 K is a bit above. So maybe B is something else, like a different form of water, but probably not. Alternatively, maybe it's another compound.

Wait, another thought: when you have a carbonate reacting with an acid, you get CO2, water, and a salt. But if the salt is a precipitate, then it's probably an insoluble salt like Ag2CO3, but I don't think that's very soluble. Wait, but silver carbonate is not very soluble in water, so if Y is an acid like HCl, then Ag2CO3 could precipitate.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that the precipitate is a sulfide, but that would require Y to be a sulfide, which may not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate. For example, CaCO3 (X) reacts with HCl (Y) to produce CO2, H2O, and CaCl2. But CaCl2 is soluble, so it wouldn't precipitate. That doesn't fit. So perhaps X is a metal carbonate that reacts with an acid to produce an insoluble salt.

Wait, maybe X is a nitrate, and Y is a solution of a sulfide, but I'm getting off track.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal hydroxide. For example, NaOH (X) reacts with an acid (Y, say H2SO4) to produce Na2SO4, water, and possibly some gas. But in that case, the gas would be SO2 or something else, not CO2.

Wait, but earlier I thought the gas is CO2, so let me circle back. If W is CO2, then the reaction between X and Y must produce CO2. So if X is a carbonate, Y is an acid. Then, X + Y → CO2 + H2O + salt.

So the precipitate G would be the salt. If the salt is insoluble, it will precipitate. For example, if X is CaCO3 and Y is HCl, then the reaction is CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O. But CaCl2 is soluble in water, so it wouldn't precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3 reacts with HCl to produce NaCl, CO2, and H2O. Again, NaCl is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfite, which reacts with an acid to produce SO2 gas. But the problem says W has equal protons and neutrons, which for SO2 would be 32 protons and 32 neutrons? Let me check: SO2 has S (16 protons, 16 neutrons usually) and two O (8 each). So total protons: 16 + 2*8=32. Neutrons: 16 + 2*8=32. So yes, SO2 would fit. So W could be SO2.

But earlier I thought W was CO2 because of the 22 protons and 22 neutrons. Wait, CO2 has 6 (C) + 2*8 (O) = 22 protons. Neutrons: C-12 has 6, each O-16 has 8. So 6 + 2*8=22. So W is CO2, which fits.

So, back to the reaction. Let's say X is a carbonate. X + Y (acid) → CO2 + H2O + salt.

The salt is a precipitate. So the salt must be insoluble in water. So, for example, if X is Ag2CO3 (silver carbonate) and Y is HNO3 (nitric acid), the reaction would produce Ag2(NO3)2, which is soluble. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, if X is PbCO3 (lead carbonate) and Y is HCl, the reaction would produce PbCl2, which is slightly soluble. So maybe it precipitates.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfate. Wait, but that would produce SO4^2- in solution, which is usually soluble.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfide, but that would produce H2S gas, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (each H: 1p, 0n; S:16p, 16n. So 2 H + 1 S = 18p, 16n. Not equal. So H2S wouldn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction between X and Y produces CO2, and the precipitate is something else, like a sulfide.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the product of X with a keto acid. The product has two oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is CO2, which has two O. So, the reaction is a decarboxylation, where the keto acid loses CO2. So X could be a base that deprotonates the keto acid, leading to the loss of CO2.

In such reactions, X is often a strong base like NaOH or KOH. So X could be NaOH. Now, NaOH has Na, O, H. The lightest element is H, the heaviest is Na. Their atomic masses are H (1.008), Na (22.99). Sum is about 24. So that would match option B:25. But wait, 1.008 +22.99=24.0, which is approximately 24, but the option is 25. Hmm, maybe my calculation is off.

Alternatively, perhaps X is KOH. Then, K (39.10), O (16.00), H (1.008). So lightest is H, heaviest is K. Sum is 1.008 +39.10=40.108, which isn't an option.

Wait, but perhaps X is another compound. Let me think about the options. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. So, if the sum is 25, perhaps it's H and Mg? No, Mg is 24.3, H is 1. So sum is about 25.3, which is close to option B:25.

Alternatively, maybe the elements are C and O. C is 12, O is 16. Sum is 28. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the elements are O and Cl. O is 16, Cl is 35.5. Sum is 51.5, not matching.

Wait, earlier I thought of X being HCl. So H (1.008) and Cl (35.45). Sum is 36.458. But option A is 35, which is close. But 35 is about the atomic mass of Cl-35. So if X is Cl-35, then the sum is 35.45 + 1.008 = 36.458. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with two elements, one of which is H and the other is something else. Let me see.

Wait, another thought: the product of X and the keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is something like dimethyl ketone, or another molecule with two O atoms. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester, which has two oxygen atoms. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but the key is to find the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So if X is HCl, the sum is about 36.458, but the options don't have that. So perhaps X is something else.

Another angle: the melting point of B is close to 277 K. B is the product when G is heated. So if G is a carbonate salt, heating it might release CO2 and leave a residue. Wait, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if G is a bicarbonate, heating it would release CO2 and leave the corresponding hydroxide.

Wait, perhaps X is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Then, reacting with an acid Y (like HCl) would produce CO2, H2O, and NaCl. The precipitate would be NaCl, but NaCl is soluble. So that doesn't fit. Unless Y is another acid that produces an insoluble salt.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate of a metal that forms an insoluble salt with Y. For example, if X is Ag2CO3 and Y is HNO3, the reaction would produce AgNO3, which is soluble. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfate, but that produces SO4^2- which is usually soluble.

I'm getting stuck on this part, so perhaps I should focus more on the part about the cumulative atomic masses.

Another approach: the options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Option C is 31, which is the sum of 15 (like O, 16) and 15 (like O again, but that doesn't make sense). Alternatively, 15 and 16: that's 31. 15 is for phosphorus (P, atomic number 15), 16 is sulfur (S). So if X has P and S, the sum would be 31. But I'm not sure if that makes sense.

Wait, but if X is H2SO4, the elements are H, S, O. The lightest is H, heaviest is S. Their atomic masses are 1.008 (H) and 32.07 (S). Sum is about 33.078, which is close to option C (31). Not exact, but perhaps considering isotopes.

Wait, but if X is H2SO4, which is a strong acid. If X reacts with a carbonate, it would produce CO2, but I'm not sure how that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps X is H2O, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another thought: the product of X with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is CO2, which has two O atoms. So the reaction is a decarboxylation, which is a common reaction in organic chemistry. So X is a base like NaOH or KOH, which causes the keto acid to lose CO2.

So if X is KOH, the elements are K, O, H. Lightest is H (1.008), heaviest is K (39.10). Sum is 40.108, which isn't an option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, X is NaOH: Na (22.99), O (16), H (1.008). Sum is 1.008 +22.99=24.0, which is close to option B:25. But 24.0 is not 25.

Wait, maybe X is something else. Let's think of another base. Maybe X is LiOH. Li (6.94), O (16), H (1.008). Sum is 7.948, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal carbonate, like CaCO3. So elements are Ca, C, O. Lightest is C (12.01), heaviest is Ca (40.08). Sum is about 52.09, not matching options.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let me think of another approach. The question states that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X must be summed. So for each element in X, sum all the isotopes present. For example, if X contains H and Cl, then sum all isotopes of H and all isotopes of Cl.

But wait, 'cumulative atomic masses'—does that mean the sum of each element's atomic masses, considering all isotopes? For example, H has isotopes with masses ~1, 2, 3 etc. So if X contains D (deuterium), the H contribution would be 2.014. Cl has ~35 and ~37. So the sum would be 2.014 (for D) + 35.45 (average Cl). So sum is 37.464. But the options don't have that.

Wait, but the problem says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses, considering all their isotopes. So for each element, sum all isotopes present in X. So if X has H and Cl, and X contains both H and D, then H's contribution is sum of all isotopes present. Same for Cl.

But this is getting complicated. Perhaps X is a compound with two elements where the lightest is H and the heaviest is Cl. So the sum would be average H (1.008) + average Cl (35.45). Sum is 36.458, but the closest option is 35 (option A). So perhaps the correct answer is A, 35.

But then why would the sum be 35? Because perhaps X only contains Cl-35 and H, so the sum is 35 (Cl) + 1 (H) = 36. But that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes in X. So for each element in X, take the lightest isotope and heaviest isotope, sum their masses, and then sum across the elements.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler: the lightest element is H (1.008) and the heaviest is Cl (35.45). Sum is ~36.458. So the closest option is A:35.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the correct answer is C:31. How?

Wait, another angle: the product of X reacting with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is a carbonyl compound with two oxygen atoms, like a ketone or an aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should go with the earlier thought that X is HCl, sum of H and Cl is ~36, so the closest option is 35. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, maybe X is Cl2, so the element is Cl, and the lightest and heaviest are the same. So sum is 35.45, which is close to option A:35.

Wait, but Cl2 is a diatomic molecule; the question says X is a substance, so it could be Cl2. If X is Cl2, then it's a single element, so the lightest and heaviest are the same (Cl). So the sum would be 35.45, which is option A:35.

But wait, the problem states that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope. Cl has both Cl-35 and Cl-37. So if X is Cl2, then the heavier isotope is Cl-37. But the sum would still be Cl's atomic mass, which is about 35.45.

But the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements in X. If X is Cl2, the only element is Cl. So the sum would be Cl's atomic mass, which is 35.45. So the closest option is A:35.

Hmm, that could make sense. So perhaps the answer is A:35.


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, which reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W (CO₂), a precipitate G, and ultimately releases B upon heating. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, suggesting it is water (H₂O). Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope, and the reaction of X with a keto acid produces a product containing two oxygen atoms, likely CO₂.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W (CO₂):** The molecule CO₂ has 22 protons and 22 neutrons, satisfying the condition that the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. This confirms that W is CO₂, indicating that the reaction between X and Y involves the production of CO₂.

2. **Precipitate G and Product B:** The precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y, and heating G releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. This strongly suggests that B is water (H₂O), as water melts at 273 K and has a melting point close to 277 K.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid:** The product of the reaction between X and a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms, likely CO₂. This suggests that X facilitates a decarboxylation reaction, where the keto acid loses CO₂. X is likely a base, such as NaOH or KOH, which can deprotonate the keto acid and promote the release of CO₂.

4. **Cumulative Atomic Masses of X:** The problem requires calculating the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. If X is HCl, the lightest element is H (atomic mass ~1.008) and the heaviest is Cl (atomic mass ~35.45). The sum of these atomic masses is approximately 36.458, which is close to option A (35). However, if X is Cl₂, it contains only chlorine, and the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes (Cl-35 and Cl-37) would still align closely with option A (35).

5. **Options Analysis:**
   - **A) 35:** Matches the atomic mass of Cl-35, consistent with X being Cl₂ or a compound like HCl.
   - **B) 25:** Does not align with the elements in X.
   - **C) 31:** Unlikely, as it does not match the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.
   - **D) 29:** Also does not align with the elements in X.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible interpretation is that X is Cl₂ or a compound like HCl, where the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements sum to approximately 35. This aligns with option A.

Answer: A
