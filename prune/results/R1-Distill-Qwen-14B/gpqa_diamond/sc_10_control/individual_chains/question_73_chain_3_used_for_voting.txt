Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, first things first, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because that would give an answer faster than light, which isn't possible. Oh right, Einstein's velocity addition formula must come into play here.

So, the formula for relative velocity in relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Let me get that straight: u is the velocity of one object as seen from the other's frame, or vice versa. Wait, no, actually, the formula is for when you have two velocities u and v in the same reference frame, and you want the relative velocity between them. Wait, no, wait. Suppose the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, what's the speed of the second?

Wait, no, the relative speed isn't just 0.6c minus 0.5c, which is 0.1c. But since they're moving in the same direction, I think it's (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), where u is the speed of the other object relative to the first. Wait, no, maybe I should think about it differently. Oh wait, no, the formula is for when you have two frames moving at u and v relative to a third frame, and you want the velocity of one frame relative to another. So for the relative speed of the second astronaut as seen from the first, it's (v - u)/(1 - (uv/c²)), but wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me get this straight. The first astronaut is moving at u = 0.6c relative to the rest frame. The second is moving at v = 0.5c in the same direction. So, from the first astronaut's perspective, what's the speed of the second? So I think the formula is (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/(c²)). Wait, wait no, wait, actually, the formula is (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/(c²)). But wait, I think I might have it backward. Let me think: if an object is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, and the lab frame is moving at velocity u relative to another frame, then in the other frame, the object's velocity is (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²). Wait, but in this case, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame. The second is moving at 0.5c. So from the first's perspective, the second's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me calculate that.

Wait, the numerator would be (0.5c - 0.6c) = (-0.1c). The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²/c²) )= 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. But speed is a magnitude, so 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c, but I have to be precise because the options have 0.14c and 0.1c. So that's the relative speed part.

Now for the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic energy includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The total energy for each astronaut is gamma times m c squared, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So, for the first astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is gamma1 * (2m) c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2 )= 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So his energy is gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Total energy E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches. So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says "the total energy of the system." Are they considering the rest energy of both astronauts, plus their kinetic energy? Because in relativity, each object's energy is gamma times m c squared, yes. So adding them together makes sense.

So the options: looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel =0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So the relative speed is 0.14c (matches what I calculated), and the energy is 5.96 mc² (matches my calculation).

But wait, another thought: when considering relative motion, the velocities are not just about the difference. But the question is about the relative speed, which I've correctly calculated using the relativistic formula.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (velocity of the first astronaut) and \( v = 0.5c \) (velocity of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the speed is a magnitude, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

#### First Astronaut
Mass \( m_1 = 2m \), velocity \( v_1 = 0.6c \). Calculate \( \gamma_1 \):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

Energy of the first astronaut:

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut
Mass \( m_2 = 3m \), velocity \( v_2 = 0.5c \). Calculate \( \gamma_2 \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

Energy of the second astronaut:

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy of the System
The total energy is the sum of the energies of both astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
\]

### Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \).
- The total energy is \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96mc^2 \).

These match the values in **Option C**.

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2 )= 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So his energy is gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Total energy E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches. So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (velocity of the first astronaut) and \( v = 0.5c \) (velocity of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the speed is a magnitude, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

#### First Astronaut
Mass \( m_1 = 2m \), velocity \( v_1 = 0.6c \). Calculate \( \gamma_1 \):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

Energy of the first astronaut:

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut
Mass \( m_2 = 3m \), velocity \( v_2 = 0.5c \). Calculate \( \gamma_2 \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

Energy of the second astronaut:

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy of the System
The total energy is the sum of the energies of both astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
\]

### Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \).
- The total energy is \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96mc^2 \).

These match the values in **Option C**.
