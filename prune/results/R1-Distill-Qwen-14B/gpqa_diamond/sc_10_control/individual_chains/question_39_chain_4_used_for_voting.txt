Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again carefully.

We have an ensemble of 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's under the same conditions. Each particle can move along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measured the positions of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Our job is to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, wait a minute. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. For the particle to be found only between x=1 and x=3, the probability outside this region must be zero. So the wave function must be zero for x < 1 and x > 3.

Looking at the wave function given: (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, that's a complex function. But in regions where the particle isn't found, the wave function must be zero. Because if the particle is not present there, the probability amplitude is zero.

So, for x <1 and x>3, the wave function should be zero. Let's consider x <1 first. Let's set the wave function to zero:

a / sqrt(1 + x) - 0.5i = 0.

This implies both real and imaginary parts must be zero. So, real part: a / sqrt(1+x) = 0, and the imaginary part: -0.5 = 0? Wait, that can't be right. Because 0.5 isn't zero, so this equation can't be satisfied for any a. Hmm, that seems like a problem. Did I get the wave function wrong?

Wait, perhaps the wave function is written as a sum where both terms are real and imaginary? No, in the given function, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So, it's a complex function. For it to be zero in regions where the particle isn't found, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero. But the imaginary part is -0.5i. So, for this to be zero, -0.5i =0, which is impossible. That suggests that perhaps the wave function as given isn't correct for the regions where the particle isn't found. Hmm, perhaps I've misunderstood the setup.

Wait a second. Maybe the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero outside. So perhaps the given wave function is valid only in that region, but outside it's zero. Or perhaps the wave function is presented in a way that the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is constant (but that would imply it's non-zero outside the region, which can't be if the particle isn't found there).

Wait, perhaps the given wave function is just the real part, or perhaps it's part of a more complex expression. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find 'a' such that the wave function equals zero at x=1 and x=3, which are the boundaries.

Wait, but the problem states that when measured, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside that region. So, the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3.

But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a complex function. So in regions where the particle isn't found, the wave function must be zero, meaning both the real and imaginary parts are zero. But the imaginary part is -0.5, which isn't zero. So that seems contradictory. Unless the wave function is only non-zero in the interval [1,3], and zero outside. But how?

Wait, perhaps I should model the wave function as being zero outside [1,3], and the given expression is valid only within that interval. So, for x between 1 and 3, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i; and zero otherwise. But that brings up the question of normalization.

Wait, the wave function must satisfy normalization condition. The integral of |psi|^2 dx from 1 to 3 should equal 1, since all the probability is there.

So, let's compute the normalization condition. The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The modulus squared is (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, since (real part squared) plus (imaginary part squared). So |psi|^2 is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but the wave function has a non-zero imaginary part, which would imply that the probability isn't just the square of the real part. So, the probability density is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts. So, the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx should equal 1.

So let's compute that integral.

Integral [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3.

Breaking it into two terms:

a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each integral:

First integral: ∫ 1/(1+x) dx = ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² = (1 - 0.5) / ln(2) = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute 0.5 / ln(2). ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213. Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, about 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer is B.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given wave function and apply the normalization condition. The wave function is expressed as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

where \(i\) is the imaginary unit. The wave function must satisfy the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

Since the particle is only found between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), the wave function is zero outside this interval. Within the interval, the probability density is given by:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral is split into two parts:

1. \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\):  
   The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln(1+x)\). Evaluating from \(x=1\) to \(x=3\), we get:

   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. \(\int_1^3 0.25 dx\):  
   This is straightforward:

   \[
   0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Rearranging for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{1 - 0.5}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again carefully.

Wait, the wave function must satisfy normalization condition. The integral of |psi|^2 dx from 1 to 3 should equal 1, since all the probability is there.

So, let's compute the normalization condition. The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The modulus squared is (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, since (real part squared) plus (imaginary part squared). So |psi|^2 is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but the wave function has a non-zero imaginary part, which would imply that the probability isn't just the square of the real part. So, the probability density is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts. So, the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx should equal 1.

So let's compute that integral.

Integral [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3.

Breaking it into two terms:

a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each integral:

First integral: ∫ 1/(1+x) dx = ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² = (1 - 0.5) / ln(2) = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute 0.5 / ln(2). ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213. Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, about 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer is B.

   This is straightforward:

   \[
   0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Rearranging for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{1 - 0.5}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.
