Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question involves two reactions with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The starting materials are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So, I think this is about epoxidation.

Epoxidation of alkenes typically forms an epoxide. But wait, the structure of the alkene must influence the product. Let me think about the geometry of the starting alkenes. (E)-oct-4-ene has the two higher priority groups on opposite sides, while (Z) has them on the same side.

When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide via an electrocyclic ring-opening mechanism. But wait, I'm a bit hazy on the details. Oh right, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a stereospecific way. For a trans (E) alkene, the epoxidation would lead to a specific configuration in the epoxide ring. Similarly, the cis (Z) alkene would form another epoxide.

Wait, but wait—epoxidation of E and Z alkenes: for an E (trans) double bond, the two substituents on each carbon are opposite. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are on opposite faces. Wait, no—epoxide formation is stereospecific, so the configuration of the alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide.

Another thought: When (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA, the epoxide formed will have a certain stereochemistry, maybe trans or cis. Similarly, the (Z)-oct-4-ene will form a different epoxide.

Wait, but wait—mCPBA adds to the double bond in a way that the peracid's oxygen adds to the same face. So the endo transition state leads to the formation of an epoxide where the two new oxygen atoms are on opposite sides (cis or trans?), but I'm getting a little confused.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms an epoxide where the substituents are adjacent in a certain way. Let me think of the structure. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle, but for (E), substituents on each end are opposite.

Wait, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2 between two CH2 groups. No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 with four carbons on each side? Wait, octane has eight carbons. So oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2 between carbons 4 and 5. Wait, no—actually, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait. Let me correct that. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 where the double bond is between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2, but actually, each end has two CH2 groups.

But perhaps I should imagine the molecule as CH2CH2 with substituents on either side. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents (like CH2CH2CH3 groups) on either end of the double bond are opposite each other, while in (Z), they are on the same side.

When mCPBA reacts with each, it forms an epoxide. Now, the question is, what products do each reaction form?

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide. Then aqueous acid. Wait, after epoxidation, what happens when acid is added? I thought that epoxides can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening. Oh wait, but the question says both reactions go to 100% completion. So after epoxidation, when acid is added, do they ring-open?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. When mCPBA is used, it forms an epoxide. Then, in acidic conditions, the epoxide usually undergoes ring-opening. So maybe each reaction forms an epoxide, which then opens in acid.

Wait, but mCPBA is usually used for epoxidation. So perhaps after that, the acid work-up causes something else. Alternatively, maybe the work-up isn't causing further reaction beyond isolating the epoxide. Hmm, but the question says that after mCPBA, aqueous acid is added, and both reactions go to completion. So perhaps the epoxide is further reacted.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The reaction conditions: mCPBA is used for epoxidation. Then, aqueous acid is added. For example, in some cases, the epoxide might protonate and then undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening. But wait, the problem states that the products are combined, so perhaps each reaction gives a mixture of diols.

Wait, no. Wait, when epoxides are treated with aqueous acid, they typically undergo ring-opening via acid catalysis. For example, the epoxide would protonate, then the ring opens in a way that depends on the structure. The ring-opening of epoxides under acidic conditions typically leads to the formation of diols, where the two hydroxyl groups add to the carbons in a trans fashion.

Wait, but wait, the ring-opening of epoxides in acid usually occurs via a two-step mechanism: the epoxide oxygen is protonated, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. Then, water (or another nucleophile) attacks the more substituted carbon, leading to the ring opening. The product is a diol with the hydroxyl groups added in a trans configuration relative to the former epoxide.

So, for each epoxide, when treated with acid (like aqueous H3O+), the epoxide opens to form a diol. Now, the stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide.

So, first, let's figure out what each starting alkene produces.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form an epoxide. Then, acid work-up gives a diol.

Similarly, Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide → diol.

Wait, but the starting alkenes are E and Z, so their epoxidation will form different epoxides. Then, the ring-opening will give different diols.

Wait, but what are the structures of the epoxides?

Let me imagine oct-4-ene as CH2CH2 between carbons 4 and 5. For (E), the substituents on either end (like CH2CH3 groups) are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds across the double bond, it forms an epoxide. The geometry of the epoxide will depend on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, I think that epoxidation of a trans (E) alkene leads to a trans epoxide? Or is it the other way around? Hmm. Let me think about the mechanism. The mCPBA reacts with the alkene in a concerted way, forming the epoxide. The addition is stereospecific, meaning that the configuration of the starting alkene influences the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to visualize. In the epoxidation, the two oxygen atoms are added across the double bond. For an E-alkene, the substituents on each end are opposite, so when the oxygen is added, the two new oxygen substituents will be on opposite sides of the epoxide ring.

Wait, but the epoxide is a three-membered ring, so the substituents on either end would be on the same face. Oh, wait, no. Let me get this right. When the double bond is E, the two higher priority groups (like the substituents on either end) are on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, the peracid's oxygen adds to each carbon in a way that the two oxygen atoms end up on the same face as the substituents, or opposite?

Hmm. Let me think of a simple example. Take propene, CH2=CH2CH3. If it's E (but wait, that's not possible for propene, but anyway), the substituents are opposite. After epoxidation, the oxygen atoms would be added across the double bond. But wait, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end of the double bond are on opposite sides. So, when mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds to each carbon from the same face, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide formed from (E) alkene is trans, and from (Z) is cis. Because for (Z), the substituents are on the same side, so when the oxygen adds, they'd be adjacent in the same face, leading to a cis epoxide.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the stereochemistry of epoxidation. Epoxidation generally leads to the formation of an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Because the reaction is stereospecific. So, the configuration of the alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, I think I need to look this up mentally: when an E-alkene reacts with mCPBA, the resulting epoxide is trans. Similarly, a Z-alkene would form a cis epoxide. Because the endo transition state leads to the addition of the oxygen atoms on the same face as the substituents. So, for an E-alkene, the substituents are opposite, so the oxygen atoms end up on opposite faces in the epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the opposite is true. Let me think again. When the alkene is E, the groups are opposite, and when the peracid attacks, the oxygen atoms are added on the same face. So, in the epoxide, the substituents (like the adjacent CH2 groups) would be on opposite sides, making the epoxide trans.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's imagine the (E) and (Z) alkenes.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents (like the two CH2CH2CH3 groups) on either end are on opposite sides of the double bond. When epoxidized, the two oxygen atoms are added across the double bond in a way that the new oxygen atoms are on the same face of the original double bond. So, for the (E) isomer, which has substituents opposite, the resulting epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms on the same face, leading to a trans configuration.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide's configuration is such that the substituents on each carbon are either cis or trans in the ring.

So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents (the adjacent CH2 groups) are on opposite sides. So when the epoxide forms, the two new oxygen substituents would be on the same face, leading to a trans epoxide.

Wait, I'm not entirely confident, but let's proceed with that assumption.

So, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (trans) → acid → diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (cis) → acid → diol.

Now, the acid work-up would cause the epoxide to open. So, each epoxide would form a diol. But the configuration of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide.

In acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon. Let's think about the epoxide structure.

The epoxide is a three-membered ring. For the (E) case, trans epoxide, and for the (Z) case, cis epoxide.

Wait, but in oct-4-ene, both ends are similar, so the epoxide would be symmetrical. So, the ring-opening would be the same on either side.

Wait, but let's think of the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of each epoxide.

For a trans epoxide (from (E) alkene), the ring-opening would proceed with the water attacking the more substituted carbon, but since the epoxide is symmetric, perhaps the diol that forms would have adjacent hydroxyl groups in a certain configuration.

Wait, no, the substituents on each carbon of the epoxide are the same, since it's oct-4-ene. So, each carbon in the epoxide has two CH2 groups attached. So, the epoxide is symmetrical.

So, when the epoxide is treated with acid, the protonation occurs on one of the oxygen atoms, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. The water attacks one carbon, leading to the formation of a carbocation (or a partial positive charge), and then the other oxygen attacks, leading to the diol.

Wait, but in the case of symmetric epoxides, like from (E) or (Z) alkenes, the diol formed would have the hydroxyl groups in a particular configuration.

Let me think of a specific example. Take cyclohexene oxide (epoxide). When opened under acidic conditions, the diol that forms has the hydroxyl groups trans to each other. Because the attack occurs on the less hindered carbon, leading to the trans addition.

Wait, but in a symmetrical epoxide, like from (E) or (Z) oct-4-ene, the diol formed would have the hydroxyl groups either both axial (but in a smaller molecule, perhaps) or in a trans configuration.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact stereochemistry. Let me think: when an epoxide opens in acidic conditions, the nucleophile (like water) attacks the more substituted carbon. Wait, no, in acidic conditions, the attack is on the less substituted carbon? Or does it depend on the structure?

Wait, no, wait. For asymmetric epoxides, the attack is typically on the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized (like less carbocation strain). But in a symmetric epoxide, like from (E) or (Z) oct-4-ene, both carbons are equally substituted, so either can be attacked. But since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol formed would be the same regardless of which carbon is attacked first.

Wait, but in that case, for the (E) epoxide, which is trans, the attack would proceed in a way that the hydroxyl groups are added in a certain configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps each epoxide, upon acid treatment, forms a diol with a specific stereochemistry.

So, in the case of the (E) epoxide, which is trans, the ring-opening under acid leads to a diol where the hydroxyl groups are on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans).

Wait, no, perhaps it's the opposite. Let me think again: the epoxide is a three-membered ring. When it's opened, the hydroxyl groups are added anti to each other. Because the ring opens with the nucleophile attacking from the opposite side of the leaving group.

Wait, in acid-catalyzed epoxide opening, the protonation occurs on the epoxide oxygen, making the adjacent carbons electrophilic. The nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon (in asymmetric cases), leading to a carbocation. Then, the other oxygen attacks from the opposite side, leading to the diol.

So, in a trans epoxide, the attack would lead to the diol having the hydroxyl groups in a trans configuration around the former epoxide carbons.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this mentally. For (E)-epoxide: the two oxygen atoms are on opposite faces of the ring. When water attacks, it comes from the opposite face of the protonated oxygen, leading to the diol's configuration.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of the diastereomers. So, the diol formed from the (E) epoxide would be trans, and the diol from the (Z) epoxide would be cis?

Wait, no, perhaps the opposite. Because in an epoxide, the two oxygen atoms are adjacent. When the epoxide is trans, the ring-opening would lead to a diol where the hydroxyl groups are on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans).

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the specific example of trans and cis epoxides.

For a trans epoxide: when the epoxide opens, the two hydroxyl groups end up on the same face, leading to a trans diol.

Wait, no, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think of the chair-like transition state. No, perhaps another approach.

In the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide, the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon. For symmetric epoxides, either attack is possible, but because of the ring's symmetry, the diol formed will be the same regardless.

Wait, but the stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide. Let me think of a specific example. Take cis-2,3-epoxybutane. When treated with acid, the epoxide opens to form a diol. The hydroxyl groups would add in a trans configuration across the former epoxide carbons because the ring opening leads to attack from the opposite side.

Wait, maybe that's the case. So, in the case of a cis epoxide (from Z-alkene), the diol formed would have the hydroxyl groups in a trans configuration. Similarly, a trans epoxide (from E-alkene) would form a diol with the hydroxyl groups in a cis configuration.

Wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because if the epoxide is cis, the attack would be from the same face, leading to the diol being trans.

Alternatively, perhaps when the epoxide is cis, the diol is trans, and when the epoxide is trans, the diol is cis.

Wait, that might make sense. So, for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide → ring-opening → diol with cis OH groups.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide → ring-opening → diol with trans OH groups.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me try to think of the mechanism again. When the epoxide is opened under acidic conditions, the water attacks the protonated epoxide oxygen. The attack occurs from the opposite side of the leaving group. So, for a cis epoxide, the attack would lead to the hydroxyl groups adding on opposite sides, leading to a trans diol.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the same for any epoxide. The diol formed will always be trans because the attack is from the opposite face.

Wait, wait, perhaps the diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's configuration because the starting epoxide has substituents arranged in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the diastereomers are formed based on the epoxide's structure. Let's imagine an epoxide where the substituents are on the same face (cis). When the ring opens, the diol's substituents would end up trans to each other. Whereas, if the substituents were on opposite faces (trans epoxide), ring-opening would lead to diol substituents being cis.

So, for Reaction 1: (E) → trans epoxide → diol (cis)
Reaction 2: (Z) → cis epoxide → diol (trans)

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the diol's configuration is the same as the epoxide's. Let me think again.

Wait, let's imagine a specific example. Take (E)-2-butene, which upon epoxidation with mCPBA forms a trans epoxide. Then, under acidic conditions, this epoxide would open to form a diol. What's the configuration of that diol?

Wait, but I can't recall exactly, so perhaps I should try to imagine the mechanism. The epoxide oxygen is protonated, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. Water attacks one carbon from the opposite side of the protonated oxygen. This leads to the ring opening, and the other oxygen attacks from the opposite side, leading to the diol.

Wait, perhaps the diol's configuration is such that the two hydroxyl groups are trans to each other. Because the attack occurs on opposite faces.

Wait, if the epoxide is trans, perhaps the diol's hydroxyl groups are also trans. Or perhaps it's the opposite.

Alternatively, maybe the diol's configuration is the same as the epoxide's. So, a trans epoxide leads to a trans diol, and a cis epoxide leads to a cis diol.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: when the epoxide is symmetric, the diol formed will have two possible configurations, but perhaps they are the same due to symmetry. For example, in the case of cyclohexene oxide opening under acid, the diol formed is trans-1,2-cyclohexanediol.

Wait, so in that case, the cis epoxide (from a cis-alkene) would lead to a trans diol.

So, perhaps, in general, regardless of the starting epoxide's configuration (cis or trans), the diol's hydroxyl groups are trans.

Wait, but that can't be right because Reaction 1 and 2 would then produce the same diol, which can't be correct because the question implies different products.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps each starting alkene leads to a different diol, which may or may not be enantiomers or diastereomers.

Wait, maybe each reaction leads to a different diastereomer. So, combining the products would give a mixture of diastereomers, which would then be analyzed on the HPLC columns.

Wait, but let's think about the products.

So, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide → acid → trans diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide → acid → cis diol.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the diol's configuration is the same as the epoxide's. Alternatively, perhaps the diol's configuration is the opposite.

Wait, another way: when the epoxide is trans, the diol would have the hydroxyl groups on the same face (cis) or opposite (trans). But if the epoxide is trans, then the diol's hydroxyl groups would be trans.

Wait, perhaps the diol is always trans, regardless of the epoxide's configuration. Because in the ring-opening mechanism, the hydroxyl groups are added in a trans fashion.

But then, both reactions would produce the same diol, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a different diastereomer. So, if the diol's configuration is determined by the epoxide's configuration, then Reaction 1 and 2 would produce different diastereomers.

Wait, but how many diastereomers are possible for the diol?

The diol is 4,5-diol in octane. So, the structure would be HOCH2CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait no, octane has eight carbons, so after the diol, there are three CH2 groups on each side of the diol.

Wait, the diol would be on carbons 4 and 5. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH(OH)CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, but the actual structure would be:

CH2CH2CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, but the configuration around the two OH groups would determine the diastereomerism.

If the OH groups are on the same side (cis), that's one diastereomer. If they're on opposite sides (trans), that's another.

But wait, if the epoxide is trans, the diol would have the OHs on the same side (cis), and if the epoxide is cis, the diol would have OHs on opposite sides (trans). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mechanism again. For a trans epoxide, the two oxygen atoms are on opposite faces. When the ring opens, the water attacks each carbon from the opposite face, leading to OH groups on the same face, making a cis diol.

Wait, that would mean:

Reaction 1: (E)-epoxide (trans) → diol (cis)
Reaction 2: (Z)-epoxide (cis) → diol (trans)

So, each reaction gives a different diol enantiomer? Or diastereomer?

Wait, but if the diols are enantiomers or diastereomers, that would affect how they appear on the HPLC columns.

Wait, but wait, the diols are on the same carbon chain. So, their structures are 4,5-diol each, but the stereochemistry around those two OH groups determines the diastereomerism.

So, each reaction produces a diol with a different configuration: one cis, one trans.

Wait, but wait, the diol from Reaction 1 is cis, and from Reaction 2 is trans.

Now, the chemist combines these two products. So, the mixture would contain both cis and trans diols.

Now, the question is about running this mixture on a standard (achiral) HPLC and a chiral HPLC column.

In an achiral column, diastereomers would have different retention times, whereas enantiomers would have the same retention time because they are not separated on an achiral column. But wait, wait—if the diols are diastereomers, they would be separated on an achiral column because they have different physical properties.

In a chiral column, diastereomers would still be separated if they are not mirror images. Enantiomers would be separated because the column can differentiate between them.

Wait, but in this case, the two diols are cis and trans, which are diastereomers, not enantiomers. So, on a chiral column, they would also be separated.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me think again.

Wait, after both reactions, the chemist combines the products. So, in the mixture, you have two diastereomers: the diol from (E) and the diol from (Z). Each diol is a single compound because each reaction went to completion.

Wait, but wait—wait a second. Let me think about the diols.

For Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (trans) → diol (cis). So the diol has both OH groups on the same side, making it a cis diol.

For Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (cis) → diol (trans). So the diol has OH groups on opposite sides, making it a trans diol.

In the mixture, you have both the cis and trans diols. Each is a diastereomer of the other.

Now, when running on a standard (achiral) HPLC column: each diastereomer would have a different retention time. So, two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC column: since the two diols are diastereomers, the column would also separate them, giving two peaks. Wait, but wait—maybe I'm mixing up. Chiral columns are used to separate enantiomers. Diastereomers are already separated on achiral columns. So, if the diols are diastereomers, they would show as two separate peaks on both the standard and chiral HPLC.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose the diol from Reaction 1 is a single enantiomer, and the diol from Reaction 2 is another diastereomer. Wait, but no, each diol is a single compound. So, the mixture would have two diastereomers, each of which would give a single peak on the HPLC.

So, on the standard HPLC, you'd see two peaks. On the chiral HPLC, you'd also see two peaks, because the two diastereomers are not mirror images of each other. Enantiomers would be separated on a chiral column, but diastereomers would also be separated if the column can differentiate them.

Wait, but another possibility: each diol could have multiple stereoisomers. Let me think. The diol is on two adjacent carbons, each with an OH group. So, each diol has two stereocenters. For the cis diol, the two OHs are on the same face, so their configurations are the same. For the trans diol, the OHs are on opposite faces, so their configurations are opposite.

Wait, perhaps the cis diol is a single diastereomer, and the trans diol is another. So, the mixture would have two distinct diastereomers, each of which would give a single peak on the HPLC.

So, on the standard column, two peaks. On the chiral column, two peaks as well.

Wait, but let me think of the number of possible stereoisomers.

The diol is 4,5-diol in octane. Each OH is on a separate carbon, so each is a stereocenter. So, for each diol, there are two stereocenters.

Wait, but in this case, the diols from each reaction would have specific configurations.

For example, the diol from Reaction 1 (cis) would have both OHs on the same face, say R and R, but perhaps that's not the case because the configuration depends on the starting alkene.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the diol from (E) would have the two OHs on the same face (cis), leading to a (R,R) configuration. The diol from (Z) would have the two OHs on opposite faces (trans), leading to (R,S) configuration.

Wait, but (R,S) is a meso compound, which is achiral. Oh, wait! Because if the two stereocenters are R and S, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound, meaning it's not chiral.

Wait, but in our case, the diol is 4,5-diol. The molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the two OHs are on opposite sides. Because the molecule would look the same when reflected across that plane.

So, the diol from Reaction 2 (trans) would be a meso compound, meaning it's not chiral. While the diol from Reaction 1 (cis) would have two stereocenters with the same configuration (R,R or S,S), making it chiral.

So, in the mixture, you have:

- From Reaction 1: a chiral diol (two stereocenters, same configuration → no plane of symmetry → chiral)
- From Reaction 2: a meso diol (two stereocenters, opposite configurations → has a plane of symmetry → achiral)

So, when running the mixture on an achiral HPLC column, both compounds would have different retention times because they are diastereomers. So, two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC column, the chiral diol would split into two peaks (enantiomers), but the meso compound is achiral and would appear as a single peak.

Wait, that's a possibility. So, the chiral diol (from Reaction 1) would have two enantiomers, but since Reaction 1 only produces one enantiomer, would it appear as a single peak? Or does the reaction lead to a racemic mixture?

Wait, no. The reaction with mCPBA is stereospecific. So, the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene leads to a single epoxide enantiomer, which upon ring-opening gives a single diol enantiomer. Similarly, the (Z)-epoxide leads to a single diol enantiomer, but in this case, it's a meso compound.

Wait, but no. Let me clarify. For Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene would form a single epoxide enantiomer, and upon ring-opening, would produce a single diol enantiomer. But wait, the diol from Reaction 1 has two stereocenters. If the diol is (R,R), that's a single enantiomer. But on an achiral column, it would be a single peak.

For Reaction 2, the (Z) epoxide would form a meso diol (after ring-opening), which is a single compound but achiral. So, on an achiral column, it would be a single peak as well.

Wait, but I'm getting confused again. Let me think.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide → diol (cis, but with both OH on same face → (R,R) or (S,S) configuration → chiral. So, one enantiomer.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide → diol (trans, leading to (R,S) configuration → meso, so achiral.

So, when the chemist combines the two products, the mixture contains:

1. (R,R)-diol (chiral)
2. (R,S)-diol (meso, achiral)

So, in the mixture, how many distinct compounds are present?

Two: one chiral and one meso.

Now, putting this mixture on the HPLC columns.

On a standard (achiral) HPLC column: each distinct compound would elute as a separate peak. So, two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC column: the chiral diol would be separated into two peaks (its enantiomers), but since Reaction 1 only produces one enantiomer, it would appear as a single peak. Wait, no—wait, if the diol is chiral, but the reaction only produces one enantiomer, then on a chiral column, it would elute as a single peak because it's a single enantiomer.

Wait, but wait. Reaction 1 produces (R,R) diol, which is a single enantiomer. On a chiral column, it would have a single peak. The meso diol (from Reaction 2) is achiral, so on a chiral column, it would also have a single peak.

Wait, but that would mean both compounds are resolved into two peaks on the chiral column as well. But the meso compound is a single compound, so it would give one peak. The chiral diol (from Reaction 1) is a single enantiomer, so it would give another peak. So, in total, two peaks on both columns.

Wait, but wait. The diol from Reaction 1 is chiral, and the diol from Reaction 2 is achiral.

So, on an achiral column, you have two compounds (different diastereomers), leading to two peaks.

On a chiral column, the chiral diol would split into two peaks (enantiomers), but if Reaction 1 only produces one enantiomer, it would appear as a single peak. Wait, no, because the chiral diol is a single enantiomer, so on a chiral column, it would still be a single peak. The meso diol is a single compound, so another peak. So, two peaks on both columns.

But that can't be right because the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Option C says 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Option D says 3 in standard and 4 in chiral.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the diol structures.

Wait, another angle: each reaction leads to a diol, but perhaps each diol can exist as multiple stereoisomers.

Wait, Reaction 1 produces a single diastereomer of the cis diol (two stereocenters with same configuration), which is chiral.

Reaction 2 produces a single diastereomer of the trans diol (two stereocenters with opposite configurations), which is meso and thus achiral.

So, the mixture has two compounds: one chiral diol and one meso diol.

On an achiral column, each compound is separated if they are different, which they are (different diastereomers). So, two peaks.

On a chiral column, the chiral diol would have two enantiomers, but since Reaction 1 only produces one, it would appear as a single peak. The meso diol is a single compound, so another peak. So, two peaks on both columns.

But wait, the question is about the products of both reactions being combined. So, each reaction gives one diol. If the diols are different, then on the HPLC columns, they would show as two peaks in each.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the diol from Reaction 1 is a pair of enantiomers. No, because the reaction is stereospecific and goes to completion, it would form a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps I should think that each reaction produces a diol that is a meso compound or a chiral compound.

For Reaction 1: (E) → trans epoxide → diol (cis) → two stereocenters same → chiral.

For Reaction 2: (Z) → cis epoxide → diol (trans) → two stereocenters opposite → meso.

So, when the products are combined, the mixture contains: (R,R) diol (chiral) and (R,S) diol (meso). So, two different compounds.

On an achiral column, both would have different retention times, so two peaks.

On a chiral column, the (R,R) diol is chiral, so it would appear as a single peak (since it's a single enantiomer), and the (R,S) diol is a single compound, so another peak. So, again, two peaks on both columns.

But looking at the options, option C is 2 peaks in both columns. But the option says "the products of both reactions" are combined. So, each product is a single compound. So, when combined, you have two compounds, each with their own peaks on both columns.

Wait, but wait, perhaps each reaction produces more than one product. Let me think again.

In Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide → ring-opening → diol (cis)

In Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide → ring-opening → diol (trans)

Each reaction produces a single diol.

But wait, perhaps each reaction leads to more than one diastereomer. No, because the reaction is stereospecific and goes to completion.

So, the mixture has two diastereomeric diols, each of which is a single compound.

In the HPLC, on an achiral column, each diastereomer would elute as a separate peak (2 peaks).

On a chiral column, the chiral diol (from Reaction 1) would be a single peak, and the meso diol (from Reaction 2) would be a single peak. So, again, two peaks on both columns.

But that's not matching any options. Let's look at the options again.

Option C: 2 peaks in both.

Option D: 3 in standard and 4 in chiral.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps each diol has more than one stereoisomer.

Wait, perhaps the diol from Reaction 1 is a single enantiomer (chiral), and the diol from Reaction 2 is a single meso compound.

But when the two are combined, the mixture has two compounds, each as a single stereoisomer.

So, on the achiral column, two peaks.

On the chiral column, the chiral diol would be a single peak (since it's an enantiomer). The meso diol is a single compound, so another peak. So, two peaks.

But that's not matching the options. Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers, but no, because each reaction produces only one enantiomer.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in thinking that both diols are diastereomers. Maybe they're actually enantiomers, which would change the HPLC behavior.

But no, that can't be right because the diols are on different carbons.

Wait, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers. So, for Reaction 1, the diol is chiral and has two enantiomers, but the reaction produces only one. Similarly for Reaction 2, the diol is meso, so a single compound.

So, the mixture would have: one enantiomer of the chiral diol and the meso diol.

On the achiral column, two peaks.

On the chiral column, the chiral diol would split into two peaks (enantiomers) but since only one is present, it would appear as one peak. The meso diol is a single peak. So, two peaks.

So, in that case, the answer would be C: 2 peaks in both.

But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)4 peaks in both

B)2 in standard, 3 in chiral

C)2 in both

D)3 in standard, 4 in chiral

So, if the answer is C, then 2 peaks in both columns.

But wait, another possibility arises: perhaps each reaction produces a pair of diastereomers. But I don't think so because the starting materials are E and Z, leading to specific epoxide and diol structures.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers, but no, the reaction is stereospecific and produces a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers. No, because the reaction is stereospecific, so each starting material leads to a single product.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of what the products are.

Each reaction produces a diol. The diols are diastereomers of each other.

In the mixture, there are two diastereomers. On an achiral column, these would be separated into two peaks. On a chiral column, each diastereomer is a pair of enantiomers? Or not.

Wait, no. Each diastereomer is a single compound. So on a chiral column, each would give a single peak because they are not enantiomers.

Wait, but wait. The diol from Reaction 1 is chiral and has two enantiomers. But the reaction only produces one enantiomer. Similarly, the diol from Reaction 2 is a meso compound, which is a single compound.

So, in the mixture, you have:

1. (R,R) diol (chiral, single enantiomer)
2. (R,S) diol (meso, single compound)

On the standard HPLC: two peaks.

On the chiral HPLC: the (R,R) would elute as one peak, and the (R,S) as another. So, two peaks.

So, the answer would be C: 2 peaks in both.

But let me look at the options again. Option C is 2 in both, which would be the case.

But wait, the options list C as 2 in both, which matches this scenario.

So the answer should be C.

The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. mCPBA is a stereospecific reagent that forms epoxides, and the geometry of the starting alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide leads to diols, where the stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide.

### Reaction Analysis:
1. **Reaction 1**:  
   - Starting with (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed is **trans** due to the stereospecific nature of mCPBA.  
   - Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the trans epoxide results in a **cis diol** (both hydroxyl groups on the same side of the carbon chain).  
   - This diol has two stereocenters with the same configuration (e.g., (R,R)) and is **chiral**.

2. **Reaction 2**:  
   - Starting with (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed is **cis** due to the stereospecific nature of mCPBA.  
   - Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the cis epoxide results in a **trans diol** (hydroxyl groups on opposite sides of the carbon chain).  
   - This diol has two stereocenters with opposite configurations (e.g., (R,S)) and is **achiral** (meso compound).

### Mixture Analysis:
- The products of the two reactions are combined, resulting in a mixture containing:
  1. A **chiral diol** (cis diol, (R,R)) from Reaction 1.  
  2. An **achiral diol** (trans diol, (R,S)) from Reaction 2.

### HPLC Analysis:
1. **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**:  
   - Diastereomers (the two diols) have different physical properties and are separated into **two distinct peaks**.  
   - The chiral diol and the meso diol are diastereomers and do not interfere with each other.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:  
   - The chiral diol is a single enantiomer and appears as **one peak**.  
   - The meso diol is achiral and appears as **one peak**.  
   - Thus, the chiral column also resolves the mixture into **two peaks**.

### Conclusion:
The mixture produces **two peaks** on both the standard and chiral HPLC columns. This corresponds to **Option C**.

ANSWER: C

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question involves two reactions with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The starting materials are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So, I think this is about epoxidation.

Epoxidation of alkenes typically forms an epoxide. But wait, the structure of the alkene must influence the product. Let me think about the geometry of the starting alkenes. (E)-oct-4-ene has the two higher priority groups on opposite sides, while (Z) has them on the same side.

When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide via an electrocyclic ring-opening mechanism. But wait, I'm a bit hazy on the details. Oh right, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a stereospecific way. For a trans (E) alkene, the epoxidation would lead to a specific configuration in the epoxide ring. Similarly, the cis (Z) alkene would form another epoxide.

Wait, but wait—epoxidation of E and Z alkenes: for an E (trans) double bond, the two substituents on each carbon are opposite. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are on opposite faces. Wait, no—epoxide formation is stereospecific, so the configuration of the alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide.

Another thought: When (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA, the epoxide formed will have a certain stereochemistry, maybe trans or cis. Similarly, the (Z)-oct-4-ene will form a different epoxide.

Wait, but wait—mCPBA adds to the double bond in a way that the peracid's oxygen adds to the same face. So the endo transition state leads to the formation of an epoxide where the two new oxygen atoms are on opposite sides (cis or trans?), but I'm getting a little confused.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms an epoxide where the substituents are adjacent in a certain way. Let me think of the structure. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle, but for (E), substituents on each end are opposite.

Wait, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2 between two CH2 groups. No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 with four carbons on each side? Wait, octane has eight carbons. So oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2 between carbons 4 and 5. Wait, no—actually, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait. Let me correct that. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 where the double bond is between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2, but actually, each end has two CH2 groups.

But perhaps I should imagine the molecule as CH2CH2 with substituents on either side. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents (like CH2CH2CH3 groups) on either end of the double bond are opposite each other, while in (Z), they are on the same side.

When mCPBA reacts with each, it forms an epoxide. Now, the question is, what products do each reaction form?

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide. Then aqueous acid. Wait, after epoxidation, what happens when acid is added? I thought that epoxides can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening. Oh wait, but the question says both reactions go to 100% completion. So after epoxidation, when acid is added, do they ring-open?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. When mCPBA is used, it forms an epoxide. Then, in acidic conditions, the epoxide usually undergoes ring-opening. So maybe each reaction forms an epoxide, which then opens in acid.

Wait, but mCPBA is usually used for epoxidation. So perhaps after that, the acid work-up causes something else. Alternatively, maybe the work-up isn't causing further reaction beyond isolating the epoxide. Hmm, but the question says that after mCPBA, aqueous acid is added, and both reactions go to completion. So perhaps the epoxide is further reacted.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The reaction conditions: mCPBA is used for epoxidation. Then, aqueous acid is added. For example, in some cases, the epoxide might protonate and then undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening. But wait, the problem states that the products are combined, so perhaps each reaction gives a mixture of diols.

Wait, no. Wait, when epoxides are treated with aqueous acid, they typically undergo ring-opening via acid catalysis. For example, the epoxide would protonate, then the ring opens in a way that depends on the structure. The ring-opening of epoxides under acidic conditions typically leads to the formation of diols, where the two hydroxyl groups add to the carbons in a trans fashion.

Wait, but wait, the ring-opening of epoxides in acid usually occurs via a two-step mechanism: the epoxide oxygen is protonated, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. Then, water (or another nucleophile) attacks the more substituted carbon, leading to the ring opening. The product is a diol with the hydroxyl groups added in a trans configuration relative to the former epoxide.

So, for each epoxide, when treated with acid (like aqueous H3O+), the epoxide opens to form a diol. Now, the stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide.

So, first, let's figure out what each starting alkene produces.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form an epoxide. Then, acid work-up gives a diol.

Similarly, Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide → diol.

Wait, but the starting alkenes are E and Z, so their epoxidation will form different epoxides. Then, the ring-opening will give different diols.

Wait, but what are the structures of the epoxides?

Let me imagine oct-4-ene as CH2CH2 between carbons 4 and 5. For (E), the substituents on either end (like CH2CH3 groups) are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds across the double bond, it forms an epoxide. The geometry of the epoxide will depend on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, I think that epoxidation of a trans (E) alkene leads to a trans epoxide? Or is it the other way around? Hmm. Let me think about the mechanism. The mCPBA reacts with the alkene in a concerted way, forming the epoxide. The addition is stereospecific, meaning that the configuration of the starting alkene influences the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to visualize. In the epoxidation, the two oxygen atoms are added across the double bond. For an E-alkene, the substituents on each end are opposite, so when the oxygen is added, the two new oxygen substituents will be on opposite sides of the epoxide ring.

Wait, but the epoxide is a three-membered ring, so the substituents on either end would be on the same face. Oh, wait, no. Let me get this right. When the double bond is E, the two higher priority groups (like the substituents on either end) are on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, the peracid's oxygen adds to each carbon in a way that the two oxygen atoms end up on the same face as the substituents, or opposite?

Hmm. Let me think of a simple example. Take propene, CH2=CH2CH3. If it's E (but wait, that's not possible for propene, but anyway), the substituents are opposite. After epoxidation, the oxygen atoms would be added across the double bond. But wait, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end of the double bond are on opposite sides. So, when mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds to each carbon from the same face, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide formed from (E) alkene is trans, and from (Z) is cis. Because for (Z), the substituents are on the same side, so when the oxygen adds, they'd be adjacent in the same face, leading to a cis epoxide.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the stereochemistry of epoxidation. Epoxidation generally leads to the formation of an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Because the reaction is stereospecific. So, the configuration of the alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, I think I need to look this up mentally: when an E-alkene reacts with mCPBA, the resulting epoxide is trans. Similarly, a Z-alkene would form a cis epoxide. Because the endo transition state leads to the addition of the oxygen atoms on the same face as the substituents. So, for an E-alkene, the substituents are opposite, so the oxygen atoms end up on opposite faces in the epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the opposite is true. Let me think again. When the alkene is E, the groups are opposite, and when the peracid attacks, the oxygen atoms are added on the same face. So, in the epoxide, the substituents (like the adjacent CH2 groups) would be on opposite sides, making the epoxide trans.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's imagine the (E) and (Z) alkenes.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents (like the two CH2CH2CH3 groups) on either end are on opposite sides of the double bond. When epoxidized, the two oxygen atoms are added across the double bond in a way that the new oxygen atoms are on the same face of the original double bond. So, for the (E) isomer, which has substituents opposite, the resulting epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms on the same face, leading to a trans configuration.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide's configuration is such that the substituents on each carbon are either cis or trans in the ring.

So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents (the adjacent CH2 groups) are on opposite sides. So when the epoxide forms, the two new oxygen substituents would be on the same face, leading to a trans epoxide.

Wait, I'm not entirely confident, but let's proceed with that assumption.

So, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (trans) → acid → diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (cis) → acid → diol.

Now, the acid work-up would cause the epoxide to open. So, each epoxide would form a diol. But the configuration of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide.

In acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon. Let's think about the epoxide structure.

The epoxide is a three-membered ring. For the (E) case, trans epoxide, and for the (Z) case, cis epoxide.

Wait, but in oct-4-ene, both ends are similar, so the epoxide would be symmetrical. So, the ring-opening would be the same on either side.

Wait, but let's think of the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of each epoxide.

For a trans epoxide (from (E) alkene), the ring-opening would proceed with the water attacking the more substituted carbon, but since the epoxide is symmetric, perhaps the diol that forms would have adjacent hydroxyl groups in a certain configuration.

Wait, no, the substituents on each carbon of the epoxide are the same, since it's oct-4-ene. So, each carbon in the epoxide has two CH2 groups attached. So, the epoxide is symmetrical.

So, when the epoxide is treated with acid, the protonation occurs on one of the oxygen atoms, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. The water attacks one carbon, leading to the formation of a carbocation (or a partial positive charge), and then the other oxygen attacks, leading to the diol.

Wait, but in the case of symmetric epoxides, like from (E) or (Z) alkenes, the diol formed would have the hydroxyl groups in a particular configuration.

Let me think of a specific example. Take cyclohexene oxide (epoxide). When opened under acidic conditions, the diol that forms has the hydroxyl groups trans to each other. Because the attack occurs on the less hindered carbon, leading to the trans addition.

Wait, but in a symmetrical epoxide, like from (E) or (Z) oct-4-ene, the diol formed would have the hydroxyl groups either both axial (but in a smaller molecule, perhaps) or in a trans configuration.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact stereochemistry. Let me think: when an epoxide opens in acidic conditions, the nucleophile (like water) attacks the more substituted carbon. Wait, no, in acidic conditions, the attack is on the less substituted carbon? Or does it depend on the structure?

Wait, no, wait. For asymmetric epoxides, the attack is typically on the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized (like less carbocation strain). But in a symmetric epoxide, like from (E) or (Z) oct-4-ene, both carbons are equally substituted, so either can be attacked. But since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol formed would be the same regardless of which carbon is attacked first.

Wait, but in that case, for the (E) epoxide, which is trans, the attack would proceed in a way that the hydroxyl groups are added in a certain configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps each epoxide, upon acid treatment, forms a diol with a specific stereochemistry.

So, in the case of the (E) epoxide, which is trans, the ring-opening under acid leads to a diol where the hydroxyl groups are on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans).

Wait, no, perhaps it's the opposite. Let me think again: the epoxide is a three-membered ring. When it's opened, the hydroxyl groups are added anti to each other. Because the ring opens with the nucleophile attacking from the opposite side of the leaving group.

Wait, in acid-catalyzed epoxide opening, the protonation occurs on the epoxide oxygen, making the adjacent carbons electrophilic. The nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon (in asymmetric cases), leading to a carbocation. Then, the other oxygen attacks from the opposite side, leading to the diol.

So, in a trans epoxide, the attack would lead to the diol having the hydroxyl groups in a trans configuration around the former epoxide carbons.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this mentally. For (E)-epoxide: the two oxygen atoms are on opposite faces of the ring. When water attacks, it comes from the opposite face of the protonated oxygen, leading to the diol's configuration.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of the diastereomers. So, the diol formed from the (E) epoxide would be trans, and the diol from the (Z) epoxide would be cis?

Wait, no, perhaps the opposite. Because in an epoxide, the two oxygen atoms are adjacent. When the epoxide is trans, the ring-opening would lead to a diol where the hydroxyl groups are on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans).

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the specific example of trans and cis epoxides.

For a trans epoxide: when the epoxide opens, the two hydroxyl groups end up on the same face, leading to a trans diol.

Wait, no, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think of the chair-like transition state. No, perhaps another approach.

In the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide, the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon. For symmetric epoxides, either attack is possible, but because of the ring's symmetry, the diol formed will be the same regardless.

Wait, but the stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide. Let me think of a specific example. Take cis-2,3-epoxybutane. When treated with acid, the epoxide opens to form a diol. The hydroxyl groups would add in a trans configuration across the former epoxide carbons because the ring opening leads to attack from the opposite side.

Wait, maybe that's the case. So, in the case of a cis epoxide (from Z-alkene), the diol formed would have the hydroxyl groups in a trans configuration. Similarly, a trans epoxide (from E-alkene) would form a diol with the hydroxyl groups in a cis configuration.

Wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because if the epoxide is cis, the attack would be from the same face, leading to the diol being trans.

Alternatively, perhaps when the epoxide is cis, the diol is trans, and when the epoxide is trans, the diol is cis.

Wait, that might make sense. So, for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide → ring-opening → diol with cis OH groups.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide → ring-opening → diol with trans OH groups.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me try to think of the mechanism again. When the epoxide is opened under acidic conditions, the water attacks the protonated epoxide oxygen. The attack occurs from the opposite side of the leaving group. So, for a cis epoxide, the attack would lead to the hydroxyl groups adding on opposite sides, leading to a trans diol.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the same for any epoxide. The diol formed will always be trans because the attack is from the opposite face.

Wait, wait, perhaps the diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's configuration because the starting epoxide has substituents arranged in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the diastereomers are formed based on the epoxide's structure. Let's imagine an epoxide where the substituents are on the same face (cis). When the ring opens, the diol's substituents would end up trans to each other. Whereas, if the substituents were on opposite faces (trans epoxide), ring-opening would lead to diol substituents being cis.

So, for Reaction 1: (E) → trans epoxide → diol (cis)
Reaction 2: (Z) → cis epoxide → diol (trans)

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the diol's configuration is the same as the epoxide's. Let me think again.

Wait, let's imagine a specific example. Take (E)-2-butene, which upon epoxidation with mCPBA forms a trans epoxide. Then, under acidic conditions, this epoxide would open to form a diol. What's the configuration of that diol?

Wait, but I can't recall exactly, so perhaps I should try to imagine the mechanism. The epoxide oxygen is protonated, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. Water attacks one carbon from the opposite side of the protonated oxygen. This leads to the ring opening, and the other oxygen attacks from the opposite side, leading to the diol.

Wait, perhaps the diol's configuration is such that the two hydroxyl groups are trans to each other. Because the attack occurs on opposite faces.

Wait, if the epoxide is trans, perhaps the diol's hydroxyl groups are also trans. Or perhaps it's the opposite.

Alternatively, maybe the diol's configuration is the same as the epoxide's. So, a trans epoxide leads to a trans diol, and a cis epoxide leads to a cis diol.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: when the epoxide is symmetric, the diol formed will have two possible configurations, but perhaps they are the same due to symmetry. For example, in the case of cyclohexene oxide opening under acid, the diol formed is trans-1,2-cyclohexanediol.

Wait, so in that case, the cis epoxide (from a cis-alkene) would lead to a trans diol.

So, perhaps, in general, regardless of the starting epoxide's configuration (cis or trans), the diol's hydroxyl groups are trans.

Wait, but that can't be right because Reaction 1 and 2 would then produce the same diol, which can't be correct because the question implies different products.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps each starting alkene leads to a different diol, which may or may not be enantiomers or diastereomers.

Wait, maybe each reaction leads to a different diastereomer. So, combining the products would give a mixture of diastereomers, which would then be analyzed on the HPLC columns.

Wait, but let's think about the products.

So, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide → acid → trans diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide → acid → cis diol.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the diol's configuration is the same as the epoxide's. Alternatively, perhaps the diol's configuration is the opposite.

Wait, another way: when the epoxide is trans, the diol would have the hydroxyl groups on the same face (cis) or opposite (trans). But if the epoxide is trans, then the diol's hydroxyl groups would be trans.

Wait, perhaps the diol is always trans, regardless of the epoxide's configuration. Because in the ring-opening mechanism, the hydroxyl groups are added in a trans fashion.

But then, both reactions would produce the same diol, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a different diastereomer. So, if the diol's configuration is determined by the epoxide's configuration, then Reaction 1 and 2 would produce different diastereomers.

Wait, but how many diastereomers are possible for the diol?

The diol is 4,5-diol in octane. So, the structure would be HOCH2CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait no, octane has eight carbons, so after the diol, there are three CH2 groups on each side of the diol.

Wait, the diol would be on carbons 4 and 5. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH(OH)CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, but the actual structure would be:

CH2CH2CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, but the configuration around the two OH groups would determine the diastereomerism.

If the OH groups are on the same side (cis), that's one diastereomer. If they're on opposite sides (trans), that's another.

But wait, if the epoxide is trans, the diol would have the OHs on the same side (cis), and if the epoxide is cis, the diol would have OHs on opposite sides (trans). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mechanism again. For a trans epoxide, the two oxygen atoms are on opposite faces. When the ring opens, the water attacks each carbon from the opposite face, leading to OH groups on the same face, making a cis diol.

Wait, that would mean:

Reaction 1: (E)-epoxide (trans) → diol (cis)
Reaction 2: (Z)-epoxide (cis) → diol (trans)

So, each reaction gives a different diol enantiomer? Or diastereomer?

Wait, but if the diols are enantiomers or diastereomers, that would affect how they appear on the HPLC columns.

Wait, but wait, the diols are on the same carbon chain. So, their structures are 4,5-diol each, but the stereochemistry around those two OH groups determines the diastereomerism.

So, each reaction produces a diol with a different configuration: one cis, one trans.

Wait, but wait, the diol from Reaction 1 is cis, and from Reaction 2 is trans.

Now, the chemist combines these two products. So, the mixture would contain both cis and trans diols.

Now, the question is about running this mixture on a standard (achiral) HPLC and a chiral HPLC column.

In an achiral column, diastereomers would have different retention times, whereas enantiomers would have the same retention time because they are not separated on an achiral column. But wait, wait—if the diols are diastereomers, they would be separated on an achiral column because they have different physical properties.

In a chiral column, diastereomers would still be separated if they are not mirror images. Enantiomers would be separated because the column can differentiate between them.

Wait, but in this case, the two diols are cis and trans, which are diastereomers, not enantiomers. So, on a chiral column, they would also be separated.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me think again.

Wait, after both reactions, the chemist combines the products. So, in the mixture, you have two diastereomers: the diol from (E) and the diol from (Z). Each diol is a single compound because each reaction went to completion.

Wait, but wait—wait a second. Let me think about the diols.

For Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (trans) → diol (cis). So the diol has both OH groups on the same side, making it a cis diol.

For Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (cis) → diol (trans). So the diol has OH groups on opposite sides, making it a trans diol.

In the mixture, you have both the cis and trans diols. Each is a diastereomer of the other.

Now, when running on a standard (achiral) HPLC column: each diastereomer would have a different retention time. So, two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC column: since the two diols are diastereomers, the column would also separate them, giving two peaks. Wait, but wait—maybe I'm mixing up. Chiral columns are used to separate enantiomers. Diastereomers are already separated on achiral columns. So, if the diols are diastereomers, they would show as two separate peaks on both the standard and chiral HPLC.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose the diol from Reaction 1 is a single enantiomer, and the diol from Reaction 2 is another diastereomer. Wait, but no, each diol is a single compound. So, the mixture would have two diastereomers, each of which would give a single peak on the HPLC.

So, on the standard HPLC, you'd see two peaks. On the chiral HPLC, you'd also see two peaks, because the two diastereomers are not mirror images of each other. Enantiomers would be separated on a chiral column, but diastereomers would also be separated if the column can differentiate them.

Wait, but another possibility: each diol could have multiple stereoisomers. Let me think. The diol is on two adjacent carbons, each with an OH group. So, each diol has two stereocenters. For the cis diol, the two OHs are on the same face, so their configurations are the same. For the trans diol, the OHs are on opposite faces, so their configurations are opposite.

Wait, perhaps the cis diol is a single diastereomer, and the trans diol is another. So, the mixture would have two distinct diastereomers, each of which would give a single peak on the HPLC.

So, on the standard column, two peaks. On the chiral column, two peaks as well.

Wait, but let me think of the number of possible stereoisomers.

The diol is 4,5-diol in octane. Each OH is on a separate carbon, so each is a stereocenter. So, for each diol, there are two stereocenters.

Wait, but in this case, the diols from each reaction would have specific configurations.

For example, the diol from Reaction 1 (cis) would have both OHs on the same face, say R and R, but perhaps that's not the case because the configuration depends on the starting alkene.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the diol from (E) would have the two OHs on the same face (cis), leading to a (R,R) configuration. The diol from (Z) would have the two OHs on opposite faces (trans), leading to (R,S) configuration.

Wait, but (R,S) is a meso compound, which is achiral. Oh, wait! Because if the two stereocenters are R and S, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound, meaning it's not chiral.

Wait, but in our case, the diol is 4,5-diol. The molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the two OHs are on opposite sides. Because the molecule would look the same when reflected across that plane.

So, the diol from Reaction 2 (trans) would be a meso compound, meaning it's not chiral. While the diol from Reaction 1 (cis) would have two stereocenters with the same configuration (R,R or S,S), making it chiral.

So, in the mixture, you have:

- From Reaction 1: a chiral diol (two stereocenters, same configuration → no plane of symmetry → chiral)
- From Reaction 2: a meso diol (two stereocenters, opposite configurations → has a plane of symmetry → achiral)

So, when running the mixture on an achiral HPLC column, both compounds would have different retention times because they are diastereomers. So, two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC column, the chiral diol would split into two peaks (enantiomers), but the meso compound is achiral and would appear as a single peak.

Wait, that's a possibility. So, the chiral diol (from Reaction 1) would have two enantiomers, but since Reaction 1 only produces one enantiomer, would it appear as a single peak? Or does the reaction lead to a racemic mixture?

Wait, no. The reaction with mCPBA is stereospecific. So, the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene leads to a single epoxide enantiomer, which upon ring-opening gives a single diol enantiomer. Similarly, the (Z)-epoxide leads to a single diol enantiomer, but in this case, it's a meso compound.

Wait, but no. Let me clarify. For Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene would form a single epoxide enantiomer, and upon ring-opening, would produce a single diol enantiomer. But wait, the diol from Reaction 1 has two stereocenters. If the diol is (R,R), that's a single enantiomer. But on an achiral column, it would be a single peak.

For Reaction 2, the (Z) epoxide would form a meso diol (after ring-opening), which is a single compound but achiral. So, on an achiral column, it would be a single peak as well.

Wait, but I'm getting confused again. Let me think.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide → diol (cis, but with both OH on same face → (R,R) or (S,S) configuration → chiral. So, one enantiomer.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide → diol (trans, leading to (R,S) configuration → meso, so achiral.

So, when the chemist combines the two products, the mixture contains:

1. (R,R)-diol (chiral)
2. (R,S)-diol (meso, achiral)

So, in the mixture, how many distinct compounds are present?

Two: one chiral and one meso.

Now, putting this mixture on the HPLC columns.

On a standard (achiral) HPLC column: each distinct compound would elute as a separate peak. So, two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC column: the chiral diol would be separated into two peaks (its enantiomers), but since Reaction 1 only produces one enantiomer, it would appear as a single peak. Wait, no—wait, if the diol is chiral, but the reaction only produces one enantiomer, then on a chiral column, it would elute as a single peak because it's a single enantiomer.

Wait, but wait. Reaction 1 produces (R,R) diol, which is a single enantiomer. On a chiral column, it would have a single peak. The meso diol (from Reaction 2) is achiral, so on a chiral column, it would also have a single peak.

Wait, but that would mean both compounds are resolved into two peaks on the chiral column as well. But the meso compound is a single compound, so it would give one peak. The chiral diol (from Reaction 1) is a single enantiomer, so it would give another peak. So, in total, two peaks on both columns.

Wait, but wait. The diol from Reaction 1 is chiral, and the diol from Reaction 2 is achiral.

So, on an achiral column, you have two compounds (different diastereomers), leading to two peaks.

On a chiral column, the chiral diol would split into two peaks (enantiomers), but if Reaction 1 only produces one enantiomer, it would appear as a single peak. Wait, no, because the chiral diol is a single enantiomer, so on a chiral column, it would still be a single peak. The meso diol is a single compound, so another peak. So, two peaks on both columns.

But that can't be right because the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Option C says 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Option D says 3 in standard and 4 in chiral.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the diol structures.

Wait, another angle: each reaction leads to a diol, but perhaps each diol can exist as multiple stereoisomers.

Wait, Reaction 1 produces a single diastereomer of the cis diol (two stereocenters with same configuration), which is chiral.

Reaction 2 produces a single diastereomer of the trans diol (two stereocenters with opposite configurations), which is meso and thus achiral.

So, the mixture has two compounds: one chiral diol and one meso diol.

On an achiral column, each compound is separated if they are different, which they are (different diastereomers). So, two peaks.

On a chiral column, the chiral diol would have two enantiomers, but since Reaction 1 only produces one, it would appear as a single peak. The meso diol is a single compound, so another peak. So, two peaks on both columns.

But wait, the question is about the products of both reactions being combined. So, each reaction gives one diol. If the diols are different, then on the HPLC columns, they would show as two peaks in each.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the diol from Reaction 1 is a pair of enantiomers. No, because the reaction is stereospecific and goes to completion, it would form a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps I should think that each reaction produces a diol that is a meso compound or a chiral compound.

For Reaction 1: (E) → trans epoxide → diol (cis) → two stereocenters same → chiral.

For Reaction 2: (Z) → cis epoxide → diol (trans) → two stereocenters opposite → meso.

So, when the products are combined, the mixture contains: (R,R) diol (chiral) and (R,S) diol (meso). So, two different compounds.

On an achiral column, both would have different retention times, so two peaks.

On a chiral column, the (R,R) diol is chiral, so it would appear as a single peak (since it's a single enantiomer), and the (R,S) diol is a single compound, so another peak. So, again, two peaks on both columns.

But looking at the options, option C is 2 peaks in both columns. But the option says "the products of both reactions" are combined. So, each product is a single compound. So, when combined, you have two compounds, each with their own peaks on both columns.

Wait, but wait, perhaps each reaction produces more than one product. Let me think again.

In Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide → ring-opening → diol (cis)

In Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide → ring-opening → diol (trans)

Each reaction produces a single diol.

But wait, perhaps each reaction leads to more than one diastereomer. No, because the reaction is stereospecific and goes to completion.

So, the mixture has two diastereomeric diols, each of which is a single compound.

In the HPLC, on an achiral column, each diastereomer would elute as a separate peak (2 peaks).

On a chiral column, the chiral diol (from Reaction 1) would be a single peak, and the meso diol (from Reaction 2) would be a single peak. So, again, two peaks on both columns.

But that's not matching any options. Let's look at the options again.

Option C: 2 peaks in both.

Option D: 3 in standard and 4 in chiral.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps each diol has more than one stereoisomer.

Wait, perhaps the diol from Reaction 1 is a single enantiomer (chiral), and the diol from Reaction 2 is a single meso compound.

But when the two are combined, the mixture has two compounds, each as a single stereoisomer.

So, on the achiral column, two peaks.

On the chiral column, the chiral diol would be a single peak (since it's an enantiomer). The meso diol is a single compound, so another peak. So, two peaks.

But that's not matching the options. Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers, but no, because each reaction produces only one enantiomer.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in thinking that both diols are diastereomers. Maybe they're actually enantiomers, which would change the HPLC behavior.

But no, that can't be right because the diols are on different carbons.

Wait, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers. So, for Reaction 1, the diol is chiral and has two enantiomers, but the reaction produces only one. Similarly for Reaction 2, the diol is meso, so a single compound.

So, the mixture would have: one enantiomer of the chiral diol and the meso diol.

On the achiral column, two peaks.

On the chiral column, the chiral diol would split into two peaks (enantiomers) but since only one is present, it would appear as one peak. The meso diol is a single peak. So, two peaks.

So, in that case, the answer would be C: 2 peaks in both.

But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)4 peaks in both

B)2 in standard, 3 in chiral

C)2 in both

D)3 in standard, 4 in chiral

So, if the answer is C, then 2 peaks in both columns.

But wait, another possibility arises: perhaps each reaction produces a pair of diastereomers. But I don't think so because the starting materials are E and Z, leading to specific epoxide and diol structures.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers, but no, the reaction is stereospecific and produces a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers. No, because the reaction is stereospecific, so each starting material leads to a single product.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of what the products are.

Each reaction produces a diol. The diols are diastereomers of each other.

In the mixture, there are two diastereomers. On an achiral column, these would be separated into two peaks. On a chiral column, each diastereomer is a pair of enantiomers? Or not.

Wait, no. Each diastereomer is a single compound. So on a chiral column, each would give a single peak because they are not enantiomers.

Wait, but wait. The diol from Reaction 1 is chiral and has two enantiomers. But the reaction only produces one enantiomer. Similarly, the diol from Reaction 2 is a meso compound, which is a single compound.

So, in the mixture, you have:

1. (R,R) diol (chiral, single enantiomer)
2. (R,S) diol (meso, single compound)

On the standard HPLC: two peaks.

On the chiral HPLC: the (R,R) would elute as one peak, and the (R,S) as another. So, two peaks.

So, the answer would be C: 2 peaks in both.

But let me look at the options again. Option C is 2 in both, which would be the case.

But wait, the options list C as 2 in both, which matches this scenario.

So the answer should be C.


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. mCPBA is a stereospecific reagent that forms epoxides, and the geometry of the starting alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide leads to diols, where the stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide.

### Reaction Analysis:
1. **Reaction 1**:  
   - Starting with (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed is **trans** due to the stereospecific nature of mCPBA.  
   - Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the trans epoxide results in a **cis diol** (both hydroxyl groups on the same side of the carbon chain).  
   - This diol has two stereocenters with the same configuration (e.g., (R,R)) and is **chiral**.

2. **Reaction 2**:  
   - Starting with (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed is **cis** due to the stereospecific nature of mCPBA.  
   - Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the cis epoxide results in a **trans diol** (hydroxyl groups on opposite sides of the carbon chain).  
   - This diol has two stereocenters with opposite configurations (e.g., (R,S)) and is **achiral** (meso compound).

### Mixture Analysis:
- The products of the two reactions are combined, resulting in a mixture containing:
  1. A **chiral diol** (cis diol, (R,R)) from Reaction 1.  
  2. An **achiral diol** (trans diol, (R,S)) from Reaction 2.

### HPLC Analysis:
1. **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**:  
   - Diastereomers (the two diols) have different physical properties and are separated into **two distinct peaks**.  
   - The chiral diol and the meso diol are diastereomers and do not interfere with each other.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:  
   - The chiral diol is a single enantiomer and appears as **one peak**.  
   - The meso diol is achiral and appears as **one peak**.  
   - Thus, the chiral column also resolves the mixture into **two peaks**.

### Conclusion:
The mixture produces **two peaks** on both the standard and chiral HPLC columns. This corresponds to **Option C**.
