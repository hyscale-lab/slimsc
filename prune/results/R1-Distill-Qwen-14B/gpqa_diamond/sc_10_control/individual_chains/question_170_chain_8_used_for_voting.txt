Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Alright, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I think that notation means it's a two-component vector, like a column vector. So the state vector χ would be [3i; 4], right? Or maybe [4; 3i]? Wait, wait, the way it's written, (3i, 4), so in order, the first component is 3i, the second is 4. So the state vector is χ = [3i; 4]. But wait, sometimes in these problems, it's written as a row vector, but probably it's a column vector. I'll proceed with that.

The question asks for the expectation value of S_y, which is the spin operator along the y-axis. I remember that for spin-½ particles, the spin operators are given in terms of the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, yeah, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) * σ, where σ is the Pauli matrix.

So the Pauli matrix σ_y is given as:

[0  -i]
[i   0]

So then, the operator S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The expectation value of S_y is given by the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = χ† S_y χ. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the expectation value is ⟨S_y⟩ = <ψ| S_y |ψ>, where |ψ> is the state vector. Since χ is the state, I think it's a column vector. So the bra vector is the conjugate transpose of χ.

So first, I need to compute χ†, which is the conjugate transpose of χ. χ is [3i; 4], so χ† would be [ -3 , 4 ], because the conjugate of 3i is -3, and 4 is real, so it stays the same. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3i is the first component. So when you take the conjugate, 3i becomes -3i. But wait, as a row vector, it's the conjugate of each component. So χ is a column vector with first element 3i and second 4. So χ† is a row vector [ -3i*, 4* ] which would be [ -3i* is -3i*, wait, 3i is (0 + 3i), so the conjugate is (0 - 3i) = -3i. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the conjugate of 3i is -3i, correct. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, to compute S_y χ. Let me compute that. Let me represent S_y as (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrix:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So, S_y χ would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix product of σ_y and χ.

Let me compute σ_y * χ:

σ_y is:
0  -i
i   0

χ is [3i; 4]

So the product σ_y * χ is a new column vector. Let's compute each component.

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*(3i) + 0 = 3i². Since i² is -1, that's 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y * χ is [ -4i; -3 ]

Then, multiply by (ħ/2):

S_y χ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, the expectation value is χ† multiplied by S_y χ.

So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So, χ† (S_y χ) = [ -3i, 4 ] * [ (-4i)(ħ/2), (-3)(ħ/2) ]

Wait a second, let me make sure I get the dimensions right. Let me write S_y χ as (ħ/2) times [ -4i; -3 ].

So the multiplication is:

[ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ].

Which equals (ħ/2) * [ (-3i)(-4i) + 4*(-3) ].

Let's compute each term.

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i². i² is -1, so this is 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

So sum is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Multiply by (ħ/2):

(ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24/2) ħ = -12 ħ.

Wait, that can't be right. Because looking at the options, the answer options have fractions with denominator 25. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial state vector. Wait, the state was given as (3i,4). So as a column vector, χ is [3i; 4]. So when I compute σ_y * χ, let me re-calculate that.

σ_y is:
Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

So:

First component of σ_y χ: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*(3i) = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y χ is [ -4i; -3 ].

Then, S_y χ is (ħ/2) times that vector: [ -4i (ħ/2), -3 (ħ/2) ].

Now, χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So χ† times S_y χ is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ (-4i)(ħ/2), (-3)(ħ/2) ].

So the dot product is (-3i)*(-4i)*(ħ/2) + 4*(-3)*(ħ/2).

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12. Multiply by ħ/2: (-12)*(ħ/2) = -6ħ.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12. Multiply by ħ/2: (-12)*(ħ/2) = -6ħ.

So total is (-6ħ) + (-6ħ) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options given. The options have denominators 25 and others. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the state vector. Let me check the notation again. The state is (3i,4). So as a column vector, it's [3i; 4]. But perhaps the state is given as a row vector, so maybe χ is [3i,4], and χ† is [3i*,4*] which would be [ -3i, 4 ] as a column, but maybe I should adjust for that.

Wait, no, the expectation value formula is <S_y> = χ† S_y χ. So yes, I think that's correct.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in χ†. Let me re-examine that.

χ is [3i; 4]. So χ† is the conjugate transpose, so [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, but when I compute χ† S_y χ, I get -12 ħ, but the options have fractions like 25. So perhaps the state vector is not normalized. Oh wait, wait, perhaps I should normalize the state vector first.

Because the expectation value formula requires the state to be normalized, so that χ† χ = 1. Let me check if χ is normalized.

Compute χ† χ: [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [3i; 4 ].

So (-3i)*(3i) + 4*4.

(-3i)(3i) = -9 i² = -9*(-1) = 9.

4*4 = 16.

So total is 9 +16 =25. So the norm is 25. So the state is not normalized. So to get the correct expectation value, I should normalize the state.

So the normalized state is χ_normalized = (1/5) [3i;4], because sqrt(25) is 5.

So the expectation value is computed using χ_normalized† S_y χ_normalized.

So let me re-calculate using the normalized state.

χ_normalized = (1/5) [3i; 4].

χ_normalized† = (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ].

So, compute S_y χ_normalized.

S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i,0]].

So, S_y χ_normalized = (ħ/2) * σ_y * χ_normalized.

Which is (ħ/2) * (1/5) * σ_y [3i;4].

As before, σ_y [3i;4] is [ -4i; -3 ].

So, S_y χ_normalized = (ħ/2)(1/5) [ -4i; -3 ] = (ħ/(10)) [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, compute χ_normalized† S_y χ_normalized.

χ_normalized† is (1/5)[ -3i, 4 ].

So, χ_normalized† S_y χ_normalized = (1/5)[ -3i, 4 ] * (ħ/(10)) [ -4i; -3 ].

Wait, no, because S_y χ_normalized is (ħ/(10)) [ -4i; -3 ], so the multiplication is:

(1/5) [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by (ħ/(10)) [ -4i; -3 ].

So the scalar product is (1/5)(ħ/10) [ (-3i)(-4i) + 4*(-3) ].

Compute each term:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

Sum: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Multiply by (1/5)(ħ/10): (1/5)(1/10) ) * (-24) ħ = (1/50)(-24) ħ = (-24/50) ħ = (-12/25) ħ.

So the expectation value is (-12 ħ)/25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ /25. So that's the answer.

Wait, did I make a miscalculation earlier? Because the initial state wasn't normalized, and that's where I went wrong. Oh right, I forgot to normalize the state vector before computing the expectation value, which is crucial. So I need to normalize it first, which I did, and that's why the denominator became 25.

So the correct expectation value is -12 ħ /25, which is option A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( \langle S_y \rangle \), for an electron in the spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator along the y-direction is given by \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Thus, \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \).

2. **State Vector Normalization**: The given state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \) is not normalized. The norm is:
   \[
   \chi^\dagger \chi = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(3i) + 4(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]
   The normalized state is:
   \[
   \chi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Compute \( S_y \chi_{\text{normalized}} \)**: Using \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), we calculate:
   \[
   S_y \chi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \chi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{5} \sigma_y \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Applying \( \sigma_y \) to \( \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \):
   \[
   \sigma_y \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   S_y \chi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{10} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger S_y \chi_{\text{normalized}} \)**: The conjugate transpose of \( \chi_{\text{normalized}} \) is:
   \[
   \chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   The expectation value is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger S_y \chi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{10} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Compute the dot product:
   \[
   (-3i)(-4i) + 4(-3) = 12i^2 - 12 = 12(-1) - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24.
   \]
   Multiply by \( \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{10} \):
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{10} \cdot (-24) = \frac{-24}{50} \hbar = \frac{-12}{25} \hbar.
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( \langle S_y \rangle = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to option **A**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Alright, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I think that notation means it's a two-component vector, like a column vector. So the state vector χ would be [3i; 4], right? Or maybe [4; 3i]? Wait, wait, the way it's written, (3i, 4), so in order, the first component is 3i, the second is 4. So the state vector is χ = [3i; 4]. But wait, sometimes in these problems, it's written as a row vector, but probably it's a column vector. I'll proceed with that.

The question asks for the expectation value of S_y, which is the spin operator along the y-axis. I remember that for spin-½ particles, the spin operators are given in terms of the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, yeah, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) * σ, where σ is the Pauli matrix.

So the Pauli matrix σ_y is given as:

[0  -i]
[i   0]

So then, the operator S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The expectation value of S_y is given by the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = χ† S_y χ. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the expectation value is ⟨S_y⟩ = <ψ| S_y |ψ>, where |ψ> is the state vector. Since χ is the state, I think it's a column vector. So the bra vector is the conjugate transpose of χ.

So first, I need to compute χ†, which is the conjugate transpose of χ. χ is [3i; 4], so χ† would be [ -3 , 4 ], because the conjugate of 3i is -3, and 4 is real, so it stays the same. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3i is the first component. So when you take the conjugate, 3i becomes -3i. But wait, as a row vector, it's the conjugate of each component. So χ is a column vector with first element 3i and second 4. So χ† is a row vector [ -3i*, 4* ] which would be [ -3i* is -3i*, wait, 3i is (0 + 3i), so the conjugate is (0 - 3i) = -3i. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the conjugate of 3i is -3i, correct. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, to compute S_y χ. Let me compute that. Let me represent S_y as (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrix:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So, S_y χ would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix product of σ_y and χ.

Let me compute σ_y * χ:

σ_y is:
0  -i
i   0

χ is [3i; 4]

So the product σ_y * χ is a new column vector. Let's compute each component.

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*(3i) + 0 = 3i². Since i² is -1, that's 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y * χ is [ -4i; -3 ]

Then, multiply by (ħ/2):

S_y χ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, the expectation value is χ† multiplied by S_y χ.

So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So, χ† (S_y χ) = [ -3i, 4 ] * [ (-4i)(ħ/2), (-3)(ħ/2) ]

Wait a second, let me make sure I get the dimensions right. Let me write S_y χ as (ħ/2) times [ -4i; -3 ].

So the multiplication is:

[ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ].

Which equals (ħ/2) * [ (-3i)(-4i) + 4*(-3) ].

Let's compute each term.

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i². i² is -1, so this is 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

So sum is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Multiply by (ħ/2):

(ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24/2) ħ = -12 ħ.

Wait, that can't be right. Because looking at the options, the answer options have fractions with denominator 25. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial state vector. Wait, the state was given as (3i,4). So as a column vector, χ is [3i; 4]. So when I compute σ_y * χ, let me re-calculate that.

σ_y is:
Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

So:

First component of σ_y χ: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*(3i) = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y χ is [ -4i; -3 ].

Then, S_y χ is (ħ/2) times that vector: [ -4i (ħ/2), -3 (ħ/2) ].

Now, χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So χ† times S_y χ is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ (-4i)(ħ/2), (-3)(ħ/2) ].

So the dot product is (-3i)*(-4i)*(ħ/2) + 4*(-3)*(ħ/2).

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12. Multiply by ħ/2: (-12)*(ħ/2) = -6ħ.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12. Multiply by ħ/2: (-12)*(ħ/2) = -6ħ.

So total is (-6ħ) + (-6ħ) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options given. The options have denominators 25 and others. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the state vector. Let me check the notation again. The state is (3i,4). So as a column vector, it's [3i; 4]. But perhaps the state is given as a row vector, so maybe χ is [3i,4], and χ† is [3i*,4*] which would be [ -3i, 4 ] as a column, but maybe I should adjust for that.

Wait, no, the expectation value formula is <S_y> = χ† S_y χ. So yes, I think that's correct.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in χ†. Let me re-examine that.

χ is [3i; 4]. So χ† is the conjugate transpose, so [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, but when I compute χ† S_y χ, I get -12 ħ, but the options have fractions like 25. So perhaps the state vector is not normalized. Oh wait, wait, perhaps I should normalize the state vector first.

Because the expectation value formula requires the state to be normalized, so that χ† χ = 1. Let me check if χ is normalized.

Compute χ† χ: [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [3i; 4 ].

So (-3i)*(3i) + 4*4.

(-3i)(3i) = -9 i² = -9*(-1) = 9.

4*4 = 16.

So total is 9 +16 =25. So the norm is 25. So the state is not normalized. So to get the correct expectation value, I should normalize the state.

So the normalized state is χ_normalized = (1/5) [3i;4], because sqrt(25) is 5.

So the expectation value is computed using χ_normalized† S_y χ_normalized.

So let me re-calculate using the normalized state.

χ_normalized = (1/5) [3i; 4].

χ_normalized† = (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ].

So, compute S_y χ_normalized.

S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i,0]].

So, S_y χ_normalized = (ħ/2) * σ_y * χ_normalized.

Which is (ħ/2) * (1/5) * σ_y [3i;4].

As before, σ_y [3i;4] is [ -4i; -3 ].

So, S_y χ_normalized = (ħ/2)(1/5) [ -4i; -3 ] = (ħ/(10)) [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, compute χ_normalized† S_y χ_normalized.

χ_normalized† is (1/5)[ -3i, 4 ].

So, χ_normalized† S_y χ_normalized = (1/5)[ -3i, 4 ] * (ħ/(10)) [ -4i; -3 ].

Wait, no, because S_y χ_normalized is (ħ/(10)) [ -4i; -3 ], so the multiplication is:

(1/5) [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by (ħ/(10)) [ -4i; -3 ].

So the scalar product is (1/5)(ħ/10) [ (-3i)(-4i) + 4*(-3) ].

Compute each term:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

Sum: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Multiply by (1/5)(ħ/10): (1/5)(1/10) ) * (-24) ħ = (1/50)(-24) ħ = (-24/50) ħ = (-12/25) ħ.

So the expectation value is (-12 ħ)/25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ /25. So that's the answer.

Wait, did I make a miscalculation earlier? Because the initial state wasn't normalized, and that's where I went wrong. Oh right, I forgot to normalize the state vector before computing the expectation value, which is crucial. So I need to normalize it first, which I did, and that's why the denominator became 25.

So the correct expectation value is -12 ħ /25, which is option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( \langle S_y \rangle \), for an electron in the spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator along the y-direction is given by \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Thus, \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \).

2. **State Vector Normalization**: The given state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \) is not normalized. The norm is:
   \[
   \chi^\dagger \chi = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(3i) + 4(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]
   The normalized state is:
   \[
   \chi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Compute \( S_y \chi_{\text{normalized}} \)**: Using \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), we calculate:
   \[
   S_y \chi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \chi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{5} \sigma_y \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Applying \( \sigma_y \) to \( \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \):
   \[
   \sigma_y \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   S_y \chi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{10} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger S_y \chi_{\text{normalized}} \)**: The conjugate transpose of \( \chi_{\text{normalized}} \) is:
   \[
   \chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   The expectation value is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger S_y \chi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{10} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Compute the dot product:
   \[
   (-3i)(-4i) + 4(-3) = 12i^2 - 12 = 12(-1) - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24.
   \]
   Multiply by \( \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{10} \):
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{10} \cdot (-24) = \frac{-24}{50} \hbar = \frac{-12}{25} \hbar.
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( \langle S_y \rangle = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to option **A**.

Answer: A
