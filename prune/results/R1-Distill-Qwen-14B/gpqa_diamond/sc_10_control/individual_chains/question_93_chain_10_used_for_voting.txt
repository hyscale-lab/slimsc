Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Hmm... let's think through it step by step.

The question is about a scientist making a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and ran three technical replicates at each dilution. The efficiency is 100%, R2 is 1, and the slope is -3.3. So his data looks pretty good on the surface because a slope of -3.3 is typical for a good qPCR curve, and R² of 1 means it's a perfect fit.

Looking at his results, the Ct values are going down as the concentration increases, which makes sense because higher concentrations should reach the threshold sooner. For example, 100,000 copies have a Ct around 34, and 10 copies have a Ct around 20.7. That seems logical.

Wait, but the question is about discrepancies in his results. So where could the problem be? The options are A to D.

Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. But that's not true because qPCR is a standard method for quantification, especially with a calibration curve. So A is probably not the right answer.

Option B says Ct values don't agree with the target amount. But looking at the data, each dilution step (10x) changes the Ct by about 3.3 cycles. Let me calculate: Each 10-fold dilution should change Ct by log2(10)*slope. Wait, the slope is -3.3. Normally, the slope is calculated as -3.322 for a 10-fold dilution (because log2(10) is about 3.3219). So a slope of -3.3 is almost spot on. That suggests that each 10x dilution leads to a ~3.3 Ct increase. So the Ct values are consistent with the target amounts. So B might not be the issue.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, ten-fold would usually correspond to about 3.3 cycles. So if the slope is -3.3, that's exactly what's expected. The Ct values change about 3.3 cycles per 10-fold dilution. So why is C an option? Oh wait, maybe the scientist's data shows a deviation from that. Let me check the data.

Looking at 100,000: Ct is around 34.2 (average of 33.9,34.2,34.5)
10,000: Ct ~30.9
1,000: Ct ~27.6
100: Ct ~24.3
10: Ct ~21.

So between 100,000 and 10,000, the Ct increases by about 3.3 (34.2-30.9=3.3). Similarly, each step up is about 3.3. So that's correct. So C says ten-fold is more than 3.3 cycles, but here it's spot on, so maybe C isn't the issue.

Option D: Deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. Let's look at the triplicates:

At 100000: 33.9,34.2,34.5. The differences are 0.3 between each. So the maximum deviation is 0.6 (between 33.9 and 34.5). Hmm, but is that within acceptable limits? I think in qPCR, you usually expect the Ct values of technical replicates to be within 0.5 cycles of each other. So a deviation of up to 0.5 is acceptable. So 0.6 would be a bit high, but I'm not sure if that's what's being pointed out here.

Wait the question is about discrepancies in his results. If the technical replicates have a high deviation, that could indicate a problem with the assay. For instance, if the replicates vary a lot, the calibration curve might not be reliable. But looking at the data, the maximum deviation between the first and third replicate is 0.6 (34.5 -33.9=0.6). That's about 0.6, which is more than the 0.3 stated in option D.

Wait, but in the question, it's asking which explains the discrepancies in his results. So if technical replicates have a deviation over 0.3, that's a problem. So in the data, each set of triplicates has a max deviation of 0.6 (like 34.5 -33.9=0.6), which is more than 0.3. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

But wait, the options say "the deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates". So the scientist's results have that, which is a problem. So the discrepancy in his results (maybe meaning the curve not being reliable) is due to high variability in technical replicates.

Wait another thing: The efficiency is 100%—which is perfect, but in reality, it's impossible because you can't have 100% efficiency. But the question says it was 100%, so maybe that's not the issue here.

So looking back, the question is why are there discrepancies in his results. The most likely reason is that the technical replicates have high variability, more than 0.3 cycles. So the answer would be D.

The question involves analyzing discrepancies in a scientist's qPCR results while creating a calibration curve. The scientist used a positive control with known copy numbers, ran three technical replicates at each dilution, and obtained a qPCR efficiency of 100%, an R² of 1, and a slope of -3.3. The Ct values decreased as the concentration of the target nucleic acid increased, which aligns with expectations. However, the question focuses on identifying the reason for discrepancies in the results.

**Option A** suggests that qPCR cannot quantify nucleic acids. This is incorrect because qPCR is a standard method for quantification, especially when a calibration curve is used. Therefore, A is not the correct answer.

**Option B** states that Ct values do not align with the amount of target nucleic acid. However, the Ct values decrease consistently with increasing concentration, and the slope of -3.3 corresponds to the expected change for a 10-fold dilution (log₂(10) ≈ 3.322). Thus, the Ct values are consistent with the target amounts, making B unlikely to be correct.

**Option C** claims that a 10-fold dilution corresponds to more than 3.3 cycles. This is not the case here, as the slope of -3.3 indicates that a 10-fold dilution results in a Ct change of approximately 3.3 cycles, which is expected. Therefore, C is also incorrect.

**Option D** highlights that the deviation between technical replicates exceeds 0.3 cycles. Examining the data, the maximum deviation between technical replicates at each concentration is 0.6 cycles (e.g., between 33.9 and 34.5 at 100,000 copies/µl). This deviation is greater than 0.3 cycles, which is considered acceptable in qPCR. The high variability in technical replicates could explain discrepancies in the results, making D the correct answer.

**Conclusion**: The discrepancies in the scientist's results are most likely due to the high variability between technical replicates, with deviations exceeding 0.3 cycles.
