Okay, so I need to figure out how many loops are in the Feynman diagram based on the given expression. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but I remember that the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order in perturbation theory. Each loop typically introduces factors of certain constants and energy scales.

The expression given is α³ * g² * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4π)^6 * (Q/M)². Let me break this down. I know that α is the fine-structure constant, approximately 1/137, and g is a coupling constant, maybe like the strong or weak coupling. The 4π terms often come from loop integrals in dimensional regularization or other methods. The (Q/M) term looks like a ratio of energy scales, perhaps where Q is the momentum and M is a mass scale, like a renormalization scale.

In terms of loop counts, each loop contributes a factor of (something)/(16π²) or similar, depending on the regularization method. Wait, more precisely, each loop brings in a factor of (4π)^{-d}, where d is the spacetime dimension. Oh, wait, but in 4 dimensions, each loop might bring in a (4π)^{-2} factor because of the integral over the loop momentum. Or wait, maybe each loop brings a 1/(16π²) factor, since 4π squared is 16π².

Looking at the denominator, it's (4π)^6. Let me see: (4π)^6 is (4π)^{2*3}, which would mean three loops if each contributes a (4π)^2. Because each loop would contribute a 1/(4π)^2 factor. So three loops would give (1/(4π^2))^3 = 1/(4π)^6, which matches the denominator.

Wait, but let's make sure. Each loop integral in four dimensions (using dimensional regularization, say) might give a 1/(ε) term with ε being small, but when you regularize, you often get a factor of (4π)^{d/2} or something similar. Alternatively, in terms of Feynman parameters, each loop brings a 1/(16π²) when you evaluate the integral. Because 16 is 4 squared, so each loop contributes a 1/(4π)^2 factor. So three loops would give (1/(4π)^2)^3 = 1/(4π)^6, which is exactly what we have here.

So the denominator (4π)^6 comes from three loops. Let me check the numerator factors. The other terms: α^3, g^2, sqrt(2), 8. These are probably from the vertices and propagators. Alpha is proportional to the square of the coupling, so α = e^2/(4π), so having α^3 would imply a certain number of vertices. But the question isn't about the number of vertices, just loops.

So putting it all together, the (4π)^6 in the denominator suggests three loops. So the answer should be D) 3.

To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, we analyze the given expression: 

\[
\alpha^3 \cdot g^2 \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot 8 \cdot \frac{1}{(4\pi)^6} \cdot \left(\frac{Q}{M}\right)^2.
\]

The key factor to focus on is the denominator \((4\pi)^6\). In quantum field theory, each loop typically contributes a factor of \((4\pi)^{-2}\) to the amplitude. Therefore, the presence of \((4\pi)^6\) in the denominator indicates that there are three loops, as \((4\pi)^6 = \left((4\pi)^2\right)^3\). This matches the structure of the expression.

The other terms in the numerator, such as \(\alpha^3\), \(g^2\), \(\sqrt{2}\), and \(8\), are related to the vertices and propagators in the diagram but do not directly affect the loop count. Similarly, the \(\left(\frac{Q}{M}\right)^2\) term represents a ratio of energy scales and does not influence the number of loops.

Thus, based on the \((4\pi)^6\) factor, the diagram contains three loops.
