Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Hmm, di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester?) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the compound has both a carbonyl and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

Wait, the total number of carbons is 8. The aromatic ring is a benzene ring, which has 6 carbons. So the substituents must contribute 2 more carbons. Oh wait, wait. No, wait. The molecule as a whole has 8 carbons. So the benzene ring is 6 carbons, and the substituents add 2 more. So each substituent adds one carbon each? Or maybe one substituent adds two carbons and the other adds nothing? No, di-substituted means two substituents. So each substituent could be something like a -Cl or -CH2 group, but wait, if each substituent is a single carbon, that would add 2 carbons to the 6, making 8. Oh wait, but wait, substituents can be more complex.

Wait, but let's think about the functional groups. The FTIR has a carbonyl group. So one of the substituents is probably a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or something else. The other substituent is a halogen, since there's an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but wait. Let me get this right. The aromatic ring has two substituents, one is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halide. But wait, a halide as a substituent would be something like -Cl, -Br, etc., which are single atoms, so they don't contribute any carbons. So the carbonyl group would have to contribute the remaining 2 carbons beyond the benzene's 6. Wait, that would mean the carbonyl substituent has 2 carbons attached. So perhaps it's an acyl group, like an acetyl group (-COCH3). Wait, but that's two carbons: the CO (carbonyl) and the methyl group. So the substituent is -COCH3 (acetyl group). And the other substituent is a halogen, say -Cl or -Br.

So the structure would be benzene with two substituents: one acetyl group and one halogen. So the molecule is something like para-substituted with an acetyl and a halogen, or maybe meta or ortho. But the substituents would be in positions that are either para, meta, or ortho.

Wait, but the substituents would be in positions that affect the NMR. Let's think about how the substituents affect the aromatic protons. If the two substituents are in the para position, then the ring would have a certain symmetry. If they're in the ortho or meta positions, the symmetry would be different.

But the question is about the 1H NMR data. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). The 9.9 ppm is a sharp singlet, maybe an aldehyde proton. But wait, if it's a carbonyl group, could it be an aldehyde (-CHO)? But wait, the substituent is attached to the ring, so if it's an aldehyde, that would be a -CHO group. That would add 1 carbon (the aldehyde) and the ring has 6, making 7. But wait, the total is 8 carbons. So maybe another substituent. Wait, but the substituents are two, each adding one group. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituents could be a -COCH2- group, but that would add more than 8 carbons. Wait, maybe the substituent is a -COOR group, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a -COCH3 and a -X (halide). Let's count the carbons: benzene (6) + COCH3 (2) + X (0) → total 8. That works.

So the structure would be benzene with an acetyl group (-COCH3) and a halide (-X). So, where would the substituents be? Considering the NMR, if the substituents are opposite each other (para), the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern. But let's think about each option.

Option A: Peaks at 9.9 (singlet, 1H). High ppm, that's probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, but if the substituent is an acetyl group, the aldehyde would have a proton, but an acetyl is -COCH3, which doesn't have a proton adjacent to the carbonyl. So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but that wouldn't have a proton. Wait, perhaps it's a nitrile? No, nitrile doesn't have a carbonyl in IR (but CN has a strong peak). Wait, the IR has a carbonyl group, so maybe it's a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.

Wait, but the substituent could be an acetyl group (-COCH3). So the aldehyde scenario doesn't fit because acetyl doesn't have an aldehyde proton. So maybe that's incorrect.

In Option A, the 9.9 ppm is a singlet. Another possibility is an aromatic proton that's deshielded due to substituents. Wait, but an aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the substituent is an aldehyde. But then the substituent would be -CHO, which is 1 carbon. Then the ring has 6, substituents: -CHO (1) and -X (0). So total 7 carbons. But the question says 8. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -COCH2- group. But that would require more carbons. Let me think again.

Wait another approach: the total number of carbons in the molecule is 8. The benzene ring is 6 carbons. So substituents contribute 2 carbons. So each substituent should have one carbon each. But one substituent is a halogen (like Cl), which is 0 carbons, so the other substituent must be a group with two carbons. So substituents would be -X (like Cl) and a group with two carbons, like -COCH3 (acetyl group). So that fits.

So structure: benzene ring with -COCH3 and -X (Cl, Br, etc.) as substituents.

Now, the substituents are attached to the ring. Let's think about the possible positions. If they're para, then the ring would have two substituents opposite each other, leading to certain NMR signals.

In the case of para-substituted benzaldehyde (but that's not the case here), the aromatic protons would be as a pair of doublets. But in this case, the substituents are -COCH3 and -X.

Wait, the NMR would show the aromatic protons. Let's think about that. If the substituents are in the para position, the ring would have two substituents opposite each other, so the aromatic protons would be in two sets: the two protons ortho to one substituent would be equivalent, and the other two ortho to the other substituent would be equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, with substituents in the para position.

Wait, but the substituents would be -COCH3 and -X. If they're para, then the ring would have symmetry. So the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets.

Wait, the substituents are in the para positions, so the aromatic protons would be in such a way that they are split into two sets of doublets. Let me think: Each substituent is para, so the ring would have two substituents opposite each other. So the aromatic protons would be two sets of two protons each, each set as a doublet.

Wait, but in para-substituted benzene, the substituents are in positions 1 and 4. The protons in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those in positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So, they would each form a doublet.

Wait, let me recall: in para-substituted benzene rings with two substituents (like p-xylene), the ring protons split into two sets. Each set has two equivalent protons, each as a doublet.

So in the NMR, the aromatic region would have two doublets: one at higher ppm and one at lower. The higher ppm would be closer to the electron-withdrawing group (like -COCH3), which deshields the protons, leading to higher ppm. The -X substituent (like Cl) is electron-withdrawing as well, but maybe less so than the acetyl group.

Wait, but wait: the substituent -COCH3 is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the adjacent protons, causing them to appear downfield. The Cl substituent is also electron-withdrawing, but perhaps less so than the acetyl. So the protons adjacent to the acetyl would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than those adjacent to Cl.

So the aromatic protons would show up as two doublets: one at higher ppm (say, around 7.8-8.0 ppm) and another at lower ppm (say, 7.5-7.7 ppm). But looking at the options:

Option A: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). That fits. So the two doublets with 2H each, which would match the para-substituted scenario.

But what about the other peaks in option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s). That's a singlet. Where would that come from? Maybe an aldehyde proton. But earlier I thought that the substituent is -COCH3, which doesn't have an aldehyde proton. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because the substituent is -COCH3, but another possibility is that one substituent is an aldehyde and the other is a halide, but that would require an additional carbon.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the substituent scenario.

If the substituents are -CHO (which is 1 carbon) and -X (0), the total would be 6 + 1 + 0 = 7 carbons. But the question says 8. So that can't be.

So the substituent must be a group with two carbons. So the substituent is -COCH3 (acetyl group).

So then, the aromatic ring has substituents at para positions: one -COCH3 and one -X (like Cl).

So the aromatic protons would be in two doublets, as per option A. But where's the 9.9 ppm peak?

Wait, perhaps the acetyl group is attached as a ketone, which has a carbonyl but no adjacent protons. The 9.9 ppm could be an aldehyde proton, but that would require a different substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CO- group. No, that would complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methyl ketone, but that doesn't introduce a new proton. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about each option.

Option C: Peaks at 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 ppm is likely a methyl group attached to something electronegative, like a carbonyl. So that's the acetyl group, -COCH3.

So in option C, there are two doublets in the aromatic region, each 2H, which would fit a para substitution. The 2.3 (3H, s) would be the methyl group of the acetyl. But where's the halogen?

Wait, but the substituents are -COCH3 and -X. So in option C, the NMR only shows the acetyl methyl group. But the halogen substituent would be on the ring, which perhaps doesn't have protons attached. So the aromatic signals would be as two doublets, and the methyl from the acetyl. But where is the halogen in the NMR? Halogens don't show up in proton NMR, so that's okay. So option C has those signals. But what about the other options?

Option A has an extra peak at 9.9 ppm. If the substituent is a -CHO group (which would require 7 carbons total, which is not the case), that peak would make sense. But since the substituent is -COCH3, that peak isn't part of the structure, so option A's data wouldn't fit.

Option C: The aromatic protons are two doublets, which matches the para substitution. The 2.3 ppm (s, 3H) is the methyl from the acetyl. So that fits. But where is the halogen in the structure? The halogen would be another substituent on the ring, but it doesn't contribute to the proton NMR. So the NMR would show the aromatic protons and the acetyl methyl.

But wait, in option C, would the aromatic protons be split into two doublets? Let's think: if the substituents are para, then the two substituents are across from each other. So the ring would have four aromatic protons: two next to the acetyl and two next to the halogen. These would each be equivalent and split as doublets. So, in the NMR, we'd see two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So option C has that. But wait, the integration in option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). That adds up to 4H, which matches the benzene ring (since two substituents, so four H left). So yes.

But wait, what about the other substituents? The acetyl group would have a methyl group (3H, singlet at ~2.3 ppm). So option C includes that.

So the structure would be para-substituted benzaldehyde? No, wait. No, substituents are -COCH3 and -X (like Cl). So the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions, each being an electron-withdrawing group.

So then, in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, and the acetyl's methyl group as a singlet. That's what option C shows. So option C could be the correct one.

But wait, the FTIR also shows the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituent must include a halogen.

So in option C, the substituent is -COCH3 and the other substituent is -X (like Cl). So the NMR wouldn't show any signals from the Cl, but the aromatic protons would split into doublets as observed.

So that would make option C a possibility.

Wait, but looking at option A again: 9.9 ppm (1H, s). If that's an aldehyde proton, but that would mean substituent is -CHO, which only adds one carbon. That can't be because the total is 8, so benzene (6) + CHO (1) + X (0) = 7. So it's not possible. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

Option D: Peaks at 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 ppm is a singlet, which could be an aromatic proton. The 4.8 and 4.6 are for two sets of two H each, as doublets. That might suggest a structure with substituents that have neighboring protons, like perhaps a -OCH2CH2O- group, but that doesn't fit with the carbonyl and halogen substituents.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are a carbonyl group and an -OCH2CH3 group. But that's not a halogen substituent.

Option B: Peaks at 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). This looks like a di-substituted ethylene group, perhaps a -OCH2CH2O- or something similar. Maybe a vinyl group, but not sure how that would fit with the carbonyl and halogen.

Wait, but the presence of a carbonyl group in the FTIR would mean a substituent with a carbonyl, like acetyl.

So, going back to the options, option C seems to fit the scenario.

Wait, but what about the substituent being a -COCH2Cl group? No, that would add more carbons and complicate the structure.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COCl group, but that would not fit because Cl is part of the carbonyl and the substituent would be a single group, not two. So that's probably not.

Wait, the question says the compound is di-substituted. So two substituents on the benzene ring. Each substituent is either a carbonyl group or a halogen. But no, the substituents themselves could be groups that include both. Wait, no. The FTIR shows a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

So substituent 1: -COCH3 (2 carbons)
Substituent 2: -X (Cl, Br; 0 carbons)

So total carbons: 6 + 2 + 0 = 8. Perfect.

So, in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be two doublets (each 2H) and the acetyl's methyl as a singlet.

So looking at option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). That exactly matches. So option C would be the correct NMR.

Wait, but wait another thing: the substituent is -COCH3 and -X. The -X (like Cl) is in para position to the acetyl. So the aromatic protons adjacent to Cl would be more shielded than those adjacent to the acetyl. So the higher ppm (7.8) would be the protons next to the acetyl (more deshielded), and the lower ppm (7.6) would be next to Cl (less deshielded).

Thus, the NMR would show the two doublets as described in option C. So option C is the correct one.

But wait, another thought: the substituent could be a nitro group, but that's not a carbonyl. So it's not applicable here.

Wait, the FTIR also shows a peak for an aromatic-halogen bond, so the substituent is definitely a halogen. So the substituents are -COCH3 and -X. Therefore, the NMR would have aromatic doublets and the acetyl's methyl.

So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound in question is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. This implies that the substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen (-X, such as -Cl or -Br). The total number of carbons in the molecule is 8, so the benzene ring (6 carbons) plus the substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. Therefore, the carbonyl-containing group must contribute 2 carbons, which fits the structure of an acetyl group (-COCH₃).

The substituents are likely in the para position relative to each other, as this arrangement provides the necessary symmetry to split the aromatic protons into two sets of doublets in the NMR spectrum. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is electron-withdrawing and deshields the adjacent aromatic protons, causing them to appear at a higher chemical shift (around 7.8 ppm). The halogen (-X) is also electron-withdrawing but less so than the acetyl group, leading to the adjacent aromatic protons appearing at a slightly lower chemical shift (around 7.6 ppm). The methyl group of the acetyl (-CH₃) appears as a singlet at around 2.3 ppm.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes a peak at 9.9 ppm (1H, s), which suggests an aldehyde proton. However, the substituent is -COCH₃, not -CHO, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Shows peaks characteristic of a di-substituted ethylene group, which does not fit the structure of the compound.
- **Option C**: Matches the expected NMR signals for a para-substituted benzene with -COCH₃ and -X. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H), and the methyl group of the acetyl appears as a singlet at 2.3 ppm. This is consistent with the structure.
- **Option D**: Includes signals that suggest a different substitution pattern or functional groups, which do not match the compound described.

Thus, the correct NMR data for the compound is provided in **Option C**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Hmm, di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester?) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the compound has both a carbonyl and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

Wait, the total number of carbons is 8. The aromatic ring is a benzene ring, which has 6 carbons. So the substituents must contribute 2 more carbons. Oh wait, wait. No, wait. The molecule as a whole has 8 carbons. So the benzene ring is 6 carbons, and the substituents add 2 more. So each substituent adds one carbon each? Or maybe one substituent adds two carbons and the other adds nothing? No, di-substituted means two substituents. So each substituent could be something like a -Cl or -CH2 group, but wait, if each substituent is a single carbon, that would add 2 carbons to the 6, making 8. Oh wait, but wait, substituents can be more complex.

Wait, but let's think about the functional groups. The FTIR has a carbonyl group. So one of the substituents is probably a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or something else. The other substituent is a halogen, since there's an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but wait. Let me get this right. The aromatic ring has two substituents, one is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halide. But wait, a halide as a substituent would be something like -Cl, -Br, etc., which are single atoms, so they don't contribute any carbons. So the carbonyl group would have to contribute the remaining 2 carbons beyond the benzene's 6. Wait, that would mean the carbonyl substituent has 2 carbons attached. So perhaps it's an acyl group, like an acetyl group (-COCH3). Wait, but that's two carbons: the CO (carbonyl) and the methyl group. So the substituent is -COCH3 (acetyl group). And the other substituent is a halogen, say -Cl or -Br.

So the structure would be benzene with two substituents: one acetyl group and one halogen. So the molecule is something like para-substituted with an acetyl and a halogen, or maybe meta or ortho. But the substituents would be in positions that are either para, meta, or ortho.

Wait, but the substituents would be in positions that affect the NMR. Let's think about how the substituents affect the aromatic protons. If the two substituents are in the para position, then the ring would have a certain symmetry. If they're in the ortho or meta positions, the symmetry would be different.

But the question is about the 1H NMR data. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). The 9.9 ppm is a sharp singlet, maybe an aldehyde proton. But wait, if it's a carbonyl group, could it be an aldehyde (-CHO)? But wait, the substituent is attached to the ring, so if it's an aldehyde, that would be a -CHO group. That would add 1 carbon (the aldehyde) and the ring has 6, making 7. But wait, the total is 8 carbons. So maybe another substituent. Wait, but the substituents are two, each adding one group. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituents could be a -COCH2- group, but that would add more than 8 carbons. Wait, maybe the substituent is a -COOR group, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a -COCH3 and a -X (halide). Let's count the carbons: benzene (6) + COCH3 (2) + X (0) → total 8. That works.

So the structure would be benzene with an acetyl group (-COCH3) and a halide (-X). So, where would the substituents be? Considering the NMR, if the substituents are opposite each other (para), the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern. But let's think about each option.

Option A: Peaks at 9.9 (singlet, 1H). High ppm, that's probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, but if the substituent is an acetyl group, the aldehyde would have a proton, but an acetyl is -COCH3, which doesn't have a proton adjacent to the carbonyl. So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but that wouldn't have a proton. Wait, perhaps it's a nitrile? No, nitrile doesn't have a carbonyl in IR (but CN has a strong peak). Wait, the IR has a carbonyl group, so maybe it's a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.

Wait, but the substituent could be an acetyl group (-COCH3). So the aldehyde scenario doesn't fit because acetyl doesn't have an aldehyde proton. So maybe that's incorrect.

In Option A, the 9.9 ppm is a singlet. Another possibility is an aromatic proton that's deshielded due to substituents. Wait, but an aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the substituent is an aldehyde. But then the substituent would be -CHO, which is 1 carbon. Then the ring has 6, substituents: -CHO (1) and -X (0). So total 7 carbons. But the question says 8. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -COCH2- group. But that would require more carbons. Let me think again.

Wait another approach: the total number of carbons in the molecule is 8. The benzene ring is 6 carbons. So substituents contribute 2 carbons. So each substituent should have one carbon each. But one substituent is a halogen (like Cl), which is 0 carbons, so the other substituent must be a group with two carbons. So substituents would be -X (like Cl) and a group with two carbons, like -COCH3 (acetyl group). So that fits.

So structure: benzene ring with -COCH3 and -X (Cl, Br, etc.) as substituents.

Now, the substituents are attached to the ring. Let's think about the possible positions. If they're para, then the ring would have two substituents opposite each other, leading to certain NMR signals.

In the case of para-substituted benzaldehyde (but that's not the case here), the aromatic protons would be as a pair of doublets. But in this case, the substituents are -COCH3 and -X.

Wait, the NMR would show the aromatic protons. Let's think about that. If the substituents are in the para position, the ring would have two substituents opposite each other, so the aromatic protons would be in two sets: the two protons ortho to one substituent would be equivalent, and the other two ortho to the other substituent would be equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, with substituents in the para position.

Wait, but the substituents would be -COCH3 and -X. If they're para, then the ring would have symmetry. So the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets.

Wait, the substituents are in the para positions, so the aromatic protons would be in such a way that they are split into two sets of doublets. Let me think: Each substituent is para, so the ring would have two substituents opposite each other. So the aromatic protons would be two sets of two protons each, each set as a doublet.

Wait, but in para-substituted benzene, the substituents are in positions 1 and 4. The protons in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those in positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So, they would each form a doublet.

Wait, let me recall: in para-substituted benzene rings with two substituents (like p-xylene), the ring protons split into two sets. Each set has two equivalent protons, each as a doublet.

So in the NMR, the aromatic region would have two doublets: one at higher ppm and one at lower. The higher ppm would be closer to the electron-withdrawing group (like -COCH3), which deshields the protons, leading to higher ppm. The -X substituent (like Cl) is electron-withdrawing as well, but maybe less so than the acetyl group.

Wait, but wait: the substituent -COCH3 is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the adjacent protons, causing them to appear downfield. The Cl substituent is also electron-withdrawing, but perhaps less so than the acetyl. So the protons adjacent to the acetyl would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than those adjacent to Cl.

So the aromatic protons would show up as two doublets: one at higher ppm (say, around 7.8-8.0 ppm) and another at lower ppm (say, 7.5-7.7 ppm). But looking at the options:

Option A: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). That fits. So the two doublets with 2H each, which would match the para-substituted scenario.

But what about the other peaks in option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s). That's a singlet. Where would that come from? Maybe an aldehyde proton. But earlier I thought that the substituent is -COCH3, which doesn't have an aldehyde proton. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because the substituent is -COCH3, but another possibility is that one substituent is an aldehyde and the other is a halide, but that would require an additional carbon.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the substituent scenario.

If the substituents are -CHO (which is 1 carbon) and -X (0), the total would be 6 + 1 + 0 = 7 carbons. But the question says 8. So that can't be.

So the substituent must be a group with two carbons. So the substituent is -COCH3 (acetyl group).

So then, the aromatic ring has substituents at para positions: one -COCH3 and one -X (like Cl).

So the aromatic protons would be in two doublets, as per option A. But where's the 9.9 ppm peak?

Wait, perhaps the acetyl group is attached as a ketone, which has a carbonyl but no adjacent protons. The 9.9 ppm could be an aldehyde proton, but that would require a different substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CO- group. No, that would complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methyl ketone, but that doesn't introduce a new proton. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about each option.

Option C: Peaks at 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 ppm is likely a methyl group attached to something electronegative, like a carbonyl. So that's the acetyl group, -COCH3.

So in option C, there are two doublets in the aromatic region, each 2H, which would fit a para substitution. The 2.3 (3H, s) would be the methyl group of the acetyl. But where's the halogen?

Wait, but the substituents are -COCH3 and -X. So in option C, the NMR only shows the acetyl methyl group. But the halogen substituent would be on the ring, which perhaps doesn't have protons attached. So the aromatic signals would be as two doublets, and the methyl from the acetyl. But where is the halogen in the NMR? Halogens don't show up in proton NMR, so that's okay. So option C has those signals. But what about the other options?

Option A has an extra peak at 9.9 ppm. If the substituent is a -CHO group (which would require 7 carbons total, which is not the case), that peak would make sense. But since the substituent is -COCH3, that peak isn't part of the structure, so option A's data wouldn't fit.

Option C: The aromatic protons are two doublets, which matches the para substitution. The 2.3 ppm (s, 3H) is the methyl from the acetyl. So that fits. But where is the halogen in the structure? The halogen would be another substituent on the ring, but it doesn't contribute to the proton NMR. So the NMR would show the aromatic protons and the acetyl methyl.

But wait, in option C, would the aromatic protons be split into two doublets? Let's think: if the substituents are para, then the two substituents are across from each other. So the ring would have four aromatic protons: two next to the acetyl and two next to the halogen. These would each be equivalent and split as doublets. So, in the NMR, we'd see two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So option C has that. But wait, the integration in option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). That adds up to 4H, which matches the benzene ring (since two substituents, so four H left). So yes.

But wait, what about the other substituents? The acetyl group would have a methyl group (3H, singlet at ~2.3 ppm). So option C includes that.

So the structure would be para-substituted benzaldehyde? No, wait. No, substituents are -COCH3 and -X (like Cl). So the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions, each being an electron-withdrawing group.

So then, in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, and the acetyl's methyl group as a singlet. That's what option C shows. So option C could be the correct one.

But wait, the FTIR also shows the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituent must include a halogen.

So in option C, the substituent is -COCH3 and the other substituent is -X (like Cl). So the NMR wouldn't show any signals from the Cl, but the aromatic protons would split into doublets as observed.

So that would make option C a possibility.

Wait, but looking at option A again: 9.9 ppm (1H, s). If that's an aldehyde proton, but that would mean substituent is -CHO, which only adds one carbon. That can't be because the total is 8, so benzene (6) + CHO (1) + X (0) = 7. So it's not possible. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

Option D: Peaks at 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 ppm is a singlet, which could be an aromatic proton. The 4.8 and 4.6 are for two sets of two H each, as doublets. That might suggest a structure with substituents that have neighboring protons, like perhaps a -OCH2CH2O- group, but that doesn't fit with the carbonyl and halogen substituents.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are a carbonyl group and an -OCH2CH3 group. But that's not a halogen substituent.

Option B: Peaks at 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). This looks like a di-substituted ethylene group, perhaps a -OCH2CH2O- or something similar. Maybe a vinyl group, but not sure how that would fit with the carbonyl and halogen.

Wait, but the presence of a carbonyl group in the FTIR would mean a substituent with a carbonyl, like acetyl.

So, going back to the options, option C seems to fit the scenario.

Wait, but what about the substituent being a -COCH2Cl group? No, that would add more carbons and complicate the structure.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COCl group, but that would not fit because Cl is part of the carbonyl and the substituent would be a single group, not two. So that's probably not.

Wait, the question says the compound is di-substituted. So two substituents on the benzene ring. Each substituent is either a carbonyl group or a halogen. But no, the substituents themselves could be groups that include both. Wait, no. The FTIR shows a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

So substituent 1: -COCH3 (2 carbons)
Substituent 2: -X (Cl, Br; 0 carbons)

So total carbons: 6 + 2 + 0 = 8. Perfect.

So, in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be two doublets (each 2H) and the acetyl's methyl as a singlet.

So looking at option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). That exactly matches. So option C would be the correct NMR.

Wait, but wait another thing: the substituent is -COCH3 and -X. The -X (like Cl) is in para position to the acetyl. So the aromatic protons adjacent to Cl would be more shielded than those adjacent to the acetyl. So the higher ppm (7.8) would be the protons next to the acetyl (more deshielded), and the lower ppm (7.6) would be next to Cl (less deshielded).

Thus, the NMR would show the two doublets as described in option C. So option C is the correct one.

But wait, another thought: the substituent could be a nitro group, but that's not a carbonyl. So it's not applicable here.

Wait, the FTIR also shows a peak for an aromatic-halogen bond, so the substituent is definitely a halogen. So the substituents are -COCH3 and -X. Therefore, the NMR would have aromatic doublets and the acetyl's methyl.

So the correct answer is option C.


The compound in question is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. This implies that the substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen (-X, such as -Cl or -Br). The total number of carbons in the molecule is 8, so the benzene ring (6 carbons) plus the substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. Therefore, the carbonyl-containing group must contribute 2 carbons, which fits the structure of an acetyl group (-COCH₃).

The substituents are likely in the para position relative to each other, as this arrangement provides the necessary symmetry to split the aromatic protons into two sets of doublets in the NMR spectrum. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is electron-withdrawing and deshields the adjacent aromatic protons, causing them to appear at a higher chemical shift (around 7.8 ppm). The halogen (-X) is also electron-withdrawing but less so than the acetyl group, leading to the adjacent aromatic protons appearing at a slightly lower chemical shift (around 7.6 ppm). The methyl group of the acetyl (-CH₃) appears as a singlet at around 2.3 ppm.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes a peak at 9.9 ppm (1H, s), which suggests an aldehyde proton. However, the substituent is -COCH₃, not -CHO, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Shows peaks characteristic of a di-substituted ethylene group, which does not fit the structure of the compound.
- **Option C**: Matches the expected NMR signals for a para-substituted benzene with -COCH₃ and -X. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H), and the methyl group of the acetyl appears as a singlet at 2.3 ppm. This is consistent with the structure.
- **Option D**: Includes signals that suggest a different substitution pattern or functional groups, which do not match the compound described.

Thus, the correct NMR data for the compound is provided in **Option C**.
