Okay, let's try to figure out this question. So, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm, I need to think about how to synthesize that from benzene. Let me break down the structure.

The molecule has a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromine, and position 5 has a nitro group. Also, there's an ethanone group attached. Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, right? So the ketone is on the benzene ring. So the structure is acetophenone with substituents at the 3 and 5 positions.

Wait, but how are these substituents arranged? Oh, benzene is symmetric, so 3 and 5 are meta to each other. So, the substituents need to be introduced in such a way that they end up in the correct positions relative to the ketone.

So, benzene needs to undergo a series of substitutions. Let's think about the steps.

First, benzene is likely to undergo a nitration and then a bromination, but the order and the directing groups matter. Wait, when you introduce a nitro group, it's a meta director. If the first substitution is nitration, the nitro group is a meta director, so the next group would go meta to it. But then, when you introduce the ketone, which is also a meta director, you have to make sure the bromine and nitro groups end up in the right spots.

Alternatively, maybe we start by introducing the ketone. Because once the ketone is attached, it's a strong meta director. So, the order in which substituents are added would determine their positions.

Wait, the target molecule has nitro and bromine groups. Let me imagine the benzene ring. The ketone is on position 1. Then, nitro is on 5 and bromine on 3. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is in position 3, but I think that would complicate the numbering. Wait, no. Let me draw a benzene ring with the ketone at position 1. Then, the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions. So, 3-bromo, 5-nitro.

Wait, but how do we get the substituents in those positions? Let's think about the directing effects.

The ketone (acetophenone) is a meta director. So substituents after would go into the meta positions relative to it. But if we have multiple substituents, their directing effects will depend on which is more activating or deactivating.

Wait, nitro groups are meta directors and deactivating. Bromine is an ortho/para director but deactivating as well. So, the order in which we introduce substituents will determine where they go.

Wait, the target is 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. Let's think about the substituents on the benzene ring. The acetophenone is at position 1, nitro at 5, bromine at 3. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5, which are meta to each other. Hmm, but how to get them there.

Alternatively, maybe the acetophenone is introduced after the nitro and bromine. Wait, no, because the ketone is part of the ring structure. So probably, the ketone is attached first, then the nitro and bromine are added in the right positions.

Wait, but when you have a benzene ring with substituents, each new substitution is directed by the existing substituents. So, perhaps the first substitution is nitration, then bromination, then introducing the ketone, but that might not work. Or perhaps the ketone is introduced early on.

Wait, maybe the steps are: first, nitration to add nitro. Then, then bromination in a position directed by nitro. Then, introduce the ketone.

Wait, but let's think in the context of the options given. Each option has a sequence of steps. The options are A, B, C, D.

Looking at the options, each has a series of steps, including nitration, bromination, some reactions with HCl, Fe, NaNO2, H3PO2, and acetylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3.

Hmm. Let's think about the possibility of using the acetylation as the first step.

Wait, acetylation is typically done via Friedel-Crafts acylation. So, benzene can react with CH3COCl in presence of AlCl3 to form acetophenone.

Wait, but if first we acetylate benzene, then the acetophenone is a meta director. So the next substituents would go into the meta positions relative to the ketone.

So, let's say step i is acetylation: benzene → acetophenone.

Then, the next step would be nitration. Since the ketone is meta director, nitration would occur at the meta position, position 3. But wait, acetophenone has the ketone at position 1. So the nitro group would go at position 3, and another substituent would go at position 5. Wait, but how?

Wait no, acetophenone is a monosubstituted benzene. So after acetylation, the next substituents would be directed by the ketone.

So, if the second step is nitration, the nitro group would go into the meta position relative to the ketone, which is position 3. Then, the third substituent would have to go into position 5.

Wait, but wait, nitro is a strong deactivating group, so it directs meta. So, if we have acetophenone, then add nitro at position 3, then bromination would be next.

But wait, the target has bromine at position 3 and nitro at 5. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused about the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration and bromination happen before the acetylation. Let me think.

If we first nitrate benzene, then brominate, then acetylate. But wait, nitration is a meta director. So benzene with nitro at position 1. Then, bromination would add Br in the meta position, position 3 or 5? Wait, benzene is symmetric, but let's say the nitro is at position 1. Then, bromination would add Br at position 3 (meta to nitro), or perhaps another position.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director, so the next substituent would go to the meta position. So, after nitration, bromination would add Br at position 3. Then, acetylation would add the ketone. Wait, but where?

In benzene with nitro at 1 and Br at 3, the next substitution (acetylation) would be directed by the most powerful group. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So the acetylation would occur at position 5 (meta to nitro). So the structure would be 5-acetyl-1-nitro-3-bromobenzene. Wait, but the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the positions again. Let me number the benzene ring. Let's imagine the acetophenone is at position 1. Then, the nitro is at 5, and bromine at 3. So, in this case, acetophenone is position 1, nitro 5 (meta to acetophenone), and bromine 3 (meta to acetophenone). But wait, how can that happen.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to perform the acetylation first, which will place the ketone at position 1. Then, nitration would add nitro at position 3 (meta to ketone). Then, bromination would occur where? Since nitro is a meta director, but it's already in position 3. Wait, the next substituent would be directed by the nitro group. So, bromine would go to position 5 (meta to nitro, which is at 3), which is also meta to the ketone. So, perhaps that's the way.

Let me outline:

1. Acetylate benzene to make acetophenone. Ketone is at 1. Structure: Ph-CO-CH3.

2. Nitration: add nitro at meta position, position 3.

3. Bromination: where? Nitro group (position 3) is a meta director, so bromine would go to position 6 (if the ring is numbered with ketone at 1, and nitro at 3, then the next meta position for nitro is 6. But wait, our target has nitro at 5 and bromine at 3. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the correct order is nitration first. Let's try that.

1. Nitration of benzene: benzene → nitrobenzene. Nitro at position 1.

2. Bromination: since nitro is meta director, Br would add at position 3.

3. Then, acetylation: the most activating group is nitro? No, nitro is deactivating. So, the most activated position would be where? In nitrobenzene, Br is at 3. Now, the ring has nitro at 1 and Br at 3.

Wait, when you have multiple substituents, the next substitution is directed by the most powerful director. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta director. Br is deactivating, but ortho/para director. So, which one is more influential? The nitro group is more deactivating, so the next substituent would be directed by nitro.

So, acetylation would occur meta to nitro, which is position 5. So, that would place the ketone at position 5.

But the target has the ketone at position 1, right? Because it's 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the ketone is directly attached at position 1, and the other substituents are at 3 and 5.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the synthesis needs to arrange the substituents in such a way that the ketone is in position 1, with nitro at 5 and Br at 3.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the steps needed to place each group correctly.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a nitro group, bromine, and a ketone. The ketone is a meta director. So, after the ketone is attached, the next substituents would go into the meta positions relative to the ketone.

Wait, but the nitro and bromine are both in the meta positions relative to the ketone. So, when the ketone is first introduced, the next steps would add the nitro and bromine in meta positions. But wait, nitro and bromine are both meta directors. Hmm, but they are added via different reactions.

Wait, maybe the order is nitration first (to add nitro at meta to ketone), then bromination, but wait, the ketone hasn't been added yet.

Hmm, perhaps the sequence is as follows:

First, introduce the nitro group.

Then, introduce the bromine.

Then, introduce the ketone.

Wait, but that's tricky because the ketone is a strong meta director. Let me think.

But wait, if I nitrate benzene first, then brominate, then acetylate. Let me see.

1. Nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene (nitro at 1).

2. Bromination of nitrobenzene: since nitro is meta director, Br adds at 3 or 5. Let's say 3.

3. Acetylation: since nitro is a meta director, the ketone would add at the position meta to nitro, which is position 5. So, the structure would be 5-acetyl-1-nitro-3-bromobenzene. Wait, but that's acetophenone at position 5, which is probably not the case we want. The target has the ketone in position 1.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is acetylation first.

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone (position 1).

2. Nitration: adds nitro at position 3 (meta to ketone).

3. Bromination: nitro is meta director, so Br would add at position 5 (meta to nitro, but that's the same as position 5 relative to the ketone, which is already position 1. Wait, acetophenone is at 1, nitro at 3. Then, adding Br, which is directed by nitro which is at 3. So, Br would go to position 6 (meta to nitro) or position 5 (para to nitro). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, in acetophenone, the ketone is at 1. Nitro group is added at 3 (meta to ketone). Now, for bromination, which substituent directs? Since nitro is a strong deactivating group, it would direct the next substituent to its meta position. So, the nitro is at 3, so its meta positions are 6 and 6 is not possible because benzene only has six positions. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, acetophenone is at position 1. Nitration adds nitro at position 3 (meta to ketone). Now, nitro is at 3. The next substitution (bromination) would be directed by nitro, which is a meta director. So, the bromine could go to position 6 (meta to nitro at 3). But that would make the substituents at 3 (nitro) and 6 (Br). Wait, but the target has nitro at 5 and Br at 3. So that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the order. Let's try another approach.

What if the ketone is introduced after nitro and bromine?

But how? Because acetylation (Friedel-Crafts) requires an activating group. Benzene is not very reactive. Wait, but nitro is deactivating, making the ring less reactive. So Friedel-Crafts might not work if nitro is present.

Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation requires activating groups. If the ring has strong deactivating groups, the reaction may not proceed. So, perhaps the ketone must be introduced before any deactivating groups.

So, acetylation must come first. So the first step is acetylation.

So, the sequence starts with i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetophenone.

Next, nitration. Nitro group is added at position 3 (meta to ketone).

Then, bromination. Now, the ring has acetophenone (position 1), nitro (position 3), and needs bromine at position 5.

Wait, but bromination after nitration would be directed by nitro.

So, nitro is at position 3. So, bromine would go to position 6 (meta to nitro) or position 5 (ortho to nitro? No, nitro is deactivating, so para would be position 6).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me imagine the acetophenone at position 1. Nitro is at 3, which is meta to 1. Now, when we brominate, the directing is by nitro, which is position 3. So, bromine would go to position 6 (meta to nitro at 3).

But the target has bromine at position 3 and nitro at 5. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options to see which sequence would lead to the correct substituents.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) acetylation, ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iv) Fe/HCl, v) HNO3/H2SO4, vi) NaNO2/HCl, vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me see:

After acetylation (i), then bromination (ii) would add Br at meta to acetophenone (position 3). Then nitration (iii) would add nitro at position 5 (meta to Br, but wait, Br is ortho/para director but deactivating. So, nitration would go where? The ring now has acetophenone at 1 and Br at 3.

The ring now is acetophenone (1), Br (3). Next, nitration. The most activating group is acetophenone, which is a meta director. So, nitration would occur meta to ketone, which is position 5. So, nitro at 5.

So, after these steps, we have acetophenone at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. That matches the target: 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl acetophenone. Wait, but the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So yes, the positions are correct.

Then, what's next in option A? iv) Fe/HCl. That's probably a reduction step. Wait, Fe and HCl is for something else. Or maybe it's a workup step.

v) HNO3/H2SO4—another nitration? That would be adding another nitro group, which we don't want.

vi) NaNO2/HCl—this is a diazotization step. But why would we need that?

vii) H3PO2—this is a reducing agent, like in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, but that would remove the ketone, which we don't want. So option A's steps seem to lead to the target but then add more groups and possibly destroy the ketone. So perhaps option A is incorrect.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), ii) HNO3 (nitration), iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acetylation), iv) HNO3, v) Fe/HCl, vi) NaNO2/HCl, vii) H3PO2.

Wait, brominating benzene first would lead to bromobenzene. Then nitration: nitro would add in the meta position relative to Br, so at position 5. Then acetylation: acetophenone would add in the meta position relative to nitro (position 5) → so acetophenone at position 3.

Wait, but then the ring would have Br at 1, nitro at 3, and acetophenone at 5. That would not match the target, which has acetophenone at 1.

Moreover, after acetylation (iii), the next steps are more nitrations, reductions, diazotization, and H3PO2, which might not lead to the desired product.

Option C: i) HNO3 (nitrate), ii) Fe/HCl, iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3, iv) Br2, v) HNO3, vi) NaNO2/HCl, vii) H3PO2.

So, nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene. Then, Fe/HCl is probably a reduction step, but nitrobenzene can be reduced to phenylamine. Wait, but Fe/HCl is a typical acid for reactions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different step.

Wait, after nitration (i), step ii is Fe/HCl. That could be a reduction of nitro to amine. So nitrobenzene → aniline. Then, iii is acetylation: benzene with amine group would undergo acetylation to acetanilide. Then, iv is Br2/FeBr3: bromination. But acetanilide is a meta director. So Br would add at position 3 (meta to acetanilide). Then, v is HNO3/H2SO4: nitration of acetanilide, which is a meta director. So nitro would go at position 5 (meta to acetanilide). Then, vi is NaNO2/HCl: diazotization of the amine group. Then, vii is H3PO2: which is a reducing agent, perhaps for a Sandmeyer reaction or something else.

But the target has a ketone, not an amine. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Option D: i) HNO3, ii) Fe/HCl, iii) NaNO2/HCl, iv) H3PO2, v) Br2, vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3, vii) HNO3.

So, nitrate → nitrobenzene. Then Fe/HCl: reduce nitro to amine → aniline. NaNO2/HCl: diazotization → diazonium salt. H3PO2: possibly a reduction, but I'm not sure. Then Br2/FeBr3: bromination. Then acetylation, then nitration again.

I don't see how this would lead to the correct product.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the steps that introduce the substituents in the correct positions. From earlier analysis, the correct order seems to be acetylation first, then nitration, then bromination. Because that way, the substituents are added meta to the ketone.

Looking back at option A, the steps are acetylation, bromination, nitration. Wait, but that would place Br at position 3, then nitro at position 5, which is correct. Then, the subsequent steps would be other reactions, but do they affect the substituents?

Wait, after acetylation, bromination, nitration, the ring has acetophenone at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So that's exactly the target. But in option A, the steps after nitration are Fe/HCl, HNO3, etc., which may not be necessary. But perhaps those steps are to introduce more substituents, but the question is about high-yield synthesis. So perhaps the correct sequence is in option A, but the extra steps might be superfluous. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me count the steps. Option A:

i) Acetylate → acetophenone.

ii) Brominate → Br at 3.

iii) Nitrate → nitro at 5.

So after step iii, the structure is correct. The remaining steps (iv to vii) would presumably not change the substituents. Wait, iv) Fe/HCl is likely a reduction; but acetophenone is not easily reduced under those conditions. Alternatively, it's a workup. Or perhaps it's a step in a substitution.

Wait, but after step iii, the molecule is 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, which is the desired product. So why would there be more steps? Unless the steps are actually leading to the desired product in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the positions. Let me think again about option A.

In option A:

i) Acetylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) → acetophenone (position 1).

ii) Bromination (Br2/FeBr3) → adds Br in meta to acetophenone → position 3.

iii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) → adds nitro in meta to Br (since Br is a deactivating, ortho/para director, but meta to acetophenone? Wait, no. Now, the substituents are acetophenone (1) and Br (3). So when nitrating, which group directs?

Acetophenone is a meta director, Br is an ortho/para director. But Br is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive. But the acetophenone is activating. So the nitration would be directed by the acetophenone, which is at position 1. So nitro would go into position 5 (meta to acetophenone). So the product after step iii is correct.

Then, step iv is Fe/HCl. Hmm, not sure. Maybe a workup. Steps v to vii may not change the structure; perhaps they are for purification or something else.

But in that case, the product after step iii is correct. So option A's steps would achieve the target in the first three steps. The rest of the steps may be incorrect or unnecessary, but perhaps the question is only about the correct sequence leading to the product, regardless of the subsequent steps. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility is that the steps after iii are for other purposes, like introducing or removing groups, but I don't see how that would help. Let me think about what each step does.

Looking at the options, perhaps option C is the correct one. Let me think again.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation of aniline → acetanilide.

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate acetanilide. Acetanilide is a meta director, so Br would go to position 5.

Wait, acetanilide is at position 1 (if the initial nitration was at position 1), then Br would be at position 3 (meta to acetanilide? Or position 5? I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to have the nitro and bromine introduced before the acetylation, but that seems problematic because of deactivating groups.

Wait, another approach: maybe after acetylation, the nitro and bromine are introduced in a way that they are both meta to the acetophenone.

So, after acetylation, nitration would add nitro at position 3, then bromination would add Br at position 5 (meta to nitro, which is meta to acetophenone). Hmm, but in option A, the steps are acetylation, bromination, nitration. So bromine is added before nitro.

Wait, another way: the order of nitration and bromination after acetylation.

After acetylation, if we nitrate first, nitro goes to position 3. Then, bromination would be directed by nitro (since nitro is a stronger deactivating group than Br's effect). So, Br would go to position 5 (meta to nitro, which is position 3). So the product is 3-nitro-5-bromoacetophenone, which matches the target structure.

Wait, but in option A, the steps after acetylation are bromination (ii), then nitration (iii). So that would add Br at position 3, then nitro at position 5, same as desired. So after step iii, the product is correct.

But then why would option A have more steps? Maybe the correct sequence is just the first three steps, but the question lists a longer sequence. But the question says 'which sequence would lead to', so perhaps all the steps are necessary.

Wait, perhaps the other steps are for another purpose. For example, maybe the initial steps are for introducing groups, and the rest are for purification or workup. Alternatively, maybe the steps are not in the correct order.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to perform the acetylation first, then the nitration, then the bromination, so the correct option would be option A, where the first three steps are acetylation, then bromination, then nitration. Wait, no, in option A, the order is acetylation, bromination, nitration. So acetophenone, then Br at 3, then nitro at 5. That's correct.

But why are the other steps in option A? Let's see:

iv) Fe/HCl → Could this be for removing a group? For example, maybe the Fe/HCl is used in a workup, but I'm not sure.

v) HNO3 → Another nitration? But that would add another nitro group, which we don't want.

Wait, maybe the steps after iii are not relevant, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps are more about the introduction of substituents, and the other steps are for forming the final product.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the other steps in option A are for the synthesis of the acetophenone, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B or C.

Wait, another possibility: the target molecule has the nitro and bromine in the meta positions relative to each other. So perhaps the order is to introduce both the nitro and bromine before the acetylation.

But as earlier, that might not be possible because acetylation requires an activated ring. So, for Friedel-Crafts, the ring needs to be activated. If the ring has strong deactivating groups like nitro, then Friedel-Crafts won't proceed.

So, the acetylation must come before nitration and bromination.

So, the correct sequence is acetylation first, then nitration, then bromination.

Which would correspond to steps in option A: i, ii, iii are acetylation, bromination, nitration.

But wait, in option A, after acetylation, it's bromination, then nitration. So after acetylation, Br is added, which is a deactivating group. Then nitration occurs. But with Br present, which is an ortho/para director. So, when you have acetophenone (1), Br (3), then nitrating would be directed by which group?

The acetophenone is a strong activator, so it should direct the nitro group to its meta position, which is position 5. So, the product after step iii is correct. Then the rest of the steps may not affect the substituents.

But in the options, the steps after iii in option A are:

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps a reduction, but with acetophenone, not sure.

v) HNO3 → another nitration, which we don't want.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, but we don't have an amine group.

vii) H3PO2 → reducing agent, which might remove the ketone.

So, perhaps option A's steps would end up destroying the ketone, which is not desired. So, this can't be the right option.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Option C's steps:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate aniline to acetanilide.

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate acetanilide (meta director) → Br at position 5.

v) HNO3 → nitrate acetanilide → position 3.

Wait, but acetanilide is a meta director. If the ring already has an acetanilide group at position 1, nitration would go to position 5 (meta), but perhaps that's not necessary.

Alternatively, maybe this leads to the correct product.

But I'm getting confused again. Let me think about the positions.

After step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce to amine at 1.

Step iii: acetylate amine → acetanilide at 1.

Step iv: brominate → Br at position 4 (ortho to acetanilide), or position 3 or 5 (meta). Wait, acetanilide is a meta director, so Br would go to position 3 or 5. Let's say 3.

Step v: nitrate → acetanilide directs nitro to position 5 (meta to acetanilide at 1).

So after step v, the substituents would be acetanilide (1), Br (3), nitro (5). Then, steps vi and vii: NaNO2/HCl and H3PO2. These are steps for a diazotization and possible reduction. But I don't see how that would form the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetanilide is converted back to amine, but that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

I'm getting stuck between options A and C, but I'm more confident that acetylation must come first, then nitration, then bromination. So option A's first three steps are correct, but the subsequent steps might be wrong.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the correct option is C. Let me try to think through all the steps of option C.

Option C steps:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation → acetanilide.

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate acetanilide. Acetanilide is a meta director, so Br adds at position 3 or 5. Let's say 3.

v) HNO3 → nitrate acetanilide. Acetanilide is meta director, so nitro adds at position 5.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization: but acetanilide is not an amine, but after step v, the ring has acetanilide, Br, and nitro. So, perhaps this step is to make a diazonium salt from the amine, but the amine was already acetylated.

Wait, no. After step iii, the ring has acetanilide (position 1), and then Br and nitro are added in steps iv and v. So, step vi would need an amine group, but the amine is already acetylated. So, this step doesn't make sense.

Perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite the later steps.

Wait, but if the correct product is achieved after step iii, perhaps the other steps are irrelevant. Or perhaps I'm missing some step that the option includes.

Alternatively, maybe the order is acetylation, nitration, bromination. Let me see which option has that.

Looking at the options:

Option B: acetylation is step iii.

So steps before that are bromination and nitration.

Not the order I want.

Option D: acetylation is step vi.

So, after several other steps.

No.

Option C: acetylation is step iii, after nitration and Fe/HCl.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that after acetylation, another nitro group is added. But that would lead to disubstituted acetophenone, which is not desired.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are as follows:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

2. Nitrate → nitro at position 3.

3. Brominate → Br at position 5 (directed by acetophenone's meta).

So, this would be the correct order: acetylation → nitration → bromination.

Looking at the options, which option does that?

Option A: i) acetylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration.

So steps are A: acetylation → bromination → nitration. Which would lead to Br at 3, then nitro at 5.

Wait, but in option A, after acetylation comes bromination, then nitration. So the product would have Br at 3 and nitro at 5, which is correct.

But then, why does option A have more steps? Perhaps the subsequent steps are for removing or adding other groups, but that's not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct sequence is option A. So the answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (bromine, nitro, and ketone) are introduced in the correct positions on the benzene ring. The ketone group is a strong meta-director, and the nitro group is a meta-director and deactivating. Bromine is an ortho/para-director but deactivating. The target molecule has the ketone at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces the ketone group at position 1, forming acetophenone.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone).
3. **Step iii**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to the ketone).
   - After these steps, the product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which matches the target molecule.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps (Fe/HCl, HNO₃, NaNO₂/HCl, H₃PO₂) are unnecessary and potentially destructive to the ketone group. However, the first three steps are sufficient to achieve the desired product.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group at position 3 (meta to bromine).
3. **Step iii**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces the ketone group at position 5 (meta to nitro).
   - This results in a product where the ketone is at position 5, which does not match the target molecule.
4. Subsequent steps (iv–vii) do not correct the positions of the substituents.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces the ketone group at position 1, forming acetanilide.
4. **Step iv**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine at position 3 (meta to acetanilide).
5. **Step v**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to acetanilide).
   - After these steps, the product is correct (1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one).
6. **Steps vi–vii**: These steps (NaNO₂/HCl, H₃PO₂) are unnecessary and potentially destructive to the ketone group. However, the first five steps are sufficient to achieve the desired product.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) and reduction (H₃PO₂) do not contribute to the desired product.
4. **Step iv**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine at position 3.
5. **Step v**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces the ketone group at position 1.
6. **Step vi**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds another nitro group, which is not desired.
   - This sequence does not lead to the correct product.

### Conclusion:
Both **Option A** and **Option C** can lead to the desired product, but **Option A** is more direct and efficient. The first three steps in Option A (acetylation, bromination, nitration) are sufficient to achieve the target molecule, making it the best choice.

**Answer: A**

Okay, let's try to figure out this question. So, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm, I need to think about how to synthesize that from benzene. Let me break down the structure.

The molecule has a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromine, and position 5 has a nitro group. Also, there's an ethanone group attached. Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, right? So the ketone is on the benzene ring. So the structure is acetophenone with substituents at the 3 and 5 positions.

Wait, but how are these substituents arranged? Oh, benzene is symmetric, so 3 and 5 are meta to each other. So, the substituents need to be introduced in such a way that they end up in the correct positions relative to the ketone.

So, benzene needs to undergo a series of substitutions. Let's think about the steps.

First, benzene is likely to undergo a nitration and then a bromination, but the order and the directing groups matter. Wait, when you introduce a nitro group, it's a meta director. If the first substitution is nitration, the nitro group is a meta director, so the next group would go meta to it. But then, when you introduce the ketone, which is also a meta director, you have to make sure the bromine and nitro groups end up in the right spots.

Alternatively, maybe we start by introducing the ketone. Because once the ketone is attached, it's a strong meta director. So, the order in which substituents are added would determine their positions.

Wait, the target molecule has nitro and bromine groups. Let me imagine the benzene ring. The ketone is on position 1. Then, nitro is on 5 and bromine on 3. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is in position 3, but I think that would complicate the numbering. Wait, no. Let me draw a benzene ring with the ketone at position 1. Then, the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions. So, 3-bromo, 5-nitro.

Wait, but how do we get the substituents in those positions? Let's think about the directing effects.

The ketone (acetophenone) is a meta director. So substituents after would go into the meta positions relative to it. But if we have multiple substituents, their directing effects will depend on which is more activating or deactivating.

Wait, nitro groups are meta directors and deactivating. Bromine is an ortho/para director but deactivating as well. So, the order in which we introduce substituents will determine where they go.

Wait, the target is 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. Let's think about the substituents on the benzene ring. The acetophenone is at position 1, nitro at 5, bromine at 3. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5, which are meta to each other. Hmm, but how to get them there.

Alternatively, maybe the acetophenone is introduced after the nitro and bromine. Wait, no, because the ketone is part of the ring structure. So probably, the ketone is attached first, then the nitro and bromine are added in the right positions.

Wait, but when you have a benzene ring with substituents, each new substitution is directed by the existing substituents. So, perhaps the first substitution is nitration, then bromination, then introducing the ketone, but that might not work. Or perhaps the ketone is introduced early on.

Wait, maybe the steps are: first, nitration to add nitro. Then, then bromination in a position directed by nitro. Then, introduce the ketone.

Wait, but let's think in the context of the options given. Each option has a sequence of steps. The options are A, B, C, D.

Looking at the options, each has a series of steps, including nitration, bromination, some reactions with HCl, Fe, NaNO2, H3PO2, and acetylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3.

Hmm. Let's think about the possibility of using the acetylation as the first step.

Wait, acetylation is typically done via Friedel-Crafts acylation. So, benzene can react with CH3COCl in presence of AlCl3 to form acetophenone.

Wait, but if first we acetylate benzene, then the acetophenone is a meta director. So the next substituents would go into the meta positions relative to the ketone.

So, let's say step i is acetylation: benzene → acetophenone.

Then, the next step would be nitration. Since the ketone is meta director, nitration would occur at the meta position, position 3. But wait, acetophenone has the ketone at position 1. So the nitro group would go at position 3, and another substituent would go at position 5. Wait, but how?

Wait no, acetophenone is a monosubstituted benzene. So after acetylation, the next substituents would be directed by the ketone.

So, if the second step is nitration, the nitro group would go into the meta position relative to the ketone, which is position 3. Then, the third substituent would have to go into position 5.

Wait, but wait, nitro is a strong deactivating group, so it directs meta. So, if we have acetophenone, then add nitro at position 3, then bromination would be next.

But wait, the target has bromine at position 3 and nitro at 5. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused about the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration and bromination happen before the acetylation. Let me think.

If we first nitrate benzene, then brominate, then acetylate. But wait, nitration is a meta director. So benzene with nitro at position 1. Then, bromination would add Br in the meta position, position 3 or 5? Wait, benzene is symmetric, but let's say the nitro is at position 1. Then, bromination would add Br at position 3 (meta to nitro), or perhaps another position.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director, so the next substituent would go to the meta position. So, after nitration, bromination would add Br at position 3. Then, acetylation would add the ketone. Wait, but where?

In benzene with nitro at 1 and Br at 3, the next substitution (acetylation) would be directed by the most powerful group. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So the acetylation would occur at position 5 (meta to nitro). So the structure would be 5-acetyl-1-nitro-3-bromobenzene. Wait, but the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the positions again. Let me number the benzene ring. Let's imagine the acetophenone is at position 1. Then, the nitro is at 5, and bromine at 3. So, in this case, acetophenone is position 1, nitro 5 (meta to acetophenone), and bromine 3 (meta to acetophenone). But wait, how can that happen.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to perform the acetylation first, which will place the ketone at position 1. Then, nitration would add nitro at position 3 (meta to ketone). Then, bromination would occur where? Since nitro is a meta director, but it's already in position 3. Wait, the next substituent would be directed by the nitro group. So, bromine would go to position 5 (meta to nitro, which is at 3), which is also meta to the ketone. So, perhaps that's the way.

Let me outline:

1. Acetylate benzene to make acetophenone. Ketone is at 1. Structure: Ph-CO-CH3.

2. Nitration: add nitro at meta position, position 3.

3. Bromination: where? Nitro group (position 3) is a meta director, so bromine would go to position 6 (if the ring is numbered with ketone at 1, and nitro at 3, then the next meta position for nitro is 6. But wait, our target has nitro at 5 and bromine at 3. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the correct order is nitration first. Let's try that.

1. Nitration of benzene: benzene → nitrobenzene. Nitro at position 1.

2. Bromination: since nitro is meta director, Br would add at position 3.

3. Then, acetylation: the most activating group is nitro? No, nitro is deactivating. So, the most activated position would be where? In nitrobenzene, Br is at 3. Now, the ring has nitro at 1 and Br at 3.

Wait, when you have multiple substituents, the next substitution is directed by the most powerful director. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta director. Br is deactivating, but ortho/para director. So, which one is more influential? The nitro group is more deactivating, so the next substituent would be directed by nitro.

So, acetylation would occur meta to nitro, which is position 5. So, that would place the ketone at position 5.

But the target has the ketone at position 1, right? Because it's 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the ketone is directly attached at position 1, and the other substituents are at 3 and 5.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the synthesis needs to arrange the substituents in such a way that the ketone is in position 1, with nitro at 5 and Br at 3.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the steps needed to place each group correctly.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a nitro group, bromine, and a ketone. The ketone is a meta director. So, after the ketone is attached, the next substituents would go into the meta positions relative to the ketone.

Wait, but the nitro and bromine are both in the meta positions relative to the ketone. So, when the ketone is first introduced, the next steps would add the nitro and bromine in meta positions. But wait, nitro and bromine are both meta directors. Hmm, but they are added via different reactions.

Wait, maybe the order is nitration first (to add nitro at meta to ketone), then bromination, but wait, the ketone hasn't been added yet.

Hmm, perhaps the sequence is as follows:

First, introduce the nitro group.

Then, introduce the bromine.

Then, introduce the ketone.

Wait, but that's tricky because the ketone is a strong meta director. Let me think.

But wait, if I nitrate benzene first, then brominate, then acetylate. Let me see.

1. Nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene (nitro at 1).

2. Bromination of nitrobenzene: since nitro is meta director, Br adds at 3 or 5. Let's say 3.

3. Acetylation: since nitro is a meta director, the ketone would add at the position meta to nitro, which is position 5. So, the structure would be 5-acetyl-1-nitro-3-bromobenzene. Wait, but that's acetophenone at position 5, which is probably not the case we want. The target has the ketone in position 1.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is acetylation first.

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone (position 1).

2. Nitration: adds nitro at position 3 (meta to ketone).

3. Bromination: nitro is meta director, so Br would add at position 5 (meta to nitro, but that's the same as position 5 relative to the ketone, which is already position 1. Wait, acetophenone is at 1, nitro at 3. Then, adding Br, which is directed by nitro which is at 3. So, Br would go to position 6 (meta to nitro) or position 5 (para to nitro). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, in acetophenone, the ketone is at 1. Nitro group is added at 3 (meta to ketone). Now, for bromination, which substituent directs? Since nitro is a strong deactivating group, it would direct the next substituent to its meta position. So, the nitro is at 3, so its meta positions are 6 and 6 is not possible because benzene only has six positions. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, acetophenone is at position 1. Nitration adds nitro at position 3 (meta to ketone). Now, nitro is at 3. The next substitution (bromination) would be directed by nitro, which is a meta director. So, the bromine could go to position 6 (meta to nitro at 3). But that would make the substituents at 3 (nitro) and 6 (Br). Wait, but the target has nitro at 5 and Br at 3. So that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the order. Let's try another approach.

What if the ketone is introduced after nitro and bromine?

But how? Because acetylation (Friedel-Crafts) requires an activating group. Benzene is not very reactive. Wait, but nitro is deactivating, making the ring less reactive. So Friedel-Crafts might not work if nitro is present.

Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation requires activating groups. If the ring has strong deactivating groups, the reaction may not proceed. So, perhaps the ketone must be introduced before any deactivating groups.

So, acetylation must come first. So the first step is acetylation.

So, the sequence starts with i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetophenone.

Next, nitration. Nitro group is added at position 3 (meta to ketone).

Then, bromination. Now, the ring has acetophenone (position 1), nitro (position 3), and needs bromine at position 5.

Wait, but bromination after nitration would be directed by nitro.

So, nitro is at position 3. So, bromine would go to position 6 (meta to nitro) or position 5 (ortho to nitro? No, nitro is deactivating, so para would be position 6).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me imagine the acetophenone at position 1. Nitro is at 3, which is meta to 1. Now, when we brominate, the directing is by nitro, which is position 3. So, bromine would go to position 6 (meta to nitro at 3).

But the target has bromine at position 3 and nitro at 5. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options to see which sequence would lead to the correct substituents.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) acetylation, ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iv) Fe/HCl, v) HNO3/H2SO4, vi) NaNO2/HCl, vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me see:

After acetylation (i), then bromination (ii) would add Br at meta to acetophenone (position 3). Then nitration (iii) would add nitro at position 5 (meta to Br, but wait, Br is ortho/para director but deactivating. So, nitration would go where? The ring now has acetophenone at 1 and Br at 3.

The ring now is acetophenone (1), Br (3). Next, nitration. The most activating group is acetophenone, which is a meta director. So, nitration would occur meta to ketone, which is position 5. So, nitro at 5.

So, after these steps, we have acetophenone at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. That matches the target: 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl acetophenone. Wait, but the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So yes, the positions are correct.

Then, what's next in option A? iv) Fe/HCl. That's probably a reduction step. Wait, Fe and HCl is for something else. Or maybe it's a workup step.

v) HNO3/H2SO4—another nitration? That would be adding another nitro group, which we don't want.

vi) NaNO2/HCl—this is a diazotization step. But why would we need that?

vii) H3PO2—this is a reducing agent, like in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, but that would remove the ketone, which we don't want. So option A's steps seem to lead to the target but then add more groups and possibly destroy the ketone. So perhaps option A is incorrect.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), ii) HNO3 (nitration), iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acetylation), iv) HNO3, v) Fe/HCl, vi) NaNO2/HCl, vii) H3PO2.

Wait, brominating benzene first would lead to bromobenzene. Then nitration: nitro would add in the meta position relative to Br, so at position 5. Then acetylation: acetophenone would add in the meta position relative to nitro (position 5) → so acetophenone at position 3.

Wait, but then the ring would have Br at 1, nitro at 3, and acetophenone at 5. That would not match the target, which has acetophenone at 1.

Moreover, after acetylation (iii), the next steps are more nitrations, reductions, diazotization, and H3PO2, which might not lead to the desired product.

Option C: i) HNO3 (nitrate), ii) Fe/HCl, iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3, iv) Br2, v) HNO3, vi) NaNO2/HCl, vii) H3PO2.

So, nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene. Then, Fe/HCl is probably a reduction step, but nitrobenzene can be reduced to phenylamine. Wait, but Fe/HCl is a typical acid for reactions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different step.

Wait, after nitration (i), step ii is Fe/HCl. That could be a reduction of nitro to amine. So nitrobenzene → aniline. Then, iii is acetylation: benzene with amine group would undergo acetylation to acetanilide. Then, iv is Br2/FeBr3: bromination. But acetanilide is a meta director. So Br would add at position 3 (meta to acetanilide). Then, v is HNO3/H2SO4: nitration of acetanilide, which is a meta director. So nitro would go at position 5 (meta to acetanilide). Then, vi is NaNO2/HCl: diazotization of the amine group. Then, vii is H3PO2: which is a reducing agent, perhaps for a Sandmeyer reaction or something else.

But the target has a ketone, not an amine. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Option D: i) HNO3, ii) Fe/HCl, iii) NaNO2/HCl, iv) H3PO2, v) Br2, vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3, vii) HNO3.

So, nitrate → nitrobenzene. Then Fe/HCl: reduce nitro to amine → aniline. NaNO2/HCl: diazotization → diazonium salt. H3PO2: possibly a reduction, but I'm not sure. Then Br2/FeBr3: bromination. Then acetylation, then nitration again.

I don't see how this would lead to the correct product.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the steps that introduce the substituents in the correct positions. From earlier analysis, the correct order seems to be acetylation first, then nitration, then bromination. Because that way, the substituents are added meta to the ketone.

Looking back at option A, the steps are acetylation, bromination, nitration. Wait, but that would place Br at position 3, then nitro at position 5, which is correct. Then, the subsequent steps would be other reactions, but do they affect the substituents?

Wait, after acetylation, bromination, nitration, the ring has acetophenone at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So that's exactly the target. But in option A, the steps after nitration are Fe/HCl, HNO3, etc., which may not be necessary. But perhaps those steps are to introduce more substituents, but the question is about high-yield synthesis. So perhaps the correct sequence is in option A, but the extra steps might be superfluous. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me count the steps. Option A:

i) Acetylate → acetophenone.

ii) Brominate → Br at 3.

iii) Nitrate → nitro at 5.

So after step iii, the structure is correct. The remaining steps (iv to vii) would presumably not change the substituents. Wait, iv) Fe/HCl is likely a reduction; but acetophenone is not easily reduced under those conditions. Alternatively, it's a workup. Or perhaps it's a step in a substitution.

Wait, but after step iii, the molecule is 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, which is the desired product. So why would there be more steps? Unless the steps are actually leading to the desired product in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the positions. Let me think again about option A.

In option A:

i) Acetylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) → acetophenone (position 1).

ii) Bromination (Br2/FeBr3) → adds Br in meta to acetophenone → position 3.

iii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) → adds nitro in meta to Br (since Br is a deactivating, ortho/para director, but meta to acetophenone? Wait, no. Now, the substituents are acetophenone (1) and Br (3). So when nitrating, which group directs?

Acetophenone is a meta director, Br is an ortho/para director. But Br is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive. But the acetophenone is activating. So the nitration would be directed by the acetophenone, which is at position 1. So nitro would go into position 5 (meta to acetophenone). So the product after step iii is correct.

Then, step iv is Fe/HCl. Hmm, not sure. Maybe a workup. Steps v to vii may not change the structure; perhaps they are for purification or something else.

But in that case, the product after step iii is correct. So option A's steps would achieve the target in the first three steps. The rest of the steps may be incorrect or unnecessary, but perhaps the question is only about the correct sequence leading to the product, regardless of the subsequent steps. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility is that the steps after iii are for other purposes, like introducing or removing groups, but I don't see how that would help. Let me think about what each step does.

Looking at the options, perhaps option C is the correct one. Let me think again.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation of aniline → acetanilide.

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate acetanilide. Acetanilide is a meta director, so Br would go to position 5.

Wait, acetanilide is at position 1 (if the initial nitration was at position 1), then Br would be at position 3 (meta to acetanilide? Or position 5? I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to have the nitro and bromine introduced before the acetylation, but that seems problematic because of deactivating groups.

Wait, another approach: maybe after acetylation, the nitro and bromine are introduced in a way that they are both meta to the acetophenone.

So, after acetylation, nitration would add nitro at position 3, then bromination would add Br at position 5 (meta to nitro, which is meta to acetophenone). Hmm, but in option A, the steps are acetylation, bromination, nitration. So bromine is added before nitro.

Wait, another way: the order of nitration and bromination after acetylation.

After acetylation, if we nitrate first, nitro goes to position 3. Then, bromination would be directed by nitro (since nitro is a stronger deactivating group than Br's effect). So, Br would go to position 5 (meta to nitro, which is position 3). So the product is 3-nitro-5-bromoacetophenone, which matches the target structure.

Wait, but in option A, the steps after acetylation are bromination (ii), then nitration (iii). So that would add Br at position 3, then nitro at position 5, same as desired. So after step iii, the product is correct.

But then why would option A have more steps? Maybe the correct sequence is just the first three steps, but the question lists a longer sequence. But the question says 'which sequence would lead to', so perhaps all the steps are necessary.

Wait, perhaps the other steps are for another purpose. For example, maybe the initial steps are for introducing groups, and the rest are for purification or workup. Alternatively, maybe the steps are not in the correct order.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to perform the acetylation first, then the nitration, then the bromination, so the correct option would be option A, where the first three steps are acetylation, then bromination, then nitration. Wait, no, in option A, the order is acetylation, bromination, nitration. So acetophenone, then Br at 3, then nitro at 5. That's correct.

But why are the other steps in option A? Let's see:

iv) Fe/HCl → Could this be for removing a group? For example, maybe the Fe/HCl is used in a workup, but I'm not sure.

v) HNO3 → Another nitration? But that would add another nitro group, which we don't want.

Wait, maybe the steps after iii are not relevant, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps are more about the introduction of substituents, and the other steps are for forming the final product.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the other steps in option A are for the synthesis of the acetophenone, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B or C.

Wait, another possibility: the target molecule has the nitro and bromine in the meta positions relative to each other. So perhaps the order is to introduce both the nitro and bromine before the acetylation.

But as earlier, that might not be possible because acetylation requires an activated ring. So, for Friedel-Crafts, the ring needs to be activated. If the ring has strong deactivating groups like nitro, then Friedel-Crafts won't proceed.

So, the acetylation must come before nitration and bromination.

So, the correct sequence is acetylation first, then nitration, then bromination.

Which would correspond to steps in option A: i, ii, iii are acetylation, bromination, nitration.

But wait, in option A, after acetylation, it's bromination, then nitration. So after acetylation, Br is added, which is a deactivating group. Then nitration occurs. But with Br present, which is an ortho/para director. So, when you have acetophenone (1), Br (3), then nitrating would be directed by which group?

The acetophenone is a strong activator, so it should direct the nitro group to its meta position, which is position 5. So, the product after step iii is correct. Then the rest of the steps may not affect the substituents.

But in the options, the steps after iii in option A are:

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps a reduction, but with acetophenone, not sure.

v) HNO3 → another nitration, which we don't want.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, but we don't have an amine group.

vii) H3PO2 → reducing agent, which might remove the ketone.

So, perhaps option A's steps would end up destroying the ketone, which is not desired. So, this can't be the right option.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Option C's steps:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate aniline to acetanilide.

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate acetanilide (meta director) → Br at position 5.

v) HNO3 → nitrate acetanilide → position 3.

Wait, but acetanilide is a meta director. If the ring already has an acetanilide group at position 1, nitration would go to position 5 (meta), but perhaps that's not necessary.

Alternatively, maybe this leads to the correct product.

But I'm getting confused again. Let me think about the positions.

After step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce to amine at 1.

Step iii: acetylate amine → acetanilide at 1.

Step iv: brominate → Br at position 4 (ortho to acetanilide), or position 3 or 5 (meta). Wait, acetanilide is a meta director, so Br would go to position 3 or 5. Let's say 3.

Step v: nitrate → acetanilide directs nitro to position 5 (meta to acetanilide at 1).

So after step v, the substituents would be acetanilide (1), Br (3), nitro (5). Then, steps vi and vii: NaNO2/HCl and H3PO2. These are steps for a diazotization and possible reduction. But I don't see how that would form the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetanilide is converted back to amine, but that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

I'm getting stuck between options A and C, but I'm more confident that acetylation must come first, then nitration, then bromination. So option A's first three steps are correct, but the subsequent steps might be wrong.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the correct option is C. Let me try to think through all the steps of option C.

Option C steps:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation → acetanilide.

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate acetanilide. Acetanilide is a meta director, so Br adds at position 3 or 5. Let's say 3.

v) HNO3 → nitrate acetanilide. Acetanilide is meta director, so nitro adds at position 5.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization: but acetanilide is not an amine, but after step v, the ring has acetanilide, Br, and nitro. So, perhaps this step is to make a diazonium salt from the amine, but the amine was already acetylated.

Wait, no. After step iii, the ring has acetanilide (position 1), and then Br and nitro are added in steps iv and v. So, step vi would need an amine group, but the amine is already acetylated. So, this step doesn't make sense.

Perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite the later steps.

Wait, but if the correct product is achieved after step iii, perhaps the other steps are irrelevant. Or perhaps I'm missing some step that the option includes.

Alternatively, maybe the order is acetylation, nitration, bromination. Let me see which option has that.

Looking at the options:

Option B: acetylation is step iii.

So steps before that are bromination and nitration.

Not the order I want.

Option D: acetylation is step vi.

So, after several other steps.

No.

Option C: acetylation is step iii, after nitration and Fe/HCl.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that after acetylation, another nitro group is added. But that would lead to disubstituted acetophenone, which is not desired.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are as follows:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

2. Nitrate → nitro at position 3.

3. Brominate → Br at position 5 (directed by acetophenone's meta).

So, this would be the correct order: acetylation → nitration → bromination.

Looking at the options, which option does that?

Option A: i) acetylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration.

So steps are A: acetylation → bromination → nitration. Which would lead to Br at 3, then nitro at 5.

Wait, but in option A, after acetylation comes bromination, then nitration. So the product would have Br at 3 and nitro at 5, which is correct.

But then, why does option A have more steps? Perhaps the subsequent steps are for removing or adding other groups, but that's not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct sequence is option A. So the answer is option A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (bromine, nitro, and ketone) are introduced in the correct positions on the benzene ring. The ketone group is a strong meta-director, and the nitro group is a meta-director and deactivating. Bromine is an ortho/para-director but deactivating. The target molecule has the ketone at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces the ketone group at position 1, forming acetophenone.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone).
3. **Step iii**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to the ketone).
   - After these steps, the product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which matches the target molecule.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps (Fe/HCl, HNO₃, NaNO₂/HCl, H₃PO₂) are unnecessary and potentially destructive to the ketone group. However, the first three steps are sufficient to achieve the desired product.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group at position 3 (meta to bromine).
3. **Step iii**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces the ketone group at position 5 (meta to nitro).
   - This results in a product where the ketone is at position 5, which does not match the target molecule.
4. Subsequent steps (iv–vii) do not correct the positions of the substituents.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces the ketone group at position 1, forming acetanilide.
4. **Step iv**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine at position 3 (meta to acetanilide).
5. **Step v**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to acetanilide).
   - After these steps, the product is correct (1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one).
6. **Steps vi–vii**: These steps (NaNO₂/HCl, H₃PO₂) are unnecessary and potentially destructive to the ketone group. However, the first five steps are sufficient to achieve the desired product.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) and reduction (H₃PO₂) do not contribute to the desired product.
4. **Step iv**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine at position 3.
5. **Step v**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces the ketone group at position 1.
6. **Step vi**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds another nitro group, which is not desired.
   - This sequence does not lead to the correct product.

### Conclusion:
Both **Option A** and **Option C** can lead to the desired product, but **Option A** is more direct and efficient. The first three steps in Option A (acetylation, bromination, nitration) are sufficient to achieve the target molecule, making it the best choice.
