Okay, so I have this chemistry problem where I need to figure out what an unknown compound is based on spectral data. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The problem states that the chemist found a white solid. The spectral information includes mass, IR, and 1H NMR data. The options are four different chlorinated aromatic compounds. Let's go through each piece of data one by one and see what they tell me.

Starting with the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 and it's 100%, so that's the molecular weight. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. I remember that molecular ion peaks can sometimes be accompanied by isotopic peaks. Chlorine has a significant natural abundance of its isotopes—about 75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37. So if the molecular formula includes a chlorine atom, the molecular ion would have two peaks: one for Cl-35 and another for Cl-37. Let me calculate the possible molecular weights.

Wait, the molecular ion is at 156. Let me think about the possible formula. If the molecular weight is 156, and there's a chlorine in the molecule, the molecular formula would need to sum up to 156. Let's consider each option:

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding Cl, OH, and another O? Wait, no: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is C7H5ClO2. Let's compute: C=12*7=84, H=5*1=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. Sum: 84 +5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Hmm, so approximately 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm.

Option B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl gives C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 12*7=84, 5*1=5, 35.5, 16*2=32. Total: 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5 again. So same as option A.

Option C) Phenyl chloroformate. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. Its formula would be C7H5ClO2 as well. So same molecular weight. So all three options (A, B, C) have the same formula. What about D?

Option D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same as B, I think. Structure would be Cl in position 2. Same formula, same molecular weight.

Wait, but wait. Looking back, the molecular ion is at 156, but when the molecule has Cl, the molecular ion should be at 156+2=158? No, wait, Cl has two common isotopes: 35Cl (75%) and 37Cl (25%). So the molecular ion would have a peak at m/z corresponding to both isotopes. For a molecule with one Cl atom, the molecular ion would appear as two peaks: one at 156 (if Cl is 35) and another at 158 (37Cl). But wait, the molecular ion is at 156, which is 100%, and another peak at 158, 32%. Hmm. So the ratio between the peaks would be according to the natural abundance of Cl isotopes. Let me think: the M+ and M+2 peaks (where M is molecular weight without considering Cl) would be in the ratio of 75% : 25%. So if the molecular ion is 156 (100%?), but wait, I'm a bit confused. 

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the molecular weight and see if the isotopic peaks fit. Let me think, the molecular ion is the higher mass, or the lower? Let me think: the molecular formula for all options is C7H5ClO2. The molecular weight is 156.5. So the molecular ion would be at 156, but considering the Cl isotopes, the M and M+2 peaks? No, wait, the Cl-35 would give M = 156 (since 156.5 is approx. 156.5, so the 35Cl would make M = (exact mass is 156.5 - 35.5? No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is at m/z=156, which would be the [M]^•+ ion for the Cl-35 isotope. The Cl-37 isotope would cause the [M+2Cl]^•+? No, wait, no. Wait, I'm mixing things up. The actual molecular ion would be the molecule with Cl-35, so M would be 156 (since 156.5 is the average). But the molecular ion in mass spec is usually the most abundant, which is Cl-35, so 156. But wait, the problem states the molecular ion is at 156 (100%), and another peak at 158 (32%). So that 158 peak would be the Cl-37 isotope. The ratio is 32%, which is about a quarter of the 100% peak. Cl-35 is about 75%, Cl-37 is 25%. So the ratio between M and M+2 peaks is 3:1. So the molecular ion at 156 (Cl-35) is 100%, and the M+2 at 158 (Cl-37) is 25% of the molecular ion. But wait, in the given data, the 158 peak is 32%. Hmm, that's a bit higher than 25%. Maybe it's due to a different number of Cl atoms? Wait, but all the options have only one Cl. So maybe that's a clue. So let's park this for now and look at the other data.

Next, the IR spectrum. It shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. A strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That peak is in the range of carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters, or acid chlorides. So the presence of a carbonyl group is indicated.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: has a hydroxyl group (OH) and an aldehyde group. The aldehyde would show a strong peak around 1720 cm^-1, and the OH would show a broad peak.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has an O-H stretch (broad) and a carbonyl (around 1700 cm^-1). Wait, but I remember that carboxylic acids have lower wavenumber for the carbonyl (like around 1700-1725). Also, the O-H in carboxylic acids is usually broad and strong.

C) Phenyl chloroformate: which is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. That would have an ester group. The carbonyl in esters is around 1720-1740 cm^-1. Also, the O in the ester might not have an O-H stretch, unless there's something else. Wait, but chloroformate is an acid derivative. Hmm, but in the IR, the broad peak from 3500-2700 suggests an O-H. So if phenyl chloroformate is the compound, where would the O-H be? Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So it's an ester, right? So no hydroxyl group. So the broad peak might be something else. Maybe from another functional group.

Wait, but looking at the IR data, the broad peak is from 3500 to 2700. That's a wide range. An O-H stretch usually appears around 3200-3600, but broad. The 2700 could be an aldehyde C-H stretch? Or maybe an alcohol O-H. Wait, but the 1720 is a carbonyl. So if it's chloroformate, the carbonyl is there, but where's the O-H? Because phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph, so it's an ester. No hydroxyl groups. So the IR for option C wouldn't show a broad peak in 3500-2700. So maybe that's not the case. Unless I'm missing something.

Option D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: similar to option B, but the Cl is in position 2. So it's a carboxylic acid with Cl. So the IR would show the broad O-H of the acid and the carbonyl.

So the IR suggests either a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group. Looking at the options, A, B, D have a hydroxyl or a carboxylic acid group (which has both OH and COOH), while C doesn't.

So that would suggest that the compound is either A, B, or D.

Now, moving on to the 1H NMR data:

The peaks are: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H).

At 11.0 ppm, that's a singlet, probably an aldehyde proton (which is usually around 9-10 ppm) or possibly an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm, as singlets because they're exchange broadened. But in D2O, they might disappear, but in NMR, they can appear as broad singlets. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but 11 is a bit high for an aldehyde. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, B and D are benzoic acids (so have a COOH group), which would have a proton around 11 ppm. Option A is a benzaldehyde with an OH group (phenolic OH), which would show a peak around 5 ppm (but that's broad) or if it's an aldehyde, maybe. Wait, no, wait: in 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the structure is:

O
|
O-C6H3-Cl
with the OH at position 2 and aldehyde at position 3. So the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But in the NMR, the peak at 11.0 is a singlet. Could that be the aldehyde? Or is it an acidic proton elsewhere?

Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid (options B and D), the COOH proton would be around 10-12 ppm. So the 11.0 ppm peak could be that.

Now, looking at the aromatic protons:

8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, because the two doublets each with 2H are typical of para-substituted benzene rings. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the protons ortho to the substituent are split into a doublet with coupling around 8-8.5 ppm, and the meta are lower. Or wait, let me think. If we have a substituent in the para position, the protons adjacent to it (ortho) would be deshielded and appear downfield, and the protons para to that would be another substituent, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, looking at the NMR data:

The two doublets each have 2H. So if the ring has two substituents, perhaps in a para position relative to each other. Let me think about the structures.

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid: the substituents are Cl and COOH in the para positions. So the benzene ring would have COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4 (or vice versa, but same effect). The protons ortho to COOH would be at higher ppm.

In benzoic acid, the COOH group is at position 1, so the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) are typically around 7.5-8.5 ppm. The para position (position 4) has Cl. So the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be at lower ppm than the ortho to COOH. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to visualize:

Structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid:

COOH is at position 1, Cl at position 4. So positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH, and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl.

The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be deshielded and appear upfield or downfield? Wait, in para-substituted benzoic acids, the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) are typically around 8.0-8.1 ppm as a doublet, and the meta protons (3 and 5) are around 7.5-7.6 ppm as another doublet.

Wait, but in this NMR data, the higher ppm is 8.02 (d, 2H) and lower is 7.72 (d, 2H). So that fits with the para-substituted pattern. So that would fit with option B or D.

Wait, option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So substituents are COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 2. So the ring would have COOH at 1, Cl at 2, and then H's at positions 3,4,5,6.

In this case, the protons ortho to COOH would be position 2 (Cl, so no H) and position 6. The meta to COOH would be position 3 and 5. The para position to COOH is position 4, which has H.

Wait, this might complicate the NMR. Let me think. In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the ring would have H's at 3,4,5,6.

Proton at position 4 is para to COOH, so it's deshielded. Protons at positions 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and have Cl in position 2, which is adjacent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, leading to a more symmetrical pattern, which would give the two doublets as described in the NMR.

Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets each integrating for 2H. So in para-substituted rings, you have two sets of doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent has two ortho H's which are equivalent, leading to two doublets.

So for 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B), the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The ortho protons to COOH are positions 2 and 6, which are equivalent. The ortho protons to Cl would be positions 3 and 5, which are equivalent. But wait, in that case, the protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. The protons at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

Wait, but the coupling between these protons would cause the doublets. So let's see: if the substituents are at 1 and 4, the H's at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. The H's at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

In such a scenario, the H's at 2 and 6 would be deshielded more due to the electron-withdrawing COOH group, so they would appear downfield. The H's at 3 and 5 would be near the Cl, which is slightly electron-withdrawing, but perhaps not as much as COOH. So the H's at 2 and 6 would be around 8.0 ppm, and H's at 3 and 5 around 7.7 ppm. That matches the NMR data.

So for option B, the NMR would show two doublets, integrating for 2H each, at around 8.0 and 7.7 ppm. That fits.

Now, looking at option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

Structure: HO-C6H3-CHO with Cl at position 3 and OH at position 2. So the substituents are at positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and the aldehyde at position 1. Wait, actually, benzaldehyde is at position 1, so substituents would be at 2 (OH) and 3 (Cl).

In that case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 4,5,6. Wait, let me think. The positions are 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and the other positions are 4,5,6.

Wait, no. For benzaldehyde, the aldehyde is at position 1. If the molecule is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, then position 2 is OH and position 3 is Cl. So positions 4,5,6 would have H's.

In such a case, the substituents are at 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). So the ring would have H's at 4,5,6.

The H at position 4 is ortho to Cl (position 3) and meta to OH (position 2). The H at position 5 is meta to Cl and para to OH. The H at position 6 is ortho to OH and meta to Cl.

Hmm, the NMR for this would be more complex. Let me think: the H's at position 4 and 6 would be ortho to substituents, perhaps leading to more splitting. But the given NMR only shows two doublets, each 2H. That suggests a simpler pattern, which might not match option A. So perhaps option A is less likely.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the ring would have an ester group (O-CO-Cl) attached. Wait, no, it's Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the substituent is O-CO-Cl attached to the benzene ring.

In that case, how would the aromatic protons look? The substituent is at one position (let's say position 1), so the H's at 2,3,4,5,6 would be present. The substituent is electron-withdrawing, so the ortho and para positions would be deshielded.

In such a case, the aromatic protons might show a more complex splitting, perhaps as a doublet of doublets or other multiplets, but the given NMR shows two doublets each of 2H. That suggests a para-substituted ring, which I'm not sure if that's the case here. Also, phenyl chloroformate doesn't have an OH group, so the IR's broad peak might not fit unless it's from another source. But in that case, where would the O-H come from? It doesn't, so perhaps option C is less likely.

Now, let's go back to the IR data. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. Carboxylic acids typically have a carbonyl around 1700-1725 cm^-1, but the peak is sharp. Wait, but I thought carboxylic acids have broader carbonyl peaks due to hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, if the carbonyl is more electron-deficient, the peak could be higher. For example, acid chlorides have carbonyls around 1800 cm^-1. Ester carbonyls are around 1720-1740 cm^-1, which fits the 1720 peak.

So if the peak is at 1720 cm^-1, it could be an ester (like option C) or possibly a ketone or aldehyde. But wait, in the NMR, there's a peak at 11.0 ppm. For an ester, where is the O-H? There isn't one. So if option C is the case, the IR's broad peak (3500-2700) can't be explained, so that's a problem.

Alternatively, for the other options, the broad IR peak is from O-H. So if the carbonyl is at 1720, and it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit. But wait, carboxylic acids' carbonyls are usually around 1700, but could be higher. So options B and D have COOH groups.

Wait, looking back, the IR has 1720 cm^-1. For benzoic acid derivatives, the carbonyl is around 1670-1700, but sometimes can be higher, especially if the substituents are electron-withdrawing. So maybe a Cl substituent could cause a higher wavenumber. So this could fit with options B and D.

Now, the NMR data:

The 11.0 ppm singlet is a strong indication for a carboxylic acid proton. So options B and D both have COOH groups. Let's look at their structures.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. COOH at position 1, Cl at position 4.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. COOH at position 1, Cl at position 2.

The NMR for option B would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, each 2H, which fits the data. For option D, the aromatic protons would be in a different pattern. Let's think:

In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are COOH (position 1) and Cl (position 2). The aromatic H's are at positions 3,4,5,6. The H's at positions 3 and 6 are adjacent to Cl (position 2), and the H's at 4 and 5 are across.

Wait, actually, in that structure, the H at position 3 is adjacent to Cl (position 2), and H at position 4 is adjacent to position 3. Hmm, perhaps the splitting would be more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the ring would have two sets of protons: one set at 8.0 ppm and another at 7.7 ppm. But I'm not sure. Perhaps the coupling constants would be different, leading to different shifts.

Wait, another approach: in benzoic acid derivatives, the protons ortho to the COOH group are usually more deshielded and appear downfield. So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) would be meta to Cl. But the presence of Cl (a strong electron-withdrawing group) at position 4 would have a significant effect on the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the two doublets are due to two sets of equivalent protons. For example, in para-substituted rings with two substituents, you get two doublets.

Wait, in option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 and 4. So the ring would have:

- Protons at 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH and meta to Cl)
- Protons at 3 and 5 (meta to COOH and ortho to Cl)

Each pair would be equivalent due to symmetry. So protons at 2 and 6 would show up as a doublet around 8.0 ppm, and protons at 3 and 5 as another doublet around 7.7 ppm. That's exactly what the NMR data shows: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So that's a good fit.

In option D, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 and 2. The ring would have:

- Protons at 3 and 6 (adjacent to Cl at 2)
- Protons at 4 and 5 (para and meta positions)

But in this case, the symmetry is less, so the NMR would show more complex splitting. For example, the H at position 3 (ortho to Cl) would be more deshielded than H at position 6 (meta to Cl and ortho to COOH). So perhaps the NMR would show more than two doublets, or perhaps a triplet or something else, but the given data only shows two doublets. Thus, option D might not fit the NMR data as well as option B.

Therefore, putting it all together:

- Molecular weight around 156, with Cl (so isotopic peaks at 156 and 158 with 75% and 25% abundance, which fits the 100% and 32% given, approximately). Wait, wait, the 158 peak is 32%. If Cl has 25% abundance, 32% is a bit higher than expected. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me think about that.

The molecular ion peak (M) is at 156, which is the Cl-35 isotope. The M+2 peak (158) comes from Cl-37. So the abundance ratio between M and M+2 should be 3:1 (75%:25%). But the given data is 100% at 156 and 32% at 158. So the 158 is 32% of 156. So relative abundance is 32 / 100 = 0.32. The expected ratio for Cl-35 and Cl-37 is 3:1, so M is 3 times more than M+2. Wait, 32% is 32 of M, which would be 32/(100) = 0.32. So for a 3:1 ratio, M would be 3 parts, M+2 1 part. So M+2 should be 25% of M. But in the data, M+2 is 32% of M. That's a bit higher than expected.

Is there a possibility that there are two Cl atoms in the molecule? Let me check the molecular formulas again.

Option B: C7H5ClO2. Only one Cl.

So that would give M and M+2 peaks in a 3:1 ratio. So why is the M+2 peak 32% of M? That's higher than 25%. Maybe it's an error in the problem, or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, could it be that the molecular formula includes two Cl atoms? Let me check the options:

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: C7H5ClO2. One Cl.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: same.

C) Phenyl chloroformate: same.

D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: same.

So all options have one Cl. Therefore, the M and M+2 should be in a 3:1 ratio. The given data shows M+2 as 32% of M, which is 32, which is about 4 times higher than the 25% expected. Wait, no, 32 is 32% of the M peak. So that's 32% relative to 100%, which is an M+2 peak of 0.32 times the M peak. But according to Cl's natural abundance, M+2 should be about 0.25 times M. So why is it 0.32?

Hmm, maybe the molecular formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is not the [M]^+ but something else. Or perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula includes two Cl atoms. Wait, any of the options have two Cl? No, all four options have one Cl. So the M and M+2 peaks should be in 3:1 ratio, but the data shows a higher ratio. That could suggest that my earlier assumption about the molecular formula is incorrect. Wait, but the molecular weight is 156. If the molecule had two Cl, the molecular weight would be higher. 156 - (Cl:35.5) = 120.5, adding two Cl would make 120.5 +71 = 191.5, which doesn't fit the given M of 156. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is not the one I'm thinking. Maybe the molecular ion is at 156, but the chlorine is actually contributing to a different mass. Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is not the only peak. Maybe the molecular ion is at 156, but the peak at 158 isn't the M+2, but something else, like a fragment. But that doesn't make sense because the M+2 peak for a molecule with Cl should be the molecular ion plus 2, which is 158.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecular ion is not the main peak because of some other factors, like the presence of other isotopes. Alternatively, the peak at 158 could be a fragment. But without more information, I think I have to proceed with the assumption that the data fits best with option B.

So putting it all together:

- IR shows O-H (broad) and carbonyl (sharp at 1720 cm^-1)
- NMR shows 11 ppm singlet (COOH), and two doublets (para-substituted ring)
- Mass suggests one Cl, with M and M+2 in 3:1 ratio, but data shows 100 and 32, which is 3.125:1, close enough.

Therefore, the most likely option is B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** (100%) and a secondary peak at **m/z = 158** (32%) suggest a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom, as chlorine has two isotopes (Cl-35 at 75% and Cl-37 at 25%). The observed ratio of 100% at 156 and 32% at 158 is close to the expected 3:1 ratio for Cl-35 and Cl-37, confirming the presence of one chlorine atom.

The **IR spectrum** shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests the compound contains either a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde group.

The **¹H NMR** data includes:
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: A singlet in this region is consistent with a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   This compound contains an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group. The aldehyde proton typically appears around 9-10 ppm, but the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid proton. Additionally, the aromatic protons in this structure would not produce the observed two doublets, as the substituents (Cl and OH) are not para to each other. Thus, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in the para position. The carboxylic acid proton explains the singlet at 11.0 ppm, and the para-substitution pattern accounts for the two doublets in the aromatic region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm). The IR data also aligns with this structure, as the broad O-H stretch and sharp carbonyl peak are consistent with a carboxylic acid. The molecular weight and isotopic peaks further support this option.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   This compound contains an ester group (Cl-CO-O-Ph). However, it lacks a hydroxyl group, making it inconsistent with the broad O-H stretch observed in the IR spectrum. Additionally, the aromatic protons in phenyl chloroformate would not produce the observed two doublets. Thus, this option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in the ortho position. While the carboxylic acid proton could explain the singlet at 11.0 ppm, the ortho substitution would result in a more complex splitting pattern for the aromatic protons, inconsistent with the observed two doublets. Therefore, this option is less likely than B.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular weight, isotopic peaks, IR and NMR data, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The para-substitution pattern explains the NMR splitting, the carboxylic acid group accounts for the IR peaks, and the molecular weight matches the given data.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem where I need to figure out what an unknown compound is based on spectral data. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The problem states that the chemist found a white solid. The spectral information includes mass, IR, and 1H NMR data. The options are four different chlorinated aromatic compounds. Let's go through each piece of data one by one and see what they tell me.

Starting with the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 and it's 100%, so that's the molecular weight. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. I remember that molecular ion peaks can sometimes be accompanied by isotopic peaks. Chlorine has a significant natural abundance of its isotopes—about 75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37. So if the molecular formula includes a chlorine atom, the molecular ion would have two peaks: one for Cl-35 and another for Cl-37. Let me calculate the possible molecular weights.

Wait, the molecular ion is at 156. Let me think about the possible formula. If the molecular weight is 156, and there's a chlorine in the molecule, the molecular formula would need to sum up to 156. Let's consider each option:

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding Cl, OH, and another O? Wait, no: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is C7H5ClO2. Let's compute: C=12*7=84, H=5*1=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. Sum: 84 +5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Hmm, so approximately 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm.

Option B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl gives C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 12*7=84, 5*1=5, 35.5, 16*2=32. Total: 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5 again. So same as option A.

Option C) Phenyl chloroformate. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. Its formula would be C7H5ClO2 as well. So same molecular weight. So all three options (A, B, C) have the same formula. What about D?

Option D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same as B, I think. Structure would be Cl in position 2. Same formula, same molecular weight.

Wait, but wait. Looking back, the molecular ion is at 156, but when the molecule has Cl, the molecular ion should be at 156+2=158? No, wait, Cl has two common isotopes: 35Cl (75%) and 37Cl (25%). So the molecular ion would have a peak at m/z corresponding to both isotopes. For a molecule with one Cl atom, the molecular ion would appear as two peaks: one at 156 (if Cl is 35) and another at 158 (37Cl). But wait, the molecular ion is at 156, which is 100%, and another peak at 158, 32%. Hmm. So the ratio between the peaks would be according to the natural abundance of Cl isotopes. Let me think: the M+ and M+2 peaks (where M is molecular weight without considering Cl) would be in the ratio of 75% : 25%. So if the molecular ion is 156 (100%?), but wait, I'm a bit confused. 

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the molecular weight and see if the isotopic peaks fit. Let me think, the molecular ion is the higher mass, or the lower? Let me think: the molecular formula for all options is C7H5ClO2. The molecular weight is 156.5. So the molecular ion would be at 156, but considering the Cl isotopes, the M and M+2 peaks? No, wait, the Cl-35 would give M = 156 (since 156.5 is approx. 156.5, so the 35Cl would make M = (exact mass is 156.5 - 35.5? No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is at m/z=156, which would be the [M]^•+ ion for the Cl-35 isotope. The Cl-37 isotope would cause the [M+2Cl]^•+? No, wait, no. Wait, I'm mixing things up. The actual molecular ion would be the molecule with Cl-35, so M would be 156 (since 156.5 is the average). But the molecular ion in mass spec is usually the most abundant, which is Cl-35, so 156. But wait, the problem states the molecular ion is at 156 (100%), and another peak at 158 (32%). So that 158 peak would be the Cl-37 isotope. The ratio is 32%, which is about a quarter of the 100% peak. Cl-35 is about 75%, Cl-37 is 25%. So the ratio between M and M+2 peaks is 3:1. So the molecular ion at 156 (Cl-35) is 100%, and the M+2 at 158 (Cl-37) is 25% of the molecular ion. But wait, in the given data, the 158 peak is 32%. Hmm, that's a bit higher than 25%. Maybe it's due to a different number of Cl atoms? Wait, but all the options have only one Cl. So maybe that's a clue. So let's park this for now and look at the other data.

Next, the IR spectrum. It shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. A strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That peak is in the range of carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters, or acid chlorides. So the presence of a carbonyl group is indicated.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: has a hydroxyl group (OH) and an aldehyde group. The aldehyde would show a strong peak around 1720 cm^-1, and the OH would show a broad peak.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has an O-H stretch (broad) and a carbonyl (around 1700 cm^-1). Wait, but I remember that carboxylic acids have lower wavenumber for the carbonyl (like around 1700-1725). Also, the O-H in carboxylic acids is usually broad and strong.

C) Phenyl chloroformate: which is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. That would have an ester group. The carbonyl in esters is around 1720-1740 cm^-1. Also, the O in the ester might not have an O-H stretch, unless there's something else. Wait, but chloroformate is an acid derivative. Hmm, but in the IR, the broad peak from 3500-2700 suggests an O-H. So if phenyl chloroformate is the compound, where would the O-H be? Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So it's an ester, right? So no hydroxyl group. So the broad peak might be something else. Maybe from another functional group.

Wait, but looking at the IR data, the broad peak is from 3500 to 2700. That's a wide range. An O-H stretch usually appears around 3200-3600, but broad. The 2700 could be an aldehyde C-H stretch? Or maybe an alcohol O-H. Wait, but the 1720 is a carbonyl. So if it's chloroformate, the carbonyl is there, but where's the O-H? Because phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph, so it's an ester. No hydroxyl groups. So the IR for option C wouldn't show a broad peak in 3500-2700. So maybe that's not the case. Unless I'm missing something.

Option D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: similar to option B, but the Cl is in position 2. So it's a carboxylic acid with Cl. So the IR would show the broad O-H of the acid and the carbonyl.

So the IR suggests either a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group. Looking at the options, A, B, D have a hydroxyl or a carboxylic acid group (which has both OH and COOH), while C doesn't.

So that would suggest that the compound is either A, B, or D.

Now, moving on to the 1H NMR data:

The peaks are: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H).

At 11.0 ppm, that's a singlet, probably an aldehyde proton (which is usually around 9-10 ppm) or possibly an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm, as singlets because they're exchange broadened. But in D2O, they might disappear, but in NMR, they can appear as broad singlets. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but 11 is a bit high for an aldehyde. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, B and D are benzoic acids (so have a COOH group), which would have a proton around 11 ppm. Option A is a benzaldehyde with an OH group (phenolic OH), which would show a peak around 5 ppm (but that's broad) or if it's an aldehyde, maybe. Wait, no, wait: in 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the structure is:

O
|
O-C6H3-Cl
with the OH at position 2 and aldehyde at position 3. So the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But in the NMR, the peak at 11.0 is a singlet. Could that be the aldehyde? Or is it an acidic proton elsewhere?

Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid (options B and D), the COOH proton would be around 10-12 ppm. So the 11.0 ppm peak could be that.

Now, looking at the aromatic protons:

8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, because the two doublets each with 2H are typical of para-substituted benzene rings. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the protons ortho to the substituent are split into a doublet with coupling around 8-8.5 ppm, and the meta are lower. Or wait, let me think. If we have a substituent in the para position, the protons adjacent to it (ortho) would be deshielded and appear downfield, and the protons para to that would be another substituent, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, looking at the NMR data:

The two doublets each have 2H. So if the ring has two substituents, perhaps in a para position relative to each other. Let me think about the structures.

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid: the substituents are Cl and COOH in the para positions. So the benzene ring would have COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4 (or vice versa, but same effect). The protons ortho to COOH would be at higher ppm.

In benzoic acid, the COOH group is at position 1, so the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) are typically around 7.5-8.5 ppm. The para position (position 4) has Cl. So the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be at lower ppm than the ortho to COOH. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to visualize:

Structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid:

COOH is at position 1, Cl at position 4. So positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH, and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl.

The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be deshielded and appear upfield or downfield? Wait, in para-substituted benzoic acids, the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) are typically around 8.0-8.1 ppm as a doublet, and the meta protons (3 and 5) are around 7.5-7.6 ppm as another doublet.

Wait, but in this NMR data, the higher ppm is 8.02 (d, 2H) and lower is 7.72 (d, 2H). So that fits with the para-substituted pattern. So that would fit with option B or D.

Wait, option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So substituents are COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 2. So the ring would have COOH at 1, Cl at 2, and then H's at positions 3,4,5,6.

In this case, the protons ortho to COOH would be position 2 (Cl, so no H) and position 6. The meta to COOH would be position 3 and 5. The para position to COOH is position 4, which has H.

Wait, this might complicate the NMR. Let me think. In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the ring would have H's at 3,4,5,6.

Proton at position 4 is para to COOH, so it's deshielded. Protons at positions 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and have Cl in position 2, which is adjacent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, leading to a more symmetrical pattern, which would give the two doublets as described in the NMR.

Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets each integrating for 2H. So in para-substituted rings, you have two sets of doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent has two ortho H's which are equivalent, leading to two doublets.

So for 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B), the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The ortho protons to COOH are positions 2 and 6, which are equivalent. The ortho protons to Cl would be positions 3 and 5, which are equivalent. But wait, in that case, the protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. The protons at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

Wait, but the coupling between these protons would cause the doublets. So let's see: if the substituents are at 1 and 4, the H's at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. The H's at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

In such a scenario, the H's at 2 and 6 would be deshielded more due to the electron-withdrawing COOH group, so they would appear downfield. The H's at 3 and 5 would be near the Cl, which is slightly electron-withdrawing, but perhaps not as much as COOH. So the H's at 2 and 6 would be around 8.0 ppm, and H's at 3 and 5 around 7.7 ppm. That matches the NMR data.

So for option B, the NMR would show two doublets, integrating for 2H each, at around 8.0 and 7.7 ppm. That fits.

Now, looking at option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

Structure: HO-C6H3-CHO with Cl at position 3 and OH at position 2. So the substituents are at positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and the aldehyde at position 1. Wait, actually, benzaldehyde is at position 1, so substituents would be at 2 (OH) and 3 (Cl).

In that case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 4,5,6. Wait, let me think. The positions are 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and the other positions are 4,5,6.

Wait, no. For benzaldehyde, the aldehyde is at position 1. If the molecule is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, then position 2 is OH and position 3 is Cl. So positions 4,5,6 would have H's.

In such a case, the substituents are at 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). So the ring would have H's at 4,5,6.

The H at position 4 is ortho to Cl (position 3) and meta to OH (position 2). The H at position 5 is meta to Cl and para to OH. The H at position 6 is ortho to OH and meta to Cl.

Hmm, the NMR for this would be more complex. Let me think: the H's at position 4 and 6 would be ortho to substituents, perhaps leading to more splitting. But the given NMR only shows two doublets, each 2H. That suggests a simpler pattern, which might not match option A. So perhaps option A is less likely.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the ring would have an ester group (O-CO-Cl) attached. Wait, no, it's Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the substituent is O-CO-Cl attached to the benzene ring.

In that case, how would the aromatic protons look? The substituent is at one position (let's say position 1), so the H's at 2,3,4,5,6 would be present. The substituent is electron-withdrawing, so the ortho and para positions would be deshielded.

In such a case, the aromatic protons might show a more complex splitting, perhaps as a doublet of doublets or other multiplets, but the given NMR shows two doublets each of 2H. That suggests a para-substituted ring, which I'm not sure if that's the case here. Also, phenyl chloroformate doesn't have an OH group, so the IR's broad peak might not fit unless it's from another source. But in that case, where would the O-H come from? It doesn't, so perhaps option C is less likely.

Now, let's go back to the IR data. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. Carboxylic acids typically have a carbonyl around 1700-1725 cm^-1, but the peak is sharp. Wait, but I thought carboxylic acids have broader carbonyl peaks due to hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, if the carbonyl is more electron-deficient, the peak could be higher. For example, acid chlorides have carbonyls around 1800 cm^-1. Ester carbonyls are around 1720-1740 cm^-1, which fits the 1720 peak.

So if the peak is at 1720 cm^-1, it could be an ester (like option C) or possibly a ketone or aldehyde. But wait, in the NMR, there's a peak at 11.0 ppm. For an ester, where is the O-H? There isn't one. So if option C is the case, the IR's broad peak (3500-2700) can't be explained, so that's a problem.

Alternatively, for the other options, the broad IR peak is from O-H. So if the carbonyl is at 1720, and it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit. But wait, carboxylic acids' carbonyls are usually around 1700, but could be higher. So options B and D have COOH groups.

Wait, looking back, the IR has 1720 cm^-1. For benzoic acid derivatives, the carbonyl is around 1670-1700, but sometimes can be higher, especially if the substituents are electron-withdrawing. So maybe a Cl substituent could cause a higher wavenumber. So this could fit with options B and D.

Now, the NMR data:

The 11.0 ppm singlet is a strong indication for a carboxylic acid proton. So options B and D both have COOH groups. Let's look at their structures.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. COOH at position 1, Cl at position 4.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. COOH at position 1, Cl at position 2.

The NMR for option B would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, each 2H, which fits the data. For option D, the aromatic protons would be in a different pattern. Let's think:

In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are COOH (position 1) and Cl (position 2). The aromatic H's are at positions 3,4,5,6. The H's at positions 3 and 6 are adjacent to Cl (position 2), and the H's at 4 and 5 are across.

Wait, actually, in that structure, the H at position 3 is adjacent to Cl (position 2), and H at position 4 is adjacent to position 3. Hmm, perhaps the splitting would be more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the ring would have two sets of protons: one set at 8.0 ppm and another at 7.7 ppm. But I'm not sure. Perhaps the coupling constants would be different, leading to different shifts.

Wait, another approach: in benzoic acid derivatives, the protons ortho to the COOH group are usually more deshielded and appear downfield. So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) would be meta to Cl. But the presence of Cl (a strong electron-withdrawing group) at position 4 would have a significant effect on the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the two doublets are due to two sets of equivalent protons. For example, in para-substituted rings with two substituents, you get two doublets.

Wait, in option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 and 4. So the ring would have:

- Protons at 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH and meta to Cl)
- Protons at 3 and 5 (meta to COOH and ortho to Cl)

Each pair would be equivalent due to symmetry. So protons at 2 and 6 would show up as a doublet around 8.0 ppm, and protons at 3 and 5 as another doublet around 7.7 ppm. That's exactly what the NMR data shows: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So that's a good fit.

In option D, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 and 2. The ring would have:

- Protons at 3 and 6 (adjacent to Cl at 2)
- Protons at 4 and 5 (para and meta positions)

But in this case, the symmetry is less, so the NMR would show more complex splitting. For example, the H at position 3 (ortho to Cl) would be more deshielded than H at position 6 (meta to Cl and ortho to COOH). So perhaps the NMR would show more than two doublets, or perhaps a triplet or something else, but the given data only shows two doublets. Thus, option D might not fit the NMR data as well as option B.

Therefore, putting it all together:

- Molecular weight around 156, with Cl (so isotopic peaks at 156 and 158 with 75% and 25% abundance, which fits the 100% and 32% given, approximately). Wait, wait, the 158 peak is 32%. If Cl has 25% abundance, 32% is a bit higher than expected. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me think about that.

The molecular ion peak (M) is at 156, which is the Cl-35 isotope. The M+2 peak (158) comes from Cl-37. So the abundance ratio between M and M+2 should be 3:1 (75%:25%). But the given data is 100% at 156 and 32% at 158. So the 158 is 32% of 156. So relative abundance is 32 / 100 = 0.32. The expected ratio for Cl-35 and Cl-37 is 3:1, so M is 3 times more than M+2. Wait, 32% is 32 of M, which would be 32/(100) = 0.32. So for a 3:1 ratio, M would be 3 parts, M+2 1 part. So M+2 should be 25% of M. But in the data, M+2 is 32% of M. That's a bit higher than expected.

Is there a possibility that there are two Cl atoms in the molecule? Let me check the molecular formulas again.

Option B: C7H5ClO2. Only one Cl.

So that would give M and M+2 peaks in a 3:1 ratio. So why is the M+2 peak 32% of M? That's higher than 25%. Maybe it's an error in the problem, or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, could it be that the molecular formula includes two Cl atoms? Let me check the options:

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: C7H5ClO2. One Cl.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: same.

C) Phenyl chloroformate: same.

D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: same.

So all options have one Cl. Therefore, the M and M+2 should be in a 3:1 ratio. The given data shows M+2 as 32% of M, which is 32, which is about 4 times higher than the 25% expected. Wait, no, 32 is 32% of the M peak. So that's 32% relative to 100%, which is an M+2 peak of 0.32 times the M peak. But according to Cl's natural abundance, M+2 should be about 0.25 times M. So why is it 0.32?

Hmm, maybe the molecular formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is not the [M]^+ but something else. Or perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula includes two Cl atoms. Wait, any of the options have two Cl? No, all four options have one Cl. So the M and M+2 peaks should be in 3:1 ratio, but the data shows a higher ratio. That could suggest that my earlier assumption about the molecular formula is incorrect. Wait, but the molecular weight is 156. If the molecule had two Cl, the molecular weight would be higher. 156 - (Cl:35.5) = 120.5, adding two Cl would make 120.5 +71 = 191.5, which doesn't fit the given M of 156. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is not the one I'm thinking. Maybe the molecular ion is at 156, but the chlorine is actually contributing to a different mass. Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is not the only peak. Maybe the molecular ion is at 156, but the peak at 158 isn't the M+2, but something else, like a fragment. But that doesn't make sense because the M+2 peak for a molecule with Cl should be the molecular ion plus 2, which is 158.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecular ion is not the main peak because of some other factors, like the presence of other isotopes. Alternatively, the peak at 158 could be a fragment. But without more information, I think I have to proceed with the assumption that the data fits best with option B.

So putting it all together:

- IR shows O-H (broad) and carbonyl (sharp at 1720 cm^-1)
- NMR shows 11 ppm singlet (COOH), and two doublets (para-substituted ring)
- Mass suggests one Cl, with M and M+2 in 3:1 ratio, but data shows 100 and 32, which is 3.125:1, close enough.

Therefore, the most likely option is B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** (100%) and a secondary peak at **m/z = 158** (32%) suggest a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom, as chlorine has two isotopes (Cl-35 at 75% and Cl-37 at 25%). The observed ratio of 100% at 156 and 32% at 158 is close to the expected 3:1 ratio for Cl-35 and Cl-37, confirming the presence of one chlorine atom.

The **IR spectrum** shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests the compound contains either a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde group.

The **¹H NMR** data includes:
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: A singlet in this region is consistent with a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   This compound contains an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group. The aldehyde proton typically appears around 9-10 ppm, but the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid proton. Additionally, the aromatic protons in this structure would not produce the observed two doublets, as the substituents (Cl and OH) are not para to each other. Thus, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in the para position. The carboxylic acid proton explains the singlet at 11.0 ppm, and the para-substitution pattern accounts for the two doublets in the aromatic region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm). The IR data also aligns with this structure, as the broad O-H stretch and sharp carbonyl peak are consistent with a carboxylic acid. The molecular weight and isotopic peaks further support this option.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   This compound contains an ester group (Cl-CO-O-Ph). However, it lacks a hydroxyl group, making it inconsistent with the broad O-H stretch observed in the IR spectrum. Additionally, the aromatic protons in phenyl chloroformate would not produce the observed two doublets. Thus, this option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in the ortho position. While the carboxylic acid proton could explain the singlet at 11.0 ppm, the ortho substitution would result in a more complex splitting pattern for the aromatic protons, inconsistent with the observed two doublets. Therefore, this option is less likely than B.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular weight, isotopic peaks, IR and NMR data, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The para-substitution pattern explains the NMR splitting, the carboxylic acid group accounts for the IR peaks, and the molecular weight matches the given data.

**Answer: B**
