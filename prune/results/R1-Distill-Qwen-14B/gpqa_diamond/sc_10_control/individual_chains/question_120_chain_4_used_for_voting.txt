Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are all different power laws, like 1 over plx squared, cubed, etc.

Wait, okay, let me think. Parallax is a measure of how far away a star is. I remember that parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/distance. So a larger parallax means a closer star, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away.

Now, the problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Oh, probably uniformly in space, meaning the number density of stars is constant throughout the volume. So, you have the same number of stars per cubic parsec everywhere.

But we're looking at how the number of stars per unit parallax range changes with plx. So, for a given range of plx, like from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there?

Wait, parallax relates to distance. So, maybe I should express the volume in terms of distance and then relate it to parallax.

Parallax plx is 1/d, where d is the distance. So, if the parallax changes by a small amount dplx, how does that relate to the distance? Let me think, since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So the distance is inversely proportional to parallax.

If I have a thin shell at distance d, its thickness in terms of distance would be dd. But how does that translate to a change in parallax, dplx? Let's see. Differentiating both sides, dplx = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = -d² dplx. The negative sign just indicates that as d increases, plx decreases, which makes sense.

So, the volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)π R³, so the shell's volume is the difference between R and R+dr, which approximates to 4π R² dr for small dr.

But wait, in this case, the shell's volume would be 4π d² dd, right? Since we're considering a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd.

But we need to express this in terms of parallax. Since d = 1/plx, and dd = -d² dplx, substituting d gives dd = -(1/plx²) dplx.

So, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * [ -(1/plx²) dplx ].

Wait, wait. Let's be careful with signs. Since dplx is a positive quantity (we're considering a range), and dd is negative (because as plx increases, d decreases), perhaps I should take the absolute value. So, the thickness in distance would be |dd| = d^2 dplx.

So, volume dV = 4π d² |dd| =4π (1/plx)^2 * ( (1/plx²) dplx ) )

Wait, because d = 1/plx, so d squared is 1/plx^2. And |dd| is d^2 dplx, which is (1/plx^2) dplx.

Putting it together: dV = 4π * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx ) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recalculate.

Wait, d = 1/plx, so d squared is 1/plx^2. Then, |dd| = d^2 dplx = (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, dV = 4π d² |dd| = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2 dplx) ) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Hmm, so the volume element in terms of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4 times dplx.

But wait, the number of stars in that volume depends on the volume. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is constant. Let's call that constant n (number per cubic parsec). So, the number of stars in the volume element dV is n * dV.

So, number of stars dN = n * (4π (1/plx^4) dplx )

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, per unit dplx, the number is dN/d (dplx) = n *4π (1/plx^4 )

So, dN/dplxx = n *4π (1/plx^4 )

Wait, but the problem asks for how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So, as plx increases, how does the number per unit plx change?

So, the number per unit plx (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the parallax is inversely proportional to distance, and the volume element in terms of parallax is 1/plx^4.

So, the number of stars in a shell with a certain plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So, when plx increases (say, from 1 to 2), the number of stars in that plx range would drop as 1/(2)^4 = 1/16 times the number at plx=1.

But wait, another way to think about it: for stars uniformly distributed in space, the number density is n. So, the number of stars within a distance d and d+dd is n * 4π d² dd.

But d is 1/plx, so dd = ( -d² dplx ) → but again, considering positive change, we can write dd = (1/plx²) dplx.

So, the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx² dplx ) = n * 4π (1/plx^4 ) dplx.

So, the number per unit plx (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you change variables, you have to be careful about the Jacobian. I think I did the correct substitution, though. So, in terms of parallax, the volume element is 1/plx^4 dplx, which affects the number of stars.

So, the correct answer should be option A: ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. For a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \), the volume element is given by \( dV = 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Taking the absolute value, \( |dd| = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \).

The volume element in terms of parallax becomes:
\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this volume element is proportional to the volume:
\[
dN = n \, dV = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx},
\]
where \( n \) is the number density of stars. The number of stars per unit range of parallax is therefore:
\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**

Putting it together: dV = 4π * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx ) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, d = 1/plx, so d squared is 1/plx^2. Then, |dd| = d^2 dplx = (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, dV = 4π d² |dd| = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2 dplx) ) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, number of stars dN = n * (4π (1/plx^4) dplx )

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, per unit dplx, the number is dN/d (dplx) = n *4π (1/plx^4 )

So, dN/dplxx = n *4π (1/plx^4 )

Wait, but the problem asks for how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So, as plx increases, how does the number per unit plx change?

So, the number per unit plx (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. For a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \), the volume element is given by \( dV = 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Taking the absolute value, \( |dd| = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \).

The volume element in terms of parallax becomes:
\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this volume element is proportional to the volume:
\[
dN = n \, dV = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx},
\]
where \( n \) is the number density of stars. The number of stars per unit range of parallax is therefore:
\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
