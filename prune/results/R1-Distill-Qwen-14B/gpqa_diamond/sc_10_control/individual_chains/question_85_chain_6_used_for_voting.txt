Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors. Oh right, the formula involves the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, and since both planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out, I think.

The question gives me two planets, Planet1 and Planet2. Both are detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. So the star's properties are important here because the luminosity depends on them.

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. But wait, for equilibrium temperature, the mass and radius might not matter directly. I think the main factors are the star's luminosity and the planet's distance.

Wait, the question mentions radial velocity shifts. Oh right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The shift gives us the mass of the planet and the orbital period, but in this question, they give the shifts in terms of wavelength measured in forbidden lines.

Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å. Wait, so the shift is the Doppler shift due to the star's movement towards and away from us because of the planet's orbit.

The Doppler shift (Δλ) is related to the velocity (v) via Δλ/λ = v/c, where c is the speed of light. So the velocity amplitude K is given by K = c * (Δλ/λ).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Oh, but since both shifts are measured in the same line, I can compare their velocities. Let me compute K for each planet.

The star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the radial velocity method. The formula for K involves the planet's mass, the planet's orbital period, and other factors. But perhaps another approach is needed here.

Wait, the radial velocity method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which relates to the mass of the planet and the distance between the star and planet. Let's think about the formula for K. The formula is K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M sin i) / ( (P)^(1/3) (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star))^(1/3). But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, that term can be approximated, so K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) * M_planet sin i ) / ( (P)^(1/3) (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star))^(1/3) ≈ (2πG)^(1/3) M_planet sin i / (P^(1/3) M_star^(2/3)) ), since M_planet << M_star.

Wait, but I'm getting ahead of myself. The given data is the Doppler shift in the forbidden line. So each planet's mass causes the star to move, which shifts the line. So the Doppler shift tells us about the velocity of the star, which relates to the planet's mass and the distance (semi-major axis) of the planet's orbit.

Wait, but for the equilibrium temperature, I need the distance of each planet from the star because the temperature depends on the inverse square of the distance. So the key is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet1 and Planet2. Once I have that, I can find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

So, how to find the ratio of their semi-major axes? Well, from the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. But wait, I don't have the periods given. Hmm.

Wait, the problem states that both planets are in circular orbits, but it doesn't provide their orbital periods. So perhaps I can relate the Doppler shifts to their distance from the star, which is the semi-major axis.

Wait, the Doppler shift is proportional to the star's velocity, which is K. So, the shift Δλ is proportional to K. So, K1/K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2. Wait, because Δλ is proportional to K, since Δλ = (v/c) * λ. So the ratio K1/K2 = (Δλ1 / Δλ2) * (λ2 / λ1). But here, both shifts are in the same forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. So λ is same for both. So K1/K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.

So K1 = (3/4) K2.

But K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is given by the formula K = (v) = (27 * π * G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (P)^(1/3) (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ) ), but since M_p is much less than M_s, it's approximately K ≈ ( (27 * π * G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (P)^(1/3) (M_s)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, but without knowing the periods, how can I relate K to the semi-major axis? Because the semi-major axis a is related to the period via Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M_s + M_p))/(4π²). Again, M_p is negligible, so a^3 = [G M_s P²]/(4 π²).

But since I don't have P, but have K, perhaps I can find a relation between a1 and a2.

Wait, another approach: since K is proportional to (M_p) / (a (1 - e²)^(0.5)), but for circular orbits, e=0. So K ≈ (M_p) / a.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2 π / P)^(1/3) * (1/(c))

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me look for a better approach.

Alternatively, the semi-amplitude K can be expressed as:

K = (v) = [ (27 * π G) / (c^3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s)^2 (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( 1 / (P) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe it's too complicated. Alternatively, since both planets are orbiting the same star, perhaps the ratio of their K's can be related to their masses and their semi-major axes.

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (2 π G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (P)^(1/3) (M_s)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_s))^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_s, we can approximate 1/(1 + M_p/M_s)^(1/3) ≈ 1. So K ≈ (2 π G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i / ( P^(1/3) M_s^(2/3) ) )

Now, let's express K for each planet.

K1 = (2 π G)^(1/3) M1 sin i / ( P1^(1/3) M_s^(2/3) )

Similarly, K2 = (2 π G)^(1/3) M2 sin i / ( P2^(1/3) M_s^(2/3) )

So the ratio K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * (P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) )

But from Kepler's third law, (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_s + M_p)/(4 π²). Since M_p is much smaller than M_s, M_s + M_p ≈ M_s.

So for each planet:

a1^3 / P1^2 = G M_s / (4 π² ) → P1 = [ (4 π² a1^3) / (G M_s) ) ]^(1/2)

So, P1 = ( (4 π² a1^3) / (G M_s) )^(1/2 )

Similarly, P2 = ( (4 π² a2^3 ) / ( G M_s ) )^(1/2 )

So, P1/P2 = ( a1^3 / a2^3 )^(1/2 )

Let me take the cube root of (a1/a2)^3, so (a1/a2)^3 = (P1^2 / P2^2) * (M_s / M_s) ) → a1/a2 = (P1^2 / P2^2 )^(1/3 )

But wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled. Let's try to write P in terms of a.

P = sqrt( (4 π² a^3)/( G M_s ) ) )

So P is proportional to a^(3/2) / sqrt(M_s). But M_s is the same for both planets.

So, P1/P2 = (a1/a2)^(3/2) )

So, P1 = (a1/a2)^(3/2) * P2.

But going back to the ratio K1/K2.

We have K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) )

Substituting P1 in terms of a1 and a2.

P1 = ( a1^3 / a2^3 )^(1/2) * (P2) ?

Wait, perhaps I should substitute the expression for P1.

P1 = (a1^3 / a2^3)^(1/2) * (P2) )?

Wait, no, because P1 = sqrt( (4 π² a1^3)/(G M_s) ) )

Similarly, P2 = sqrt( (4 π² a2^3)/(G M_s) ) )

So, P1/P2 = sqrt( (a1^3)/(a2^3) ) ) ) = (a1/a2)^(3/2) )

Which implies P1 = P2 * (a1/a2)^(3/2 )

So, P2 = P1 * (a2/a1)^(3/2 )

Now, let's substitute P1 into the K ratio equation.

K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) )

= (M1/M2) * ( (P2 / P1 ) )^(1/3 )

But P2/P1 = [ (a2 / a1 )^(3/2 ) ) ]

So,

K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * [ (a2/a1 )^(3/2 ) ]^(1/3 )

= (M1/M2) * (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

So,

K1/K2 = (M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But from earlier, from the Doppler shifts, K1 is 0.03 Å and K2 is 0.04 Å, same line. So K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4.

So,

3/4 = (M1/M2) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5 Earth masses.

So,

3/4 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Let me solve for sqrt(a2/a1) :

sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4) / (7/5) = (3/4) * (5/7) ) = 15/(28) ≈ 0.5357

So,

sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 → (a2/a1) = (15/28)^2 = 225 / 784 ≈ 0.287 approx.

Wait, but let me compute 225/784 accurately.

225 ÷ 784: Well, 784 is 28^2, 225 is 15^2.

But 225/784 = (15/28)^2. 15/28 is approx 0.5357.

So, a2 / a1 ≈ (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287.

So, a2 ≈ 0.287 * a1.

Wait, but I'm interested in a1 and a2 because the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star.

Equilibrium temperature formula is:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

But wait, actually, the equilibrium temperature is given by:

Te = T_eff * ( L / (16 π^2 sigma a^2) )^(1/4 )

Wait, no. Let me get the formula right.

The equilibrium temperature is given by:

Te = T_eff_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to express it in terms of the star's luminosity.

The star's luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

L = 4 π R_star^2 sigma Teff^4.

So, L = 4 π R^2 sigma T_eff^4.

The planet's equilibrium temperature is then:

Te = T_eff * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(0.25 )

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

The equilibrium temperature is given by the balance between the incoming stellar flux and the outgoing thermal radiation.

Incoming flux at distance a: S = L / (4 π a^2 )

Outgoing flux: S = sigma Te^4 (1 - A)

Setting them equal:

L/(4 π a^2) = sigma Te^4 (1 - A)

So,

Teff^4 = ( L / (4 π a^2) ) / ( sigma (1 - A) )

But L=4 π R_star^2 sigma Teff_star^4.

Substitute L:

Teff^4 = (4 π R_star^2 sigma Teff_star^4 ) / (4 π a^2 ) ) / ( sigma (1 - A) )

Simplify:

Teff^4 = ( R_star^2 Teff_star^4 ) / ( a^2 (1 - A) )

So,

Teff = Teff_star * sqrt( R_star / (a sqrt(1 - A)) )

Wait, no, let me compute that again. Let's take the fourth root of both sides.

Teff = Teff_star * ( R_star / (a sqrt(1 - A) ) )^(1/2 )

Which can be written as:

Teff = Teff_star * sqrt( R_star ) / ( a^(1/2) ) * 1/( (1 - A)^(1/4) )

So,

Te = Teff * sqrt(R) / sqrt(a) * (1/( (1 - A)^(1/4) ) )

But since both planets have the same albedo, A is the same for both, so the (1 - A) term is the same for both and cancels out when taking the ratio.

So,

Te1/Te2 = sqrt(R_star / a1) / sqrt(R_star / a2) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because sqrt( R_star / a1 ) divided by sqrt( R_star / a2 ) is sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which from earlier, a2/a1 ≈ (225/784) ≈ 0.287.

So, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( 0.287 ) ≈ sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

Wait, sqrt(0.287) is approximately 0.536.

So, Te1 ≈ 0.536 * Te2.

So the ratio Te1/Te2 is approximately 0.536. So, Te1 is about 0.536 times Te2. So the ratio is about 0.536, which is approximately 0.53. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53.

Wait, but wait. Earlier, we have a2/a1 ≈ 0.287, so a1 is bigger than a2. So Planet1 is farther away from the star than Planet2. So since a1 is larger, Te1 would be smaller than Te2. Because equilibrium temperature decreases with distance.

So the ratio Te1/Te2 is ~0.53.

So the correct answer should be option C: ~0.53.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by analyzing the given data. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

\[
T_e = T_{\text{eff, star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}} \cdot \left(\frac{1 - A}{1}\right)^{1/4}
\]

where \(T_{\text{eff, star}}\) is the star's effective temperature, \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the star's radius, \(a\) is the planet's semi-major axis, and \(A\) is the planet's albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo (\(A\)), the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends on the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.

### Step 1: Relating Radial Velocity Shifts to Semi-Major Axes
The radial velocity (RV) method provides the semi-amplitude \(K\), which is proportional to the Doppler shift. The problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of \(0.03 \, \text{Å}\), while Planet2 induces a shift of \(0.04 \, \text{Å}\). Since the shifts are measured in the same forbidden line, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{\Delta \lambda_1}{\Delta \lambda_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

The semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the planet's mass \(M_p\), the orbital period \(P\), and the semi-major axis \(a\) by:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{a}
\]

For circular orbits, the orbital period \(P\) is related to the semi-major axis \(a\) via Kepler's third law:

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_{\text{star}}}
\]

Substituting \(P^2 \propto a^3\) into the expression for \(K\), we find:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1 / a_1}{M_2 / a_2} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Rearranging for \(\sqrt{a_2 / a_1}\):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{K_1 / K_2}{M_1 / M_2}
\]

### Step 2: Substituting Known Values
The masses of the planets are \(M_1 = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\) and \(M_2 = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\). Substituting into the equation:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{(3/4)}{(7/5)} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{7} = \frac{15}{28} \approx 0.5357
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx (0.5357)^2 \approx 0.287
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures
The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \approx \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

This means Planet1's equilibrium temperature is approximately \(0.536\) times that of Planet2.

### Final Answer
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately \(0.53\).

Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors. Oh right, the formula involves the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo.

The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. So the star's properties are important here because the luminosity depends on them.

Wait, the question mentions radial velocity shifts. Oh right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The shift gives us the mass of the planet and the orbital period, but in this question, they give the shifts in terms of wavelength measured in forbidden lines.

Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å. Wait, so the shift is the Doppler shift due to the star's movement towards and away from us because of the planet's orbit.

The Doppler shift (Δλ) is related to the velocity (v) via Δλ/λ = v/c, where c is the speed of light. So the velocity amplitude K is given by K = c * (Δλ/λ).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Oh, but since both shifts are measured in the same line, I can compare their velocities. Let me compute K for each planet.

The star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the radial velocity method. The formula for K involves the planet's mass, the planet's orbital period, and other factors. But perhaps another approach is needed here.

Wait, the radial velocity method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which relates to the mass of the planet and the distance between the star and planet. Let's think about the formula for K. The formula is K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M sin i) / ( (P)^(1/3) (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star))^(1/3). But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, that term can be approximated, so K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) * M_planet sin i ) / ( (P)^(1/3) (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star))^(1/3) ≈ (2πG)^(1/3) M_planet sin i / (P^(1/3) M_star^(2/3)) ), since M_planet << M_star.

Wait, but I'm getting ahead of myself. The given data is the Doppler shift in the forbidden line. So each planet's mass causes the star to move, which shifts the line. So the Doppler shift tells us about the velocity of the star, which relates to the planet's mass and the distance (semi-major axis) of the planet's orbit.

Wait, but for the equilibrium temperature, I need the distance of each planet from the star because the temperature depends on the inverse square of the distance. So the key is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet1 and Planet2. Once I have that, I can find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

So, how to find the ratio of their semi-major axes? Well, from the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. But wait, I don't have the periods given. Hmm.

Wait, the problem states that both planets are in circular orbits, but it doesn't provide their orbital periods. So perhaps I can relate the Doppler shifts to their distance from the star, which is the semi-major axis.

Wait, the Doppler shift is proportional to the star's velocity, which is K. So, the shift Δλ is proportional to K. So, K1/K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2. Wait, because Δλ is proportional to K, since Δλ = (v/c) * λ. So the ratio K1/K2 = (Δλ1 / Δλ2) * (λ2 / λ1). But here, both shifts are in the same forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. So λ is same for both. So K1/K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.

So K1 = (3/4) K2.

But K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is given by the formula K = (v) = (27 * π * G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (P)^(1/3) (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ) ), but since M_p is much less than M_s, it's approximately K ≈ ( (27 * π * G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (P)^(1/3) (M_s)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, but without knowing the periods, how can I relate K to the semi-major axis? Because the semi-major axis a is related to the period via Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M_s + M_p))/(4π²). Again, M_p is negligible, so a^3 = [G M_s P²]/(4 π²).

But since I don't have P, but have K, perhaps I can find a relation between a1 and a2.

Wait, another approach: since K is proportional to (M_p) / (a (1 - e²)^(0.5)), but for circular orbits, e=0. So K ≈ (M_p) / a.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2 π / P)^(1/3) * (1/(c))

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me look for a better approach.

Alternatively, the semi-amplitude K can be expressed as:

K = (v) = [ (27 * π G) / (c^3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s)^2 (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( 1 / (P) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe it's too complicated. Alternatively, since both planets are orbiting the same star, perhaps the ratio of their K's can be related to their masses and their semi-major axes.

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (2 π G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (P)^(1/3) (M_s)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_s))^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_s, we can approximate 1/(1 + M_p/M_s)^(1/3) ≈ 1. So K ≈ (2 π G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i / ( P^(1/3) M_s^(2/3) ) )

Now, let's express K for each planet.

K1 = (2 π G)^(1/3) M1 sin i / ( P1^(1/3) M_s^(2/3) )

Similarly, K2 = (2 π G)^(1/3) M2 sin i / ( P2^(1/3) M_s^(2/3) )

So the ratio K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * (P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) )

But from Kepler's third law, (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_s + M_p)/(4 π²). Since M_p is much smaller than M_s, M_s + M_p ≈ M_s.

So for each planet:

a1^3 / P1^2 = G M_s / (4 π² ) → P1 = [ (4 π² a1^3) / (G M_s) ) ]^(1/2)

So, P1 = ( (4 π² a1^3) / (G M_s) )^(1/2 )

Similarly, P2 = ( (4 π² a2^3 ) / ( G M_s ) )^(1/2 )

So, P1/P2 = ( a1^3 / a2^3 )^(1/2 )

Let me take the cube root of (a1/a2)^3, so (a1/a2)^3 = (P1^2 / P2^2) * (M_s / M_s) ) → a1/a2 = (P1^2 / P2^2 )^(1/3 )

But wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled. Let's try to write P in terms of a.

P = sqrt( (4 π² a^3)/( G M_s ) ) )

So P is proportional to a^(3/2) / sqrt(M_s). But M_s is the same for both planets.

So, P1/P2 = (a1/a2)^(3/2) )

So, P1 = (a1/a2)^(3/2) * P2.

But going back to the ratio K1/K2.

We have K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) )

Substituting P1 in terms of a1 and a2.

P1 = ( a1^3 / a2^3 )^(1/2) * (P2) ?

Wait, perhaps I should substitute the expression for P1.

P1 = (a1^3 / a2^3)^(1/2) * (P2) )?

Wait, no, because P1 = sqrt( (4 π² a1^3)/(G M_s) ) )

Similarly, P2 = sqrt( (4 π² a2^3)/(G M_s) ) )

So, P1/P2 = sqrt( (a1^3)/(a2^3) ) ) ) = (a1/a2)^(3/2) )

Which implies P1 = P2 * (a1/a2)^(3/2 )

So, P2 = P1 * (a2/a1)^(3/2 )

Now, let's substitute P1 into the K ratio equation.

K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) )

= (M1/M2) * ( (P2 / P1 ) )^(1/3 )

But P2/P1 = [ (a2 / a1 )^(3/2 ) ) ]

So,

K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * [ (a2/a1 )^(3/2 ) ]^(1/3 )

= (M1/M2) * (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

So,

K1/K2 = (M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But from earlier, from the Doppler shifts, K1 is 0.03 Å and K2 is 0.04 Å, same line. So K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4.

So,

3/4 = (M1/M2) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5 Earth masses.

So,

3/4 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Let me solve for sqrt(a2/a1) :

sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4) / (7/5) = (3/4) * (5/7) ) = 15/(28) ≈ 0.5357

So,

sqrt(a2/a1) = 15/28 → (a2/a1) = (15/28)^2 = 225 / 784 ≈ 0.287 approx.

Wait, but let me compute 225/784 accurately.

225 ÷ 784: Well, 784 is 28^2, 225 is 15^2.

But 225/784 = (15/28)^2. 15/28 is approx 0.5357.

So, a2 / a1 ≈ (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287.

So, a2 ≈ 0.287 * a1.

Wait, but I'm interested in a1 and a2 because the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star.

Equilibrium temperature formula is:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

But wait, actually, the equilibrium temperature is given by:

Te = T_eff * ( L / (16 π^2 sigma a^2) )^(1/4 )

Wait, no. Let me get the formula right.

The equilibrium temperature is given by:

Te = T_eff_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to express it in terms of the star's luminosity.

The star's luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

L = 4 π R_star^2 sigma Teff^4.

So, L = 4 π R^2 sigma T_eff^4.

The planet's equilibrium temperature is then:

Te = T_eff * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(0.25 )

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

The equilibrium temperature is given by the balance between the incoming stellar flux and the outgoing thermal radiation.

Incoming flux at distance a: S = L / (4 π a^2 )

Outgoing flux: S = sigma Te^4 (1 - A)

Setting them equal:

L/(4 π a^2) = sigma Te^4 (1 - A)

So,

Teff^4 = ( L / (4 π a^2) ) / ( sigma (1 - A) )

But L=4 π R_star^2 sigma Teff_star^4.

Substitute L:

Teff^4 = (4 π R_star^2 sigma Teff_star^4 ) / (4 π a^2 ) ) / ( sigma (1 - A) )

Simplify:

Teff^4 = ( R_star^2 Teff_star^4 ) / ( a^2 (1 - A) )

So,

Teff = Teff_star * sqrt( R_star / (a sqrt(1 - A)) )

Wait, no, let me compute that again. Let's take the fourth root of both sides.

Teff = Teff_star * ( R_star / (a sqrt(1 - A) ) )^(1/2 )

Which can be written as:

Teff = Teff_star * sqrt( R_star ) / ( a^(1/2) ) * 1/( (1 - A)^(1/4) )

So,

Te = Teff * sqrt(R) / sqrt(a) * (1/( (1 - A)^(1/4) ) )

But since both planets have the same albedo, A is the same for both, so the (1 - A) term is the same for both and cancels out when taking the ratio.

So,

Te1/Te2 = sqrt(R_star / a1) / sqrt(R_star / a2) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because sqrt( R_star / a1 ) divided by sqrt( R_star / a2 ) is sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which from earlier, a2/a1 ≈ (225/784) ≈ 0.287.

So, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( 0.287 ) ≈ sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

Wait, sqrt(0.287) is approximately 0.536.

So, Te1 ≈ 0.536 * Te2.

So the ratio Te1/Te2 is approximately 0.536. So, Te1 is about 0.536 times Te2. So the ratio is about 0.536, which is approximately 0.53. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53.

Wait, but wait. Earlier, we have a2/a1 ≈ 0.287, so a1 is bigger than a2. So Planet1 is farther away from the star than Planet2. So since a1 is larger, Te1 would be smaller than Te2. Because equilibrium temperature decreases with distance.

So the ratio Te1/Te2 is ~0.53.

So the correct answer should be option C: ~0.53.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by analyzing the given data. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

\[
T_e = T_{\text{eff, star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}} \cdot \left(\frac{1 - A}{1}\right)^{1/4}
\]

where \(T_{\text{eff, star}}\) is the star's effective temperature, \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the star's radius, \(a\) is the planet's semi-major axis, and \(A\) is the planet's albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo (\(A\)), the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends on the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.

### Step 1: Relating Radial Velocity Shifts to Semi-Major Axes
The radial velocity (RV) method provides the semi-amplitude \(K\), which is proportional to the Doppler shift. The problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of \(0.03 \, \text{Å}\), while Planet2 induces a shift of \(0.04 \, \text{Å}\). Since the shifts are measured in the same forbidden line, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{\Delta \lambda_1}{\Delta \lambda_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

The semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the planet's mass \(M_p\), the orbital period \(P\), and the semi-major axis \(a\) by:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{a}
\]

For circular orbits, the orbital period \(P\) is related to the semi-major axis \(a\) via Kepler's third law:

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_{\text{star}}}
\]

Substituting \(P^2 \propto a^3\) into the expression for \(K\), we find:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1 / a_1}{M_2 / a_2} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Rearranging for \(\sqrt{a_2 / a_1}\):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{K_1 / K_2}{M_1 / M_2}
\]

### Step 2: Substituting Known Values
The masses of the planets are \(M_1 = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\) and \(M_2 = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\). Substituting into the equation:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{(3/4)}{(7/5)} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{7} = \frac{15}{28} \approx 0.5357
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx (0.5357)^2 \approx 0.287
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures
The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \approx \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

This means Planet1's equilibrium temperature is approximately \(0.536\) times that of Planet2.

### Final Answer
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately \(0.53\).
