Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is typically measured in kilocalories per mole or something like that.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I guess I need to find out how much each contributes to the reaction. Oh wait, but which are the acids and which are the bases here? HCl and H2SO4 are acids because they can donate H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a base since it can provide OH- ions.

So the reaction would be between the acids and the base. But wait, how do I approach this when there are multiple acid solutions? I think I should calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, see how they neutralize each other.

Let me break it down step by step. First, calculate the moles of each substance.

Starting with HCl. The formula is HCl, which is a strong acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. The molarity is 0.2 M. So moles of HCl = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 moles. So HCl contributes 0.1 moles of H+.

Next is H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid, but it's diprotic, meaning each mole can donate two H+ ions. So the volume is 300 mL, which is 0.3 L, and molarity 0.3 M. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol. Since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, the total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Then the base, Ba(OH)2. This is a strong base, and each mole provides two OH- ions because its formula is Ba(OH)2. The volume is 200 mL which is 0.2 L, and molarity is 0.5 M. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.1 *2=0.2 moles.

Wait, but in neutralization, H+ and OH- react in a 1:1 ratio. So the total H+ from both acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. The OH- is 0.2 moles.

So the OH- is the limiting reagent here because 0.2 < 0.28. That means all the OH- will react, and some H+ will be left.

The reaction would be something like: H+ + OH- → H2O, with enthalpy change. Since it's neutralization, the heat produced (exothermic) depends on the amount of H+ and OH- that react.

But wait, I think the enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of reaction. For strong acids and bases, it's around -57 kJ/mol (or about -13.6 kcal/mol) per mole of H+ neutralized. Because when one mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH-, it releases about 13.6 kcal (since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, so 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal).

So in this case, the OH- is 0.2 moles. So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 mol * (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait a second. What about the excess H+? Because there's more H+ than OH-, but once the OH- is all used up, the remaining H+ is just in solution. But the neutralization only involves the OH- reacting. So the calculation is based on the moles of OH- available.

So the total enthalpy released is 0.2 * (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, so that would be the answer.

But wait, I need to make sure about the units. The options have both kcal and kJ. Option A is kcal, D is kJ. The calculation I did was in kcal. 13.6 kcal is approximately 57 kJ, but in this question, the calculation is done in kcal, so the answer would be A.

Alternatively, if the problem expects kJ, but I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is given in kcal. So I think the correct answer is A.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing the given solutions, we first determine the moles of H⁺ ions from the acids and the moles of OH⁻ ions from the base. The reactions involve H⁺ and OH⁻ ions neutralizing each other in a 1:1 ratio, forming water. The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately **-13.6 kcal/mol** or **-57 kJ/mol** per mole of H⁺ neutralized.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids
1. **HCl**:  
   - Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L, Molarity = 0.2 M  
   - Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \)  
   - Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes 0.1 moles of H⁺.

2. **H₂SO₄**:  
   - Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L, Molarity = 0.3 M  
   - Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \)  
   - H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, so it contributes \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺.

**Total moles of H⁺ from acids**:  
\[ 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \]

### Step 2: Calculate moles of OH⁻ from base
- **Ba(OH)₂**:  
  - Volume = 200 mL = 0.2 L, Molarity = 0.5 M  
  - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \)  
  - Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, and each mole provides 2 moles of OH⁻.  
  - Total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 3: Determine the limiting reagent
- Total moles of H⁺ = 0.28 mol  
- Total moles of OH⁻ = 0.2 mol  

Since OH⁻ is the limiting reagent (0.2 mol < 0.28 mol), all 0.2 moles of OH⁻ will react, leaving some H⁺ unneutralized.

### Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization
The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately **-13.6 kcal/mol** per mole of H⁺ neutralized.  
- Moles of OH⁻ neutralized = 0.2 mol  
- Total enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol}) = -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

### Step 5: Verify the units and options
The calculation is performed in kcal, and the correct answer matches **Option A: -2.72 kcal**.
