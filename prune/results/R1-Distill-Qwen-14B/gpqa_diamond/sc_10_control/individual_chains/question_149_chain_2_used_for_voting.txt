Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The scenario is that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound. The 1H NMR of the crude sample looks mostly as expected. But there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals, adding up to 1H. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so it's not like they're splitting each other. 

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum matching the expected molecule. So, same mass, same retention time? Or wait, same in that the mass spec is consistent, but the LC shows two peaks. Hmm.

The options are A-D. Let me think about each.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If there's a precursor, the mass would be different, right? Because a precursor would have a higher mass, like the molecular ion plus maybe the protecting group or something. But both LC peaks have the same mass as expected. So A might not be right, because the mass should be different.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they would have identical physical properties except for how they interact with chiral environments. In NMR, if the compound is a racemic mixture, the alpha protons would have the same chemical shift because each enantiomer contributes the same peaks (since the shifts are same in each). Wait, but if it's a racemic mixture, wouldn't the NMR show one peak for each set of equivalent protons? Oh wait, but if the molecule has internal planes of symmetry, maybe the protons are equivalent. Hmm, but in that case, the NMR wouldn't show two separate peaks. Unless the molecule is not symmetric. Wait, no, in an NMR, enantiomers would produce the same spectrum because the same environment. So perhaps the two peaks in NMR are from two different enantiomers. Wait, but if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR wouldn't split into two peaks for the same proton. Because each enantiomer has the same environment for that proton. They would merge into one peak, not split. So maybe B is not the right answer.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Double coupling would imply some kind of coupling between protons. But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so perhaps this isn't the issue. Or wait, maybe the double coupling refers to something else, like in the synthesis step. Like maybe during the formation of the amide bond, there was some coupling that caused a side product. But I'm not sure how that would lead to two peaks in the NMR for the same proton. Also, the LC-MS would show the same mass, so it's not a different molecule. Hmm.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks. If the sample is a mix of diastereomers, then an alpha-proton that's in different environments would split into two peaks. The integrals would add to 1H because each diastereomer contributes one proton. But wait, if there's a 50:50 mix, each would contribute 0.5H, so together 1H. That makes sense. And since diastereomers have different structures, their LC retention times would be different, leading to two peaks in LC-MS. But wait, the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity. The mass spectrum is same, which suggests same mass. So if the diastereomers have the same mass but different structures, that's possible. For example, epimers or diastereomers with same molecular formula. So D could be a possibility.

Let me go back to the NMR. Two peaks same alpha proton, same shift? No, they have similar chemical shifts but not the same. Wait, the question says 'peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton' and 'similar chemical shifts'. So the shifts are close, but not identical. How would that happen? If the compound is a mix of diastereomers, the environment around the alpha-proton would be slightly different in each, causing different shifts. So each would have a peak, close in shift but not same. The integrals add to 1H, so each could be 0.5H, and they're from the same position but different environments. So that fits.

In the case of diastereomers, their retention times on LC would be different, so two peaks. And if they have same molecular weight (same formula), same mass spectrum, that fits what the question says.

Option B, enantiomers, same mass but same NMR. So wouldn't see two peaks in NMR. So B is unlikely.

So, the most likely answer is D: mixture of diastereoisomers.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the LC-MS analysis is showing two peaks because of something else, like a dimer or adduct. But the question says both peaks have the same mass, which is consistent with the expected molecule. So adducts would have different masses. So that can't be it.

Another thought: Perhaps the crude compound hasn't been purified, and there are two isomers present. If during the synthesis, the product formed as a racemic mixture, but that's enantiomers, which wouldn't split the NMR peaks. Alternatively, if it's a diastereomer mixture, the NMR would show split peaks as in D.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be D.

The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (together integrating to 1H). LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity, both consistent with the expected molecule. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Analysis of the Options:

**Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
A precursor would have a different mass than the expected molecule, as it would typically include additional groups (e.g., protecting groups). However, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with the same mass as the expected molecule, ruling out contamination with a precursor. Thus, this option is unlikely.

**Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images and have identical physical properties, including NMR spectra. If the compound were a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak for the alpha-proton, as both enantiomers contribute identically to the spectrum. Since the NMR shows two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton, this explanation is inconsistent with the observations. Therefore, this option is not correct.

**Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
Double coupling could theoretically lead to two peaks in the NMR for the same proton. However, the question explicitly states that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, making this explanation unlikely. Additionally, double coupling would not explain the two distinct peaks observed in the LC-MS analysis. Thus, this option is also inconsistent with the data.

**Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images and have different physical properties. If the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers, the alpha-proton would experience slightly different chemical environments in each isomer, leading to two distinct peaks in the NMR spectrum with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals. The LC-MS analysis showing two peaks of equal intensity, both consistent with the expected mass, supports this explanation. Therefore, this is the most likely answer.

### Conclusion:  
The observations are best explained by the crude compound being a mixture of diastereoisomers, as this accounts for the NMR and LC-MS data.

Option B, enantiomers, same mass but same NMR. So wouldn't see two peaks in NMR. So B is unlikely.

So, the most likely answer is D: mixture of diastereoisomers.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the LC-MS analysis is showing two peaks because of something else, like a dimer or adduct. But the question says both peaks have the same mass, which is consistent with the expected molecule. So adducts would have different masses. So that can't be it.
