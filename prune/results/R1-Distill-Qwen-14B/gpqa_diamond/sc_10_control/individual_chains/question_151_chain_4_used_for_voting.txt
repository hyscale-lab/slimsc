Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when you have an observable represented by a matrix operator, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of that matrix. And the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector when you project the state onto it.

The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, I should probably write that as a vector. So the state vector is |-1; 2; 1> or in column form: 

[-1]
[ 2]
[ 1]

The observable P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that down. The first row is [0, 1/√2, 0], second row is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], and the third row is [0, 1/√2, 0].

So P looks like this:

[ 0        1/√2      0     ]
[1/√2      0       1/√2  ]
[ 0        1/√2      0     ]

Wait, I think I remember that for observables, the eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So to find the possible outcomes, I need to find the eigenvalues of P.

Alternatively, maybe I can find if 0 is an eigenvalue because the question is about the probability of measuring 0. But wait, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value or project the state onto the eigenspace of 0.

Wait, but perhaps to find the probability of getting 0 as the measurement, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Because the probability would be the squared modulus of the projection of the state onto each eigenvector.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues and see if 0 is one of them, then find the eigenvectors and proceed.

Let me try to find the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Matrix P - λI:

[ -λ       1/√2       0     ]
[1/√2     -λ        1/√2  ]
[ 0       1/√2      -λ     ]

So the determinant would be:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the determinant directly.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let's do expansion by minors along the first row.

So the determinant is:

-λ * det( [ -λ, 1/√2 ]
             [1/√2, -λ ] )

- (1/√2) * det( [1/√2, 1/√2 ]
                  [0, -λ ] )

+ 0 * something (so it's zero)

So first term: -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 

Which is -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0*1/√2 ) ] 

Which is - (1/√2) [ (-λ /√2) ) ]

Wait, so that becomes - (1/√2) * ( -λ /√2 ) ) = - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) ) = (λ ) / 2.

So putting it together, determinant is:

-λ (λ² - 1/2 ) + (λ/2) 

Which simplifies to:

-λ³ + (λ * 1/2 ) + (λ/2 )

So that's -λ³ + (λ/2 + λ/2 ) = -λ³ + λ = 0

So the characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² +1 ) =0 → λ (λ² -1 )=0 → λ=0 or λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

Oh, okay, so 0 is an eigenvalue. So the probability of measuring 0 is the sum of the squares of the projections of the state onto each eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Wait, but in this case, I think the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, because the algebraic multiplicity is 1.

Wait, but wait, in 3x3 matrices, if the eigenvalue is 0, the eigenspace is the kernel of P. So let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

For λ=0, the matrix P becomes:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0],
]

We're looking for vectors (x,y,z) such that P * (x,y,z)^T = 0.

So the equations are:

1. 0*x + (1/√2) y + 0 z = 0 → (1/√2) y = 0 → y=0.

2. (1/√2) x + 0 y + (1/√2) z = 0 → (1/√2)(x + z) = 0 → x + z =0 → z = -x.

3. 0*x + (1/√2) y + 0 z = 0 → same as equation 1, y=0.

So the system reduces to y=0 and z = -x. So the eigenvectors are of the form (x, 0, -x) → x*(1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). So any vector in this space can be written as a scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1).

So the eigenvalue 0 has a one-dimensional eigenspace with basis vector (1,0,-1). So to find the projection of the state onto this eigenspace, we can take the inner product of the state with this eigenvector and normalize.

Wait, but the state is given as a column vector: (-1, 2, 1). Let me denote this as |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1].

To find the projection onto the eigenvector |v> = [1; 0; -1], we calculate the inner product <v|ψ>, then divide by the norm squared of |v>, then take the modulus squared.

Wait, but first, I should check if the eigenvectors are normalized. The vector (1,0,-1) has a norm squared of 1² +0 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So let me compute the inner product:

<v|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2/sqrt(2)) = (-sqrt(2)).

Wait, because 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), but with a negative sign, so (-sqrt(2)).

So the inner product is -sqrt(2). The norm squared of |v> is 1, because it's normalized.

So the projection amplitude is -sqrt(2). The probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude, which is | -sqrt(2) |^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Hmm, that's a problem. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)). So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1.

That's (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = (-sqrt(2)).

So the inner product is -sqrt(2).

So the amplitude is -sqrt(2), so the probability is | -sqrt(2) |^2 = 2. But that's 2, which is more than 1, which isn't possible because probabilities can't be greater than 1.

So I must have made a mistake in my calculations. Let me rethink this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eigenvectors I found are not normalized correctly. Let me re-examine the eigenvectors for λ=0.

When I set λ=0, the system of equations is P|v> =0.

So the matrix equations are:

1. (1/√2) y = 0 → y=0.

2. (1/√2) x + (1/√2) z = 0 → x + z=0 → z= -x.

3. (1/√2) y =0 → same as equation 1.

So the solution is x can be any value, y=0, z=-x.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (x, 0, -x), which is x*(1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, as I thought.

But the norm of (1,0,-1) is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the inner product <v|ψ> is:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2/sqrt(2)) = (-sqrt(2)).

Wait, because 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2). So the inner product is -sqrt(2).

But that would give a probability of | -sqrt(2) |^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. That's impossible, so I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait a moment, maybe the state vector isn't normalized. Let me check the norm of |ψ>.

The state is [-1, 2, 1]. Its norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So, the state isn't normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it before calculating the probabilities.

Ah, that makes sense. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized to 1. So perhaps the state given is not normalized, and I should normalize it before proceeding.

So the normalized state would be |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1; 2; 1].

So now, when I compute the inner product with the normalized eigenvector, it would be:

<v|ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

= (-2)/(sqrt(12)) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

So the inner product is -1/sqrt(3), so the probability is ( -1/sqrt(3) )^2 = 1/3.

Ah, that makes sense. So the probability is 1/3.

So looking at the options, option C is 1/3.

To calculate the probability of measuring 0 for the given observable \( P \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\). After computation, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). Thus, 0 is an eigenvalue of \( P \).

### Step 2: Eigenvectors for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the system \( P |v\rangle = 0 \) yields the eigenvectors of the form \( (x, 0, -x) \). The normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 0 \\ -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: State Vector and Normalization
The state vector is given as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\ 2 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( |\psi\rangle \) is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\ 2 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Projection onto the Eigenspace of \( \lambda = 0 \)
The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the modulus of the projection of \( |\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle \) onto the eigenvector \( |v\rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle v | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle v | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(0) = |\langle v | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

So P looks like this:

[ 0        1/√2      0     ]
[1/√2      0       1/√2  ]
[ 0        1/√2      0     ]

Wait, I think I remember that for observables, the eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So to find the possible outcomes, I need to find the eigenvalues of P.

Alternatively, maybe I can find if 0 is an eigenvalue because the question is about the probability of measuring 0. But wait, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value or project the state onto the eigenspace of 0.

Wait, but perhaps to find the probability of getting 0 as the measurement, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Because the probability would be the squared modulus of the projection of the state onto each eigenvector.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues and see if 0 is one of them, then find the eigenvectors and proceed.

Let me try to find the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Matrix P - λI:

[ -λ       1/√2       0     ]
[1/√2     -λ        1/√2  ]
[ 0       1/√2      -λ     ]

So the determinant would be:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the determinant directly.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let's do expansion by minors along the first row.

So the determinant is:

-λ * det( [ -λ, 1/√2 ]
             [1/√2, -λ ] )

- (1/√2) * det( [1/√2, 1/√2 ]
                  [0, -λ ] )

+ 0 * something (so it's zero)

So first term: -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 

Which is -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0*1/√2 ) ] 

Which is - (1/√2) [ (-λ /√2) ) ]

Wait, so that becomes - (1/√2) * ( -λ /√2 ) ) = - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) ) = (λ ) / 2.

So putting it together, determinant is:

-λ (λ² - 1/2 ) + (λ/2) 

Which simplifies to:

-λ³ + (λ * 1/2 ) + (λ/2 )

So that's -λ³ + (λ/2 + λ/2 ) = -λ³ + λ = 0

So the characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² +1 ) =0 → λ (λ² -1 )=0 → λ=0 or λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

Oh, okay, so 0 is an eigenvalue. So the probability of measuring 0 is the sum of the squares of the projections of the state onto each eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Wait, but in this case, I think the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, because the algebraic multiplicity is 1.

Wait, but wait, in 3x3 matrices, if the eigenvalue is 0, the eigenspace is the kernel of P. So let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

For λ=0, the matrix P becomes:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0],
]

We're looking for vectors (x,y,z) such that P * (x,y,z)^T = 0.

So the equations are:

1. 0*x + (1/√2) y + 0 z = 0 → (1/√2) y = 0 → y=0.

2. (1/√2) x + 0 y + (1/√2) z = 0 → (1/√2)(x + z) = 0 → x + z =0 → z = -x.

3. 0*x + (1/√2) y + 0 z = 0 → same as equation 1, y=0.

So the system reduces to y=0 and z = -x. So the eigenvectors are of the form (x, 0, -x) → x*(1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). So any vector in this space can be written as a scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1).

So the eigenvalue 0 has a one-dimensional eigenspace with basis vector (1,0,-1). So to find the projection of the state onto this eigenspace, we can take the inner product of the state with this eigenvector and normalize.

Wait, but the state is given as a column vector: (-1, 2, 1). Let me denote this as |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1].

To find the projection onto the eigenvector |v> = [1; 0; -1], we calculate the inner product <v|ψ>, then divide by the norm squared of |v>, then take the modulus squared.

Wait, but first, I should check if the eigenvectors are normalized. The vector (1,0,-1) has a norm squared of 1² +0 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So let me compute the inner product:

<v|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2/sqrt(2)) = (-sqrt(2)).

Wait, because 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), but with a negative sign, so (-sqrt(2)).

So the inner product is -sqrt(2). The norm squared of |v> is 1, because it's normalized.

So the projection amplitude is -sqrt(2). The probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude, which is | -sqrt(2) |^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Hmm, that's a problem. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)). So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1.

That's (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = (-sqrt(2)).

So the inner product is -sqrt(2).

So the amplitude is -sqrt(2), so the probability is | -sqrt(2) |^2 = 2. But that's 2, which is more than 1, which isn't possible because probabilities can't be greater than 1.

So I must have made a mistake in my calculations. Let me rethink this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eigenvectors I found are not normalized correctly. Let me re-examine the eigenvectors for λ=0.

When I set λ=0, the system of equations is P|v> =0.

So the matrix equations are:

1. (1/√2) y = 0 → y=0.

2. (1/√2) x + (1/√2) z = 0 → x + z=0 → z= -x.

3. (1/√2) y =0 → same as equation 1.

So the solution is x can be any value, y=0, z=-x.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (x, 0, -x), which is x*(1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, as I thought.

But the norm of (1,0,-1) is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the inner product <v|ψ> is:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2/sqrt(2)) = (-sqrt(2)).

Wait, because 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2). So the inner product is -sqrt(2).

But that would give a probability of | -sqrt(2) |^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. That's impossible, so I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait a moment, maybe the state vector isn't normalized. Let me check the norm of |ψ>.

The state is [-1, 2, 1]. Its norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So, the state isn't normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it before calculating the probabilities.

Ah, that makes sense. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized to 1. So perhaps the state given is not normalized, and I should normalize it before proceeding.

So the normalized state would be |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1; 2; 1].

So now, when I compute the inner product with the normalized eigenvector, it would be:

<v|ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

= (-2)/(sqrt(12)) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

So the inner product is -1/sqrt(3), so the probability is ( -1/sqrt(3) )^2 = 1/3.

Ah, that makes sense. So the probability is 1/3.

So looking at the options, option C is 1/3.


To calculate the probability of measuring 0 for the given observable \( P \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\). After computation, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). Thus, 0 is an eigenvalue of \( P \).

### Step 2: Eigenvectors for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the system \( P |v\rangle = 0 \) yields the eigenvectors of the form \( (x, 0, -x) \). The normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 0 \\ -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: State Vector and Normalization
The state vector is given as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\ 2 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( |\psi\rangle \) is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\ 2 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Projection onto the Eigenspace of \( \lambda = 0 \)
The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the modulus of the projection of \( |\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle \) onto the eigenvector \( |v\rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle v | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle v | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(0) = |\langle v | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
