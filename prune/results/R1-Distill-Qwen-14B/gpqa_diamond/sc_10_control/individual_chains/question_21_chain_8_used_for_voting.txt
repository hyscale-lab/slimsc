Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully again.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism, as well as optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have different connectivity, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

The problem has two parts, A and B. Let me break them down.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond, leading to a different structure. It's common in compounds with adjacent double bonds or conjugated systems where a hydrogen can shift between atoms, like in enols and keto forms.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, right? So it's a six-membered ring with two ketone groups in para positions. But wait, can it undergo tautomerism? Tautomerism usually requires adjacent H and double bonds. Benzoquinone has two ketones but they are not conjugated in a way that allows for a keto-enol tautomerism. Because each O is in a para position, the structure is O=C6H4=O. Maybe it's more like two separate carbonyl groups, each O on a benzene ring. So no adjacent H to shift. So tautomerism might not be possible here.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring, with three ketones at 1,3,5 positions. So it's O=C-(CH2) around the ring. Wait, but how are the carbonyl groups arranged? Are they adjacent? Let me visualize: positions 1,3,5 are every other carbon on the ring, so each ketone is separated by a CH2 group. So each carbonyl is isolated by a single bond. So, for tautomerism, you'd need a hydrogen adjacent to a double bond. Wait, but wait, cyclohexane is a saturated ring, so all single bonds. So each ketone is on a cyclohexane ring, which is not conjugated. So can it undergo keto-enol tautomerism? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's similar to something like cyclohexanone, which can't tautomerize because the adjacent Hs are not in a position to shift. Wait, but wait, the trione has three carbonyl groups. Hmm, maybe in this case, the structure isn't conducive to tautomerism either. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should think about other examples. Like, cyclohexane-1,3-dione. That's two ketones separated by a CH2. Can that undergo tautomerism? Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, benzoquinone has two ketones, but they are on a benzene ring. For the para positions, perhaps there's no possibility for hydrogen transfer because the ring is aromatic and the adjacent positions are fixed. So maybe both compounds don't show tautomerism, but that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm wrong about one of them.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether each compound can exist in keto and enol forms. Benzoquinone: the structure is O=C6H4=O. Wait, isn't that a quinone, which is a conjugated system of two ketones. Quinones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism if there are adjacent hydrogen atoms. Wait, in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are at para positions—so the ring is fully conjugated. So the structure is O=C6H4=O, which is a conjugated di-ketone. So in this case, is there a possibility for hydrogen transfer? For example, can a hydrogen from one oxygen move to the adjacent carbon, forming an enol? Or perhaps in this case, the structure is such that the hydrogens are not adjacent to the carbonyl groups, so no tautomerism occurs.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism. Let me think: each ketone is on a cyclohexane ring, separated by CH2 groups. So each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2. Wait, the carbonyl is C=O, so the adjacent carbons are CH2. Could a hydrogen from the CH2 shift to the carbonyl carbon, forming an enol? But wait, the enol form would have a double bond between two carbons. For example, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is at positions 1,3,5. So, between each ketone, there's a CH2 group. So, maybe the structure isn't conducive for any enol tautomerism because the positions are all taken by ketones. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about tautomerism in other contexts. For example, cyclohexanone can't tautomerize because the adjacent H's are on a CH2 which isn't conjugated. But in something like cyclohexene, the double bond allows for enol forms. Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketones. So, perhaps each is isolated and can't undergo tautomerism because there are no adjacent H's to shift. Alternatively, maybe the trione has a structure that allows some conjugation, enabling tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of these compounds can undergo tautomerism. Let's consider benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is a quinone, which can exist in a keto form and an enol form. For example, para-benzoquinone can tautomerize to ortho-benzoquinone? Wait, no, that's not possible because the positions are fixed. Alternatively, maybe the structure allows a hydrogen shift between the two carbonyl groups. Wait, but that would require a conjugated system, which the benzene ring provides. So maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize.

Wait, but wait, when you have a conjugated di-ketone like 1,4-benzoquinone (para), can a hydrogen shift occur? Let me imagine the structure. The two carbonyl groups are across from each other on the benzene ring. The adjacent positions (ortho and meta) don't have any H's that can shift because the ring is conjugated. So perhaps benzoquinone can't tautomerize because the H's are not in the right positions.

Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize either. So which one doesn't show tautomerism? The question says one of the two doesn't. So which is it?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong. Let's think of tautomerism in another way. Tautomerism requires a hydrogen to move from an atom to a position where a double bond can form. For example, in a compound like cyclohexanone, you don't get tautomerism because the adjacent CH2 groups don't have H's that can shift to form a double bond. But in a compound like cyclohexane-1,3-dione, maybe a hydrogen can shift from one of the carbonyl-adjacent CH2 groups to form a conjugated double bond, allowing a keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups. Let me think about the structure. Each C=O group is on a different carbon of the cyclohexane ring, with two CH2 groups in between. So, for each C=O, the adjacent carbons are CH2. So, in this case, the H's on the CH2 are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Wait, but the CH2 groups are between the carbonyls. So for example, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-O? No, wait, it's a ring. So perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2-O connected in a ring. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-O=C-CH2-CH2-O=C, but that doesn't form a ring. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about each compound's actual structure and whether they can tautomerize.

Benzoquinone: O=C6H4=O. So, two carbonyl groups opposite each other on a benzene ring. For tautomerism, a H would need to shift from one O to another, but I don't think that's possible in this structure because the H's are on the benzene ring, which is already conjugated. So no, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism. Wait, but wait—another possibility: perhaps the quinone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In which case, a H from one O could shift to an adjacent C, forming a double bond, but in this case, the structure is fully conjugated, making it difficult for such a shift. Alternatively, perhaps in some cases, quinones can tautomerize, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups. Wait, that's a lot of carbonyls. Maybe each is isolated, so no adjacent H's to shift. So perhaps neither compound can undergo tautomerism. But the question says one of them does not show tautomerism. So perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing tautomerism with resonance. Benzoquinone can undergo resonance between the two carbonyl groups, but that's not tautomerism. Tautomerism is a specific type of isomerism where a hydrogen moves and a bond shifts.

Alternatively, another approach: think about which compounds are capable of keto-enol tautomerism. Keto-enol tautomerism occurs in compounds where a hydrogen can shift from an oxygen to an adjacent carbon, forming a double bond. For example, in compounds with alpha hydrogens to carbonyl groups.

Benzoquinone: each oxygen is in the para position. The hydrogens on the ring are in the ortho and meta positions relative to each ketone. So, perhaps the H's adjacent to the carbonyl groups (on the ring) can shift. Wait, but in a benzene ring, the carbons are sp² hybridized, and the H's are in specific positions. So, maybe the H's aren't able to shift in such a way to form an enol tautomer. So maybe benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: the carbonyl groups are on a cyclohexane ring. So each carbonyl is connected to the ring via single bonds. Each adjacent carbon to the carbonyl is a CH2 group. So, perhaps in this structure, each CH2 group has H's that can shift. For example, a H from the CH2 next to a carbonyl could shift to the carbonyl carbon, breaking the C=O and forming a C-O single bond and a double bond elsewhere. But wait, would that be possible in a ring structure with three ketones?

Alternatively, maybe the trione can undergo tautomerism. For example, if a hydrogen from a CH2 group adjacent to one carbonyl shifts to that carbonyl, creating an enol-like structure. But perhaps in this case, the ring's structure doesn't allow for that. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think. If a compound has multiple carbonyl groups, can it still tautomerize? For example, if I have two carbonyl groups with a CH2 in between, maybe the central CH2 can lose a hydrogen, form a double bond, and shift the carbonyl. But in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is next to two CH2 groups. Would that allow any tautomerism? I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize because the structure is too rigid, or the necessary H's are not in the correct position. If that's the case, then both compounds don't tautomerize, but the question says that one of them doesn't. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize. For example, if a hydrogen shifts from one carbonyl oxygen to the adjacent carbon, forming an enol tautomer. But in a para-benzoquinone, the positions are fixed, so perhaps it's not possible. So, maybe neither can tautomerize, but the question implies that one of them does not.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about benzoquinone. Let me think again. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups in the para positions. Each carbonyl group is O=C–C6H4–C=O. The hydrogens on the ring are in the ortho and meta positions relative to each carbonyl. So, for tautomerism, a hydrogen would have to move from the ring to the carbonyl carbon, but in the ring structure, the carbonyl is part of a conjugated π system, so the H's are in fixed positions. So I don't think benzoquinone can tautomerize.

If that's the case, then the other compound, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, must be the one that doesn't show tautomerism. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize, but benzoquinone cannot.

Wait, but the question is asking which compound does NOT show tautomerism. So if benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, then A would be benzoquinone. But earlier I thought that perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't either, but maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism, making A equal to cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, maybe I should think about whether each compound has alpha hydrogens. Alpha hydrogens are necessary for keto-enol tautomerism. Benzoquinone, being a di-ketone, has hydrogens on the benzene ring that are alpha to the carbonyl groups. So, if a hydrogen is alpha, it can shift. But in para-benzoquinone, the alpha positions are on the ring, which is sp² hybridized. So, can an sp² hydrogen shift to form an enol tautomer?

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe in some cases, like in furan derivatives, the H's can shift, but in a benzene ring, the structure is more rigid. So perhaps benzoquinone's alpha H's are not in a position to tautomerize. So, benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize, making A = benzoquinone.

So for part A, the answer would be that benzoquinone is the one that doesn't show tautomerism.

Moving on to part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism (or enantiomerism) occurs when a compound has a chiral center, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Let's draw its structure. 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)O-CH3. Wait, no. The formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, wait: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)COOCH3.

So, what's the structure? It's CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So, the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see: the carbon attached to the hydroxyl group (the second carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the CH2 group),
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH3 (the first carbon).

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and another CH3 (because the second carbon is connected to the first CH3, the third is COOCH3, and the fourth is the OH, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, the structure is:

Carbon chain: (CH3)-(CH(OH))-(COOCH3). So the CH(OH) is in the middle. So the carbon in the middle (second carbon) is bonded to:

- a methyl group (CH3),
- an OH group,
- a carbonyl group (COOCH3),
- and another CH2 group (no, wait, that's the first carbon). Wait, no, the second carbon is connected to:

1. Left: CH3 (from first carbon),
2. Middle: OH,
3. Right: COOCH3,
4. And what else? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me number the carbons.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3 - CH(OH) - COOCH3.

So the second carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to:

- left: CH3,
- middle: OH,
- right: COOCH3,
- and what's the fourth group? The fourth group would be the next carbon, which is the COOCH3. Wait, no, each carbon in the chain is connected to four things. So the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (third carbon),
- and the other side would be a hydrogen? No, wait, the second carbon is CH(OH), so it's connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- OH (top),
- COOCH3 (right),
- and a hydrogen (bottom)? No, wait, wait. Let me think again. 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

O
||
CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3 ?

Wait, no. The structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the second carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- OH (top),
- COOCH3 (right),
- and another CH group? No, because the second carbon is between the first and third. Wait, maybe the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- COOCH3 (right),
- OH,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but that would give the second carbon four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So that's four different groups attached to the same carbon. Oh! So that makes the second carbon a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate: Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H. Its diester would be (CH3O)2CCHCHCOOCH3? No, wait, fumarate is the diester of maleic acid with two methyl groups. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). Wait, no, maleic acid is a trans-diepoxy compound, so the structure is HOOCCH=CHCOOH. The diester would be (CH3O)2CCH=CHCOOCH3? No, wait, fumarate is (CH2CH(COOCH3)2), but more accurately, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H. No, no, maleic acid is actually HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So the diester, dimethyl fumarate, would be (CH3O)2C-CH=CH-CO2CH3? Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2(COOCH3)2 with a double bond in between. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, wait, I might be getting confused.

Wait, fumarate is the ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is a cis-dicarboxylic acid. The structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not right. Wait, no, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, but that's actually fumaric acid. Wait, no, fumaric acid is the trans isomer. Oh, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, wait: Fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but the double bond is between the two CH groups, and the substituents are trans. When you esterify both carboxylic acids with methanol, you get dimethyl fumarate, which would have the structure CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), no, wait, that's not right. Wait, the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is (CH2CH2(COOCH3)2), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the structure is (CH3O)2CCH=CHCOOCH3. No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the double bond's position.

Alternatively, dimethyl fumarate has the structure CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). Wait, no, that would imply a single bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2COOCH3)2 connected by a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So the structure is O
        |
CH2-C=CH2-OOCCH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about it as CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two carbons in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group. So the structure would be:

O
||
COOCH3-C=C-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that would be the structure if the COOCH3 groups were on the same side, but in reality, the double bond would have substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but that's not a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I can think differently. The key thing is whether dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it meso or not. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't have optical isomerism. Alternatively, if it's a meso compound, it might not show optical isomerism.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, which is a trans-dicarboxylic acid. So the structure is (CH3O)2C=CHCOOCH3? No, perhaps it's (CH3O)2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2(COOCH3))2 connected by a double bond. So it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but that's a single bond. No, wait, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (CH3O)2C-CH=CH-CO2CH3? No, perhaps it's CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). No, I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached. Wait, in that case, each carbon is connected to two COOCH3 groups, making the molecule symmetric. So, perhaps it's a meso compound, thus not showing optical isomerism.

Wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. For example, in dimethyl fumarate, if the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making it a trans configuration, then the molecule could be a meso compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (CH3O)2C-CH2-CH2-CO2CH3? No, that's a single bond.

Wait, maybe I should think about the actual structure. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So the dimethyl ester would be (CH3O)2C-CH=CH-CO2CH3? No, wait, each of the two carboxylic acid groups is esterified with methanol, so each becomes a COOCH3 group. So the structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). Wait, no, that's not correct because the double bond is between the two CH groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

Wait, but that leaves the two COOCH3 groups on the same side of the double bond, but wait, in fumaric acid, the substituents are trans. So in dimethyl fumarate, if the COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral, hence no optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the substituents are on opposite sides, then the molecule is a meso compound. For example, in tartaric acid, the meso form is achiral.

So, if dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, then it doesn't show optical isomerism. But if it's not a meso compound, it could have enantiomers.

Wait, but wait, what's the structure of dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is the trans-dimer of maleic acid. So, the diester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the structure is:

O
||
OOCR - C=C - RCOO
           |
           O

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the structure as (CH2(COOCH3))2 connected by a double bond. For example:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But in this case, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetric. So the compound would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, if the substituents were on the same side, the molecule would be chiral, but in the case of fumarate, they are trans, leading to a meso form.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. Let me think again: if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is meso, thus achiral.

So, dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center, so it can show optical isomerism. Therefore, between the two compounds, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism, and dimethyl fumarate does not.

So for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Putting it all together:

A is the compound that doesn't show tautomerism. Earlier reasoning suggested that benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism. So A = benzoquinone.

B is the compound that shows optical isomerism, which is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

But earlier analysis says that B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the correct option is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the question.

### Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond, leading to a different structure. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups in a para arrangement on a benzene ring. The hydrogens on the ring are in fixed positions due to the aromatic conjugation, and there are no alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups that can shift to form an enol. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The structure is rigid, and the hydrogens on the CH2 groups are not positioned to allow for a keto-enol tautomerism. Thus, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione also does not show tautomerism**.

The question specifies that only one compound does not show tautomerism. Based on the analysis, **benzoquinone is the correct answer for Part A**.

### Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure (CH3O)2C=CHCOOCH3. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the trans configuration of the double bond, making it a meso compound. As a result, **dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism**.

Thus, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the correct answer for Part B**.

### Final Answer
Combining the results from Part A and Part B:
- A = benzoquinone
- B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

The correct option is **B**.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully again.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism, as well as optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have different connectivity, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

The problem has two parts, A and B. Let me break them down.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond, leading to a different structure. It's common in compounds with adjacent double bonds or conjugated systems where a hydrogen can shift between atoms, like in enols and keto forms.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, right? So it's a six-membered ring with two ketone groups in para positions. But wait, can it undergo tautomerism? Tautomerism usually requires adjacent H and double bonds. Benzoquinone has two ketones but they are not conjugated in a way that allows for a keto-enol tautomerism. Because each O is in a para position, the structure is O=C6H4=O. Maybe it's more like two separate carbonyl groups, each O on a benzene ring. So no adjacent H to shift. So tautomerism might not be possible here.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring, with three ketones at 1,3,5 positions. So it's O=C-(CH2) around the ring. Wait, but how are the carbonyl groups arranged? Are they adjacent? Let me visualize: positions 1,3,5 are every other carbon on the ring, so each ketone is separated by a CH2 group. So each carbonyl is isolated by a single bond. So, for tautomerism, you'd need a hydrogen adjacent to a double bond. Wait, but wait, cyclohexane is a saturated ring, so all single bonds. So each ketone is on a cyclohexane ring, which is not conjugated. So can it undergo keto-enol tautomerism? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's similar to something like cyclohexanone, which can't tautomerize because the adjacent Hs are not in a position to shift. Wait, but wait, the trione has three carbonyl groups. Hmm, maybe in this case, the structure isn't conducive to tautomerism either. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should think about other examples. Like, cyclohexane-1,3-dione. That's two ketones separated by a CH2. Can that undergo tautomerism? Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, benzoquinone has two ketones, but they are on a benzene ring. For the para positions, perhaps there's no possibility for hydrogen transfer because the ring is aromatic and the adjacent positions are fixed. So maybe both compounds don't show tautomerism, but that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm wrong about one of them.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether each compound can exist in keto and enol forms. Benzoquinone: the structure is O=C6H4=O. Wait, isn't that a quinone, which is a conjugated system of two ketones. Quinones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism if there are adjacent hydrogen atoms. Wait, in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are at para positions—so the ring is fully conjugated. So the structure is O=C6H4=O, which is a conjugated di-ketone. So in this case, is there a possibility for hydrogen transfer? For example, can a hydrogen from one oxygen move to the adjacent carbon, forming an enol? Or perhaps in this case, the structure is such that the hydrogens are not adjacent to the carbonyl groups, so no tautomerism occurs.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism. Let me think: each ketone is on a cyclohexane ring, separated by CH2 groups. So each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2. Wait, the carbonyl is C=O, so the adjacent carbons are CH2. Could a hydrogen from the CH2 shift to the carbonyl carbon, forming an enol? But wait, the enol form would have a double bond between two carbons. For example, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is at positions 1,3,5. So, between each ketone, there's a CH2 group. So, maybe the structure isn't conducive for any enol tautomerism because the positions are all taken by ketones. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about tautomerism in other contexts. For example, cyclohexanone can't tautomerize because the adjacent H's are on a CH2 which isn't conjugated. But in something like cyclohexene, the double bond allows for enol forms. Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketones. So, perhaps each is isolated and can't undergo tautomerism because there are no adjacent H's to shift. Alternatively, maybe the trione has a structure that allows some conjugation, enabling tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of these compounds can undergo tautomerism. Let's consider benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is a quinone, which can exist in a keto form and an enol form. For example, para-benzoquinone can tautomerize to ortho-benzoquinone? Wait, no, that's not possible because the positions are fixed. Alternatively, maybe the structure allows a hydrogen shift between the two carbonyl groups. Wait, but that would require a conjugated system, which the benzene ring provides. So maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize.

Wait, but wait, when you have a conjugated di-ketone like 1,4-benzoquinone (para), can a hydrogen shift occur? Let me imagine the structure. The two carbonyl groups are across from each other on the benzene ring. The adjacent positions (ortho and meta) don't have any H's that can shift because the ring is conjugated. So perhaps benzoquinone can't tautomerize because the H's are not in the right positions.

Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize either. So which one doesn't show tautomerism? The question says one of the two doesn't. So which is it?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong. Let's think of tautomerism in another way. Tautomerism requires a hydrogen to move from an atom to a position where a double bond can form. For example, in a compound like cyclohexanone, you don't get tautomerism because the adjacent CH2 groups don't have H's that can shift to form a double bond. But in a compound like cyclohexane-1,3-dione, maybe a hydrogen can shift from one of the carbonyl-adjacent CH2 groups to form a conjugated double bond, allowing a keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups. Let me think about the structure. Each C=O group is on a different carbon of the cyclohexane ring, with two CH2 groups in between. So, for each C=O, the adjacent carbons are CH2. So, in this case, the H's on the CH2 are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Wait, but the CH2 groups are between the carbonyls. So for example, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-O? No, wait, it's a ring. So perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2-O connected in a ring. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-O=C-CH2-CH2-O=C, but that doesn't form a ring. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about each compound's actual structure and whether they can tautomerize.

Benzoquinone: O=C6H4=O. So, two carbonyl groups opposite each other on a benzene ring. For tautomerism, a H would need to shift from one O to another, but I don't think that's possible in this structure because the H's are on the benzene ring, which is already conjugated. So no, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism. Wait, but wait—another possibility: perhaps the quinone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In which case, a H from one O could shift to an adjacent C, forming a double bond, but in this case, the structure is fully conjugated, making it difficult for such a shift. Alternatively, perhaps in some cases, quinones can tautomerize, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups. Wait, that's a lot of carbonyls. Maybe each is isolated, so no adjacent H's to shift. So perhaps neither compound can undergo tautomerism. But the question says one of them does not show tautomerism. So perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing tautomerism with resonance. Benzoquinone can undergo resonance between the two carbonyl groups, but that's not tautomerism. Tautomerism is a specific type of isomerism where a hydrogen moves and a bond shifts.

Alternatively, another approach: think about which compounds are capable of keto-enol tautomerism. Keto-enol tautomerism occurs in compounds where a hydrogen can shift from an oxygen to an adjacent carbon, forming a double bond. For example, in compounds with alpha hydrogens to carbonyl groups.

Benzoquinone: each oxygen is in the para position. The hydrogens on the ring are in the ortho and meta positions relative to each ketone. So, perhaps the H's adjacent to the carbonyl groups (on the ring) can shift. Wait, but in a benzene ring, the carbons are sp² hybridized, and the H's are in specific positions. So, maybe the H's aren't able to shift in such a way to form an enol tautomer. So maybe benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: the carbonyl groups are on a cyclohexane ring. So each carbonyl is connected to the ring via single bonds. Each adjacent carbon to the carbonyl is a CH2 group. So, perhaps in this structure, each CH2 group has H's that can shift. For example, a H from the CH2 next to a carbonyl could shift to the carbonyl carbon, breaking the C=O and forming a C-O single bond and a double bond elsewhere. But wait, would that be possible in a ring structure with three ketones?

Alternatively, maybe the trione can undergo tautomerism. For example, if a hydrogen from a CH2 group adjacent to one carbonyl shifts to that carbonyl, creating an enol-like structure. But perhaps in this case, the ring's structure doesn't allow for that. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think. If a compound has multiple carbonyl groups, can it still tautomerize? For example, if I have two carbonyl groups with a CH2 in between, maybe the central CH2 can lose a hydrogen, form a double bond, and shift the carbonyl. But in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is next to two CH2 groups. Would that allow any tautomerism? I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize because the structure is too rigid, or the necessary H's are not in the correct position. If that's the case, then both compounds don't tautomerize, but the question says that one of them doesn't. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize. For example, if a hydrogen shifts from one carbonyl oxygen to the adjacent carbon, forming an enol tautomer. But in a para-benzoquinone, the positions are fixed, so perhaps it's not possible. So, maybe neither can tautomerize, but the question implies that one of them does not.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about benzoquinone. Let me think again. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups in the para positions. Each carbonyl group is O=C–C6H4–C=O. The hydrogens on the ring are in the ortho and meta positions relative to each carbonyl. So, for tautomerism, a hydrogen would have to move from the ring to the carbonyl carbon, but in the ring structure, the carbonyl is part of a conjugated π system, so the H's are in fixed positions. So I don't think benzoquinone can tautomerize.

If that's the case, then the other compound, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, must be the one that doesn't show tautomerism. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize, but benzoquinone cannot.

Wait, but the question is asking which compound does NOT show tautomerism. So if benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, then A would be benzoquinone. But earlier I thought that perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't either, but maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism, making A equal to cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, maybe I should think about whether each compound has alpha hydrogens. Alpha hydrogens are necessary for keto-enol tautomerism. Benzoquinone, being a di-ketone, has hydrogens on the benzene ring that are alpha to the carbonyl groups. So, if a hydrogen is alpha, it can shift. But in para-benzoquinone, the alpha positions are on the ring, which is sp² hybridized. So, can an sp² hydrogen shift to form an enol tautomer?

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe in some cases, like in furan derivatives, the H's can shift, but in a benzene ring, the structure is more rigid. So perhaps benzoquinone's alpha H's are not in a position to tautomerize. So, benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize, making A = benzoquinone.

So for part A, the answer would be that benzoquinone is the one that doesn't show tautomerism.

Moving on to part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism (or enantiomerism) occurs when a compound has a chiral center, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Let's draw its structure. 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)O-CH3. Wait, no. The formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, wait: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)COOCH3.

So, what's the structure? It's CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So, the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see: the carbon attached to the hydroxyl group (the second carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the CH2 group),
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH3 (the first carbon).

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and another CH3 (because the second carbon is connected to the first CH3, the third is COOCH3, and the fourth is the OH, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, the structure is:

Carbon chain: (CH3)-(CH(OH))-(COOCH3). So the CH(OH) is in the middle. So the carbon in the middle (second carbon) is bonded to:

- a methyl group (CH3),
- an OH group,
- a carbonyl group (COOCH3),
- and another CH2 group (no, wait, that's the first carbon). Wait, no, the second carbon is connected to:

1. Left: CH3 (from first carbon),
2. Middle: OH,
3. Right: COOCH3,
4. And what else? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me number the carbons.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3 - CH(OH) - COOCH3.

So the second carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to:

- left: CH3,
- middle: OH,
- right: COOCH3,
- and what's the fourth group? The fourth group would be the next carbon, which is the COOCH3. Wait, no, each carbon in the chain is connected to four things. So the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (third carbon),
- and the other side would be a hydrogen? No, wait, the second carbon is CH(OH), so it's connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- OH (top),
- COOCH3 (right),
- and a hydrogen (bottom)? No, wait, wait. Let me think again. 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

O
||
CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3 ?

Wait, no. The structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the second carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- OH (top),
- COOCH3 (right),
- and another CH group? No, because the second carbon is between the first and third. Wait, maybe the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- COOCH3 (right),
- OH,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but that would give the second carbon four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So that's four different groups attached to the same carbon. Oh! So that makes the second carbon a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate: Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H. Its diester would be (CH3O)2CCHCHCOOCH3? No, wait, fumarate is the diester of maleic acid with two methyl groups. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). Wait, no, maleic acid is a trans-diepoxy compound, so the structure is HOOCCH=CHCOOH. The diester would be (CH3O)2CCH=CHCOOCH3? No, wait, fumarate is (CH2CH(COOCH3)2), but more accurately, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H. No, no, maleic acid is actually HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So the diester, dimethyl fumarate, would be (CH3O)2C-CH=CH-CO2CH3? Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2(COOCH3)2 with a double bond in between. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, wait, I might be getting confused.

Wait, fumarate is the ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is a cis-dicarboxylic acid. The structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not right. Wait, no, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, but that's actually fumaric acid. Wait, no, fumaric acid is the trans isomer. Oh, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, wait: Fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but the double bond is between the two CH groups, and the substituents are trans. When you esterify both carboxylic acids with methanol, you get dimethyl fumarate, which would have the structure CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), no, wait, that's not right. Wait, the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is (CH2CH2(COOCH3)2), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the structure is (CH3O)2CCH=CHCOOCH3. No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the double bond's position.

Alternatively, dimethyl fumarate has the structure CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). Wait, no, that would imply a single bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2COOCH3)2 connected by a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So the structure is O
        |
CH2-C=CH2-OOCCH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about it as CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two carbons in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group. So the structure would be:

O
||
COOCH3-C=C-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that would be the structure if the COOCH3 groups were on the same side, but in reality, the double bond would have substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but that's not a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I can think differently. The key thing is whether dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it meso or not. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't have optical isomerism. Alternatively, if it's a meso compound, it might not show optical isomerism.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, which is a trans-dicarboxylic acid. So the structure is (CH3O)2C=CHCOOCH3? No, perhaps it's (CH3O)2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2(COOCH3))2 connected by a double bond. So it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but that's a single bond. No, wait, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (CH3O)2C-CH=CH-CO2CH3? No, perhaps it's CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). No, I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached. Wait, in that case, each carbon is connected to two COOCH3 groups, making the molecule symmetric. So, perhaps it's a meso compound, thus not showing optical isomerism.

Wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. For example, in dimethyl fumarate, if the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making it a trans configuration, then the molecule could be a meso compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (CH3O)2C-CH2-CH2-CO2CH3? No, that's a single bond.

Wait, maybe I should think about the actual structure. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So the dimethyl ester would be (CH3O)2C-CH=CH-CO2CH3? No, wait, each of the two carboxylic acid groups is esterified with methanol, so each becomes a COOCH3 group. So the structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). Wait, no, that's not correct because the double bond is between the two CH groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

Wait, but that leaves the two COOCH3 groups on the same side of the double bond, but wait, in fumaric acid, the substituents are trans. So in dimethyl fumarate, if the COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral, hence no optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the substituents are on opposite sides, then the molecule is a meso compound. For example, in tartaric acid, the meso form is achiral.

So, if dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, then it doesn't show optical isomerism. But if it's not a meso compound, it could have enantiomers.

Wait, but wait, what's the structure of dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is the trans-dimer of maleic acid. So, the diester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the structure is:

O
||
OOCR - C=C - RCOO
           |
           O

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the structure as (CH2(COOCH3))2 connected by a double bond. For example:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But in this case, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetric. So the compound would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, if the substituents were on the same side, the molecule would be chiral, but in the case of fumarate, they are trans, leading to a meso form.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. Let me think again: if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is meso, thus achiral.

So, dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center, so it can show optical isomerism. Therefore, between the two compounds, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism, and dimethyl fumarate does not.

So for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Putting it all together:

A is the compound that doesn't show tautomerism. Earlier reasoning suggested that benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism. So A = benzoquinone.

B is the compound that shows optical isomerism, which is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

But earlier analysis says that B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the correct option is B.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the question.

### Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond, leading to a different structure. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups in a para arrangement on a benzene ring. The hydrogens on the ring are in fixed positions due to the aromatic conjugation, and there are no alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups that can shift to form an enol. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The structure is rigid, and the hydrogens on the CH2 groups are not positioned to allow for a keto-enol tautomerism. Thus, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione also does not show tautomerism**.

The question specifies that only one compound does not show tautomerism. Based on the analysis, **benzoquinone is the correct answer for Part A**.

### Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure (CH3O)2C=CHCOOCH3. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the trans configuration of the double bond, making it a meso compound. As a result, **dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism**.

Thus, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the correct answer for Part B**.

### Final Answer
Combining the results from Part A and Part B:
- A = benzoquinone
- B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

The correct option is **B**.

ANSWER: B
