Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. 

Wait, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime is important. Oh right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But when observed in the lab frame, time dilation comes into play because of relativity. So the lifetime we observe is longer than the proper lifetime. 

The formula for time dilation is gamma equals energy over mass. Or wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. So gamma = E / m. Here, E is given as 27 GeV and mass m is 3.41 GeV. Let me calculate that. 

So gamma = 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 3.41 times 7 is like 23.87, so 27 is about 3.41 * 7.9? Let me do it more accurately. 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 3.41 * 8 is 27.28, which is a bit more than 27. So 27/3.41 is approximately 7.91. Let's say gamma is about 7.91.

Now, the observed lifetime tau is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime tau_0. Tau_0 is 8e-16 seconds. So tau = 7.91 * 8e-16. Let me calculate that. 8 *7.91 is about 63.28. So 63.28e-16 seconds, or 6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, but how does this relate to the decay length? The decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The particle's speed is probably close to the speed of light. So the distance L is approximately speed v multiplied by the lifetime tau. Since v is roughly c, which is 3e8 m/s. 

So L = c * tau. Let me compute that. 3e8 m/s * 6.328e-15 s = 3 * 6.328 * 1e-7. 3*6 is 18, 3*0.328 is about 0.984. So 18.984e-7 meters. Which is 1.8984e-6 meters, or about 1.9e-6 meters.

But wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, so I think the idea is that the resolution must be such that a certain fraction of the decays can be detected. So perhaps the resolution needs to be on the order of the decay length, but maybe I'm missing something. 

Wait, the resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay products' positions. So the decay length has to be larger than the resolution for a certain fraction of the decays to be observed. Alternatively, the probability of observing the decay is related to the ratio between the decay length and the resolution. 

I recall that the probability P of observing a decay is given by P = 1 - exp(-L / L_res), where L is the average decay length and L_res is the resolution. Wait, but wait, when the decay length is much larger than the resolution, the exponential approaches 1, so P approaches 0. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the formula is P = 1 - exp(-L_res / L). Let me think. 

If L is the decay length, and the resolution is the distance you can resolve, then when L is much larger than the resolution, you can't see it, so the probability would be low. Alternatively, when L is smaller than the resolution, the decay would not be observed because you can't distinguish the decay point. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach. The average path length is L = gamma * c * tau_0. But to observe the decay, the distance the particle travels before decaying must be such that the chamber can detect it. The minimum resolution is the smallest length that can be detected. I think the problem is stating that the chamber must have a resolution (let's say the minimum detectable length) such that at least 30% of the decays are observed.

So the probability of observing the decay is when the decay length is greater than the resolution. But wait, the decay length is a statistical thing. So perhaps we need to find the resolution such that the probability of the decay happening within that resolution is 30%.

Wait, the decay length is a random variable. The probability that a decay occurs within a certain distance is given by the decay probability, which is a function of the distance. The formula is P = 1 - exp(-t), where t is the time. But in terms of distance, since L = v * t, and v≈c, t = L/(c). So P = 1 - exp(-L/(gamma c tau_0)). Wait, because proper lifetime tau_0 is the mean lifetime, the observed lifetime is gamma tau_0.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The average decay length is L_avg = c * gamma tau_0. But the distribution is exponential, so the probability that the decay occurs within a certain length x is P = 1 - exp(-x / L_avg).

Wait, no, I think I might have it backwards. The probability that the decay occurs after traveling a distance x is exp(-x / L_avg). So the probability that it decays within x is 1 - exp(-x / L_avg). So to get at least 30% (0.3) of the decays observed, we set 1 - exp(-x / L_avg) = 0.3. 

So solving for x: exp(-x/L_avg) = 0.7 → -x/L_avg = ln(0.7) → x = - L_avg * ln(0.7). Hmm, ln(0.7) is approximately -0.3567. So x = L_avg * 0.3567. 

So we need to compute L_avg first. L_avg = c * gamma * tau_0. Let me compute that:

c = 3e8 m/s.

gamma was approx 7.91.

tau_0 =8e-16 s.

So L_avg = 3e8 *7.91 *8e-16.

Let me compute that step by step.

3e8 *7.91 = 2.373e9.

2.373e9 *8e-16 = (2.373 *8) * 1e-7. 2.373 *8 is about 18.984.

So L_avg ≈18.984e-7 meters, which is 1.8984e-6 meters, or about 1.9e-6 meters.

Now, x is 0.3567 * 1.8984e-6 m. Let me compute that.

0.3567 *1.8984e-6 ≈0.3567 *1.8984 ≈ 0.6779e-6 m → approximately 6.78e-7 m, which is 0.678e-6 m.

Wait, but the options are 2.08e-6 m, 2.08e-9, etc. Hmm, so my calculation resulted in about 6.78e-7 m, which is about 0.678e-6 m, but none of the options seems to match that. 

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check the gamma calculation.

Gamma = E / m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. So 27 divided by 3.41.

Let me compute 3.41 times 7 is 23.87. 27 minus 23.87 is 3.13. 3.13 /3.41 is about 0.917. So gamma is approximately 7.917.

So gamma is about 7.917. 

L_avg = c * gamma * tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s.

gamma=7.917.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L_avg = 3e8 *7.917 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 = 24e-8 = 2.4e-7.

Then multiply by 7.917: 2.4e-7 *7.917= (2.4 *7.917) e-7.

2.4 *7 is 16.8, 2.4 *0.917≈2.4 *0.9=2.16 → so about 18.96e-7 m.

Which is 1.896e-6 m, which is about 1.9e-6 m.

Now, x=0.3567 *1.896e-6 = approx 0.3567 *1.896 = let's compute:

0.3 *1.896=0.5688

0.05 *1.896=0.0948 → total 0.6636

Wait, 0.3567 is 0.3 + 0.05 + 0.0067.

Wait, maybe a better way: 0.3567 *1.896 → let's compute as 1.896 *0.35 = 0.6636, and 1.896 *0.0067 ≈ 0.0127. So total x≈0.6636+0.0127=0.6763e-6 m, which is 6.763e-7 m.

So about 6.76e-7 meters.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option A) 2.08e-6 m, but that's larger than my result. Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should consider the velocity as a factor. Because L = gamma * v * tau_0. Or wait, no, because tau is gamma tau_0, and L = v * tau. But v is approximately c, but for precise calculation, perhaps I should compute beta * c, where beta is v/c.

Wait, beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² c^4)) ) → m^2/(E^2) → (3.41/27)^2 ≈ (0.1263)^2 ≈ 0.01595 → beta^2 = 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405 → beta ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992.

So beta is about 0.992, so v ≈ 0.992c.

So in that case, L_avg = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, but gamma is E/(m c^2) → but wait, no. Gamma is E/(m c^2) if E is the total energy. Because the rest energy is m c². So if E is 27 GeV, and m c² is 3.41 GeV, then gamma is 27/3.41 ≈7.917 as before.

So, using v = beta c, and L = gamma * beta c * tau_0.

Wait, because tau is gamma tau_0, so L = v tau = beta c gamma tau_0. So that's correct.

So perhaps including this beta, I should recalculate. Let me compute beta.

E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²) = 27/(3.41) ≈7.917.

Beta is v/c = sqrt(1 − (1/gamma^2)) → sqrt(1 - 1/(7.917)^2) → sqrt(1 - 1/62.69) → sqrt(61.69/62.69) → sqrt(0.984) ≈0.992.

So beta ≈0.992 → v ≈ 0.992c.

So L_avg = beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is 0.992 *3e8 m/s *7.917 *8e-16 s.

Compute step by step:

First, 3e8 *8e-16 = 24e-8 = 2.4e-7.

Multiply by gamma (7.917): 2.4e-7 *7.917 = approx 1.899e-6.

Then multiply by beta (0.992): 1.899e-6 *0.992 ≈1.884e-6 m.

So L_avg ≈1.884e-6 m, which is about 1.88e-6 m.

Then x is 0.3567 *1.884e-6 → 0.3567 *1.884 is approximately 0.673e-6 m, or 6.73e-7 m.

Still about the same as before. 

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe the question is asking for the minimum resolution, which is the decay length itself, but only a certain fraction is observed. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps the resolution must be such that 30% of the decays have a decay length larger than the resolution. Wait, that would mean that the decay length is the minimum to detect 70% of the decays. No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, if the resolution is R, then the probability that a decay is observed is the probability that the decay occurs within R. Because if the decay length is longer than R, you can't observe it. Wait, no, that seems incorrect. 

Wait, the decay occurs at some point along the path. The bubble chamber records the decay if the decay occurs within a certain small region, say, the resolution. So the smaller the resolution, the less likely to capture the decay. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the probability depends on the decay length. If the decay length is L, then the decay can happen anywhere along a path of length L. The resolution is the ability to pinpoint where the decay happened. If L is much larger than the resolution, the probability of seeing the decay is lower because the decay could happen anywhere along a longer path. 

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look up the formula for the detection probability based on decay length and resolution.

I remember that the probability of detecting a decay is given by P = 1 - exp(-R / L), where R is the resolution and L is the mean decay length. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The probability that the decay occurs within a certain length R is P = 1 - exp(-R / L). So if R is the resolution, you can detect the decay only if the decay happens within R. So to have at least 30% of the decays observed, we set 1 - exp(-R / L) ≥ 0.3.

So, solving for R: exp(-R/L) ≤ 0.7 → -R/L ≤ ln(0.7) → R ≥ - L ln(0.7) ≈ L * 0.3567.

So R must be at least approximately 35.67% of L.

So R = 0.3567 * L_avg.

We already have L_avg ≈1.884e-6 m. So R=0.3567 *1.884e-6 ≈0.3567 *1.884 = approx 0.673e-6 m, or 6.73e-7 m.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps we're making a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that at least 30% of the decays are observed, which would correspond to the decay length being larger than the resolution.

Wait, perhaps another way: the number of decays observed depends on the decay length. The minimum resolution required to observe a certain fraction would be when the decay length is just greater than the resolution, so that the probability of the decay being detected is 30%.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the decay length L without considering the 30% factor, and then see which option is closest.

Wait, the decay length without any probability consideration is L = gamma * v * tau_0. Which we calculated as approximately 1.88e-6 meters, which is option A: 2.08e-6 m. Close, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the precise calculation is needed. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Gamma =27 /3.41.

3.41 * 7.9 = 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41 *0.9=3.069 → total 26.939. Close to 27. So 27/3.41 ≈7.913.

So gamma=7.913.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)) = sqrt(1 - (3.41²)/(27²)).

3.41^2 = 11.6281, 27^2=729. So 11.6281 /729 ≈0.01598. So 1 -0.01598=0.98402. sqrt(0.98402)= about 0.9920 approximately.

So beta=0.9920.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s.

gamma=7.913.

beta=0.9920.

So L =7.913 *0.9920 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 7.913 *0.9920: 7.913 *0.992 ≈7.866.

Then, 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8=2.4e-7.

Multiply by 7.866: 2.4e-7 *7.866 = 1.88784e-6 meters.

So L=1.88784e-6 m.

So the decay length is approximately 1.888e-6 m, which is about 1.89e-6 m.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is a bit higher. So perhaps the precise calculation with more accurate numbers would match exactly.

Wait, perhaps 2.08e-6 is exactly 1.89e-6 multiplied by approximately 1.1. Hmm, but why would that be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach, and the question is simply asking for the decay length without considering the 30% factor, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation of gamma uses the relativistic beta factor in a different way. Let me think again about the decay length formula.

Wait, the decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

Yes, that's correct.

So if we calculate L as gamma * beta * c * tau_0, and then set R to be at least 35.67% of L, then R would be about 0.3567 *1.888e-6 m ≈6.73e-7 m.

But that's not one of the options. So perhaps the question is not considering the probability factor, and is just asking for the decay length itself, which would be approximately 1.88e-6 m, but that's not an option either. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately L.

Let me calculate gamma exactly: 27 /3.41.

27 /3.41 = ?

3.41 ×7.9=26.939 → 27-26.939=0.061.

So 0.061 /3.41 ≈0.0179.

So gamma=7.9 +0.0179=7.9179.

Beta: sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2)).

3.41^2=11.6281.

27^2=729.

11.6281/729=0.015973.

1-0.015973=0.984027.

sqrt(0.984027)= approx 0.99200.

So beta=0.99200.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

gamma=7.9179, beta=0.992.

gamma*beta=7.9179 *0.992= approximately 7.866.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L =7.866 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7.

Multiply by 7.866: 2.4e-7 *7.866= 1.88784e-6 m.

So 1.88784e-6 m.

Wait, but why is option A 2.08e-6 m? Perhaps I should check if I made a miscalculation in the earlier steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy is given as 27 GeV, but is that the kinetic energy or the total energy? Because E in the gamma formula is the total energy.

The problem states the energy is 27 GeV, so it's the total energy including rest mass. So gamma is correct as E/(m c²) =27/3.41.

Hmm, perhaps another error is in the calculation of L.

Wait, 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s = 24e-8 m =2.4e-7 m. Then multiply by gamma*beta: 2.4e-7 m *7.9179*0.992.

Wait, 7.9179 *0.992 =7.866.

So 2.4e-7 *7.866= 1.88784e-6 m.

So that's correct.

But the options have A) 2.08e-6 m, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is to use beta as 1, so L = gamma * c * tau_0. Then L=7.9179 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute: 7.9179 *3e8=2.375e9. 2.375e9 *8e-16= (2.375 *8) * 1e-7 =19e-7=1.9e-6 m, which is 1.9e-6 m. Hmm, that's even closer to option A.

But why would we use beta as 1? Because particles are moving at nearly the speed of light, perhaps to approximate we take v=c. So L ≈ gamma * c * tau_0.

Which would give L=7.9179 *3e8 *8e-16 = 7.9179 *24e-8 = (7.9179 *24) *1e-8.

7.9179 *24: 7*24=168, 0.9179*24≈22.03 → total≈190.03.

So 190.03e-8 m =1.9003e-6 m.

So about 1.9e-6 m.

But option A is 2.08e-6 m. So perhaps the exact calculation yields 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, let's do the exact calculation with more precise numbers.

Calculating gamma=27/3.41.

27 /3.41= Let's compute this exactly.

3.41 ×7 =23.87. 27-23.87=3.13.

3.13/3.41= 0.9179.

So gamma=7.9179.

v = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) → m=3.41 GeV, E=27 GeV.

So (m/E)=3.41/27=0.1263 → square is 0.01595.

1-0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)=0.992005.

So beta=0.992005.

So L= gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

gamma * beta=7.9179 *0.992005 = 7.866.

c=2.99792e8 m/s (more precise).

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.866 * 2.99792e8 *8e-16.

Compute 2.99792e8 *8e-16 = 2.398336e-7.

Multiply by 7.866: 2.398336e-7 *7.866 = ?

2.398336e-7 *7 = 1.678835e-6.

2.398336e-7 *0.866≈2.398336e-7 *0.8=1.918669e-7; 2.398336e-7 *0.066≈1.580e-8.

Adding them: 1.918669e-7 +1.580e-8 =2.076669e-7.

So total L=1.678835e-6 +2.076669e-7=1.8865e-6 m.

Hmm, about 1.8865e-6 m. So around 1.89e-6 meters.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, the problem says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps the probability comes into play, and the resolution R should be such that the probability is 30%.

Earlier, I thought P=1 - exp(-R/L). To have P=0.3, R= L * ( -ln(1-P) ) = L * ln(7/3) ≈ L * 0.8473.

Wait, wait, no. Let's correct that.

P = 1 - exp( - R/(L) )

We set P =0.3 → 0.3 =1 - exp( -R/L )

→ exp(-R/L) =0.7 → -R/L = ln(0.7) → R= L * (-ln(0.7)).

ln(0.7)= -0.35667.

So R= L * 0.35667.

With L=1.8865e-6 m, R= 1.8865e-6 *0.35667 ≈6.73e-7 m → ~6.73e-7 m.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the approach is incorrect, and the problem is simply asking for the decay length, not considering the 30% factor.

In that case, the L is ~1.89e-6 m. But the closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, let me compute gamma again, using precise division.

gamma =27 /3.41.

3.41 *7.91=27.00.

Wait, 3.41*7.91=?

3.41 *7=23.87.

3.41 *0.9=3.069. 3.41 *0.01=0.0341.

So 7.91 is 7 +0.9 +0.01 → 23.87 +3.069 +0.0341=26.9731.

But 27 is 26.9731 plus 0.0269. So 3.41 *7.91=26.9731. To get 27, we need 7.91 + (0.0269/3.41) → 0.0269/3.41≈0.00789 → gamma=7.91789.

So gamma=7.9179.

Then, L=gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

beta=sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2 )= sqrt(1-0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)=0.992005.

So L=7.9179 * 0.992005 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 7.9179 *0.992005 =7.866.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7.

7.866 *2.4e-7=1.88784e-6 m.

So approximately 1.888e-6 m.

But the options have A) 2.08e-6 m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the velocity as exactly c. So let's compute L using v=c.

L= gamma * c * tau_0 = 7.9179 *3e8 *8e-16.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7.

7.9179 *2.4e-7=1.9003e-6 m.

So L≈1.9e-6 m.

But again, the options don't have this. So I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the mean path length without considering the 30% factor, and then match that to the options. So the correct L is approximately 1.9e-6 m, but the option is 2.08e-6 m. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 2.08e-6 m is exactly (gamma * c * tau_0) *  (gamma * beta * c * tau_0) )? No, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I used GeV for both E and m, but the units should be in GeV/c² for mass. Hmm, but in natural units where c=1, it's okay. So perhaps the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A) 2.08e-6 m, and I'm missing a factor somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in L's calculation. Let me compute 27 GeV /3.41 GeV =7.9179.

Then, L = gamma * c * tau_0 =7.9179 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8=2.4e-7.

Multiply by 7.9179: 2.4e-7 *7.9179=1.9003e-6 m.

So L=1.9003e-6 m.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, 2.08 is approximately 1.9 *1.0947. So perhaps the question considered a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the proper formula for the decay length is L= v gamma tau_0.

But since v is beta c, it's beta gamma c tau_0.

Which is exactly what we've been computing. So unless I'm missing a factor, I don't see an error.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps the calculation is done using tau instead of tau_0. Wait, the proper lifetime is tau_0, but sometimes people confuse the two.

Wait, the formula is L = beta gamma c tau_0. So yes, that's correct.

If I compute using beta gamma as 7.866, as before, then L=7.866 *3e8 *8e-16 = same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the energy is given in GeV, and the mass is also in GeV/c², but when calculating gamma, the formula is gamma = E/(m c²). But since E and m are in GeV and GeV/c², perhaps there's a unit conversion issue. Wait, E is energy, m is rest mass energy. So E (in GeV) equals gamma m c² (but m c² is GeV). So gamma = E/(m) → yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps in the calculation, I should have considered that the energy is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV/c². So gamma = E/(m c²) = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV/c² * c²) ) → GeV cancels, c² cancels, so gamma=27/3.41. Correct.

Thus, I think the calculation is correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that the decay can be observed, which would be the decay length itself. So with L=1.9e-6 m, the closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, but 2.08 is close to 1.9. Perhaps I should check the exact calculation with more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute 27 divided by 3.41 precisely.

27 ÷ 3.41.

3.41 ×7 =23.87.

3.41 ×7.9=23.87 +3.41×0.9=23.87 +3.069=26.939.

27-26.939=0.061.

So 0.061 ÷3.41=0.0179.

So gamma=7.9 + 0.0179=7.9179.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the problem is only asking for the decay length without the 30% factor, which would be 1.9e-6 m, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity v as a fraction of c and multiply all the factors again.

Wait, beta=0.992005. So v=0.992005 *3e8 m/s=2.976e8 m/s.

So L=gamma * v * tau_0.

gamma=7.9179, v=2.976e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s.

Compute:

L=7.9179 *2.976e8 *8e-16.

First, 2.976e8 *8e-16=2.3808e-7.

Multiply by 7.9179: 2.3808e-7 *7.9179 ≈1.887e-6 m.

Same result as before.

Thus, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 2.08e-6 m. But I'm not seeing how it connects.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is using v = c, which would give L=gamma * c * tau_0.

Which is 7.9179 *3e8 *8e-16=1.9003e-6 m.

But that's close to option A, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the precise calculation yields 2.08e-6 m. Let me compute 3.41 *7.9179.

Wait, no, I think I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct L is about 1.89e-6 m, but the closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of gamma.

gamma=27 /3.41 = 7.9179.

So gamma*beta=7.9179*0.992005=7.866.

So L=7.866 *3e8 *8e-16.

Which is 7.866 *24e-8 =188.784e-8 =1.88784e-6 m.

So 1.88784e-6 m is 1.888e-6 m, which is 1.888 micrometers.

But the options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m → 2.08 micrometers.

B) 2.08e-9 m → 2.08 nanometers.

C) 2.08e-1 m → 20.8 cm.

D) 2.08e-3 m → 2.08 cm.

So the only option in the same order of magnitude is A.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the minimum resolution as the decay length multiplied by (1 - 0.3) → 0.7. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the decay length, and the correct option is A) 2.08e-6 m, which is approximately 2 micrometers.

But based on my calculation, it's 1.888 micrometers. So perhaps the exact value in the problem would lead to 2.08e-6 m when using precise gamma and beta.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done without considering beta, which is what the question expects.

If I compute L=gamma * c * tau_0.

Gamma=7.9179.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.9179 *3e8 *8e-16.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7.

7.9179 *2.4e-7=1.9003e-6 m.

Which is 1.9003e-6 m.

So perhaps the intended answer is option A) 2.08e-6 m, but my calculation doesn't reach that. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \), we start by calculating the decay length \( L \), which is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The decay length is given by:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \) is the proper lifetime of \( X^0 \),
- \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy of the particle,
- \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \) is the rest mass of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.9179
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(3.41)^2}{(27)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{11.6281}{729}} = \sqrt{0.984027} \approx 0.992005
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( L \)
Substitute the values into the formula for \( L \):
\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau_0 = (7.9179)(0.992005)(3 \times 10^8)(8 \times 10^{-16})
\]

First, calculate \( c \tau_0 \):
\[
c \tau_0 = (3 \times 10^8)(8 \times 10^{-16}) = 24 \times 10^{-8} = 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
\]

Now, calculate \( \gamma \beta c \tau_0 \):
\[
L = (7.9179)(2.4 \times 10^{-7}) \approx 1.899 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the decay length is approximately \( L \approx 1.899 \, \mu\text{m} \).

### Step 4: Consider the 30% observation condition
To observe at least 30% of the decays, the resolution \( R \) must satisfy:
\[
P = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{R}{L}\right) \geq 0.3
\]

Solving for \( R \):
\[
\exp\left(-\frac{R}{L}\right) \leq 0.7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad -\frac{R}{L} \leq \ln(0.7) \quad \Rightarrow \quad R \geq -L \ln(0.7)
\]

Using \( \ln(0.7) \approx -0.3567 \):
\[
R \geq L \times 0.3567
\]

Substitute \( L \approx 1.899 \, \mu\text{m} \):
\[
R \geq 1.899 \times 0.3567 \approx 0.676 \, \mu\text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated resolution \( R \) is approximately \( 0.676 \, \mu\text{m} \), but none of the options match this value. The closest option is **A) \( 2.08 \, \mu\text{m} \)**. While this value is larger than the calculated \( R \), it is the only option within the same order of magnitude. Therefore, the intended answer is likely **A**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. 

Wait, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime is important. Oh right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But when observed in the lab frame, time dilation comes into play because of relativity. So the lifetime we observe is longer than the proper lifetime. 

The formula for time dilation is gamma equals energy over mass. Or wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. So gamma = E / m. Here, E is given as 27 GeV and mass m is 3.41 GeV. Let me calculate that. 

So gamma = 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 3.41 times 7 is like 23.87, so 27 is about 3.41 * 7.9? Let me do it more accurately. 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 3.41 * 8 is 27.28, which is a bit more than 27. So 27/3.41 is approximately 7.91. Let's say gamma is about 7.91.

Now, the observed lifetime tau is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime tau_0. Tau_0 is 8e-16 seconds. So tau = 7.91 * 8e-16. Let me calculate that. 8 *7.91 is about 63.28. So 63.28e-16 seconds, or 6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, but how does this relate to the decay length? The decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The particle's speed is probably close to the speed of light. So the distance L is approximately speed v multiplied by the lifetime tau. Since v is roughly c, which is 3e8 m/s. 

So L = c * tau. Let me compute that. 3e8 m/s * 6.328e-15 s = 3 * 6.328 * 1e-7. 3*6 is 18, 3*0.328 is about 0.984. So 18.984e-7 meters. Which is 1.8984e-6 meters, or about 1.9e-6 meters.

But wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, so I think the idea is that the resolution must be such that a certain fraction of the decays can be detected. So perhaps the resolution needs to be on the order of the decay length, but maybe I'm missing something. 

Wait, the resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay products' positions. So the decay length has to be larger than the resolution for a certain fraction of the decays to be observed. Alternatively, the probability of observing the decay is related to the ratio between the decay length and the resolution. 

I recall that the probability P of observing a decay is given by P = 1 - exp(-L / L_res), where L is the average decay length and L_res is the resolution. Wait, but wait, when the decay length is much larger than the resolution, the exponential approaches 1, so P approaches 0. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the formula is P = 1 - exp(-L_res / L). Let me think. 

If L is the decay length, and the resolution is the distance you can resolve, then when L is much larger than the resolution, you can't see it, so the probability would be low. Alternatively, when L is smaller than the resolution, the decay would not be observed because you can't distinguish the decay point. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach. The average path length is L = gamma * c * tau_0. But to observe the decay, the distance the particle travels before decaying must be such that the chamber can detect it. The minimum resolution is the smallest length that can be detected. I think the problem is stating that the chamber must have a resolution (let's say the minimum detectable length) such that at least 30% of the decays are observed.

So the probability of observing the decay is when the decay length is greater than the resolution. But wait, the decay length is a statistical thing. So perhaps we need to find the resolution such that the probability of the decay happening within that resolution is 30%.

Wait, the decay length is a random variable. The probability that a decay occurs within a certain distance is given by the decay probability, which is a function of the distance. The formula is P = 1 - exp(-t), where t is the time. But in terms of distance, since L = v * t, and v≈c, t = L/(c). So P = 1 - exp(-L/(gamma c tau_0)). Wait, because proper lifetime tau_0 is the mean lifetime, the observed lifetime is gamma tau_0.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The average decay length is L_avg = c * gamma tau_0. But the distribution is exponential, so the probability that the decay occurs within a certain length x is P = 1 - exp(-x / L_avg).

Wait, no, I think I might have it backwards. The probability that the decay occurs after traveling a distance x is exp(-x / L_avg). So the probability that it decays within x is 1 - exp(-x / L_avg). So to get at least 30% (0.3) of the decays observed, we set 1 - exp(-x / L_avg) = 0.3. 

So solving for x: exp(-x/L_avg) = 0.7 → -x/L_avg = ln(0.7) → x = - L_avg * ln(0.7). Hmm, ln(0.7) is approximately -0.3567. So x = L_avg * 0.3567. 

So we need to compute L_avg first. L_avg = c * gamma * tau_0. Let me compute that:

c = 3e8 m/s.

gamma was approx 7.91.

tau_0 =8e-16 s.

So L_avg = 3e8 *7.91 *8e-16.

Let me compute that step by step.

3e8 *7.91 = 2.373e9.

2.373e9 *8e-16 = (2.373 *8) * 1e-7. 2.373 *8 is about 18.984.

So L_avg ≈18.984e-7 meters, which is 1.8984e-6 meters, or about 1.9e-6 meters.

Now, x is 0.3567 * 1.8984e-6 m. Let me compute that.

0.3567 *1.8984e-6 ≈0.3567 *1.8984 ≈ 0.6779e-6 m → approximately 6.78e-7 m, which is 0.678e-6 m.

Wait, but the options are 2.08e-6 m, 2.08e-9, etc. Hmm, so my calculation resulted in about 6.78e-7 m, which is about 0.678e-6 m, but none of the options seems to match that. 

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check the gamma calculation.

Gamma = E / m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. So 27 divided by 3.41.

Let me compute 3.41 times 7 is 23.87. 27 minus 23.87 is 3.13. 3.13 /3.41 is about 0.917. So gamma is approximately 7.917.

So gamma is about 7.917. 

L_avg = c * gamma * tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s.

gamma=7.917.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L_avg = 3e8 *7.917 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 = 24e-8 = 2.4e-7.

Then multiply by 7.917: 2.4e-7 *7.917= (2.4 *7.917) e-7.

2.4 *7 is 16.8, 2.4 *0.917≈2.4 *0.9=2.16 → so about 18.96e-7 m.

Which is 1.896e-6 m, which is about 1.9e-6 m.

Now, x=0.3567 *1.896e-6 = approx 0.3567 *1.896 = let's compute:

0.3 *1.896=0.5688

0.05 *1.896=0.0948 → total 0.6636

Wait, 0.3567 is 0.3 + 0.05 + 0.0067.

Wait, maybe a better way: 0.3567 *1.896 → let's compute as 1.896 *0.35 = 0.6636, and 1.896 *0.0067 ≈ 0.0127. So total x≈0.6636+0.0127=0.6763e-6 m, which is 6.763e-7 m.

So about 6.76e-7 meters.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option A) 2.08e-6 m, but that's larger than my result. Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should consider the velocity as a factor. Because L = gamma * v * tau_0. Or wait, no, because tau is gamma tau_0, and L = v * tau. But v is approximately c, but for precise calculation, perhaps I should compute beta * c, where beta is v/c.

Wait, beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² c^4)) ) → m^2/(E^2) → (3.41/27)^2 ≈ (0.1263)^2 ≈ 0.01595 → beta^2 = 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405 → beta ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992.

So beta is about 0.992, so v ≈ 0.992c.

So in that case, L_avg = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, but gamma is E/(m c^2) → but wait, no. Gamma is E/(m c^2) if E is the total energy. Because the rest energy is m c². So if E is 27 GeV, and m c² is 3.41 GeV, then gamma is 27/3.41 ≈7.917 as before.

So, using v = beta c, and L = gamma * beta c * tau_0.

Wait, because tau is gamma tau_0, so L = v tau = beta c gamma tau_0. So that's correct.

So perhaps including this beta, I should recalculate. Let me compute beta.

E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²) = 27/(3.41) ≈7.917.

Beta is v/c = sqrt(1 − (1/gamma^2)) → sqrt(1 - 1/(7.917)^2) → sqrt(1 - 1/62.69) → sqrt(61.69/62.69) → sqrt(0.984) ≈0.992.

So beta ≈0.992 → v ≈ 0.992c.

So L_avg = beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is 0.992 *3e8 m/s *7.917 *8e-16 s.

Compute step by step:

First, 3e8 *8e-16 = 24e-8 = 2.4e-7.

Multiply by gamma (7.917): 2.4e-7 *7.917 = approx 1.899e-6.

Then multiply by beta (0.992): 1.899e-6 *0.992 ≈1.884e-6 m.

So L_avg ≈1.884e-6 m, which is about 1.88e-6 m.

Then x is 0.3567 *1.884e-6 → 0.3567 *1.884 is approximately 0.673e-6 m, or 6.73e-7 m.

Still about the same as before. 

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe the question is asking for the minimum resolution, which is the decay length itself, but only a certain fraction is observed. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps the resolution must be such that 30% of the decays have a decay length larger than the resolution. Wait, that would mean that the decay length is the minimum to detect 70% of the decays. No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, if the resolution is R, then the probability that a decay is observed is the probability that the decay occurs within R. Because if the decay length is longer than R, you can't observe it. Wait, no, that seems incorrect. 

Wait, the decay occurs at some point along the path. The bubble chamber records the decay if the decay occurs within a certain small region, say, the resolution. So the smaller the resolution, the less likely to capture the decay. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the probability depends on the decay length. If the decay length is L, then the decay can happen anywhere along a path of length L. The resolution is the ability to pinpoint where the decay happened. If L is much larger than the resolution, the probability of seeing the decay is lower because the decay could happen anywhere along a longer path. 

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look up the formula for the detection probability based on decay length and resolution.

I remember that the probability of detecting a decay is given by P = 1 - exp(-R / L), where R is the resolution and L is the mean decay length. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The probability that the decay occurs within a certain length R is P = 1 - exp(-R / L). So if R is the resolution, you can detect the decay only if the decay happens within R. So to have at least 30% of the decays observed, we set 1 - exp(-R / L) ≥ 0.3.

So, solving for R: exp(-R/L) ≤ 0.7 → -R/L ≤ ln(0.7) → R ≥ - L ln(0.7) ≈ L * 0.3567.

So R must be at least approximately 35.67% of L.

So R = 0.3567 * L_avg.

We already have L_avg ≈1.884e-6 m. So R=0.3567 *1.884e-6 ≈0.3567 *1.884 = approx 0.673e-6 m, or 6.73e-7 m.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps we're making a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that at least 30% of the decays are observed, which would correspond to the decay length being larger than the resolution.

Wait, perhaps another way: the number of decays observed depends on the decay length. The minimum resolution required to observe a certain fraction would be when the decay length is just greater than the resolution, so that the probability of the decay being detected is 30%.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the decay length L without considering the 30% factor, and then see which option is closest.

Wait, the decay length without any probability consideration is L = gamma * v * tau_0. Which we calculated as approximately 1.88e-6 meters, which is option A: 2.08e-6 m. Close, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the precise calculation is needed. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Gamma =27 /3.41.

3.41 * 7.9 = 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41 *0.9=3.069 → total 26.939. Close to 27. So 27/3.41 ≈7.913.

So gamma=7.913.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)) = sqrt(1 - (3.41²)/(27²)).

3.41^2 = 11.6281, 27^2=729. So 11.6281 /729 ≈0.01598. So 1 -0.01598=0.98402. sqrt(0.98402)= about 0.9920 approximately.

So beta=0.9920.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s.

gamma=7.913.

beta=0.9920.

So L =7.913 *0.9920 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 7.913 *0.9920: 7.913 *0.992 ≈7.866.

Then, 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8=2.4e-7.

Multiply by 7.866: 2.4e-7 *7.866 = 1.88784e-6 meters.

So L=1.88784e-6 m.

So the decay length is approximately 1.888e-6 m, which is about 1.89e-6 m.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is a bit higher. So perhaps the precise calculation with more accurate numbers would match exactly.

Wait, perhaps 2.08e-6 is exactly 1.89e-6 multiplied by approximately 1.1. Hmm, but why would that be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach, and the question is simply asking for the decay length without considering the 30% factor, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation of gamma uses the relativistic beta factor in a different way. Let me think again about the decay length formula.

Wait, the decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

Yes, that's correct.

So if we calculate L as gamma * beta * c * tau_0, and then set R to be at least 35.67% of L, then R would be about 0.3567 *1.888e-6 m ≈6.73e-7 m.

But that's not one of the options. So perhaps the question is not considering the probability factor, and is just asking for the decay length itself, which would be approximately 1.88e-6 m, but that's not an option either. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately L.

Let me calculate gamma exactly: 27 /3.41.

27 /3.41 = ?

3.41 ×7.9=26.939 → 27-26.939=0.061.

So 0.061 /3.41 ≈0.0179.

So gamma=7.9 +0.0179=7.9179.

Beta: sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2)).

3.41^2=11.6281.

27^2=729.

11.6281/729=0.015973.

1-0.015973=0.984027.

sqrt(0.984027)= approx 0.99200.

So beta=0.99200.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

gamma=7.9179, beta=0.992.

gamma*beta=7.9179 *0.992= approximately 7.866.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L =7.866 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7.

Multiply by 7.866: 2.4e-7 *7.866= 1.88784e-6 m.

So 1.88784e-6 m.

Wait, but why is option A 2.08e-6 m? Perhaps I should check if I made a miscalculation in the earlier steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy is given as 27 GeV, but is that the kinetic energy or the total energy? Because E in the gamma formula is the total energy.

The problem states the energy is 27 GeV, so it's the total energy including rest mass. So gamma is correct as E/(m c²) =27/3.41.

Hmm, perhaps another error is in the calculation of L.

Wait, 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s = 24e-8 m =2.4e-7 m. Then multiply by gamma*beta: 2.4e-7 m *7.9179*0.992.

Wait, 7.9179 *0.992 =7.866.

So 2.4e-7 *7.866= 1.88784e-6 m.

So that's correct.

But the options have A) 2.08e-6 m, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is to use beta as 1, so L = gamma * c * tau_0. Then L=7.9179 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute: 7.9179 *3e8=2.375e9. 2.375e9 *8e-16= (2.375 *8) * 1e-7 =19e-7=1.9e-6 m, which is 1.9e-6 m. Hmm, that's even closer to option A.

But why would we use beta as 1? Because particles are moving at nearly the speed of light, perhaps to approximate we take v=c. So L ≈ gamma * c * tau_0.

Which would give L=7.9179 *3e8 *8e-16 = 7.9179 *24e-8 = (7.9179 *24) *1e-8.

7.9179 *24: 7*24=168, 0.9179*24≈22.03 → total≈190.03.

So 190.03e-8 m =1.9003e-6 m.

So about 1.9e-6 m.

But option A is 2.08e-6 m. So perhaps the exact calculation yields 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, let's do the exact calculation with more precise numbers.

Calculating gamma=27/3.41.

27 /3.41= Let's compute this exactly.

3.41 ×7 =23.87. 27-23.87=3.13.

3.13/3.41= 0.9179.

So gamma=7.9179.

v = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) → m=3.41 GeV, E=27 GeV.

So (m/E)=3.41/27=0.1263 → square is 0.01595.

1-0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)=0.992005.

So beta=0.992005.

So L= gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

gamma * beta=7.9179 *0.992005 = 7.866.

c=2.99792e8 m/s (more precise).

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.866 * 2.99792e8 *8e-16.

Compute 2.99792e8 *8e-16 = 2.398336e-7.

Multiply by 7.866: 2.398336e-7 *7.866 = ?

2.398336e-7 *7 = 1.678835e-6.

2.398336e-7 *0.866≈2.398336e-7 *0.8=1.918669e-7; 2.398336e-7 *0.066≈1.580e-8.

Adding them: 1.918669e-7 +1.580e-8 =2.076669e-7.

So total L=1.678835e-6 +2.076669e-7=1.8865e-6 m.

Hmm, about 1.8865e-6 m. So around 1.89e-6 meters.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, the problem says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps the probability comes into play, and the resolution R should be such that the probability is 30%.

Earlier, I thought P=1 - exp(-R/L). To have P=0.3, R= L * ( -ln(1-P) ) = L * ln(7/3) ≈ L * 0.8473.

Wait, wait, no. Let's correct that.

P = 1 - exp( - R/(L) )

We set P =0.3 → 0.3 =1 - exp( -R/L )

→ exp(-R/L) =0.7 → -R/L = ln(0.7) → R= L * (-ln(0.7)).

ln(0.7)= -0.35667.

So R= L * 0.35667.

With L=1.8865e-6 m, R= 1.8865e-6 *0.35667 ≈6.73e-7 m → ~6.73e-7 m.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the approach is incorrect, and the problem is simply asking for the decay length, not considering the 30% factor.

In that case, the L is ~1.89e-6 m. But the closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, let me compute gamma again, using precise division.

gamma =27 /3.41.

3.41 *7.91=27.00.

Wait, 3.41*7.91=?

3.41 *7=23.87.

3.41 *0.9=3.069. 3.41 *0.01=0.0341.

So 7.91 is 7 +0.9 +0.01 → 23.87 +3.069 +0.0341=26.9731.

But 27 is 26.9731 plus 0.0269. So 3.41 *7.91=26.9731. To get 27, we need 7.91 + (0.0269/3.41) → 0.0269/3.41≈0.00789 → gamma=7.91789.

So gamma=7.9179.

Then, L=gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

beta=sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2 )= sqrt(1-0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)=0.992005.

So L=7.9179 * 0.992005 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 7.9179 *0.992005 =7.866.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7.

7.866 *2.4e-7=1.88784e-6 m.

So approximately 1.888e-6 m.

But the options have A) 2.08e-6 m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the velocity as exactly c. So let's compute L using v=c.

L= gamma * c * tau_0 = 7.9179 *3e8 *8e-16.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7.

7.9179 *2.4e-7=1.9003e-6 m.

So L≈1.9e-6 m.

But again, the options don't have this. So I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the mean path length without considering the 30% factor, and then match that to the options. So the correct L is approximately 1.9e-6 m, but the option is 2.08e-6 m. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 2.08e-6 m is exactly (gamma * c * tau_0) *  (gamma * beta * c * tau_0) )? No, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I used GeV for both E and m, but the units should be in GeV/c² for mass. Hmm, but in natural units where c=1, it's okay. So perhaps the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A) 2.08e-6 m, and I'm missing a factor somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in L's calculation. Let me compute 27 GeV /3.41 GeV =7.9179.

Then, L = gamma * c * tau_0 =7.9179 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8=2.4e-7.

Multiply by 7.9179: 2.4e-7 *7.9179=1.9003e-6 m.

So L=1.9003e-6 m.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, 2.08 is approximately 1.9 *1.0947. So perhaps the question considered a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the proper formula for the decay length is L= v gamma tau_0.

But since v is beta c, it's beta gamma c tau_0.

Which is exactly what we've been computing. So unless I'm missing a factor, I don't see an error.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps the calculation is done using tau instead of tau_0. Wait, the proper lifetime is tau_0, but sometimes people confuse the two.

Wait, the formula is L = beta gamma c tau_0. So yes, that's correct.

If I compute using beta gamma as 7.866, as before, then L=7.866 *3e8 *8e-16 = same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the energy is given in GeV, and the mass is also in GeV/c², but when calculating gamma, the formula is gamma = E/(m c²). But since E and m are in GeV and GeV/c², perhaps there's a unit conversion issue. Wait, E is energy, m is rest mass energy. So E (in GeV) equals gamma m c² (but m c² is GeV). So gamma = E/(m) → yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps in the calculation, I should have considered that the energy is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV/c². So gamma = E/(m c²) = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV/c² * c²) ) → GeV cancels, c² cancels, so gamma=27/3.41. Correct.

Thus, I think the calculation is correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that the decay can be observed, which would be the decay length itself. So with L=1.9e-6 m, the closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, but 2.08 is close to 1.9. Perhaps I should check the exact calculation with more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute 27 divided by 3.41 precisely.

27 ÷ 3.41.

3.41 ×7 =23.87.

3.41 ×7.9=23.87 +3.41×0.9=23.87 +3.069=26.939.

27-26.939=0.061.

So 0.061 ÷3.41=0.0179.

So gamma=7.9 + 0.0179=7.9179.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the problem is only asking for the decay length without the 30% factor, which would be 1.9e-6 m, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity v as a fraction of c and multiply all the factors again.

Wait, beta=0.992005. So v=0.992005 *3e8 m/s=2.976e8 m/s.

So L=gamma * v * tau_0.

gamma=7.9179, v=2.976e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s.

Compute:

L=7.9179 *2.976e8 *8e-16.

First, 2.976e8 *8e-16=2.3808e-7.

Multiply by 7.9179: 2.3808e-7 *7.9179 ≈1.887e-6 m.

Same result as before.

Thus, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 2.08e-6 m. But I'm not seeing how it connects.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is using v = c, which would give L=gamma * c * tau_0.

Which is 7.9179 *3e8 *8e-16=1.9003e-6 m.

But that's close to option A, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the precise calculation yields 2.08e-6 m. Let me compute 3.41 *7.9179.

Wait, no, I think I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct L is about 1.89e-6 m, but the closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of gamma.

gamma=27 /3.41 = 7.9179.

So gamma*beta=7.9179*0.992005=7.866.

So L=7.866 *3e8 *8e-16.

Which is 7.866 *24e-8 =188.784e-8 =1.88784e-6 m.

So 1.88784e-6 m is 1.888e-6 m, which is 1.888 micrometers.

But the options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m → 2.08 micrometers.

B) 2.08e-9 m → 2.08 nanometers.

C) 2.08e-1 m → 20.8 cm.

D) 2.08e-3 m → 2.08 cm.

So the only option in the same order of magnitude is A.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the minimum resolution as the decay length multiplied by (1 - 0.3) → 0.7. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the decay length, and the correct option is A) 2.08e-6 m, which is approximately 2 micrometers.

But based on my calculation, it's 1.888 micrometers. So perhaps the exact value in the problem would lead to 2.08e-6 m when using precise gamma and beta.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done without considering beta, which is what the question expects.

If I compute L=gamma * c * tau_0.

Gamma=7.9179.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.9179 *3e8 *8e-16.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7.

7.9179 *2.4e-7=1.9003e-6 m.

Which is 1.9003e-6 m.

So perhaps the intended answer is option A) 2.08e-6 m, but my calculation doesn't reach that. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \), we start by calculating the decay length \( L \), which is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The decay length is given by:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \) is the proper lifetime of \( X^0 \),
- \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy of the particle,
- \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \) is the rest mass of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.9179
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(3.41)^2}{(27)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{11.6281}{729}} = \sqrt{0.984027} \approx 0.992005
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( L \)
Substitute the values into the formula for \( L \):
\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau_0 = (7.9179)(0.992005)(3 \times 10^8)(8 \times 10^{-16})
\]

First, calculate \( c \tau_0 \):
\[
c \tau_0 = (3 \times 10^8)(8 \times 10^{-16}) = 24 \times 10^{-8} = 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
\]

Now, calculate \( \gamma \beta c \tau_0 \):
\[
L = (7.9179)(2.4 \times 10^{-7}) \approx 1.899 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the decay length is approximately \( L \approx 1.899 \, \mu\text{m} \).

### Step 4: Consider the 30% observation condition
To observe at least 30% of the decays, the resolution \( R \) must satisfy:
\[
P = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{R}{L}\right) \geq 0.3
\]

Solving for \( R \):
\[
\exp\left(-\frac{R}{L}\right) \leq 0.7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad -\frac{R}{L} \leq \ln(0.7) \quad \Rightarrow \quad R \geq -L \ln(0.7)
\]

Using \( \ln(0.7) \approx -0.3567 \):
\[
R \geq L \times 0.3567
\]

Substitute \( L \approx 1.899 \, \mu\text{m} \):
\[
R \geq 1.899 \times 0.3567 \approx 0.676 \, \mu\text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated resolution \( R \) is approximately \( 0.676 \, \mu\text{m} \), but none of the options match this value. The closest option is **A) \( 2.08 \, \mu\text{m} \)**. While this value is larger than the calculated \( R \), it is the only option within the same order of magnitude. Therefore, the intended answer is likely **A**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
