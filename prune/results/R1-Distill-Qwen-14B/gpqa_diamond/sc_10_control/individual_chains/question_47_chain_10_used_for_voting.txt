Okay, so I need to figure out which compound is C9H11NO2 given the spectroscopic data. Let's see... I remember that the molecular formula can help determine the structure. Let me write down the formula: C9H11NO2. The degrees of unsaturation would be... well, the formula is CnHmOxNy. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m -x -y)/2. So here, n=9, m=11, x=2 (two O), y=1 (one N). Plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2=6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That could mean three rings, but more likely a combination like one ring and two double bonds, or maybe a benzene ring plus a double bond or an amide group.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those broad peaks are probably from -NH stretches. Wait, but amides usually have a broad peak around 3300, right? But sometimes if it's a primary amine or something else, maybe. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be an ester, amide, ketone, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the molecular formula has two oxygen, and the presence of N and O in the formula suggests maybe an ester and an amide, or an amide and something else.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's probably a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ethyl group. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2, so maybe OCH2CH3, like an ethoxy group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Hmm. Broad suggests maybe something exchanging, like an amine, but the integration is 2. Or maybe it's an ethylene group next to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group. Wait, but the ethoxy is probably at 1.20 and 4.0. Wait, no, ethoxy is OCH2CH3, where the CH3 is triplet at 1.2, and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.3. Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 is a broad singlet. Maybe it's not OCH2 but something else.

Wait, the next peak is at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). Quartet, 2H. A quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Maybe a CH2 next to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group, but perhaps as part of an ester. Wait, in an ester like OCH2CH2COO..., no, wait. Let's think about esters: the ester group is O-CO-O. The ethyl ester would have the ethyl group attached to the oxygen. So the ethyl would split into a quartet for the OCH2 and a triplet for the CH2CH3. But in the NMR, we have a triplet at 1.2 (3H), which would fit the CH2CH3 part. So the quartet at 4.5 ppm would be the OCH2 group.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, at 4.0 ppm, we have a broad singlet for 2H. That's confusing. Maybe it's not an ethoxy group but something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an NH group, but 2H? Or maybe it's an -OCH2- attached to something else.

Looking further, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the doublets with two protons each would be on either side. So if the substituents are in the para positions, that would explain the two doublets each integrating to 2H.

Putting this together: a benzene ring with substituents in para positions. Let's say one substituent is an ethoxy group (since we've got the 1.20 triplet and maybe the 4.0 quartet?), but wait, the OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet around 4.0-4.3, but in the NMR, the 4.0 is a broad singlet. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group that includes an oxygen and a carbonyl.

Wait, the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. That could be an ester, amide, or ketone. Since the molecule has an amide or ester group, perhaps. Let's think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group in the 3 position. The benzamide would have a CONH2 group. But wait, benzamide is C6H5CONH2. If it's 3-ethoxy, then the substituents are at 3 and maybe another position? Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet for 2H at 4.0, which might not fit.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxy phenyl group. So the benzene has an ethoxy in para and a formamide group in another position. Wait, but formamide would have a structure like R-NH-CO-R, but in this case, maybe HCO-NH-Ph-OEt. Not entirely sure. The 1H NMR would have the ethoxy group, the formamide NH, which might show up broad.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be the structure where the benzene has an NH2 group and a propionate (CH2CH2COO-) group. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be something like PhNH2 and PhOOCCH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So it would be PhNH2 and the propionate ester? Or maybe the amino is attached to the benzene and the propionate is another substituent. The molecular formula for this would be C9H11NO2 if the substituents are in correct positions.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is the benzoate ester, where the benzoate has an amino group in the para position. So the structure would be OEt-CO-PhNH2. Wait, the benzoate would be O-CO-OEt. If the amino is para to the ester, then the structure is PhNH2-CO-OEt. But wait, 4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester would be PhNH2 with a COOEt group in the para position.

Let me think about the NMR for each option. The aromatic signals in the NMR are two doublets, 2H each, at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. That suggests a para-substituted benzene. Let's say the substituents are in the para positions, so the ring is symmetric. The substituents could be an amino group and an ester group, or an ethoxy and an amide, etc.

Looking at option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure would be a benzene ring with an amino group (NH2) and a COOEt group in para positions. The amino group would be in position 4, so the substituents are in positions 1 and 4 (assuming the COOEt is at position 1 and NH2 at 4, or vice versa). Wait, the NH2 group would be a strong deshield, so the protons adjacent would be downfield. Wait, no, the aromatic protons would be in the ortho and para positions relative to the substituents.

Wait, in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the substituents are in the para positions. So the benzene ring has COOEt at position 1 and NH2 at position 4. Wait, no, if it's 4-aminobenzoate, then the amino is at position 4 and the ester is at position 1 (the benzoate is O-CO-OEt attached to the benzene in position 1, and NH2 in position 4. But then the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. The substituents are at 1 and 4, so the ortho positions would be 2 and 6 relative to the ester, and 3 and 5 relative to the amino.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the NMR. The aromatic signals are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps the substituents are para to each other, and the aromatic protons are in a pair of doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each pair of ortho protons would be equivalent. Wait, no, if substituents are in para, the two ortho positions on either substituent would be equivalent. Wait, no. Let's imagine a benzene with substituents in positions 1 and 4. Then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to substituent 1, and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to substituent 4. If substituents are de-shielding, then the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be more downfield than 3 and 5? Or the opposite? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an electron-withdrawing group (like the ester) and an electron-donating group (like amino). The amino group is NH2, which is electron-donating, so the ring is activated. The ester is O-CO-OEt, which is an electron-withdrawing group.

For the NMR of a para-disubstituted benzene, with substituents X and Y in the 1 and 4 positions, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. The protons ortho to X would be in one environment, and the protons ortho to Y would be in another. So, for example, if X is the ester group (COOEt) and Y is NH2, then the ortho protons to X (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear downfield, while the ortho protons to Y (positions 3 and 5) would be shielded and appear upfield.

Wait, the amino group is strong EDG, which would deshield the ortho protons (make them more downfield), while the ester is EWG, which would also deshield the ortho protons. Hmm, maybe both substituents deshield the adjacent protons, but since they are para, the two sets of ortho protons would be equivalent in each pair. So in the NMR, you would have two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The downfield shift would be due to the substituents' effects.

In the given NMR, the aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. So, the 8.0 ppm is more downfield. So perhaps the substituent causing more deshielding is the one with the amino group. Wait, amino is EDG, which usually causes ortho protons to be upfield, but wait, amino is a strong activating group, so the ortho and para protons are more shielded (upfield). Wait, no. Let me think. EDGs activate the ring, making it easier for electrophilic substitution. But when it comes to NMR shifts, EDGs like -NH2 are ortho/para directors. They donate electrons, which can make the ring more electron-rich. Ortho protons to -NH2 are usually upfield, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait another approach: The substituent with the higher electronegativity (like the ester group) would deshield the adjacent protons more, causing them to appear downfield. So if the substituent is an ester, which is EWG, then the adjacent protons (ortho) would be more downfield. So in the NMR, the protons adjacent to the ester would be at higher ppm, like 8.0, and those adjacent to the amino would be at lower ppm, like 7.0.

So if the ester is in position 1 and the amino in position 4, the protons ortho to the ester (positions 2 and 6) would be around 8.0 ppm, and the protons ortho to the amino (positions 3 and 5) would be around 7.0 ppm. That fits with the NMR data.

Now, looking at the other parts of the NMR. The 4.5 ppm quartet for 2H suggests a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Like in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have a quartet at around 4.1-4.3. But in the given data, it's at 4.5. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl adjacent group.

Wait, in the ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1, but if it's part of a carbonyl group, like COOCH2CH3, then the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1 ppm. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5. So maybe it's not an ethyl ester. Alternatively, could it be a propyl group, but that doesn't fit the triplet at 1.2 ppm. Wait, the triplet is at 1.2, 3H, which is likely a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, let me think about the structure again. The NMR has a triplet at 1.2 ppm (3H), which is typical for a CH2CH3 group. So that would correspond to OCH2CH3, which is an ethoxy group. So I think the compound has an ethoxy group somewhere.

Looking back at the IR: the 1720 cm^-1 peak is a strong carbonyl. So that suggests an ester or amide. If it's an ester, then the structure would have a COOEt group. If it's an amide, then a CONHR group.

Looking at option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is OEt-CO-PhNH2. So, the ester group is COOEt, and the amino is in the para position. So the aromatic protons would be in two doublets as discussed.

In the NMR, the ethoxy's CH2 would be a quartet around 4.1 ppm, but in the data, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm. Wait, the NMR data has 4.5 as a quartet (2H), and 4.0 as a broad singlet (2H). Maybe the 4.0 ppm is the OCH2 group. But ethoxy's OCH2 is usually around 4.1-4.3. So why is it at 4.0? Or perhaps it's a different group.

Wait, another possibility: the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is an NH2 group. But NH2 protons are usually broad, but they would be in a singlet if they are exchanging. But the integration is 2H, which doesn't fit because NH2 has two protons. But the problem is that NH2 protons can sometimes exchange and give a broad peak. But in the NMR, the 4.0 is a broad singlet for 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2- group where the protons are split due to coupling. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count the carbons. Benzene is 6 carbons. The substituents are likely two groups, each contributing the remaining 3 carbons. Alternatively, one group is the ethoxy (OCH2CH3, 2 carbons) and the other is a carbonyl group with perhaps an ethyl ester (like COOCH2CH3, which is another 2 carbons, but that's only 4 in total). Hmm, maybe the substituents are ethoxy and another group. Let me think.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: benzene (6 C) plus substituents. Let's see the substituents: perhaps an ethoxy (2 C) and a group that contributes 1 C, but that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe the substituents include a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. Let's count the substituents.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is OEt-CO-PhNH2. So, the substituents are COOEt (which is 3 carbons: COOCH2CH3) and NH2 (no carbons). Wait, the COOEt group is:

COOEt is O=C-O-CH2CH3. So the carbonyl is from the benzoate, which is part of the benzene ring. The substituents are OEt (2 carbons) and NH2 (no carbons). Wait, no, the substituent is the COOEt group. Wait, the benzoate is attached as COOEt. So the substituent is para to the amino group. So, the COOEt is one substituent, and NH2 is another. So the substituents have 2 carbons (from OEt) and the COO group is part of the ring.

Wait, perhaps I need to count the carbons for each option.

Option D: the structure is PhNH2-COOEt.

Ph is 6 C, COOEt is 3 C (COO plus Et). Wait, COOEt is O-CO-OEt, where OEt is CH2CH3. So COOEt has 3 carbons. So Ph (6) + COOEt (3) + NH2 (no C). But that's 9 C. Oh wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So that matches. So option D has 9 C.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is PhOEt attached to a formamide group (HCONH-). So the substituents are OEt (2 C) and HCONHR (but R is the phenyl). Wait, formamide is HCONHPh. So the substituents are OEt and HCONHPh. Wait, no, perhaps the formamide is attached to the 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the structure would be Ph(OEt)-NH-CO-H. So that's Ph-OEt and Ph-NH-CO-H.

Wait, the molecular formula for formamide would be C8H9NO2: the benzene (6 C), OEt (2 C), and formamide (CO and NH). Wait, no, let me count: 4-ethoxyphenyl group is C6H4-OCH2CH3 (so 6+2=8 C?), but then the formamide adds HCONH-.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the NMR again.

The NMR has 1.20 ppm (t, 3H). That's the ethoxy CH2CH3 group. So the OCH2CH3 is present. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) is probably the OCH2 group. Wait, but in the ethoxy group, the OCH2 is adjacent to the CH3, which is a triplet, and the OCH2 would be a quartet. So that fits. So the triplet (1.20, 3H) is the CH3, quartet (4.5, 2H) is the OCH2.

But then, what about the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)? That's a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm. Maybe that's the NH2 group. But in option D, the NH2 is on the benzene ring. The NH2 protons would typically be broad, but in the NMR, the 4.0 would be the NH2? But wait, aromatic NH2 protons are usually more downfield. Also, NH2 protons can exchange and appear broad, but in the case of a primary amine (like NH2), the protons might be more upfield. Alternatively, maybe the NH is part of another group, like an amide.

Wait, looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-Ph-OEt. So the formamide group is attached to the benzene ring, which also has an ethoxy group in the para position. The NH would be part of the formamide. So the formamide would have a NH group, which might show up as a broad peak. But the integration is 2H, which would suggest two NH protons. But formamide would have one NH group (with two protons). Hmm, the integration is 2H, which fits with one NH group (if it's a singlet, but the broadness suggests exchange). Wait, but the NMR shows 2H as a broad singlet, which fits an NH2 group, perhaps. But formamide has an NH group, not NH2. So maybe that's not it.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is NH2-Ph-OOC-CH2CH2CH3 (if it's a propionate ester). Wait, propionate would be CH2CH2COO-, so the structure would be PhNH2 and OOC-CH2CH2CH3 attached as an ester. So the substituents are NH2 and OOC-CH2CH2CH3 in para positions. Then, the NMR would have the ethoxy group? No, because propionate is CH2CH2CH3. Wait, the triplet at 1.2 ppm is CH2CH3, which would be from a propyl group. Wait, the triplet at 1.2 is 3H, which would be the CH2CH3 of an ethyl group, not a propyl. So that might not fit. Unless it's a different group.

Wait, maybe the ethyl group is part of an ester. Let's see. In option D, the substituent is COOEt. So the ethyl group would be in the ester. So the 1.20 triplet is the CH2CH3, and the quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2.

But in the NMR, there's also a peak at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). What could that be? Maybe it's the NH2 protons. But in option D, the NH2 is on the benzene ring. So the NH2 protons would be in the aromatic region, but they are usually not observed because they are exchange broadened and appear as a singlet. Alternatively, they might not appear in the NMR because they're broad and possibly in the baseline.

Wait, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be an -OCH2- group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's an -NHCH2- group, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the molecular formula. For option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The formula would be C8H7NO3 (benzoic acid ethyl ester with NH2 group). Wait, no. Let me calculate: benzene (C6H5), then COOEt (C3H5O2), and NH2 (C0H2N). So the total is C6 +3 = C9; H: 5 (Ph) +5 (COOEt) + 2 (NH2) = 12 H. But the formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm, so 9 C, 11 H, 1 N, 2 O.

Wait, let me calculate the formula for option D. Structure is OEt-CO-NH2Ph. Wait, no, it's PhNH2-COOEt. So:

Ph is C6H5.

COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which adds 3 O's but in the formula, it's O2. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, the molecular formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO3. Because:

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When you make the ethyl ester, you replace the -OH with OEt, so you add 2 C and 5 H (since OEt is C2H5O). Wait, let me compute:

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Ester would be C7H5O2 + C2H5O (from OEt) → C9H10O3. Wait, but with an NH2 group in para position, which adds another H2. So the formula becomes C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that might rule out option D.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because the given formula has two oxygen atoms, but option D would have three.

Wait, let me think again. What is the molecular formula of option D?

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: the structure is OEtOC6H4NH2.

Wait, the benzoate ester is OEtOC6H4NH2.

Breaking it down: the benzene ring is C6H5. The COOEt group is OEtOCO- (so that's 3 O: COO has two O, Et has O). Wait, no, the ester group is O-CO-OEt. So the formula would be: C6H5COOEt plus NH2. Wait, no, it's C6H4(COOEt)(NH2).

Wait, perhaps I should count each atom:

Phenyl group: C6H5

COOEt: 2 O from COO, and O from Et (so total 3 O?), but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the molecular formula step by step.

The formula is C9H11NO2.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Benzoate is C7H5O2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, and the ester would have one less H because the acid loses H when esterified. Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When you esterify it with ethanol, you replace -OH with -OEt. So the ester would be C7H5O2 + C2H5O → but wait, perhaps I'm complicating.

Alternatively, count atoms:

COOEt: COO has 2 O, Et is O. So COOEt is O3?

Wait, the formula for the ester group is O-CO-OEt. So in that group, the O count is 3 (two from COO, one from OEt). So the entire molecule would have:

Ph (C6H5) + COOEt (C3H5O3) + NH2.

Wait, no, COOEt is O-CO-OEt, which is O-CO-OCH2CH3.

So each COOEt contributes 3 O.

But the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. So the compound can't have three O's.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confused. Let me compute the formula for option D:

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The structure is OEt-CO-PhNH2.

So, PhNH2 is C6H5NH2 → which is C6H7N.

COOEt is O-CO-OEt → which is O-CO-OCH2CH3 → so that's C3H5O3.

Wait, but when you combine the two, PhNH2 (C6H7N) + COOEt (C3H5O3) → but wait, the COOEt is connected to the benzene. So the total formula would be:

C6 (from benzene) + 3 (from COOEt) + 1 N (from NH2) → C9, H? Let's compute.

PhNH2 has 5 H (since benzene is C6H5, NH2 adds 2 H, but in the structure PhNH2, the benzene is C6H4NH2, so H would be 5 (from C6H4) + 2 (NH2) → 7 H.

COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3 → which is C3H5O3. So the ester part contributes 5 H.

So total H: 7 (from PhNH2) +5 (from COOEt) =12 H.

But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So option D would have 12 H, but the given formula has 11 H. This suggests that option D is not correct.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps option D is not the right choice. Let me check the other options.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure is Ph-OEt with a formamide group attached. So the formamide is HCONH-Ph-OEt.

Wait, the formamide would be HCONHR, where R is the 4-ethoxyphenyl group.

Let's compute the molecular formula for option B.

Ph-OEt is C6H5OCH2CH3 → C8H9O2.

Formamide group is HCONH-.

Wait, when attached to the phenyl group, the formula would be:

Ph-OEt is C8H9O2.

Adding the formamide group (HCONH) would add C=O, NH, and H. Wait, perhaps I should count atoms.

Alternatively, the structure is OCH2CH3 attached to benzene at position 4, and the formamide is attached at the same benzene, but perhaps position 1.

Wait, molecular formula for N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Ph-OEt is C6H5OCH2CH3 → C8 (6 from Ph, 2 from OEt), H: 5 (Ph) + (OCH2CH3 has 5 H: CH2 has 2, CH3 has 3?), wait no, OCH2CH3 is 2 H on CH2 and 3 H on CH3. So benzene has 5 H (since one is replaced by OEt). So Ph-OEt is C8H9O2.

The formamide group is HCONH-Ph-OEt.

Wait, the structure would be HCONH–Ph-OEt. So the entire molecule would be Ph-OEt–NH–CO–H.

Wait, molecular formula:

Ph-OEt is C8H9O2.

Adding HCONH would add:

HCONH- has 1 C, 2 O (from CO and NH), and 3 H (the H from CO and the two from NH).

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me count all the atoms:

Ph-OEt: C6H5OCH2CH3 → C8H9O2.

Formamide group: HCONH–.

So adding HCONH– to the benzene:

The benzene is connected to OEt and to NH–CO–H.

So the full structure is:

Ph-OEt–NH–CO–H.

Wait, but that would be HCONH–Ph-OEt.

So the formula would be:

C6 (Ph) + 2 (OEt) + 1 (CO) +1 (NH) → C9.

Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count all the atoms:

Ph: C6H5.

OEt: OCH2CH3 → 2 C, 3 O? No, OEt is OCH2CH3, which is 2 C, 1 O.

Formamide group: HCONH– → 1 C, 2 O (from CO and NH?), but wait, the NH is part of the amide. So the amide group is CONH–, which has 1 C, 2 O (from CO and none from NH, which is N).

Wait, perhaps I should write the entire formula.

Ph-OEt: C6H5OCH2CH3 → C8H9O2.

Adding HCONH– (formamide):

HCONH– is H-C(=O)-NH-.

So the formamide adds 1 C, 2 O (from CO), 1 N, and 3 H (the H from CO and NH plus the H attached to the benzene? Not sure.)

Alternatively, perhaps the entire structure is:

Ph-OEt–NH–CO–H.

Wait, that's 6 (Ph) + 2 (OEt) + 1 (CO) + 1 (NH) → 6+2+1+1=10? No, but the given formula is C9.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me compute each atom.

Carbon:

Ph: 6

OEt: 2

Formamide: CO (1 C) and H (but H is not a carbon).

Total C: 6 + 2 +1 =9 → matches.

Hydrogen:

Ph-OEt: C6H5-OCH2CH3 → H count: 5 (Ph) + 2 (from OCH2) +3 (from CH3) =10 H.

Formamide group: NH–CO–H.

Wait, the formamide is attached to the benzene. So the structure is Ph-OEt–NH–CO–H.

So the hydrogen count:

Ph-OEt: 5+2+3=10.

But the formamide is added as NH–CO–H. The NH has 2 H, and the CO–H has 1 H.

Wait, but the CO–H is the formamide's carbonyl with an H. So perhaps the formamide brings 3 H (NH2: but in formamide it's NH-).

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Let me try another approach. The molecular formula for N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be:

Number of carbons:

Ph (6) + OEt (2) + formamide's CO (1) → 6+2+1=9 → correct.

Hydrogen:

Ph-OEt has 5 (Ph) + 2 (OCH2) +3 (CH3) =10 H.

Formamide has NH (2 H) and H from CO (1 H). So adding 3 H.

But wait, the formamide is attached to the benzene, so perhaps some H's are lost due to substitution.

Alternatively, the full formula would be:

C9H11NO2.

Wait, let me compute:

Ph-OEt: C8H9O2.

Formamide group: adding HCONH–.

HCONH– is H–C(=O)–NH–.

So the formula would be:

C8H9O2 + C(=O)NH.

Which is C8+1=9 C.

Hydrogen: 9 H from Ph-OEt (wait, earlier I thought it was 10 H. Maybe I'm wrong.)

Wait, perhaps I should count each atom:

Ph-OEt: C6H5-OCH2CH3.

So, C:6+2=8.

H:5 (Ph) + 2 (OCH2) +3 (CH3) =10.

O: 2 (from OEt) +1 (from Ph-O) →3 O.

Formamide group: HCONH–.

So adding HCONH–:

C: add 1 → total 9.

H: adding 1 (from HCO) + 2 (from NH) →3 H added.

But wait, when you attach the formamide group to the benzene ring, you lose a H where the substitution occurs. So the benzene would have 5 H as before.

Wait, perhaps the total H would be:

Ph-OEt: 10 H.

Adding formamide (which brings 3 H but loses one H from substitution) →10 +3 -1=12 H.

But the given formula has 11 H. Hmm, that's not matching.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the other options.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Structure: benzamide with an ethoxy group in the 3 position.

Benzamide is PhCONH2.

Adding an ethoxy in 3 position: Ph-OCH2CH3 at position 3 and Ph-CONH2 at another position? Wait, no, 3-ethoxybenzamide would have the ethoxy in the 3 position relative to the amide group.

Wait, the structure would be OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring in the meta position relative to the CONH2 group.

So the substituents are in meta positions.

The NMR data shows a para substitution, but if the substituents are in meta, the aromatic protons would show different splitting. But the given NMR has two doublets each integrating to 2H, which suggests para substitution.

So if option A has meta substituents, the aromatic signals would not fit, so option A is probably not correct.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: NH2-Ph-OOC-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, the propionate would be OOC-CH2CH2CH3.

So the substituents are NH2 and OOC-CH2CH2CH3 in para positions.

The molecular formula: C6 (Ph) + 2 (NH2) → no, wait. Let me compute:

Ph is 6 C.

Propionate ester: OOC-CH2CH2CH3 → that's 3 C (OOC- is part of the ester, which is OOC-CH2CH2CH3. So 3 C from the propionate.

So total C: 6 +3 =9 → matches.

Hydrogen: Ph has 5 H (if it's para substituted). Propionate ester has 2 (from OOC-) + 2 (from CH2) + 3 (from CH3) → wait, OOC-CH2CH2CH3 has: OOC- (which is O, not H), then CH2 (2 H), then CH2CH3 (3 H). So total H from propionate: 2+2+3=7 H. Plus the 5 H from benzene: 12 H. But the formula is C9H11NO2.

Hmm, 12 H doesn't match. So option C might not fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's count again.

The structure is PhNH2–OOC–CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no, it's Ph-OOC–CH2CH2CH3 with NH2 in para.

Wait, no, the propionate ester would be Ph-OOC–CH2CH2CH3.

But the amino is in the para position, so the substituents are OOC-CH2CH2CH3 and NH2 in para.

So now, the formula:

Ph (6 C) + OOC-CH2CH2CH3 (3 C) + NH2 → 6+3=9 C.

Hydrogen: Ph has 5 H. OOC-CH2CH2CH3 has 2 (from OOC-CH2-) + 2 (from CH2-) + 3 (CH3) → total 7 H. NH2 has 2 H. But wait, the substituents are OOC-CH2CH2CH3 and NH2 on the benzene, so each substitution removes one H from the benzene. So benzene has 4 H? No, when you have two substituents in para, the benzene has 4 H, each in ortho and para positions.

Wait, benzene has 6 H. Two substituents in para positions would replace two H, leaving 4 H. So 4 H.

So the H count:

Ph:4

OOC-CH2CH2CH3: 2 (CH2) + 2 (CH2) +3 (CH3) →7.

NH2:2.

Total H:4+7+2=13. But given formula is 11. So that can't be right. Hmm.

So perhaps option C is not correct either.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the NMR again.

The NMR has a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) which is a CH2CH3 group. So that must be present in the structure. So the substituent must have an ethyl group. So options with ethyl groups are A (ethoxy), B (ethoxy), D (ethyl ester), and C (propyl group, which is longer).

So options A, B, D have ethyl groups, C has a propyl. So C's triplet would be at 1.6 or something else, but in the NMR, it's 1.20, which is typical for ethyl. So C is probably out.

So option D's ethyl is in the ester group, and the substituents are para. But earlier, the formula didn't match. Let me recheck the formula for option D.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: PhNH2–COOEt.

So:

PhNH2: C6H5NH2 → 6 C, 6 H (5 from benzene, 1 from NH2?), no, wait. Benzene with NH2 in para position.

Wait, the structure is OEtOC6H4NH2.

So the carbons:

Ph:6

OEt:2

COO: O, so no C.

Wait, COOEt is O-CO-OEt, which contributes 3 C (COO has 2 C from the carbonyl and the ester O, and the Et is 2 C). Wait, no. COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3, so the COO is one C, and OCH2CH3 is two C. So 1 (COO) + 2 (OEt) =3 C.

So total C:6 (Ph) +3 (COOEt) =9 → correct.

Hydrogen:

PhNH2: the benzene has 4 H (since two substituents: NH2 and COOEt in para). So 4 H.

COOEt: OCH2CH3 → 2 H (OCH2) +3 H (CH3) =5 H.

NH2: 2 H.

So total H:4 +5 +2 =11 → matches the formula.

Wait, that's correct! So the formula is C9H11NO2.

Earlier, I must have made a mistake in counting.

So for option D, the formula is correct.

Now, let's check the NMR.

The aromatic protons are in two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, which we've discussed fit a para-substituted benzene with EDG and EWG substituents.

The ethoxy group would have the CH3 triplet at 1.2 ppm, and the OCH2 as a quartet at 4.5 ppm.

But what about the 4.0 ppm peak (bs, 2H)?

Wait, perhaps it's the NH2 group. But in the NMR, the NH2 would appear as a broad peak, but where?

In an aromatic amine, the NH2 protons are usually around 5-6 ppm as broad singlets, but sometimes they can be more upfield. Alternatively, in some cases, they might not appear because they are broad and perhaps in the baseline.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. If the NH2 is on the benzene, perhaps it's not visible in the aromatic region because of exchange broadening.

Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is not present, but that's not the case in option D.

Wait, maybe the 4.0 ppm is not the NH2. Let me think about the structure again.

Option D's structure is OEtOC6H4NH2.

So, the substituents are COOEt and NH2 in para positions.

In the NMR, the ethoxy's OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.5 ppm, which matches the data.

The triplet at 1.2 is the ethoxy's CH3, which matches.

The aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0, which supports the substituents being in para.

But what about the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)?

Hmm. Could that be an -OCH2- group from another substituent? No, because in option D, the substituents are COOEt and NH2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the quartet at 4.5 ppm is not the OCH2 of the ethoxy, but something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent group.

Wait, in the ester group, the OCH2 is next to COO, so it's a quartet.

But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit upfield for an ethoxy's OCH2. Normally, ethoxy's OCH2 is around 4.1-4.3. So 4.5 is a bit high. Could that be an error or perhaps due to some other effect?

Alternatively, maybe it's a different group.

Wait, perhaps the quartet is from the NH2 group. But NH2 is on the benzene ring, so it's not adjacent to a CH2 group. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but considering the molecular formula fits, and the NMR seems to fit except for the 4.0 ppm peak, maybe I should proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an -OCH2- group from another substituent, but I don't see where that would come from in option D.

Wait, another approach: in option B, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the structure would have an ethoxy group and a formamide group (HCONH-). Let's see the NMR.

The ethoxy group would have triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5, which matches the data.

The formamide group would have an NH, which might show up as a broad peak. But in the NMR, the 4.0 is a broad singlet for 2H, which would fit an NH2 group. However, formamide has an NH, not NH2. So perhaps that's not right.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 is a broad singlet for 2H. If it's an NH2 group, that would fit option D. But in option D, the NH2 is on the benzene ring, which makes me think the NH2 would appear as a broad peak, perhaps around 5 ppm, but it's not in the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not from NH2 but from another group.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 is from a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen. For example, an OCH2 group. But in option D, the ethoxy's OCH2 is at 4.5, so 4.0 would be another OCH2.

But where would that come from? Maybe in option B, which has an ethoxy and a formamide group. The formamide group's structure is HCONH-Ph-OEt. So the formamide would have an NH, but perhaps another OCH2 group? No, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 is from the NH in the formamide. But NH protons are usually around 5-8 ppm as broad signals, but I'm not certain.

Hmm. Another angle: the IR has a strong band at 1720 cm−1, which is likely a carbonyl. In option D, the carbonyl is from the ester group (COOEt), which would have a strong band around 1720 cm−1. So that fits.

In option B, the carbonyl is from the formamide (HCONH-), which typically has a carbonyl around 1680-1700 cm−1, which is close, but the IR is at 1720, which could still fit.

But in option D, the ester's carbonyl is at higher wavenumber than in amides, which makes sense because esters have higher carbonyl frequencies than amides due to less resonance stabilization.

Wait, but in the IR, the medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 and 3325 cm−1 suggest N-H stretching. In option D, the NH2 would show a strong broad peak in IR around 3300-3500 cm−1, which matches. In option B, the NH is part of the formamide, which is usually less intense than NH2.

So, considering all this, option D seems to fit better with the IR and NMR data, except for the 4.0 ppm peak. But perhaps that's an artifact or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: in the NMR of option D, the ethoxy's OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But the data shows a quartet at 4.5. That's a bit off. Could that be an error in the question, or maybe the OCH2 is coupled with another group, shifting it upfield?

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is not the ethoxy's OCH2, but another group. But I can't think of another group in option D that would give a quartet at 4.5.

Wait, what about the NH2 group? If the NH2 is adjacent to another group, but in the structure, it's on the benzene ring, so it's not attached to any CH2 groups.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the quartet is part of the ester group, but I can't see how.

Another possibility is that the 4.0 ppm is an impurity or some other solvent peak, but that's unlikely.

Given all this, I think the best fit is option D, despite the slight discrepancy in the NMR quartet position. The formula matches, the substituents are para, the IR fits, and the ethoxy is present. The 4.0 peak might be an NH2 group, but I'm not entirely sure.

To identify the compound **C₉H₁₁NO₂** using the given spectroscopic data:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **Molecular Formula and Degrees of Unsaturation**:
   - Formula: **C₉H₁₁NO₂**
   - Degrees of unsaturation = 3 (indicating one benzene ring and one carbonyl group).

2. **IR Data**:
   - **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: Broad peaks suggest the presence of an NH group, likely from an amine or amide.
   - **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with an ester or amide.

3. **¹H NMR Data**:
   - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: Triplet indicates a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH₂, likely part of an ethyl group.
   - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: Broad singlet for 2H, possibly from an NH₂ group or another exchangeable proton environment.
   - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: Quartet suggests a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂, likely part of an ethoxy group.
   - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.

### Evaluation of Options:
#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide (C₆H₅CONH₂ with an ethoxy group at position 3)**:
   - The substituents would be meta to each other, leading to aromatic protons that do not match the observed NMR data (two doublets for para substitution).
   - **Eliminated**.

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide (C₆H₄OCH₂CH₃ with a formamide group at position 4)**:
   - The ethoxy group would produce the triplet at 1.2 ppm (CH₃) and quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH₂), which matches.
   - The formamide group would have an NH, but the NMR shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H, which is inconsistent with a single NH group.
   - **Eliminated**.

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate (C₆H₄NH₂ with a propionate ester at position 4)**:
   - The propionate group would produce a triplet at 1.6 ppm (CH₃) and multiplets for the CH₂ groups, which do not match the observed triplet at 1.2 ppm (indicative of an ethyl group).
   - The molecular formula does not match either, as the propionate group would introduce additional carbons.
   - **Eliminated**.

#### **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (C₆H₄NH₂ with a benzoate ester at position 4)**:
   - The ethoxy group in the ester would produce the triplet at 1.2 ppm (CH₃) and quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH₂), which matches.
   - The para-substituted benzene ring would produce two doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm, consistent with the NMR data.
   - The NH₂ group on the benzene ring could explain the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), though NH₂ protons are typically more downfield. This discrepancy might arise from exchange broadening.
   - The molecular formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂** matches perfectly.
   - **Best fit**.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I need to figure out which compound is C9H11NO2 given the spectroscopic data. Let's see... I remember that the molecular formula can help determine the structure. Let me write down the formula: C9H11NO2. The degrees of unsaturation would be... well, the formula is CnHmOxNy. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m -x -y)/2. So here, n=9, m=11, x=2 (two O), y=1 (one N). Plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2=6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That could mean three rings, but more likely a combination like one ring and two double bonds, or maybe a benzene ring plus a double bond or an amide group.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those broad peaks are probably from -NH stretches. Wait, but amides usually have a broad peak around 3300, right? But sometimes if it's a primary amine or something else, maybe. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be an ester, amide, ketone, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the molecular formula has two oxygen, and the presence of N and O in the formula suggests maybe an ester and an amide, or an amide and something else.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's probably a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ethyl group. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2, so maybe OCH2CH3, like an ethoxy group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Hmm. Broad suggests maybe something exchanging, like an amine, but the integration is 2. Or maybe it's an ethylene group next to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group. Wait, but the ethoxy is probably at 1.20 and 4.0. Wait, no, ethoxy is OCH2CH3, where the CH3 is triplet at 1.2, and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.3. Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 is a broad singlet. Maybe it's not OCH2 but something else.

Wait, the next peak is at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). Quartet, 2H. A quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Maybe a CH2 next to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group, but perhaps as part of an ester. Wait, in an ester like OCH2CH2COO..., no, wait. Let's think about esters: the ester group is O-CO-O. The ethyl ester would have the ethyl group attached to the oxygen. So the ethyl would split into a quartet for the OCH2 and a triplet for the CH2CH3. But in the NMR, we have a triplet at 1.2 (3H), which would fit the CH2CH3 part. So the quartet at 4.5 ppm would be the OCH2 group.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, at 4.0 ppm, we have a broad singlet for 2H. That's confusing. Maybe it's not an ethoxy group but something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an NH group, but 2H? Or maybe it's an -OCH2- attached to something else.

Looking further, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the doublets with two protons each would be on either side. So if the substituents are in the para positions, that would explain the two doublets each integrating to 2H.

Putting this together: a benzene ring with substituents in para positions. Let's say one substituent is an ethoxy group (since we've got the 1.20 triplet and maybe the 4.0 quartet?), but wait, the OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet around 4.0-4.3, but in the NMR, the 4.0 is a broad singlet. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group that includes an oxygen and a carbonyl.

Wait, the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. That could be an ester, amide, or ketone. Since the molecule has an amide or ester group, perhaps. Let's think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group in the 3 position. The benzamide would have a CONH2 group. But wait, benzamide is C6H5CONH2. If it's 3-ethoxy, then the substituents are at 3 and maybe another position? Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet for 2H at 4.0, which might not fit.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxy phenyl group. So the benzene has an ethoxy in para and a formamide group in another position. Wait, but formamide would have a structure like R-NH-CO-R, but in this case, maybe HCO-NH-Ph-OEt. Not entirely sure. The 1H NMR would have the ethoxy group, the formamide NH, which might show up broad.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be the structure where the benzene has an NH2 group and a propionate (CH2CH2COO-) group. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be something like PhNH2 and PhOOCCH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So it would be PhNH2 and the propionate ester? Or maybe the amino is attached to the benzene and the propionate is another substituent. The molecular formula for this would be C9H11NO2 if the substituents are in correct positions.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is the benzoate ester, where the benzoate has an amino group in the para position. So the structure would be OEt-CO-PhNH2. Wait, the benzoate would be O-CO-OEt. If the amino is para to the ester, then the structure is PhNH2-CO-OEt. But wait, 4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester would be PhNH2 with a COOEt group in the para position.

Let me think about the NMR for each option. The aromatic signals in the NMR are two doublets, 2H each, at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. That suggests a para-substituted benzene. Let's say the substituents are in the para positions, so the ring is symmetric. The substituents could be an amino group and an ester group, or an ethoxy and an amide, etc.

Looking at option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure would be a benzene ring with an amino group (NH2) and a COOEt group in para positions. The amino group would be in position 4, so the substituents are in positions 1 and 4 (assuming the COOEt is at position 1 and NH2 at 4, or vice versa). Wait, the NH2 group would be a strong deshield, so the protons adjacent would be downfield. Wait, no, the aromatic protons would be in the ortho and para positions relative to the substituents.

Wait, in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the substituents are in the para positions. So the benzene ring has COOEt at position 1 and NH2 at position 4. Wait, no, if it's 4-aminobenzoate, then the amino is at position 4 and the ester is at position 1 (the benzoate is O-CO-OEt attached to the benzene in position 1, and NH2 in position 4. But then the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. The substituents are at 1 and 4, so the ortho positions would be 2 and 6 relative to the ester, and 3 and 5 relative to the amino.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the NMR. The aromatic signals are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps the substituents are para to each other, and the aromatic protons are in a pair of doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each pair of ortho protons would be equivalent. Wait, no, if substituents are in para, the two ortho positions on either substituent would be equivalent. Wait, no. Let's imagine a benzene with substituents in positions 1 and 4. Then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to substituent 1, and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to substituent 4. If substituents are de-shielding, then the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be more downfield than 3 and 5? Or the opposite? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an electron-withdrawing group (like the ester) and an electron-donating group (like amino). The amino group is NH2, which is electron-donating, so the ring is activated. The ester is O-CO-OEt, which is an electron-withdrawing group.

For the NMR of a para-disubstituted benzene, with substituents X and Y in the 1 and 4 positions, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. The protons ortho to X would be in one environment, and the protons ortho to Y would be in another. So, for example, if X is the ester group (COOEt) and Y is NH2, then the ortho protons to X (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear downfield, while the ortho protons to Y (positions 3 and 5) would be shielded and appear upfield.

Wait, the amino group is strong EDG, which would deshield the ortho protons (make them more downfield), while the ester is EWG, which would also deshield the ortho protons. Hmm, maybe both substituents deshield the adjacent protons, but since they are para, the two sets of ortho protons would be equivalent in each pair. So in the NMR, you would have two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The downfield shift would be due to the substituents' effects.

In the given NMR, the aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. So, the 8.0 ppm is more downfield. So perhaps the substituent causing more deshielding is the one with the amino group. Wait, amino is EDG, which usually causes ortho protons to be upfield, but wait, amino is a strong activating group, so the ortho and para protons are more shielded (upfield). Wait, no. Let me think. EDGs activate the ring, making it easier for electrophilic substitution. But when it comes to NMR shifts, EDGs like -NH2 are ortho/para directors. They donate electrons, which can make the ring more electron-rich. Ortho protons to -NH2 are usually upfield, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait another approach: The substituent with the higher electronegativity (like the ester group) would deshield the adjacent protons more, causing them to appear downfield. So if the substituent is an ester, which is EWG, then the adjacent protons (ortho) would be more downfield. So in the NMR, the protons adjacent to the ester would be at higher ppm, like 8.0, and those adjacent to the amino would be at lower ppm, like 7.0.

So if the ester is in position 1 and the amino in position 4, the protons ortho to the ester (positions 2 and 6) would be around 8.0 ppm, and the protons ortho to the amino (positions 3 and 5) would be around 7.0 ppm. That fits with the NMR data.

Now, looking at the other parts of the NMR. The 4.5 ppm quartet for 2H suggests a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Like in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have a quartet at around 4.1-4.3. But in the given data, it's at 4.5. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl adjacent group.

Wait, in the ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1, but if it's part of a carbonyl group, like COOCH2CH3, then the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1 ppm. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5. So maybe it's not an ethyl ester. Alternatively, could it be a propyl group, but that doesn't fit the triplet at 1.2 ppm. Wait, the triplet is at 1.2, 3H, which is likely a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, let me think about the structure again. The NMR has a triplet at 1.2 ppm (3H), which is typical for a CH2CH3 group. So that would correspond to OCH2CH3, which is an ethoxy group. So I think the compound has an ethoxy group somewhere.

Looking back at the IR: the 1720 cm^-1 peak is a strong carbonyl. So that suggests an ester or amide. If it's an ester, then the structure would have a COOEt group. If it's an amide, then a CONHR group.

Looking at option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is OEt-CO-PhNH2. So, the ester group is COOEt, and the amino is in the para position. So the aromatic protons would be in two doublets as discussed.

In the NMR, the ethoxy's CH2 would be a quartet around 4.1 ppm, but in the data, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm. Wait, the NMR data has 4.5 as a quartet (2H), and 4.0 as a broad singlet (2H). Maybe the 4.0 ppm is the OCH2 group. But ethoxy's OCH2 is usually around 4.1-4.3. So why is it at 4.0? Or perhaps it's a different group.

Wait, another possibility: the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is an NH2 group. But NH2 protons are usually broad, but they would be in a singlet if they are exchanging. But the integration is 2H, which doesn't fit because NH2 has two protons. But the problem is that NH2 protons can sometimes exchange and give a broad peak. But in the NMR, the 4.0 is a broad singlet for 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2- group where the protons are split due to coupling. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count the carbons. Benzene is 6 carbons. The substituents are likely two groups, each contributing the remaining 3 carbons. Alternatively, one group is the ethoxy (OCH2CH3, 2 carbons) and the other is a carbonyl group with perhaps an ethyl ester (like COOCH2CH3, which is another 2 carbons, but that's only 4 in total). Hmm, maybe the substituents are ethoxy and another group. Let me think.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: benzene (6 C) plus substituents. Let's see the substituents: perhaps an ethoxy (2 C) and a group that contributes 1 C, but that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe the substituents include a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. Let's count the substituents.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is OEt-CO-PhNH2. So, the substituents are COOEt (which is 3 carbons: COOCH2CH3) and NH2 (no carbons). Wait, the COOEt group is:

COOEt is O=C-O-CH2CH3. So the carbonyl is from the benzoate, which is part of the benzene ring. The substituents are OEt (2 carbons) and NH2 (no carbons). Wait, no, the substituent is the COOEt group. Wait, the benzoate is attached as COOEt. So the substituent is para to the amino group. So, the COOEt is one substituent, and NH2 is another. So the substituents have 2 carbons (from OEt) and the COO group is part of the ring.

Wait, perhaps I need to count the carbons for each option.

Option D: the structure is PhNH2-COOEt.

Ph is 6 C, COOEt is 3 C (COO plus Et). Wait, COOEt is O-CO-OEt, where OEt is CH2CH3. So COOEt has 3 carbons. So Ph (6) + COOEt (3) + NH2 (no C). But that's 9 C. Oh wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So that matches. So option D has 9 C.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is PhOEt attached to a formamide group (HCONH-). So the substituents are OEt (2 C) and HCONHR (but R is the phenyl). Wait, formamide is HCONHPh. So the substituents are OEt and HCONHPh. Wait, no, perhaps the formamide is attached to the 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the structure would be Ph(OEt)-NH-CO-H. So that's Ph-OEt and Ph-NH-CO-H.

Wait, the molecular formula for formamide would be C8H9NO2: the benzene (6 C), OEt (2 C), and formamide (CO and NH). Wait, no, let me count: 4-ethoxyphenyl group is C6H4-OCH2CH3 (so 6+2=8 C?), but then the formamide adds HCONH-.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the NMR again.

The NMR has 1.20 ppm (t, 3H). That's the ethoxy CH2CH3 group. So the OCH2CH3 is present. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) is probably the OCH2 group. Wait, but in the ethoxy group, the OCH2 is adjacent to the CH3, which is a triplet, and the OCH2 would be a quartet. So that fits. So the triplet (1.20, 3H) is the CH3, quartet (4.5, 2H) is the OCH2.

But then, what about the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)? That's a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm. Maybe that's the NH2 group. But in option D, the NH2 is on the benzene ring. The NH2 protons would typically be broad, but in the NMR, the 4.0 would be the NH2? But wait, aromatic NH2 protons are usually more downfield. Also, NH2 protons can exchange and appear broad, but in the case of a primary amine (like NH2), the protons might be more upfield. Alternatively, maybe the NH is part of another group, like an amide.

Wait, looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-Ph-OEt. So the formamide group is attached to the benzene ring, which also has an ethoxy group in the para position. The NH would be part of the formamide. So the formamide would have a NH group, which might show up as a broad peak. But the integration is 2H, which would suggest two NH protons. But formamide would have one NH group (with two protons). Hmm, the integration is 2H, which fits with one NH group (if it's a singlet, but the broadness suggests exchange). Wait, but the NMR shows 2H as a broad singlet, which fits an NH2 group, perhaps. But formamide has an NH group, not NH2. So maybe that's not it.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is NH2-Ph-OOC-CH2CH2CH3 (if it's a propionate ester). Wait, propionate would be CH2CH2COO-, so the structure would be PhNH2 and OOC-CH2CH2CH3 attached as an ester. So the substituents are NH2 and OOC-CH2CH2CH3 in para positions. Then, the NMR would have the ethoxy group? No, because propionate is CH2CH2CH3. Wait, the triplet at 1.2 ppm is CH2CH3, which would be from a propyl group. Wait, the triplet at 1.2 is 3H, which would be the CH2CH3 of an ethyl group, not a propyl. So that might not fit. Unless it's a different group.

Wait, maybe the ethyl group is part of an ester. Let's see. In option D, the substituent is COOEt. So the ethyl group would be in the ester. So the 1.20 triplet is the CH2CH3, and the quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2.

But in the NMR, there's also a peak at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). What could that be? Maybe it's the NH2 protons. But in option D, the NH2 is on the benzene ring. So the NH2 protons would be in the aromatic region, but they are usually not observed because they are exchange broadened and appear as a singlet. Alternatively, they might not appear in the NMR because they're broad and possibly in the baseline.

Wait, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be an -OCH2- group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's an -NHCH2- group, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the molecular formula. For option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The formula would be C8H7NO3 (benzoic acid ethyl ester with NH2 group). Wait, no. Let me calculate: benzene (C6H5), then COOEt (C3H5O2), and NH2 (C0H2N). So the total is C6 +3 = C9; H: 5 (Ph) +5 (COOEt) + 2 (NH2) = 12 H. But the formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm, so 9 C, 11 H, 1 N, 2 O.

Wait, let me calculate the formula for option D. Structure is OEt-CO-NH2Ph. Wait, no, it's PhNH2-COOEt. So:

Ph is C6H5.

COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which adds 3 O's but in the formula, it's O2. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, the molecular formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO3. Because:

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When you make the ethyl ester, you replace the -OH with OEt, so you add 2 C and 5 H (since OEt is C2H5O). Wait, let me compute:

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Ester would be C7H5O2 + C2H5O (from OEt) → C9H10O3. Wait, but with an NH2 group in para position, which adds another H2. So the formula becomes C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that might rule out option D.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because the given formula has two oxygen atoms, but option D would have three.

Wait, let me think again. What is the molecular formula of option D?

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: the structure is OEtOC6H4NH2.

Wait, the benzoate ester is OEtOC6H4NH2.

Breaking it down: the benzene ring is C6H5. The COOEt group is OEtOCO- (so that's 3 O: COO has two O, Et has O). Wait, no, the ester group is O-CO-OEt. So the formula would be: C6H5COOEt plus NH2. Wait, no, it's C6H4(COOEt)(NH2).

Wait, perhaps I should count each atom:

Phenyl group: C6H5

COOEt: 2 O from COO, and O from Et (so total 3 O?), but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the molecular formula step by step.

The formula is C9H11NO2.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Benzoate is C7H5O2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, and the ester would have one less H because the acid loses H when esterified. Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When you esterify it with ethanol, you replace -OH with -OEt. So the ester would be C7H5O2 + C2H5O → but wait, perhaps I'm complicating.

Alternatively, count atoms:

COOEt: COO has 2 O, Et is O. So COOEt is O3?

Wait, the formula for the ester group is O-CO-OEt. So in that group, the O count is 3 (two from COO, one from OEt). So the entire molecule would have:

Ph (C6H5) + COOEt (C3H5O3) + NH2.

Wait, no, COOEt is O-CO-OEt, which is O-CO-OCH2CH3.

So each COOEt contributes 3 O.

But the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. So the compound can't have three O's.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confused. Let me compute the formula for option D:

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The structure is OEt-CO-PhNH2.

So, PhNH2 is C6H5NH2 → which is C6H7N.

COOEt is O-CO-OEt → which is O-CO-OCH2CH3 → so that's C3H5O3.

Wait, but when you combine the two, PhNH2 (C6H7N) + COOEt (C3H5O3) → but wait, the COOEt is connected to the benzene. So the total formula would be:

C6 (from benzene) + 3 (from COOEt) + 1 N (from NH2) → C9, H? Let's compute.

PhNH2 has 5 H (since benzene is C6H5, NH2 adds 2 H, but in the structure PhNH2, the benzene is C6H4NH2, so H would be 5 (from C6H4) + 2 (NH2) → 7 H.

COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3 → which is C3H5O3. So the ester part contributes 5 H.

So total H: 7 (from PhNH2) +5 (from COOEt) =12 H.

But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So option D would have 12 H, but the given formula has 11 H. This suggests that option D is not correct.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps option D is not the right choice. Let me check the other options.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure is Ph-OEt with a formamide group attached. So the formamide is HCONH-Ph-OEt.

Wait, the formamide would be HCONHR, where R is the 4-ethoxyphenyl group.

Let's compute the molecular formula for option B.

Ph-OEt is C6H5OCH2CH3 → C8H9O2.

Formamide group is HCONH-.

Wait, when attached to the phenyl group, the formula would be:

Ph-OEt is C8H9O2.

Adding the formamide group (HCONH) would add C=O, NH, and H. Wait, perhaps I should count atoms.

Alternatively, the structure is OCH2CH3 attached to benzene at position 4, and the formamide is attached at the same benzene, but perhaps position 1.

Wait, molecular formula for N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Ph-OEt is C6H5OCH2CH3 → C8 (6 from Ph, 2 from OEt), H: 5 (Ph) + (OCH2CH3 has 5 H: CH2 has 2, CH3 has 3?), wait no, OCH2CH3 is 2 H on CH2 and 3 H on CH3. So benzene has 5 H (since one is replaced by OEt). So Ph-OEt is C8H9O2.

The formamide group is HCONH-Ph-OEt.

Wait, the structure would be HCONH–Ph-OEt. So the entire molecule would be Ph-OEt–NH–CO–H.

Wait, molecular formula:

Ph-OEt is C8H9O2.

Adding HCONH would add:

HCONH- has 1 C, 2 O (from CO and NH), and 3 H (the H from CO and the two from NH).

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me count all the atoms:

Ph-OEt: C6H5OCH2CH3 → C8H9O2.

Formamide group: HCONH–.

So adding HCONH– to the benzene:

The benzene is connected to OEt and to NH–CO–H.

So the full structure is:

Ph-OEt–NH–CO–H.

Wait, but that would be HCONH–Ph-OEt.

So the formula would be:

C6 (Ph) + 2 (OEt) + 1 (CO) +1 (NH) → C9.

Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count all the atoms:

Ph: C6H5.

OEt: OCH2CH3 → 2 C, 3 O? No, OEt is OCH2CH3, which is 2 C, 1 O.

Formamide group: HCONH– → 1 C, 2 O (from CO and NH?), but wait, the NH is part of the amide. So the amide group is CONH–, which has 1 C, 2 O (from CO and none from NH, which is N).

Wait, perhaps I should write the entire formula.

Ph-OEt: C6H5OCH2CH3 → C8H9O2.

Adding HCONH– (formamide):

HCONH– is H-C(=O)-NH-.

So the formamide adds 1 C, 2 O (from CO), 1 N, and 3 H (the H from CO and NH plus the H attached to the benzene? Not sure.)

Alternatively, perhaps the entire structure is:

Ph-OEt–NH–CO–H.

Wait, that's 6 (Ph) + 2 (OEt) + 1 (CO) + 1 (NH) → 6+2+1+1=10? No, but the given formula is C9.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me compute each atom.

Carbon:

Ph: 6

OEt: 2

Formamide: CO (1 C) and H (but H is not a carbon).

Total C: 6 + 2 +1 =9 → matches.

Hydrogen:

Ph-OEt: C6H5-OCH2CH3 → H count: 5 (Ph) + 2 (from OCH2) +3 (from CH3) =10 H.

Formamide group: NH–CO–H.

Wait, the formamide is attached to the benzene. So the structure is Ph-OEt–NH–CO–H.

So the hydrogen count:

Ph-OEt: 5+2+3=10.

But the formamide is added as NH–CO–H. The NH has 2 H, and the CO–H has 1 H.

Wait, but the CO–H is the formamide's carbonyl with an H. So perhaps the formamide brings 3 H (NH2: but in formamide it's NH-).

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Let me try another approach. The molecular formula for N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be:

Number of carbons:

Ph (6) + OEt (2) + formamide's CO (1) → 6+2+1=9 → correct.

Hydrogen:

Ph-OEt has 5 (Ph) + 2 (OCH2) +3 (CH3) =10 H.

Formamide has NH (2 H) and H from CO (1 H). So adding 3 H.

But wait, the formamide is attached to the benzene, so perhaps some H's are lost due to substitution.

Alternatively, the full formula would be:

C9H11NO2.

Wait, let me compute:

Ph-OEt: C8H9O2.

Formamide group: adding HCONH–.

HCONH– is H–C(=O)–NH–.

So the formula would be:

C8H9O2 + C(=O)NH.

Which is C8+1=9 C.

Hydrogen: 9 H from Ph-OEt (wait, earlier I thought it was 10 H. Maybe I'm wrong.)

Wait, perhaps I should count each atom:

Ph-OEt: C6H5-OCH2CH3.

So, C:6+2=8.

H:5 (Ph) + 2 (OCH2) +3 (CH3) =10.

O: 2 (from OEt) +1 (from Ph-O) →3 O.

Formamide group: HCONH–.

So adding HCONH–:

C: add 1 → total 9.

H: adding 1 (from HCO) + 2 (from NH) →3 H added.

But wait, when you attach the formamide group to the benzene ring, you lose a H where the substitution occurs. So the benzene would have 5 H as before.

Wait, perhaps the total H would be:

Ph-OEt: 10 H.

Adding formamide (which brings 3 H but loses one H from substitution) →10 +3 -1=12 H.

But the given formula has 11 H. Hmm, that's not matching.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the other options.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Structure: benzamide with an ethoxy group in the 3 position.

Benzamide is PhCONH2.

Adding an ethoxy in 3 position: Ph-OCH2CH3 at position 3 and Ph-CONH2 at another position? Wait, no, 3-ethoxybenzamide would have the ethoxy in the 3 position relative to the amide group.

Wait, the structure would be OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring in the meta position relative to the CONH2 group.

So the substituents are in meta positions.

The NMR data shows a para substitution, but if the substituents are in meta, the aromatic protons would show different splitting. But the given NMR has two doublets each integrating to 2H, which suggests para substitution.

So if option A has meta substituents, the aromatic signals would not fit, so option A is probably not correct.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: NH2-Ph-OOC-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, the propionate would be OOC-CH2CH2CH3.

So the substituents are NH2 and OOC-CH2CH2CH3 in para positions.

The molecular formula: C6 (Ph) + 2 (NH2) → no, wait. Let me compute:

Ph is 6 C.

Propionate ester: OOC-CH2CH2CH3 → that's 3 C (OOC- is part of the ester, which is OOC-CH2CH2CH3. So 3 C from the propionate.

So total C: 6 +3 =9 → matches.

Hydrogen: Ph has 5 H (if it's para substituted). Propionate ester has 2 (from OOC-) + 2 (from CH2) + 3 (from CH3) → wait, OOC-CH2CH2CH3 has: OOC- (which is O, not H), then CH2 (2 H), then CH2CH3 (3 H). So total H from propionate: 2+2+3=7 H. Plus the 5 H from benzene: 12 H. But the formula is C9H11NO2.

Hmm, 12 H doesn't match. So option C might not fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's count again.

The structure is PhNH2–OOC–CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no, it's Ph-OOC–CH2CH2CH3 with NH2 in para.

Wait, no, the propionate ester would be Ph-OOC–CH2CH2CH3.

But the amino is in the para position, so the substituents are OOC-CH2CH2CH3 and NH2 in para.

So now, the formula:

Ph (6 C) + OOC-CH2CH2CH3 (3 C) + NH2 → 6+3=9 C.

Hydrogen: Ph has 5 H. OOC-CH2CH2CH3 has 2 (from OOC-CH2-) + 2 (from CH2-) + 3 (CH3) → total 7 H. NH2 has 2 H. But wait, the substituents are OOC-CH2CH2CH3 and NH2 on the benzene, so each substitution removes one H from the benzene. So benzene has 4 H? No, when you have two substituents in para, the benzene has 4 H, each in ortho and para positions.

Wait, benzene has 6 H. Two substituents in para positions would replace two H, leaving 4 H. So 4 H.

So the H count:

Ph:4

OOC-CH2CH2CH3: 2 (CH2) + 2 (CH2) +3 (CH3) →7.

NH2:2.

Total H:4+7+2=13. But given formula is 11. So that can't be right. Hmm.

So perhaps option C is not correct either.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the NMR again.

The NMR has a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) which is a CH2CH3 group. So that must be present in the structure. So the substituent must have an ethyl group. So options with ethyl groups are A (ethoxy), B (ethoxy), D (ethyl ester), and C (propyl group, which is longer).

So options A, B, D have ethyl groups, C has a propyl. So C's triplet would be at 1.6 or something else, but in the NMR, it's 1.20, which is typical for ethyl. So C is probably out.

So option D's ethyl is in the ester group, and the substituents are para. But earlier, the formula didn't match. Let me recheck the formula for option D.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: PhNH2–COOEt.

So:

PhNH2: C6H5NH2 → 6 C, 6 H (5 from benzene, 1 from NH2?), no, wait. Benzene with NH2 in para position.

Wait, the structure is OEtOC6H4NH2.

So the carbons:

Ph:6

OEt:2

COO: O, so no C.

Wait, COOEt is O-CO-OEt, which contributes 3 C (COO has 2 C from the carbonyl and the ester O, and the Et is 2 C). Wait, no. COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3, so the COO is one C, and OCH2CH3 is two C. So 1 (COO) + 2 (OEt) =3 C.

So total C:6 (Ph) +3 (COOEt) =9 → correct.

Hydrogen:

PhNH2: the benzene has 4 H (since two substituents: NH2 and COOEt in para). So 4 H.

COOEt: OCH2CH3 → 2 H (OCH2) +3 H (CH3) =5 H.

NH2: 2 H.

So total H:4 +5 +2 =11 → matches the formula.

Wait, that's correct! So the formula is C9H11NO2.

Earlier, I must have made a mistake in counting.

So for option D, the formula is correct.

Now, let's check the NMR.

The aromatic protons are in two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, which we've discussed fit a para-substituted benzene with EDG and EWG substituents.

The ethoxy group would have the CH3 triplet at 1.2 ppm, and the OCH2 as a quartet at 4.5 ppm.

But what about the 4.0 ppm peak (bs, 2H)?

Wait, perhaps it's the NH2 group. But in the NMR, the NH2 would appear as a broad peak, but where?

In an aromatic amine, the NH2 protons are usually around 5-6 ppm as broad singlets, but sometimes they can be more upfield. Alternatively, in some cases, they might not appear because they are broad and perhaps in the baseline.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. If the NH2 is on the benzene, perhaps it's not visible in the aromatic region because of exchange broadening.

Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is not present, but that's not the case in option D.

Wait, maybe the 4.0 ppm is not the NH2. Let me think about the structure again.

Option D's structure is OEtOC6H4NH2.

So, the substituents are COOEt and NH2 in para positions.

In the NMR, the ethoxy's OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.5 ppm, which matches the data.

The triplet at 1.2 is the ethoxy's CH3, which matches.

The aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0, which supports the substituents being in para.

But what about the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)?

Hmm. Could that be an -OCH2- group from another substituent? No, because in option D, the substituents are COOEt and NH2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the quartet at 4.5 ppm is not the OCH2 of the ethoxy, but something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent group.

Wait, in the ester group, the OCH2 is next to COO, so it's a quartet.

But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit upfield for an ethoxy's OCH2. Normally, ethoxy's OCH2 is around 4.1-4.3. So 4.5 is a bit high. Could that be an error or perhaps due to some other effect?

Alternatively, maybe it's a different group.

Wait, perhaps the quartet is from the NH2 group. But NH2 is on the benzene ring, so it's not adjacent to a CH2 group. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but considering the molecular formula fits, and the NMR seems to fit except for the 4.0 ppm peak, maybe I should proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an -OCH2- group from another substituent, but I don't see where that would come from in option D.

Wait, another approach: in option B, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the structure would have an ethoxy group and a formamide group (HCONH-). Let's see the NMR.

The ethoxy group would have triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5, which matches the data.

The formamide group would have an NH, which might show up as a broad peak. But in the NMR, the 4.0 is a broad singlet for 2H, which would fit an NH2 group. However, formamide has an NH, not NH2. So perhaps that's not right.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 is a broad singlet for 2H. If it's an NH2 group, that would fit option D. But in option D, the NH2 is on the benzene ring, which makes me think the NH2 would appear as a broad peak, perhaps around 5 ppm, but it's not in the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not from NH2 but from another group.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 is from a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen. For example, an OCH2 group. But in option D, the ethoxy's OCH2 is at 4.5, so 4.0 would be another OCH2.

But where would that come from? Maybe in option B, which has an ethoxy and a formamide group. The formamide group's structure is HCONH-Ph-OEt. So the formamide would have an NH, but perhaps another OCH2 group? No, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 is from the NH in the formamide. But NH protons are usually around 5-8 ppm as broad signals, but I'm not certain.

Hmm. Another angle: the IR has a strong band at 1720 cm−1, which is likely a carbonyl. In option D, the carbonyl is from the ester group (COOEt), which would have a strong band around 1720 cm−1. So that fits.

In option B, the carbonyl is from the formamide (HCONH-), which typically has a carbonyl around 1680-1700 cm−1, which is close, but the IR is at 1720, which could still fit.

But in option D, the ester's carbonyl is at higher wavenumber than in amides, which makes sense because esters have higher carbonyl frequencies than amides due to less resonance stabilization.

Wait, but in the IR, the medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 and 3325 cm−1 suggest N-H stretching. In option D, the NH2 would show a strong broad peak in IR around 3300-3500 cm−1, which matches. In option B, the NH is part of the formamide, which is usually less intense than NH2.

So, considering all this, option D seems to fit better with the IR and NMR data, except for the 4.0 ppm peak. But perhaps that's an artifact or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: in the NMR of option D, the ethoxy's OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But the data shows a quartet at 4.5. That's a bit off. Could that be an error in the question, or maybe the OCH2 is coupled with another group, shifting it upfield?

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is not the ethoxy's OCH2, but another group. But I can't think of another group in option D that would give a quartet at 4.5.

Wait, what about the NH2 group? If the NH2 is adjacent to another group, but in the structure, it's on the benzene ring, so it's not attached to any CH2 groups.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the quartet is part of the ester group, but I can't see how.

Another possibility is that the 4.0 ppm is an impurity or some other solvent peak, but that's unlikely.

Given all this, I think the best fit is option D, despite the slight discrepancy in the NMR quartet position. The formula matches, the substituents are para, the IR fits, and the ethoxy is present. The 4.0 peak might be an NH2 group, but I'm not entirely sure.

### Evaluation of Options:
#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide (C₆H₅CONH₂ with an ethoxy group at position 3)**:
   - The substituents would be meta to each other, leading to aromatic protons that do not match the observed NMR data (two doublets for para substitution).
   - **Eliminated**.

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide (C₆H₄OCH₂CH₃ with a formamide group at position 4)**:
   - The ethoxy group would produce the triplet at 1.2 ppm (CH₃) and quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH₂), which matches.
   - The formamide group would have an NH, but the NMR shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H, which is inconsistent with a single NH group.
   - **Eliminated**.

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate (C₆H₄NH₂ with a propionate ester at position 4)**:
   - The propionate group would produce a triplet at 1.6 ppm (CH₃) and multiplets for the CH₂ groups, which do not match the observed triplet at 1.2 ppm (indicative of an ethyl group).
   - The molecular formula does not match either, as the propionate group would introduce additional carbons.
   - **Eliminated**.

#### **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (C₆H₄NH₂ with a benzoate ester at position 4)**:
   - The ethoxy group in the ester would produce the triplet at 1.2 ppm (CH₃) and quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH₂), which matches.
   - The para-substituted benzene ring would produce two doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm, consistent with the NMR data.
   - The NH₂ group on the benzene ring could explain the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), though NH₂ protons are typically more downfield. This discrepancy might arise from exchange broadening.
   - The molecular formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂** matches perfectly.
   - **Best fit**.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.
