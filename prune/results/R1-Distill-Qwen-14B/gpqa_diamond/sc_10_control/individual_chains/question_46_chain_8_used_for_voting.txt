Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and figuring out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

First, I need to recall what Grubbs catalyst does. From what I remember, Grubbs is a ruthenium-based catalyst used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. Specifically, Grubbs can catalyze ring-closing metathesis (RCM) and ring-opening metathesis (ROM), but in this case, since we're dealing with an unsaturated molecule, it's likely an RCM if the structure allows.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw that structure. Pent means five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH3)CH₂? No, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. But with a methyl group on C3. So 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, the formula for pent-1-ene is C5H10. Let me count: 1 2 3 4 5. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But the 3-methyl would mean a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, pent has five carbons. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be:

Position 1: double bond between C1 and C2.

So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that makes 5 carbons: C1 (CH₂), C2 (CH), C3 (CH(CH3)), C4 (CH2), C5 (CH3). Wait, but that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Hmm, but wait, the formula would be C6H12 because: each double bond reduces two Hs. Let me check: (CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3) has 6 carbons? No, wait, no. Wait, pent indicates five carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent has five carbons. The double bond is at position 1 (so between C1 and C2). So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH₂=
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
Carbon 4: CH₂
Carbon 5: CH3

Wait, but that adds up. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. But wait, that's five carbons in the chain? Let me count: 1 (CH₂=), 2 (CH-), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH₂), 5 (CH3). Yes, that's correct.

So the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Now, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis can involve the breaking and reforming of double bonds.

Wait, but when Grubbs is used on an isolated alkene, what happens? I think Grubbs tends to cause ring-closing metathesis if possible. Because the starting material is a linear diene, maybe it can form a ring through metathesis.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is a mono-alkene, so it's a single double bond. Grubbs can do ring-closing metathesis if the molecule can form a ring. But wait, for RCM, you usually need a diene, or at least two alkenes. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, Grubbs can also break a single double bond. Maybe the molecule can undergo a metathesis reaction by breaking the double bond and rearranging.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's a possibility for the alkene to undergo a ring-closing metathesis, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure again. The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. The double bond is at the first position, so the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3.

When Grubbs catalyst is added, it will facilitate a metathesis reaction. Metathesis typically involves the breaking and reforming of double bonds. Since it's a single double bond, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis.

Wait, but for RCM, you need two alkenes, right? Because metathesis involves the breaking of two double bonds. Wait, no. No, wait, in RCM, the same double bond can be involved in a way that allows the formation of a ring. Let me see. Maybe the molecule can form a ring by moving the double bond.

Wait, perhaps if the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3, the metathesis could result in a ring formation by connecting the ends. Like, maybe the CH₂=CH part could shift to form a ring.

Wait, but another approach: the molecule has a structure that can undergo a ring-closing metathesis. Let me think about how the metathesis would proceed.

In metathesis, the catalyst breaks the double bond and connects the ends. For a single double bond, perhaps it can't form a ring because there's only one double bond.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can't form a ring because it's only a single double bond. Alternatively, maybe the molecule can undergo a ring-opening metathesis, but that's more common when there's a ring already.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused. So, perhaps Grubbs will cause the double bond to shift positions.

Wait, another possibility is that the alkene undergoes a ring-forming metathesis, but since it's a single double bond, perhaps it's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a cross metathesis. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a single molecule, so it's more likely to undergo a ring-closing metathesis if possible.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products. The question is, how many possible products are formed, excluding ethene.

Wait, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst causes the alkene to undergo a ring-closing metathesis, forming a cyclic product. Alternatively, it could undergo a redistribution of substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule can undergo a hydride shift or some other process, but that's more of a carbocation rearrangement, which isn't what Grubbs does.

Wait, another thought: Grubbs can cause olefin metathesis, which can lead to different products depending on how the ends of the double bond are connected.

Let me think: 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. When Grubbs acts on this, the double bond breaks, and the two ends can swap partners.

Wait, but in a metathesis, the two ends of each double bond are swapped. But in this case, there's only one double bond, so perhaps the two ends can form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can form a ring by connecting the two ends. So, the CH₂=CH-... and the ...CH₂CH3 parts.

Wait, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then maybe the molecule can form a five-membered ring by connecting C1 to C5 or some other position.

Wait, let me count the positions. The molecule is C1-C2-C3-C4-C5. C1 is CH₂, C2 is CH, C3 is CH(CH3), C4 is CH₂, C5 is CH3.

Wait, if the catalyst causes the ends (C1 and C2) to break the double bond. Then, perhaps C1 connects to C5 and C2 connects to C3 or something like that. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can't form a ring because it's only a mono-alkene, so the metathesis may not occur, but that's unlikely because Grubbs can work on single alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis can't form a ring, so instead, it'somerizes the double bond. But wait, Grubbs typically causes metathesis, not isomerization.

Wait, another possibility: The molecule may undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclic product. Let's see. The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. The double bond is from C1 to C2. The rest is a chain from C3 (CH(CH3)) to C5 (CH3). So, the chain from C3 to C5 is three carbons: CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, perhaps the catalyst can cause the double bond to break and form a new double bond between C2 and C3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible rings that can form. If the molecule forms a five-membered ring, that's possible. Let's see: the chain is five carbons, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, if the catalyst breaks the double bond and forms a new ring by connecting C1 to C5 and C2 to C3, perhaps that forms a ring.

Wait, but if I connect C1 and C5, that would form a five-membered ring. Let me see: C1 is CH₂, C2 is CH, C3 is CH(CH3), C4 is CH2, C5 is CH3.

Wait, connecting C1 to C5 would make a ring. So the new structure would be a cyclopentene derivative. Let me visualize: the ring would have C1 connected to C2, C2 to C3, C3 to C4, C4 to C5, and C5 back to C1. But wait, that would be a five-membered ring, but where's the double bond?

Wait, in metathesis, the double bonds are broken and reformed. So the original double bond is between C1 and C2. After metathesis, the new double bond would be between C2 and C5, perhaps, or between C1 and C3? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a bicyclic compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is a racemic mixture, meaning it has equal amounts of R and S configurations at the stereogenic center, if any. But wait, in the starting molecule, is there a chiral center?

In 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. The C3 has a CH(CH3) group attached. So, looking at C3: it's connected to C2 (CH), C4 (CH2), CH3, and another CH2 group (from C4 and C5). Wait, no. Let me think: C3 is CH(CH3), so the substituents are CH2 (from C2), CH2CH3 (from C4), and the methyl group (CH3). Hmm, wait, no, C3 is connected to C2 (CH), C4 (CH2), CH3, and another group? Let me actually count the valence.

Wait, C3 is CH(CH3). So carbon 3 has a double bond? No, wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so C3 is a single bond. So C3 is attached to C2 (CH), C4 (CH2), and a CH3 group. So carbon 3 would have four substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2CH3 (from C4?), CH3, and perhaps another CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should write it correctly. The structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. So, for C3: it is connected to C2 (CH), C4 (CH₂), and a methyl group (CH3). So, the substituents on C3 are: C2 (CH2 group?), no. Wait, C2 is CH because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C2 is CH, bonded to C1 (CH₂), and C3 (CH(CH3)).

So C3 has four substituents: C2 (CH), C4 (CH2), CH3, and another CH₂ from C4? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps C3 has three substituents: CH(CH3), CH from C2, and CH2 from C4. Hmm, maybe it's better to move on.

Since the starting material is racemic, meaning equal amounts of enantiomers, but when undergoing metathesis, how does that affect the product?

Wait, perhaps the metathesis leads to a new chiral center or not. But the key here is to figure out how many different products form.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via ring-closing but via some other metathesis, such as breaking the double bond and forming a smaller alkene, like ethene, but the question says to exclude ethene, so we're looking for other products.

Wait, wait. Wait, Grubbs can also cause ring-opening metathesis, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: perhaps the Grubbs catalyst induces a cross metathesis, but in this case, there's only one alkene, so I think that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis, leading to a cyclic product. Let me think about that.

If the molecule forms a five-membered ring, that's possible. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and when it breaks, the catalyst connects C1 to C5 and C2 to C3, forming a ring. So the new structure would be a cyclopentene derivative.

Wait, but let me think. The original structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. After breaking the double bond, the two ends (C1 and C2) can form new bonds. So, C1 (from CH₂-) and C5 (CH3) could form a new bond, and C2 (CH-) and C3 (CH(CH3)) would form a new bond.

Wait, that would form a ring where C1 is connected to C5, and C2 is connected to C3. So the ring would be C1-C2-C3-C4-C5, but that's five members. Wait, but C4 is CH₂, so that would make a five-membered ring with a bridge?

Hmm, perhaps I'm not visualizing this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the product would have a new double bond.

Wait, another thought: the metathesis could lead to the formation of a cyclopropane? No, that's more for other catalysts. Or maybe a larger ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction just leads to the formation of ethene and another alkene. Because if the molecule breaks into two parts, each with a double bond.

Wait, let me think: the original molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. If metathesis occurs, perhaps it breaks into two parts. The question is, how would the Grubbs catalyst cause this to happen.

Wait, perhaps the catalyst could cause the double bond to shift, resulting in a different alkene.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: think about the possible products when Grubbs is used on a mono-alkene.

Wait, Grubbs can perform ring-closing metathesis, but only on dienes or molecules with two alkenes. Since this is a mono-alkene, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed. But that can't be the case because the question is implying there are products.

Wait, perhaps the molecule undergoes a ring-opening metathesis, but that's more for cyclic alkenes. So I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't form a ring but instead undergoes a metathesis that results in a different structure. Let's think about the possible products.

Wait, when Grubbs is used on 3-methylpent-1-ene, perhaps it breaks the double bond and the molecule forms a new double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction results in the formation of ethylene and another alkene. Let's see: if the original molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, perhaps the metathesis breaks the double bond into two parts and forms a new double bond.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclopentene derivative. Let me see.

If the double bond breaks between C1 and C2, and then the catalyst forms new bonds between C1 and C5, and between C2 and C3. Then, the structure would be a cyclopentene where the double bond is between C2 and C3.

Wait, let me try to draw this mentally: the ring would have five members, with a double bond between C2 and C3. The substituents would be as follows: C1 is connected to C5 and C2, C2 is connected to C1 and C3, and so on. The groups would be CH(CH3), CH2CH3, etc.

But then, how many different products would that result in?

Wait, but we're treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the starting material has a chiral center at C3, as I thought earlier. So when the metathesis occurs, does the configuration at C3 affect the product?

Hmm. Maybe not, if the reaction doesn't involve that center. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction creates new chiral centers.

Wait, if the product is a five-membered ring, perhaps there are two possible products: one where the substituents are arranged in one way, and another where they're arranged differently, leading to enantiomers.

But wait, since the starting material is racemic, perhaps the products would be a single compound, considering the ring formation.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, let me think differently. Suppose the reaction breaks the double bond and forms a new one. For example, if the metathesis results in a new double bond between C2 and C3, then the product would be 2-methylcyclopentene or something similar.

But how many different products are possible? Let's think about the possible structures.

If the metathesis forms a five-membered ring, the product would be a substituted cyclopentene. But how many isomers can form from this?

Wait, perhaps the product is a single compound, but considering the possibility of different substituents leading to different structures, maybe there are two possible products due to the stereochemistry.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the ring can form in two different ways, leading to different products.

Wait, another approach: the starting molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. When Grubbs catalyst is used, it can cause the double bond to shift positions, leading to different alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form a five-membered ring with a double bond, or perhaps form a bicyclic compound.

Wait, maybe I should look for examples of similar reactions. For example, ring-closing metathesis of 1-alkenes.

Wait, I recall that for RCM to occur, the molecule needs to have two alkenes. But in this case, the molecule has only one double bond. So perhaps RCM isn't possible. Then, what happens?

Another possibility is that the molecule can't undergo RCM, so instead, the double bond undergoes a shift. But Grubbs usually causes metathesis, not shifts.

Wait, perhaps the double bond doesn't move, but instead, the molecule undergoes a ring-opening metathesis, but that's more applicable to cyclic alkenes.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible structures after metathesis.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the Grubbs catalyst causes the molecule to form a ring by connecting the CH2 group at the end to the CH2=CH- part.

Wait, the original structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. If the CH₂ at the end (C5) connects to the C1 (CH₂), that would form a five-membered ring. The double bond would then be between C2 and C3.

So, the product would be a cyclopentene derivative with substituents. Let me count the substituents on the ring.

The ring would have:

C1: connected to C5 (CH3) and C2 (CH).

C2: connected to C1 and C3 (CH(CH3)).

C3: connected to C2 and C4 (CH2).

C4: connected to C3 and C5.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the ring would be C1-C2-C3-C4-C5, forming a five-membered ring.

In this case, the substituents would be:

At C3: a CH(CH3) group.

At C5: a CH3 group.

So the product would be cyclopentene with substituents at C3 and C5.

But how many possible products are there?

Wait, if the substituents are in different positions, perhaps there are two possible products based on where the substituents are placed. Or maybe the arrangement is such that it leads to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the product can have different stereoisomerism, but since the starting material is racemic, maybe the products would account for that.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the options given.

The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

If the product is a single cyclopentene derivative, then how many stereoisomers would it have? Well, if the ring has substituents that are in positions that allow for stereoisomerism, then there could be multiple products.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single structure, so only one product besides ethene, but the question says to exclude ethene. So, maybe the product is a single compound, but that would give one product, which is not among the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene, and the Grubbs catalyst induces a metathesis that results in two different alkenes.

Wait, let's think: if the molecule breaks into two parts, each part would form a new double bond. For example, the molecule could break between C2 and C3, forming two alkenes.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule forms a new double bond upon metathesis.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single alkene, so only one product. But that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can undergo more than one metathesis pathway, leading to different products.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis in two different ways, leading to different products.

Wait, for example, the ring could form in two different orientations, leading to different diastereomers or stereoisomers.

If that's the case, perhaps there are two possible products: one where the substituents are in a certain arrangement and another where they're in a different arrangement.

But considering the starting material is racemic, perhaps each enantiomer would form the same product, so maybe there are two products in total.

Wait, but the options don't have 2 as the correct answer except option D. But the options include D)2.

But wait, the question says to exclude ethene. So perhaps the reaction produces ethene and another alkene. But since ethene is excluded, we're left with the other product(s).

But in that case, perhaps there's only one product, but the options don't have that.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the possible products.

Wait, another possibility: the metathesis could lead to the formation of a new diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products more carefully. Let me draw the structure again.

3-methylpent-1-ene: CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

Grubbs catalyst would cause the double bond to undergo metathesis. Potential products could be ethene and another compound, but since ethene is excluded, we focus on the other product.

Wait, perhaps the product is 2-methyl-1-pentene or something similar. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the structure undergoes a ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclopropane, but that doesn't make sense because cyclopropane requires two alkenes.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclopentene derivative, and in that case, there are two possible products based on the position of substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring can form in two different ways, resulting in two different products.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let's think about the options again. The possible answers are 2,4,6, or 8 products.

If there are two possible products (option D), that would align with the possibility of forming two different products based on the stereoisomerism or the position of substituents.

Wait, but the starting material is racemic, meaning it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. If the reaction proceeds in a way that each enantiomer leads to the same product, then the total number of products would be the same as the number of possible products from a single enantiomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a product that has a new chiral center, and thus has two possible stereoisomers.

Wait, but if the product has a new chiral center, then each enantiomer of the starting material would form the same product, leading to a single product. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single compound without any chiral centers, so only one product.

But again, the options don't have 1 as an option.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible number of rings that can form. For instance, the molecule could form a five-membered ring or a six-membered ring, but that seems unlikely for a five-carbon molecule.

Wait, no, the starting molecule is five carbons in a chain, so the ring can only be five or four members.

Wait, a four-membered ring would be a cyclobutene derivative, but I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can't form a ring, so it undergoes a different metathesis, leading to another product.

Wait, perhaps the catalyst causes the double bond to shift to a different position, resulting in a different alkene.

For example, the double bond could shift from C1-C2 to C2-C3, forming 2-methylpent-2-ene or something similar.

But how many possible alkenes can form?

Wait, another approach: considering the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene, the possible sites for metathesis would be the existing double bond. Grubbs could cause the double bond to break and reform in a way that creates a new alkene.

So, the original double bond is between C1 and C2. After metathesis, perhaps the double bond forms between C2 and C3, producing 2-methylpent-2-ene.

But how many possible alkenes can form from this reaction?

Wait, considering the possible positions where the double bond can form, perhaps there are two possible alkenes: one where the double bond is between C1-C2 (same as starting material), or between C2-C3.

Wait, but the starting material is the same as the product in that case, so perhaps it's not a new product.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond can form between C3 and C4, but that depends on the structure.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products for this metathesis.

Upon checking, I remember that Grubbs can cause the formation of rings by connecting the ends of the molecule. So, for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the catalyst would break the C1-C2 double bond and form a new ring by connecting C1 to C5 and C2 to C3.

This would form a cyclopentene derivative. Now, let's consider the structure of the product.

In this case, the ring would have five members, and the double bond would be between which carbons?

Wait, when the double bond breaks, the two ends (C1 and C2) are free. They can form new bonds with other parts of the molecule. So, C1 could bond with C5, and C2 could bond with C3.

Let me try to visualize this.

The original structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

Breaking the double bond between C1 and C2 gives two ends: C1 (from CH₂) and C2 (from CH).

Now, the catalyst facilitates the exchange of these ends. So, C1 can bond with C5 (CH3), and C2 can bond with C3 (CH(CH3)).

This forms a five-membered ring:

C1 connected to C5 and C2.

C2 connected to C1 and C3.

C3 connected to C2 and C4.

C4 connected to C3 and C5.

C5 connected to C4 and C1.

Wait, but that would form a five-membered ring, and the double bond would be between C2 and C3.

So the product would be cyclopentene with a substituent at C3 (CH(CH3)) and another substituent at C5 (CH3).

But how many stereoisomers would this product have?

The ring would have substituents at C3 and C5. The positions on the ring are fixed, but the substituents could be in different configurations.

Wait, but in a five-membered ring, substituents on adjacent carbons would be cis or trans. Wait, but in this case, the substituents are at C3 and C5, which are two carbons apart. So perhaps they are trans to each other.

Wait, maybe the product is a single compound without any stereoisomerism, so only one product besides ethene. But the question says to exclude ethene, so perhaps there's only one product. But the options don't have one; the closest is option D, which is 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to two different products based on the configuration of the starting material.

Wait, the starting material is racemic, so it has both enantiomers. When the reaction occurs, perhaps each enantiomer leads to a different product.

Wait, but if the reaction forms a ring that has a new chiral center, maybe each starting enantiomer forms a different product, leading to two products in total.

So, considering that, the number of possible products would be two, excluding ethene. So the answer would be option D)2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Grubbs catalyst facilitates olefin metathesis, which involves the breaking and reforming of double bonds. The starting material, racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene, has the structure CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. This molecule is a mono-alkene with a double bond between C1 and C2. The racemic designation indicates that the molecule exists as a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers due to a chiral center at C3.

When treated with Grubbs catalyst, the double bond undergoes metathesis. A plausible reaction pathway is ring-closing metathesis (RCM), where the double bond breaks, and new bonds form to create a cyclic product. Specifically, the CH₂ group at C1 can bond with the CH₃ group at C5, and the CH group at C2 can bond with the CH(CH₃) group at C3, forming a five-membered cyclopentene ring. The double bond in the product is likely between C2 and C3.

The product is a substituted cyclopentene with a CH₃ group at C5 and a CH(CH₃) group at C3. Since the starting material is racemic, the reaction can proceed via two enantiomeric pathways, each leading to a distinct stereoisomer of the product. Therefore, two possible products are formed, corresponding to the two enantiomers of the starting material.

Excluding ethene, the number of possible products is **2**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and figuring out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

First, I need to recall what Grubbs catalyst does. From what I remember, Grubbs is a ruthenium-based catalyst used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. Specifically, Grubbs can catalyze ring-closing metathesis (RCM) and ring-opening metathesis (ROM), but in this case, since we're dealing with an unsaturated molecule, it's likely an RCM if the structure allows.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw that structure. Pent means five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH3)CH₂? No, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. But with a methyl group on C3. So 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, the formula for pent-1-ene is C5H10. Let me count: 1 2 3 4 5. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But the 3-methyl would mean a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, pent has five carbons. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be:

Position 1: double bond between C1 and C2.

So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that makes 5 carbons: C1 (CH₂), C2 (CH), C3 (CH(CH3)), C4 (CH2), C5 (CH3). Wait, but that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Hmm, but wait, the formula would be C6H12 because: each double bond reduces two Hs. Let me check: (CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3) has 6 carbons? No, wait, no. Wait, pent indicates five carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent has five carbons. The double bond is at position 1 (so between C1 and C2). So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH₂=
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
Carbon 4: CH₂
Carbon 5: CH3

Wait, but that adds up. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. But wait, that's five carbons in the chain? Let me count: 1 (CH₂=), 2 (CH-), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH₂), 5 (CH3). Yes, that's correct.

So the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Now, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis can involve the breaking and reforming of double bonds.

Wait, but when Grubbs is used on an isolated alkene, what happens? I think Grubbs tends to cause ring-closing metathesis if possible. Because the starting material is a linear diene, maybe it can form a ring through metathesis.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is a mono-alkene, so it's a single double bond. Grubbs can do ring-closing metathesis if the molecule can form a ring. But wait, for RCM, you usually need a diene, or at least two alkenes. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, Grubbs can also break a single double bond. Maybe the molecule can undergo a metathesis reaction by breaking the double bond and rearranging.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's a possibility for the alkene to undergo a ring-closing metathesis, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure again. The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. The double bond is at the first position, so the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3.

When Grubbs catalyst is added, it will facilitate a metathesis reaction. Metathesis typically involves the breaking and reforming of double bonds. Since it's a single double bond, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis.

Wait, but for RCM, you need two alkenes, right? Because metathesis involves the breaking of two double bonds. Wait, no. No, wait, in RCM, the same double bond can be involved in a way that allows the formation of a ring. Let me see. Maybe the molecule can form a ring by moving the double bond.

Wait, perhaps if the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3, the metathesis could result in a ring formation by connecting the ends. Like, maybe the CH₂=CH part could shift to form a ring.

Wait, but another approach: the molecule has a structure that can undergo a ring-closing metathesis. Let me think about how the metathesis would proceed.

In metathesis, the catalyst breaks the double bond and connects the ends. For a single double bond, perhaps it can't form a ring because there's only one double bond.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can't form a ring because it's only a single double bond. Alternatively, maybe the molecule can undergo a ring-opening metathesis, but that's more common when there's a ring already.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused. So, perhaps Grubbs will cause the double bond to shift positions.

Wait, another possibility is that the alkene undergoes a ring-forming metathesis, but since it's a single double bond, perhaps it's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a cross metathesis. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a single molecule, so it's more likely to undergo a ring-closing metathesis if possible.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products. The question is, how many possible products are formed, excluding ethene.

Wait, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst causes the alkene to undergo a ring-closing metathesis, forming a cyclic product. Alternatively, it could undergo a redistribution of substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule can undergo a hydride shift or some other process, but that's more of a carbocation rearrangement, which isn't what Grubbs does.

Wait, another thought: Grubbs can cause olefin metathesis, which can lead to different products depending on how the ends of the double bond are connected.

Let me think: 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. When Grubbs acts on this, the double bond breaks, and the two ends can swap partners.

Wait, but in a metathesis, the two ends of each double bond are swapped. But in this case, there's only one double bond, so perhaps the two ends can form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can form a ring by connecting the two ends. So, the CH₂=CH-... and the ...CH₂CH3 parts.

Wait, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then maybe the molecule can form a five-membered ring by connecting C1 to C5 or some other position.

Wait, let me count the positions. The molecule is C1-C2-C3-C4-C5. C1 is CH₂, C2 is CH, C3 is CH(CH3), C4 is CH₂, C5 is CH3.

Wait, if the catalyst causes the ends (C1 and C2) to break the double bond. Then, perhaps C1 connects to C5 and C2 connects to C3 or something like that. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can't form a ring because it's only a mono-alkene, so the metathesis may not occur, but that's unlikely because Grubbs can work on single alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis can't form a ring, so instead, it'somerizes the double bond. But wait, Grubbs typically causes metathesis, not isomerization.

Wait, another possibility: The molecule may undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclic product. Let's see. The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. The double bond is from C1 to C2. The rest is a chain from C3 (CH(CH3)) to C5 (CH3). So, the chain from C3 to C5 is three carbons: CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, perhaps the catalyst can cause the double bond to break and form a new double bond between C2 and C3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible rings that can form. If the molecule forms a five-membered ring, that's possible. Let's see: the chain is five carbons, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, if the catalyst breaks the double bond and forms a new ring by connecting C1 to C5 and C2 to C3, perhaps that forms a ring.

Wait, but if I connect C1 and C5, that would form a five-membered ring. Let me see: C1 is CH₂, C2 is CH, C3 is CH(CH3), C4 is CH2, C5 is CH3.

Wait, connecting C1 to C5 would make a ring. So the new structure would be a cyclopentene derivative. Let me visualize: the ring would have C1 connected to C2, C2 to C3, C3 to C4, C4 to C5, and C5 back to C1. But wait, that would be a five-membered ring, but where's the double bond?

Wait, in metathesis, the double bonds are broken and reformed. So the original double bond is between C1 and C2. After metathesis, the new double bond would be between C2 and C5, perhaps, or between C1 and C3? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a bicyclic compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is a racemic mixture, meaning it has equal amounts of R and S configurations at the stereogenic center, if any. But wait, in the starting molecule, is there a chiral center?

In 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. The C3 has a CH(CH3) group attached. So, looking at C3: it's connected to C2 (CH), C4 (CH2), CH3, and another CH2 group (from C4 and C5). Wait, no. Let me think: C3 is CH(CH3), so the substituents are CH2 (from C2), CH2CH3 (from C4), and the methyl group (CH3). Hmm, wait, no, C3 is connected to C2 (CH), C4 (CH2), CH3, and another group? Let me actually count the valence.

Wait, C3 is CH(CH3). So carbon 3 has a double bond? No, wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so C3 is a single bond. So C3 is attached to C2 (CH), C4 (CH2), and a CH3 group. So carbon 3 would have four substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2CH3 (from C4?), CH3, and perhaps another CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should write it correctly. The structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. So, for C3: it is connected to C2 (CH), C4 (CH₂), and a methyl group (CH3). So, the substituents on C3 are: C2 (CH2 group?), no. Wait, C2 is CH because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C2 is CH, bonded to C1 (CH₂), and C3 (CH(CH3)).

So C3 has four substituents: C2 (CH), C4 (CH2), CH3, and another CH₂ from C4? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps C3 has three substituents: CH(CH3), CH from C2, and CH2 from C4. Hmm, maybe it's better to move on.

Since the starting material is racemic, meaning equal amounts of enantiomers, but when undergoing metathesis, how does that affect the product?

Wait, perhaps the metathesis leads to a new chiral center or not. But the key here is to figure out how many different products form.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via ring-closing but via some other metathesis, such as breaking the double bond and forming a smaller alkene, like ethene, but the question says to exclude ethene, so we're looking for other products.

Wait, wait. Wait, Grubbs can also cause ring-opening metathesis, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: perhaps the Grubbs catalyst induces a cross metathesis, but in this case, there's only one alkene, so I think that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis, leading to a cyclic product. Let me think about that.

If the molecule forms a five-membered ring, that's possible. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and when it breaks, the catalyst connects C1 to C5 and C2 to C3, forming a ring. So the new structure would be a cyclopentene derivative.

Wait, but let me think. The original structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. After breaking the double bond, the two ends (C1 and C2) can form new bonds. So, C1 (from CH₂-) and C5 (CH3) could form a new bond, and C2 (CH-) and C3 (CH(CH3)) would form a new bond.

Wait, that would form a ring where C1 is connected to C5, and C2 is connected to C3. So the ring would be C1-C2-C3-C4-C5, but that's five members. Wait, but C4 is CH₂, so that would make a five-membered ring with a bridge?

Hmm, perhaps I'm not visualizing this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the product would have a new double bond.

Wait, another thought: the metathesis could lead to the formation of a cyclopropane? No, that's more for other catalysts. Or maybe a larger ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction just leads to the formation of ethene and another alkene. Because if the molecule breaks into two parts, each with a double bond.

Wait, let me think: the original molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. If metathesis occurs, perhaps it breaks into two parts. The question is, how would the Grubbs catalyst cause this to happen.

Wait, perhaps the catalyst could cause the double bond to shift, resulting in a different alkene.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: think about the possible products when Grubbs is used on a mono-alkene.

Wait, Grubbs can perform ring-closing metathesis, but only on dienes or molecules with two alkenes. Since this is a mono-alkene, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed. But that can't be the case because the question is implying there are products.

Wait, perhaps the molecule undergoes a ring-opening metathesis, but that's more for cyclic alkenes. So I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't form a ring but instead undergoes a metathesis that results in a different structure. Let's think about the possible products.

Wait, when Grubbs is used on 3-methylpent-1-ene, perhaps it breaks the double bond and the molecule forms a new double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction results in the formation of ethylene and another alkene. Let's see: if the original molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, perhaps the metathesis breaks the double bond into two parts and forms a new double bond.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclopentene derivative. Let me see.

If the double bond breaks between C1 and C2, and then the catalyst forms new bonds between C1 and C5, and between C2 and C3. Then, the structure would be a cyclopentene where the double bond is between C2 and C3.

Wait, let me try to draw this mentally: the ring would have five members, with a double bond between C2 and C3. The substituents would be as follows: C1 is connected to C5 and C2, C2 is connected to C1 and C3, and so on. The groups would be CH(CH3), CH2CH3, etc.

But then, how many different products would that result in?

Wait, but we're treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the starting material has a chiral center at C3, as I thought earlier. So when the metathesis occurs, does the configuration at C3 affect the product?

Hmm. Maybe not, if the reaction doesn't involve that center. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction creates new chiral centers.

Wait, if the product is a five-membered ring, perhaps there are two possible products: one where the substituents are arranged in one way, and another where they're arranged differently, leading to enantiomers.

But wait, since the starting material is racemic, perhaps the products would be a single compound, considering the ring formation.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, let me think differently. Suppose the reaction breaks the double bond and forms a new one. For example, if the metathesis results in a new double bond between C2 and C3, then the product would be 2-methylcyclopentene or something similar.

But how many different products are possible? Let's think about the possible structures.

If the metathesis forms a five-membered ring, the product would be a substituted cyclopentene. But how many isomers can form from this?

Wait, perhaps the product is a single compound, but considering the possibility of different substituents leading to different structures, maybe there are two possible products due to the stereochemistry.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the ring can form in two different ways, leading to different products.

Wait, another approach: the starting molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. When Grubbs catalyst is used, it can cause the double bond to shift positions, leading to different alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form a five-membered ring with a double bond, or perhaps form a bicyclic compound.

Wait, maybe I should look for examples of similar reactions. For example, ring-closing metathesis of 1-alkenes.

Wait, I recall that for RCM to occur, the molecule needs to have two alkenes. But in this case, the molecule has only one double bond. So perhaps RCM isn't possible. Then, what happens?

Another possibility is that the molecule can't undergo RCM, so instead, the double bond undergoes a shift. But Grubbs usually causes metathesis, not shifts.

Wait, perhaps the double bond doesn't move, but instead, the molecule undergoes a ring-opening metathesis, but that's more applicable to cyclic alkenes.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible structures after metathesis.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the Grubbs catalyst causes the molecule to form a ring by connecting the CH2 group at the end to the CH2=CH- part.

Wait, the original structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. If the CH₂ at the end (C5) connects to the C1 (CH₂), that would form a five-membered ring. The double bond would then be between C2 and C3.

So, the product would be a cyclopentene derivative with substituents. Let me count the substituents on the ring.

The ring would have:

C1: connected to C5 (CH3) and C2 (CH).

C2: connected to C1 and C3 (CH(CH3)).

C3: connected to C2 and C4 (CH2).

C4: connected to C3 and C5.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the ring would be C1-C2-C3-C4-C5, forming a five-membered ring.

In this case, the substituents would be:

At C3: a CH(CH3) group.

At C5: a CH3 group.

So the product would be cyclopentene with substituents at C3 and C5.

But how many possible products are there?

Wait, if the substituents are in different positions, perhaps there are two possible products based on where the substituents are placed. Or maybe the arrangement is such that it leads to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the product can have different stereoisomerism, but since the starting material is racemic, maybe the products would account for that.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the options given.

The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

If the product is a single cyclopentene derivative, then how many stereoisomers would it have? Well, if the ring has substituents that are in positions that allow for stereoisomerism, then there could be multiple products.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single structure, so only one product besides ethene, but the question says to exclude ethene. So, maybe the product is a single compound, but that would give one product, which is not among the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene, and the Grubbs catalyst induces a metathesis that results in two different alkenes.

Wait, let's think: if the molecule breaks into two parts, each part would form a new double bond. For example, the molecule could break between C2 and C3, forming two alkenes.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule forms a new double bond upon metathesis.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single alkene, so only one product. But that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can undergo more than one metathesis pathway, leading to different products.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis in two different ways, leading to different products.

Wait, for example, the ring could form in two different orientations, leading to different diastereomers or stereoisomers.

If that's the case, perhaps there are two possible products: one where the substituents are in a certain arrangement and another where they're in a different arrangement.

But considering the starting material is racemic, perhaps each enantiomer would form the same product, so maybe there are two products in total.

Wait, but the options don't have 2 as the correct answer except option D. But the options include D)2.

But wait, the question says to exclude ethene. So perhaps the reaction produces ethene and another alkene. But since ethene is excluded, we're left with the other product(s).

But in that case, perhaps there's only one product, but the options don't have that.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the possible products.

Wait, another possibility: the metathesis could lead to the formation of a new diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products more carefully. Let me draw the structure again.

3-methylpent-1-ene: CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

Grubbs catalyst would cause the double bond to undergo metathesis. Potential products could be ethene and another compound, but since ethene is excluded, we focus on the other product.

Wait, perhaps the product is 2-methyl-1-pentene or something similar. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the structure undergoes a ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclopropane, but that doesn't make sense because cyclopropane requires two alkenes.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclopentene derivative, and in that case, there are two possible products based on the position of substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring can form in two different ways, resulting in two different products.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let's think about the options again. The possible answers are 2,4,6, or 8 products.

If there are two possible products (option D), that would align with the possibility of forming two different products based on the stereoisomerism or the position of substituents.

Wait, but the starting material is racemic, meaning it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. If the reaction proceeds in a way that each enantiomer leads to the same product, then the total number of products would be the same as the number of possible products from a single enantiomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a product that has a new chiral center, and thus has two possible stereoisomers.

Wait, but if the product has a new chiral center, then each enantiomer of the starting material would form the same product, leading to a single product. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single compound without any chiral centers, so only one product.

But again, the options don't have 1 as an option.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible number of rings that can form. For instance, the molecule could form a five-membered ring or a six-membered ring, but that seems unlikely for a five-carbon molecule.

Wait, no, the starting molecule is five carbons in a chain, so the ring can only be five or four members.

Wait, a four-membered ring would be a cyclobutene derivative, but I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can't form a ring, so it undergoes a different metathesis, leading to another product.

Wait, perhaps the catalyst causes the double bond to shift to a different position, resulting in a different alkene.

For example, the double bond could shift from C1-C2 to C2-C3, forming 2-methylpent-2-ene or something similar.

But how many possible alkenes can form?

Wait, another approach: considering the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene, the possible sites for metathesis would be the existing double bond. Grubbs could cause the double bond to break and reform in a way that creates a new alkene.

So, the original double bond is between C1 and C2. After metathesis, perhaps the double bond forms between C2 and C3, producing 2-methylpent-2-ene.

But how many possible alkenes can form from this reaction?

Wait, considering the possible positions where the double bond can form, perhaps there are two possible alkenes: one where the double bond is between C1-C2 (same as starting material), or between C2-C3.

Wait, but the starting material is the same as the product in that case, so perhaps it's not a new product.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond can form between C3 and C4, but that depends on the structure.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products for this metathesis.

Upon checking, I remember that Grubbs can cause the formation of rings by connecting the ends of the molecule. So, for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the catalyst would break the C1-C2 double bond and form a new ring by connecting C1 to C5 and C2 to C3.

This would form a cyclopentene derivative. Now, let's consider the structure of the product.

In this case, the ring would have five members, and the double bond would be between which carbons?

Wait, when the double bond breaks, the two ends (C1 and C2) are free. They can form new bonds with other parts of the molecule. So, C1 could bond with C5, and C2 could bond with C3.

Let me try to visualize this.

The original structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

Breaking the double bond between C1 and C2 gives two ends: C1 (from CH₂) and C2 (from CH).

Now, the catalyst facilitates the exchange of these ends. So, C1 can bond with C5 (CH3), and C2 can bond with C3 (CH(CH3)).

This forms a five-membered ring:

C1 connected to C5 and C2.

C2 connected to C1 and C3.

C3 connected to C2 and C4.

C4 connected to C3 and C5.

C5 connected to C4 and C1.

Wait, but that would form a five-membered ring, and the double bond would be between C2 and C3.

So the product would be cyclopentene with a substituent at C3 (CH(CH3)) and another substituent at C5 (CH3).

But how many stereoisomers would this product have?

The ring would have substituents at C3 and C5. The positions on the ring are fixed, but the substituents could be in different configurations.

Wait, but in a five-membered ring, substituents on adjacent carbons would be cis or trans. Wait, but in this case, the substituents are at C3 and C5, which are two carbons apart. So perhaps they are trans to each other.

Wait, maybe the product is a single compound without any stereoisomerism, so only one product besides ethene. But the question says to exclude ethene, so perhaps there's only one product. But the options don't have one; the closest is option D, which is 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to two different products based on the configuration of the starting material.

Wait, the starting material is racemic, so it has both enantiomers. When the reaction occurs, perhaps each enantiomer leads to a different product.

Wait, but if the reaction forms a ring that has a new chiral center, maybe each starting enantiomer forms a different product, leading to two products in total.

So, considering that, the number of possible products would be two, excluding ethene. So the answer would be option D)2.


Grubbs catalyst facilitates olefin metathesis, which involves the breaking and reforming of double bonds. The starting material, racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene, has the structure CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. This molecule is a mono-alkene with a double bond between C1 and C2. The racemic designation indicates that the molecule exists as a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers due to a chiral center at C3.

When treated with Grubbs catalyst, the double bond undergoes metathesis. A plausible reaction pathway is ring-closing metathesis (RCM), where the double bond breaks, and new bonds form to create a cyclic product. Specifically, the CH₂ group at C1 can bond with the CH₃ group at C5, and the CH group at C2 can bond with the CH(CH₃) group at C3, forming a five-membered cyclopentene ring. The double bond in the product is likely between C2 and C3.

The product is a substituted cyclopentene with a CH₃ group at C5 and a CH(CH₃) group at C3. Since the starting material is racemic, the reaction can proceed via two enantiomeric pathways, each leading to a distinct stereoisomer of the product. Therefore, two possible products are formed, corresponding to the two enantiomers of the starting material.

Excluding ethene, the number of possible products is **2**.

Answer: D
