Okay, so I need to figure out the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets are part of a system where the planets are in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods have a certain ratio. The question says the periods are in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for the five planets, from Planet_1 to Planet_5.

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo)/sigma )^(-1/4), but since they all have the same albedo, I can probably ignore the albedo term in the ratio.

Wait, actually, the equilibrium temperature equation is T = T_eff * (L/(16πσa²))^½, but I think another way to write it is T ≈ T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ). But maybe a simpler approach is to consider the inverse square law for stellar flux. The flux is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. So, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2), because T is proportional to sqrt(F) and F is 1/a².

So, the temperature ratio T4/T2 would be sqrt( (a2/a4) ). Because if T is proportional to sqrt(1/a), then T4/T2 = sqrt( (a2)/(a4) ).

Wait, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) / (16 * pi * sigma) )^(1/4) * ( R_star / (2 a) )^(1/2). But since albedo and R_star are the same for all planets, the ratio T4/T2 simplifies to sqrt( a2/(a4) )

Wait, no. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T scales as 1/sqrt(a). So T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Because T4 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a4)) , T2 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a2)). So T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

So the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a4 )

But I don't have the actual distances, but the periods. I know that for planets orbiting the same star, the orbital period P and the semi-major axis a are related by Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³. So, a ∝ P^(2/3)

So, a2 is proportional to P2^(2/3), and a4 is proportional to P4^(2/3). So the ratio a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) )

Wait, let me write it as a2/a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3 )

So, T4/T2 = sqrt( (a2/a4) ) = sqrt( (P2 / P4)^(2/3) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3 )

Because sqrt( x^(2/3) ) is x^(1/3 )

So, the temperature ratio is (P2/P4)^(1/3 )

Now, what are the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4? The given ratio is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So the periods are in the order of P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 :5.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the orbital periods are in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1 = 1x, Planet_2 P2=2x, Planet_3 P3=2.5x, Planet_4 P4=3.5x, Planet_5 P5=5x.

So P2 = 2x, P4=3.5x.

So the ratio P2/P4 is (2x)/(3.5x) = 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So the temperature ratio is (4/7)^(1/3 )

What's (4/7)^(1/3)? Let's compute that.

First, 4 divided by 7 is approximately 0.5714.

The cube root of 0.5714 is ... Well, the cube of 0.8 is 0.512, and cube of 0.83 is approx 0.83^3 ≈ 0.83 *0.83=0.6889 *0.83 ≈ 0.571. Oh, wait, that's interesting. Because 0.83^3 is about 0.571, which is the same as 4/7. So cube root of 4/7 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, wait, let me compute 0.83^3:

0.83 *0.83 = 0.6889

0.6889 * 0.83 = ?

Let me compute 0.6889 * 0.8 = 0.55112

0.6889 * 0.03=0.020667

Adding them: 0.55112 + 0.020667 ≈ 0.57178.

Which is about 0.5718, which is roughly 4/7 (which is approximately 0.5714). So 0.83 cubed is about 0.5718, which is very close to 4/7. So the cube root of 4/7 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, but wait, (4/7) is approximately 0.5714, and the cube root of that is about 0.83. So (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

So T4/T2 ≈ 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because the ratio is T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3) = (2/3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

So the temperature ratio is about 0.83. So Planet_4 is cooler than Planet_2 because it's farther away.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the proportionality. The equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period? Or does it depend on the period's relation through Kepler's law.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using Kepler's third law more directly.

Kepler's third law says that (P^2) / (a^3) = 4π²/(G M), which is a constant for a given star. So, a ∝ P^(2/3).

So, a2 = (P2)^(2/3), a4 = (P4)^(2/3).

So, a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3)

So, T (equilibrium) is proportional to sqrt(1/a) = (a)^(-1/2)

Thus, T4/T2 = [ (a2/(a4) ) ]^(-1/4) ??? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, equilibrium temperature T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) / (sigma) )^(1/4 )

Wait, no, the formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) )

But more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is given by:

T = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to express it in terms of flux. The flux received from the star is F = L / (4 pi a^2 ). The planet absorbs F*(1 - albedo)/4 (since it's a blackbody) and radiates as a blackbody at temperature T.

So using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

F*(1 - albedo)/(4 sigma) = sigma T^4

So rearranged,

T = [ F (1 - a) / (4 sigma) ]^(1/4 )

But F is L/(4 pi a^2 ), so substituting,

T = [ (L/(4 pi a^2 )) * (1 - a) / (4 sigma) ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify: T = [ L (1 - a) / (16 pi sigma a^2 ) ]^(1/4 )

Since L and sigma are constants for the star, and a is the distance, and (1 - a) is same for all planets, the T is proportional to (1/a^2 )^ (1/4 ) = 1/a^(0.5 )

So T ∝ 1/√a.

But a ∝ P^(2/3 ), so T ∝ 1/(P^(2/3 ))^0.5 ) = 1/ P^(1/3 )

So T ∝ 1/P^(1/3 )

Therefore, T4 / T2 = (P2 / P4 )^(1/3 )

Ah, that's a key point. So earlier I had the same conclusion. So that's where that ratio comes from.

So with P2=2, P4=3.5, their ratio is 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (4/7)^(1/3) is the same as the cube root of 0.5714, which is approximately 0.83.

So the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 is about 0.83 times that of Planet_2.

Wait, but wait, no, no. Because the question is the ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2, which is T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

But wait, wait a second. If P4 is larger than P2, meaning Planet_4 is further away because a is proportional to P^(2/3), then Planet_4 should be colder.

So T4 < T2, so T4/T2 < 1. Which is the case, 0.83 is less than 1.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \). Using Kepler's third law, \( a \propto P^{2/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Substituting this into the temperature relation, we find \( T \propto 1/P^{1/3} \).

The orbital periods of the planets are given in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Assigning \( P_1 = 1x \), \( P_2 = 2x \), \( P_3 = 2.5x \), \( P_4 = 3.5x \), and \( P_5 = 5x \), we calculate the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4 as:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2x}{3.5x} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714.
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio \( T_4/T_2 \) is then given by:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Approximating \( \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3} \), we find that \( 0.83^3 \approx 0.5714 \), so:

\[
\left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 is approximately 83% of that of Planet_2, making the ratio \( T_4/T_2 \approx 0.83 \).

From the options provided, the closest match is:

**C) ~0.83**

Okay, so I need to figure out the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

So, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2), because T is proportional to sqrt(F) and F is 1/a².

So, the temperature ratio T4/T2 would be sqrt( (a2/a4) ). Because if T is proportional to sqrt(1/a), then T4/T2 = sqrt( (a2)/(a4) ).

Wait, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) / (16 * pi * sigma) )^(1/4) * ( R_star / (2 a) )^(1/2). But since albedo and R_star are the same for all planets, the ratio T4/T2 simplifies to sqrt( a2/(a4) )

Wait, no. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T scales as 1/sqrt(a). So T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Because T4 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a4)) , T2 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a2)). So T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

So the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a4 )

But I don't have the actual distances, but the periods. I know that for planets orbiting the same star, the orbital period P and the semi-major axis a are related by Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³. So, a ∝ P^(2/3)

So, a2 is proportional to P2^(2/3), and a4 is proportional to P4^(2/3). So the ratio a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) )

Wait, let me write it as a2/a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3 )

So, T4/T2 = sqrt( (a2/a4) ) = sqrt( (P2 / P4)^(2/3) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3 )

Because sqrt( x^(2/3) ) is x^(1/3 )

So, the temperature ratio is (P2/P4)^(1/3 )

Now, what are the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4? The given ratio is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So the periods are in the order of P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 :5.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the orbital periods are in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1 = 1x, Planet_2 P2=2x, Planet_3 P3=2.5x, Planet_4 P4=3.5x, Planet_5 P5=5x.

So P2 = 2x, P4=3.5x.

So the ratio P2/P4 is (2x)/(3.5x) = 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So the temperature ratio is (4/7)^(1/3 )

What's (4/7)^(1/3)? Let's compute that.

First, 4 divided by 7 is approximately 0.5714.

The cube root of 0.5714 is ... Well, the cube of 0.8 is 0.512, and cube of 0.83 is approx 0.83^3 ≈ 0.83 *0.83=0.6889 *0.83 ≈ 0.571. Oh, wait, that's interesting. Because 0.83^3 is about 0.571, which is the same as 4/7. So cube root of 4/7 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, wait, let me compute 0.83^3:

0.83 *0.83 = 0.6889

0.6889 * 0.83 = ?

Let me compute 0.6889 * 0.8 = 0.55112

0.6889 * 0.03=0.020667

Adding them: 0.55112 + 0.020667 ≈ 0.57178.

Which is about 0.5718, which is roughly 4/7 (which is approximately 0.5714). So 0.83 cubed is about 0.5718, which is very close to 4/7. So the cube root of 4/7 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, but wait, (4/7) is approximately 0.5714, and the cube root of that is about 0.83. So (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

So T4/T2 ≈ 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because the ratio is T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3) = (2/3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

So the temperature ratio is about 0.83. So Planet_4 is cooler than Planet_2 because it's farther away.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the proportionality. The equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period? Or does it depend on the period's relation through Kepler's law.

So, a2 = (P2)^(2/3), a4 = (P4)^(2/3).

So, a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3)

So, T (equilibrium) is proportional to sqrt(1/a) = (a)^(-1/2)

Thus, T4/T2 = [ (a2/(a4) ) ]^(-1/4) ??? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, equilibrium temperature T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) / (sigma) )^(1/4 )

Wait, no, the formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) )

But more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is given by:

T = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to express it in terms of flux. The flux received from the star is F = L / (4 pi a^2 ). The planet absorbs F*(1 - albedo)/4 (since it's a blackbody) and radiates as a blackbody at temperature T.

So using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

F*(1 - albedo)/(4 sigma) = sigma T^4

So rearranged,

T = [ F (1 - a) / (4 sigma) ]^(1/4 )

But F is L/(4 pi a^2 ), so substituting,

T = [ (L/(4 pi a^2 )) * (1 - a) / (4 sigma) ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify: T = [ L (1 - a) / (16 pi sigma a^2 ) ]^(1/4 )

Since L and sigma are constants for the star, and a is the distance, and (1 - a) is same for all planets, the T is proportional to (1/a^2 )^ (1/4 ) = 1/a^(0.5 )

So T ∝ 1/√a.

But a ∝ P^(2/3 ), so T ∝ 1/(P^(2/3 ))^0.5 ) = 1/ P^(1/3 )

So T ∝ 1/P^(1/3 )

Therefore, T4 / T2 = (P2 / P4 )^(1/3 )

Ah, that's a key point. So earlier I had the same conclusion. So that's where that ratio comes from.

So with P2=2, P4=3.5, their ratio is 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (4/7)^(1/3) is the same as the cube root of 0.5714, which is approximately 0.83.

So the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 is about 0.83 times that of Planet_2.

Wait, but wait, no, no. Because the question is the ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2, which is T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

But wait, wait a second. If P4 is larger than P2, meaning Planet_4 is further away because a is proportional to P^(2/3), then Planet_4 should be colder.

So T4 < T2, so T4/T2 < 1. Which is the case, 0.83 is less than 1.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \). Using Kepler's third law, \( a \propto P^{2/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Substituting this into the temperature relation, we find \( T \propto 1/P^{1/3} \).

The orbital periods of the planets are given in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Assigning \( P_1 = 1x \), \( P_2 = 2x \), \( P_3 = 2.5x \), \( P_4 = 3.5x \), and \( P_5 = 5x \), we calculate the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4 as:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2x}{3.5x} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714.
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio \( T_4/T_2 \) is then given by:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Approximating \( \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3} \), we find that \( 0.83^3 \approx 0.5714 \), so:

\[
\left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 is approximately 83% of that of Planet_2, making the ratio \( T_4/T_2 \approx 0.83 \).

From the options provided, the closest match is:
