Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to walk through it step by step.

So, the problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are A to D, each giving a different relative speed and total energy.

First, what's being asked? The relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Right, in relativity, speeds don't just add up normally because of the Lorentz transformations. So for the relative speed, I think I need to use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, the velocity addition formula. Oh right, when two objects are moving at speeds u and v relative to a rest frame, the speed of one as seen from the other isn't u-v. Because at high speeds, that's not accurate. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, in this case, since both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed should be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by some factor. Let me write that down.

So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So relative speed would be (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

u - v = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c. Oh wait, that's about 0.14c. So looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as relative speed. So the relative speed is either C or D.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Wait, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut, right? Because energy isn't just the sum of their rest masses; each has kinetic energy as well.

The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for each astronaut, we calculate their gamma and multiply by their rest mass energy, then sum them.

Let me compute each one.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma for him: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is gamma * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2 m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma for him: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So his energy is approx 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Now sum the two energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and relative speed is 0.14c. So C matches both.

Option D says E=5 mc², which is less than what I calculated, so probably not. So the answer must be option C.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), which matches options C and D.

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

Combining the relative speed and total energy, the correct answer is:

**Relative speed \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), Total energy \( E = 5.96mc^2 \).**

This matches option C.

Gamma for him: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is gamma * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2 m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma for him: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So his energy is approx 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Now sum the two energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and relative speed is 0.14c. So C matches both.

Option D says E=5 mc², which is less than what I calculated, so probably not. So the answer must be option C.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), which matches options C and D.

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

Combining the relative speed and total energy, the correct answer is:

**Relative speed \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), Total energy \( E = 5.96mc^2 \).**

This matches option C.
