Okay, so I have this problem where a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of GADD45G. The goal is to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. But when they try to express the protein, it doesn't work as expected. The question is about figuring out why.

The problem states that they introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G protein. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which are commonly used for protein expression. They selected antibiotic-resistant colonies and tested the expression, but failed to overexpress the protein.

They provided the DNA sequence of the plus strand. I need to look for possible issues in this sequence that would prevent the proper expression of the protein.

Looking at the options, let's consider each one:

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. This would mean that the HA tag isn't correctly formed, leading to a non-functional tag. If the tag is messed up, maybe the antibody can't bind for affinity purification. But the question is about overexpression, not purification. So maybe this isn’t the main problem, but it's something to consider.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. If there's a premature stop codon, the ribosome would stop translating early, leading to a truncated protein. Looking at the DNA sequence, I need to find if there are any early stop codons in the frame. The coding sequence starts with ATG (which is the start codon) and ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. Let me scan the sequence.

Wait, looking at the end, the sequence is ...TGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'. So the last part is TGA, which is a stop codon. But is there any other in-frame stop codon before that?

Looking through the sequence: The first few codons are ATG (start), TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), etc. Wait, let's look for TAA, TAG, or TGA in the correct reading frame.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. The HA sequence is usually a specific peptide, but in the construct, it's added as a sequence before the GADD45G coding sequence. Since the HA tag is part of the coding sequence, any error there could affect expression.

Wait, perhaps the issue is in the reading frame. Let me see: the HA tag is part of the coding sequence, so it's added at the beginning. The HA tag is typically something like YPYDVPDYA or similar. But the problem states that the HA is the 'influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant.' Maybe they inserted the HA tag in the wrong frame, causing a premature stop.

Wait, but in the given DNA sequence, the first codon after the start is ATG, which is methionine. So the start is correct. Wait, but the HA sequence is inserted before GADD45G. So in the provided DNA, the start is ATG, then the HA tag, then the GADD45G sequence. If the HA tag was in the correct frame, the reading would proceed correctly. If the HA tag was inserted in a way that caused a frame shift, then after the HA, the reading frame could be messed up, leading to a premature stop.

Wait, looking at the first part of the DNA sequence: the start is ATG (correct). Next is TAC (tyr), CCA (pro), TAC (tyr), etc. These don't immediately suggest a problem. But perhaps the HA tag was inserted in the wrong frame, causing a frame shift. Let me check how many nucleotides the HA tag is. The HA tag is a short peptide, say 10 amino acids, which is 30 nucleotides. The sequence starts with ATG, then the HA part.

Wait, the first 30 nucleotides after ATG would be TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TAC GCT GCT AAA TGA. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me write this out as triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TAC GCT GCT AAA TGA ...

Wait, the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TAC GCT GCT AAA TGA ... So each codon is correct. Let me see if any of these are stop codons. The first few are TAC (tyr), CCA (pro), TAC (tyr), GAT (aspartic acid), GGT (glycine), TCC (serine), AGA (arginine), TAC (tyr), GCT (alanine), GCT (alanine), AAA (lysine), TGA (stop). Oh, wait! The 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. So the HA tag is only a few amino acids and then the ribosome would terminate early.

So that's a problem. Because the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, and then the GADD45G would follow. But here, the HA sequence is followed by a stop codon, so the protein would be truncated.

Wait, but the HA tag is supposed to be part of the GADD45G coding sequence. So the HA should be followed by the rest of GADD45G. But in this sequence, the HA part has an in-frame TGA, which would terminate translation early. So the HA tag would be incomplete, and the rest of the GADD45G wouldn't be expressed. Hence, the protein isn't overexpressed because it's being cut off.

So looking at the options, this would mean that the HA insertion caused a premature stop codon. So that's a problem with the construct. So the issue is that the HA sequence introduced a premature stop, leading the ribosome to terminate translation early.

Which option matches this? Looking at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be the case if there's an in-frame stop codon in the coding sequence.

Alternatively, option A is about a missense mutation in the HA sequence. But the problem is not that the HA is wrong—it's that the HA contains a stop codon.

Wait, the HA is a short peptide, but the way it's inserted here may have added a TGA in the sequence. So in the DNA, the HA is followed by a stop codon. So the HA is only part of the intended sequence before the stop.

So the problem is that an early stop codon is present in the coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate early.

So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but another possibility is that the HA tag insertion caused a frameshift. Let me check the length of the HA sequence. The HA tag is about 14 amino acids or so, which is 42 nucleotides. Let's check the initial part of the sequence.

The sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TAC GCT GCT AAA TGA ...

Wait, that's 12 codons (ATG is 1, then 11 more). Each codon is three letters. So 12 codons after the start would be 36 nucleotides (12 *3 =36). The HA tag is longer than that, so perhaps the frame is correct. But in this case, the 12th codon is TGA, a stop. So the HA sequence might have been incorrectly added, causing the premature stop.

So the correct answer is B, the ribosome terminated early because the coding sequence has a premature stop codon.

The researcher is attempting to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, tagged with a hemagglutinin (HA) determinant at the N-terminus. However, the protein fails to overexpress. The provided DNA sequence shows that the HA tag is followed by a TGA stop codon in the coding sequence. This is problematic because the ribosome translates the mRNA in the same reading frame, and encountering the TGA codon prematurely terminates translation. As a result, the nascent protein is truncated, preventing proper overexpression of the full-length GADD45G protein.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: A missense mutation in the HA sequence would affect the tag's structure but would not necessarily prevent translation of the full-length protein. Since the issue is overexpression failure, this is unlikely to be the cause.
- **Option B**: The presence of an in-frame TGA stop codon in the coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, leading to a truncated protein. This matches the observed problem of failed overexpression.
- **Option C**: The lack of a linker sequence could theoretically lead to proteolysis, but this would not explain the complete failure of translation initiation or elongation.
- **Option D**: The absence of a tRNA for the UAA codon is irrelevant here because the stop codon observed is TGA, not UAA.

The most likely explanation is that the premature stop codon (TGA) in the coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the expression of the full-length protein.
