Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But I'm a bit rusty on the specifics, so I need to think through this carefully.

The question gives me the density matrix rho, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A to D, each with a different vector r.

Wait, what does the geometrical position mean here? Oh right, in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector on or inside the unit sphere. For a pure state |psi>, it's a point on the sphere, and for a mixed state, it's inside.

But wait, rho is a density matrix, so it's a mixed state. Let me recall the Bloch sphere parametrization. A general single-qubit density matrix can be written as (I + r · sigma)/2, where sigma are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space. The vector r determines the position on the Bloch sphere.

So, the given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write out each term. |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0 on the diagonal. Similarly, |1><1| is diagonal with 0 and 1. So adding them gives a matrix with [1, 0; 0, 1] on the diagonal, and then dividing by 2, rho becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Wait, how does that compare to the general form (I + r·sigma)/2? Let me write that out. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], and the sigma matrices are [[0,1],[1,0]] (sigma_x), [[0,-i],[i,0]] (sigma_y), and [[1,0],[0,-1]] (sigma_z).

So when you write (I + r·sigma)/2, it's (1/2)[[1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y],[r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z]].

Comparing this to our rho, which is [[0.5, 0],[0, 0.5]], let's see what r must be. So the diagonal elements must be (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 and (1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5.

Wait, solving (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0. Similarly, (1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 - r_z = 1 → r_z=0. So r_z is zero.

What about the off-diagonal terms? Our rho has off-diagonal terms as zero. So in the general form, the off-diagonal terms are (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 and (r_x + i r_y)/2 = 0.

Wait, so (r_x - i r_y) must equal zero. That implies that both r_x and r_y are zero. Because if r_x is not zero, then r_x - i r_y would not be zero unless both are zero.

So putting it all together, r_x = 0, r_y=0, r_z=0. So the vector r is (0,0,0). That makes sense because the density matrix is a completely mixed state, meaning it's equally likely to be in state |0> or |1>, which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.

So looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). That should be the correct answer.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state. In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is a vector in 3D space that determines the state's position in the Bloch sphere.

For the given density matrix, expanding \( \rho \) yields:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the general form \( \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right) \), the off-diagonal terms must vanish, which implies \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \). Additionally, the diagonal terms are equal, so \( r_z = 0 \). Thus, the vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is \( (0, 0, 0) \).

This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the center of the Bloch sphere. Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).
