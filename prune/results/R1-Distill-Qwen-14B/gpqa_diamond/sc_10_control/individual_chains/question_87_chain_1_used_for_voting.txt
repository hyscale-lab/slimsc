Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about an organic chemistry problem. Hmm, let's try to think it through step by step. 

The question says: We have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. We need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Alright, let's break it down. First, let's figure out the structure of the compound. It's a di-substituted benzene ring (since it's a 6-membered aromatic ring), meaning there are two substituents on the ring. The total number of carbons is 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must add up to 2 carbons. Wait, no, because each substituent adds their own carbons. If each substituent is one carbon, that would add 2, making 8 total. But wait, substituents could be more than one carbon. Wait, wait, let me think. The benzene ring has 6 carbons, the substituents add up to 2 more, so each substituent is one carbon? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other is a single carbon? Or perhaps one substituent is a methyl group and the other is something else.

Wait, but the FTIR data says there's a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. Wait, but that would be two substituents: one carbonyl, one halogen. But wait, the carbonyl would be in a substituent. Let's think: the substituents on the benzene can be groups like -COOR, -COOH, etc., or perhaps a ketone group, but ketone groups are less common on aromatic rings as substituents because they're not very good electron-withdrawing groups. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde group? No, aldehydes are typically at the end of chains. Wait, another possibility is that the carbonyl is part of a substituent that's attached to the ring. For example, a ketone group as R-CO-R', but that would require more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. So benzene with two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group, the other is a halogen. Let's think of possible substituents. For example, one substituent could be a -COOH group (carboxylic acid), which has a carbonyl. Another could be a halogen like -Cl, -Br, etc. But wait, that would make the substituents each one carbon, which would add up to 2 carbons, making the total 8. Wait, the benzene is 6 carbons, substituents add 2, so 8 in total. That makes sense.

Wait, but let me confirm: if the benzene has two substituents, each one carbon, the total carbons would be 6 + 2 = 8. Yep. So substituents are -X (halogen) and -COOH (carboxylic acid), or maybe another carbonyl group like -CHO (aldehyde), but that would be possible too.

Alternatively, one substituent could be a ketone group, but that's more like R-CO-R', which is two substituents, but perhaps not. Wait, maybe the substituents are more complex. Let's think: if one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group that has more than one carbon. Wait, but the total carbons are 8. Let me calculate: benzene (6) + substituents (2) = 8. So each substituent is one carbon, or one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero. No, substituents have to be attached, so each must contribute at least one carbon. Hmm, so maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group with two carbons, like an acetyl group (CH3CO-), but that would add two carbons. Then the other substituent would be a halogen, one carbon. So benzene has 6, substituents: 2 (from acetyl) + 1 (from Cl, for example) = 3. 6+3=9, which is more than 8. So that can't be. 

Wait, perhaps the substituents are each one carbon. So, one is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, but that's not possible because a ketone substituent on benzene would be like a C=O attached, but that would require the substituent to be R-CO-. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl oxygen with another group attached. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group like an ester or ketone, and a halogen. Let me think about the possible structures. For example, if the substituents are a -COOH group and a -Cl. That would add two substituents, each with one carbon (the COOH has two oxygen but the carbon is one attached to the ring). So, benzene with -COOH and -Cl substituents: that's possible. But wait, does that give the correct NMR signals?

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group like an acetyl group. For example, benzene with an acetyl group (-COCH3) and a halogen. Then, the substituents would be -COCH3 (three carbons) and -X (one carbon), so total substituents: 4 carbons. 6+4=10, which is more than 8. So that's not right.

Hmm, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen, each with one carbon. So, benzene with -COOH and -Cl. That's 6 + 2 =8 carbons. Because benzene has 6, each substituent is one carbon? Wait, the COOH group is -COOH, which has two oxygen but the substituent attached to the ring is the carboxylic acid group, which is -COOH. The substituent is -COOH, which is a group where the ring is attached to a carbon, and that carbon is connected to another oxygen. So, the substituent has two carbons? No, wait. Wait, the substituent is a carboxylic acid group, which is -COOH. The carbon in the substituent is one carbon (the one attached to the ring). So the substituent adds one carbon. Similarly, the halogen substituent (like Cl) is one substituent with one carbon (itself, but actually Cl is an atom, not a carbon. Wait a minute, wait! Halogens are atoms, not carbons. Oh, so the substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br), but that's an atom, not a carbon. So the substituent on the benzene is an X atom, which doesn't contribute a carbon. So in this case, the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group (with one carbon) and a halogen (which is an atom, so no carbon). So, the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (from substituent) =7. But the question says 8 carbons in total. So that doesn't add up.

Wait, that's a problem. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the substituent. Let's rethink. If the substituent is something else. Maybe the substituent is an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group but perhaps more carbons. Wait, but the total is 8.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl-containing group that itself has more carbons. For example, benzaldehyde has a substituent of -CHO, which is one carbon (the aldehyde). So substituent adds one carbon. Another substituent is a halogen, which doesn't add any carbons. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) +1 (CHO) =7, which is less than 8. So not matching.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think again. The compound has 8 carbons in total. The benzene ring has 6, so the substituents must add 2 carbons. So substituents can be two groups each contributing one carbon, or one group contributing two carbons and the other nothing. But that can't be because substituents must be attached. Wait, another possibility: one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a methyl group. Because methyl is a substituent with one carbon. So substituents are -COOH and -CH3. Wait, but that would be two substituents each adding one carbon. So total substituents add 2 carbons, making total 8. That could work.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl group as well as an aromatic-halogen bond. So, if the substituents are -COOH and -CH3, there's no halogen. So that can't be right because the IR shows a halogen bond.

Ah, I see. So the substituents must include both a carbonyl group and a halogen. But the problem is that the halogen is an atom, not a carbon. So the substituents are one carbonyl group (which may add one or more carbons) and a halogen (which adds zero carbons). So, total carbons would be benzene (6) + substituents (from carbonyl group) =8. So substituent from carbonyl group must add 2 carbons. So the substituent is two carbons. For example, an acetyl group (-COCH3). So substituent is -COCH3, which is two carbons (the C=O and CH3).

So, substituents are -COCH3 and -X (halogen, one substituent). So total substituents on benzene: one is -COCH3 (two carbons), the other is -X (no carbons). So total carbons: 6 +2 =8. That works.

So the structure would be benzene ring with an acetyl group (-COCH3) and a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.) substituent. So, the substituents are at the para positions, meta, or ortho positions.

Now, looking at the NMR options. Let's think about the expected signals.

In the structure where there's a benzene ring with an acetyl group and a halogen substituent, the NMR would show:

- The aromatic protons. Depending on the substituents' positions, the aromatic protons will split into different signals. For example, if the substituents are para, the ring is symmetrical, so perhaps two sets of protons. Alternatively, if they are meta, the pattern would be different.

Wait, but the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Let's assume they are in the para position, making it a symmetric structure. So the two substituents are opposite each other.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in two sets: the ones next to the substituents (ortho) and those opposite (meta). Wait, if substituents are para, then the aromatic protons would have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, the two ortho to the acetyl group and the two ortho to the halogen. Or, maybe each substituent is in a position that creates two equivalent sets. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are meta to each other, leading to more complex splitting. Wait, but without knowing the exact positions, perhaps the key is to look for the carbonyl group's NMR signals.

Wait, the acetyl group (-COCH3) would have a CH3 group attached to the carbonyl. The CH3 would be deshielded and appear around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm, typically as a triplet or a singlet if no splitting. But looking at the options:

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). So the 2.3 ppm is a singlet of 3H, which would be a methyl group attached to something deshielded. Like a carbonyl. So that's the acetyl group. The aromatic signals are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That would be consistent with a para-substituted benzene, perhaps with substituents leading to two sets of two equivalent protons each.

Wait, but in that structure, if the substituents are para, then the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets. Let me think: in para-substituted benzene, the substituents are opposite each other, so the ring has two sets of protons. Each substituent is in a position that causes the adjacent (ortho) protons to be equivalent, and the other two (para to substituent) to be another set.

Wait, but wait, if there are two substituents in para positions, each being different groups (like -COCH3 and -X), then the ring would have four different protons. Because each substituent is different, the ring wouldn't have symmetry. Hmm, but that would complicate the NMR.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are in the para position, and both are the same. But no, because one is a carbonyl group and the other is a halogen. So substituents are different.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. If the substituents are -COCH3 and -X, and they are para to each other, then the ring would have symmetry along the axis connecting the two substituents. So the two substituents are in para positions, making the molecule symmetric. So the aromatic protons would be in two sets of equivalent protons.

Wait, in that case, each substituent is para, so the ring has two substituents opposite each other. For example, imagine looking at the ring with the two substituents at 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock. Then the protons at 1 and 2 o'clock would be ortho to the substituents, and the protons at 4 and 5 o'clock would be meta to them. But wait, in such a case, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Let me think, for para substitution, the ortho protons are equivalent, and the meta protons are equivalent.

Wait no, perhaps not. Let me think again. If two substituents are para, each being different, then the ring's symmetry is such that the substituents are opposite each other, but each substituent is unique. So the molecule would actually have a plane of symmetry through the two substituents. So the protons adjacent to substituent A (say, at position 2 and 6) would be equivalent, and the protons adjacent to substituent B (at position 4 and 8, but wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So substituents are at 1 and 4. Then, the protons at 2 and 6 (ortho to substituent 1) are equivalent. The protons at 3 and 5 (ortho to substituent 4) are equivalent. So this would give two sets of doublets in the NMR. Each set integrating to 2H each. So, for the aromatic region, two doublets, each 2H. That matches option C, which has 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). So that's looking promising.

Additionally, the acetyl group's methyl (COCH3) would show up as a singlet around δ 2.3 ppm, as in option C. So that would fit.

But wait, in the FTIR, there's a carbonyl peak and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the structure must have a carbonyl group (like the acetyl) and a halogen attached to the ring.

So looking at option C: the NMR shows two doublets for the aromatic protons, a singlet for the methyl group. That fits the scenario.

What about the other options? Let's check.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). The singlet at 9.9 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. But the substituent would be a -CHO. But earlier analysis suggested that substituent would only add 1 carbon, making the total 7 carbons. Plus, the IR has a carbonyl, which in this case is the aldehyde. But the problem is, the substituent is a halogen, so option A would have a halogen substituent elsewhere. Wait, if the structure is benzaldehyde with a halogen substituent, but that would give 7 + 1 (halogen) carbons? No, because the substituent is -CHO (1 carbon) and -X (no carbon), so the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) +1 (CHO) =7. But the question says 8, so this can't be. So option A is out.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). These look like two sets of doublets, possibly from -OCH2CH2O- or something similar, but that would be in a cyclic structure, maybe a dioxane or similar. But the IR here doesn't match; the carbonyl would be in a ketone or ester, but this NMR doesn't show any carbonyl-related protons. So B is probably incorrect.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 ppm singlet suggests an aromatic proton in a unique environment, perhaps para to something. The 4.8 and 4.6 are likely from something like an ether group, maybe OCH2 groups. The 1.3 ppm is a singlet for 2H, perhaps a CH2 group attached to something. This structure doesn't immediately fit with the required substituents of carbonyl and halogen. So D is probably out.

So the only option that fits is C, which has the aromatic doublets, and a singlet for the methyl group attached to a carbonyl. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. The benzene ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., -COCH₃, an acetyl group), and the other is a halogen (-X). The total number of carbons is 8, with the benzene ring contributing 6 carbons and the substituents contributing 2 carbons (from the acetyl group).

The structure is likely para-substituted, meaning the acetyl group and halogen are opposite each other on the benzene ring. This symmetry results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons: one set ortho to the acetyl group and another set ortho to the halogen. These protons appear as two doublets in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum. The methyl group of the acetyl group (-COCH₃) appears as a singlet around 2.3 ppm due to the deshielding effect of the carbonyl group.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, characteristic of an aldehyde proton. However, the total number of carbons would be 7 (benzene + -CHO), which contradicts the given total of 8 carbons. Thus, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Shows signals consistent with a structure containing ether groups (-OCH₂CH₂O-), but there is no evidence of a carbonyl group in the NMR data, which is required based on the FTIR spectrum. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Displays two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm), consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the methyl group of the acetyl group. This option matches the expected structure and spectral data.
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm, likely from an aromatic proton in a unique environment, and signals for ether groups. However, there is no evidence of a carbonyl group in the NMR data, which is required. This option is incorrect.

The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, as it aligns with the structure of a para-substituted benzene ring with an acetyl group and a halogen substituent.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about an organic chemistry problem. Hmm, let's try to think it through step by step. 

The question says: We have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. We need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Alright, let's break it down. First, let's figure out the structure of the compound. It's a di-substituted benzene ring (since it's a 6-membered aromatic ring), meaning there are two substituents on the ring. The total number of carbons is 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must add up to 2 carbons. Wait, no, because each substituent adds their own carbons. If each substituent is one carbon, that would add 2, making 8 total. But wait, substituents could be more than one carbon. Wait, wait, let me think. The benzene ring has 6 carbons, the substituents add up to 2 more, so each substituent is one carbon? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other is a single carbon? Or perhaps one substituent is a methyl group and the other is something else.

Wait, but the FTIR data says there's a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. Wait, but that would be two substituents: one carbonyl, one halogen. But wait, the carbonyl would be in a substituent. Let's think: the substituents on the benzene can be groups like -COOR, -COOH, etc., or perhaps a ketone group, but ketone groups are less common on aromatic rings as substituents because they're not very good electron-withdrawing groups. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde group? No, aldehydes are typically at the end of chains. Wait, another possibility is that the carbonyl is part of a substituent that's attached to the ring. For example, a ketone group as R-CO-R', but that would require more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. So benzene with two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group, the other is a halogen. Let's think of possible substituents. For example, one substituent could be a -COOH group (carboxylic acid), which has a carbonyl. Another could be a halogen like -Cl, -Br, etc. But wait, that would make the substituents each one carbon, which would add up to 2 carbons, making the total 8. Wait, the benzene is 6 carbons, substituents add 2, so 8 in total. That makes sense.

Wait, but let me confirm: if the benzene has two substituents, each one carbon, the total carbons would be 6 + 2 = 8. Yep. So substituents are -X (halogen) and -COOH (carboxylic acid), or maybe another carbonyl group like -CHO (aldehyde), but that would be possible too.

Alternatively, one substituent could be a ketone group, but that's more like R-CO-R', which is two substituents, but perhaps not. Wait, maybe the substituents are more complex. Let's think: if one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group that has more than one carbon. Wait, but the total carbons are 8. Let me calculate: benzene (6) + substituents (2) = 8. So each substituent is one carbon, or one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero. No, substituents have to be attached, so each must contribute at least one carbon. Hmm, so maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group with two carbons, like an acetyl group (CH3CO-), but that would add two carbons. Then the other substituent would be a halogen, one carbon. So benzene has 6, substituents: 2 (from acetyl) + 1 (from Cl, for example) = 3. 6+3=9, which is more than 8. So that can't be. 

Wait, perhaps the substituents are each one carbon. So, one is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, but that's not possible because a ketone substituent on benzene would be like a C=O attached, but that would require the substituent to be R-CO-. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl oxygen with another group attached. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group like an ester or ketone, and a halogen. Let me think about the possible structures. For example, if the substituents are a -COOH group and a -Cl. That would add two substituents, each with one carbon (the COOH has two oxygen but the carbon is one attached to the ring). So, benzene with -COOH and -Cl substituents: that's possible. But wait, does that give the correct NMR signals?

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group like an acetyl group. For example, benzene with an acetyl group (-COCH3) and a halogen. Then, the substituents would be -COCH3 (three carbons) and -X (one carbon), so total substituents: 4 carbons. 6+4=10, which is more than 8. So that's not right.

Hmm, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen, each with one carbon. So, benzene with -COOH and -Cl. That's 6 + 2 =8 carbons. Because benzene has 6, each substituent is one carbon? Wait, the COOH group is -COOH, which has two oxygen but the substituent attached to the ring is the carboxylic acid group, which is -COOH. The substituent is -COOH, which is a group where the ring is attached to a carbon, and that carbon is connected to another oxygen. So, the substituent has two carbons? No, wait. Wait, the substituent is a carboxylic acid group, which is -COOH. The carbon in the substituent is one carbon (the one attached to the ring). So the substituent adds one carbon. Similarly, the halogen substituent (like Cl) is one substituent with one carbon (itself, but actually Cl is an atom, not a carbon. Wait a minute, wait! Halogens are atoms, not carbons. Oh, so the substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br), but that's an atom, not a carbon. So the substituent on the benzene is an X atom, which doesn't contribute a carbon. So in this case, the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group (with one carbon) and a halogen (which is an atom, so no carbon). So, the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (from substituent) =7. But the question says 8 carbons in total. So that doesn't add up.

Wait, that's a problem. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the substituent. Let's rethink. If the substituent is something else. Maybe the substituent is an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group but perhaps more carbons. Wait, but the total is 8.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl-containing group that itself has more carbons. For example, benzaldehyde has a substituent of -CHO, which is one carbon (the aldehyde). So substituent adds one carbon. Another substituent is a halogen, which doesn't add any carbons. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) +1 (CHO) =7, which is less than 8. So not matching.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think again. The compound has 8 carbons in total. The benzene ring has 6, so the substituents must add 2 carbons. So substituents can be two groups each contributing one carbon, or one group contributing two carbons and the other nothing. But that can't be because substituents must be attached. Wait, another possibility: one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a methyl group. Because methyl is a substituent with one carbon. So substituents are -COOH and -CH3. Wait, but that would be two substituents each adding one carbon. So total substituents add 2 carbons, making total 8. That could work.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl group as well as an aromatic-halogen bond. So, if the substituents are -COOH and -CH3, there's no halogen. So that can't be right because the IR shows a halogen bond.

Ah, I see. So the substituents must include both a carbonyl group and a halogen. But the problem is that the halogen is an atom, not a carbon. So the substituents are one carbonyl group (which may add one or more carbons) and a halogen (which adds zero carbons). So, total carbons would be benzene (6) + substituents (from carbonyl group) =8. So substituent from carbonyl group must add 2 carbons. So the substituent is two carbons. For example, an acetyl group (-COCH3). So substituent is -COCH3, which is two carbons (the C=O and CH3).

So, substituents are -COCH3 and -X (halogen, one substituent). So total substituents on benzene: one is -COCH3 (two carbons), the other is -X (no carbons). So total carbons: 6 +2 =8. That works.

So the structure would be benzene ring with an acetyl group (-COCH3) and a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.) substituent. So, the substituents are at the para positions, meta, or ortho positions.

Now, looking at the NMR options. Let's think about the expected signals.

In the structure where there's a benzene ring with an acetyl group and a halogen substituent, the NMR would show:

- The aromatic protons. Depending on the substituents' positions, the aromatic protons will split into different signals. For example, if the substituents are para, the ring is symmetrical, so perhaps two sets of protons. Alternatively, if they are meta, the pattern would be different.

Wait, but the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Let's assume they are in the para position, making it a symmetric structure. So the two substituents are opposite each other.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in two sets: the ones next to the substituents (ortho) and those opposite (meta). Wait, if substituents are para, then the aromatic protons would have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, the two ortho to the acetyl group and the two ortho to the halogen. Or, maybe each substituent is in a position that creates two equivalent sets. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are meta to each other, leading to more complex splitting. Wait, but without knowing the exact positions, perhaps the key is to look for the carbonyl group's NMR signals.

Wait, the acetyl group (-COCH3) would have a CH3 group attached to the carbonyl. The CH3 would be deshielded and appear around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm, typically as a triplet or a singlet if no splitting. But looking at the options:

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). So the 2.3 ppm is a singlet of 3H, which would be a methyl group attached to something deshielded. Like a carbonyl. So that's the acetyl group. The aromatic signals are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That would be consistent with a para-substituted benzene, perhaps with substituents leading to two sets of two equivalent protons each.

Wait, but in that structure, if the substituents are para, then the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets. Let me think: in para-substituted benzene, the substituents are opposite each other, so the ring has two sets of protons. Each substituent is in a position that causes the adjacent (ortho) protons to be equivalent, and the other two (para to substituent) to be another set.

Wait, but wait, if there are two substituents in para positions, each being different groups (like -COCH3 and -X), then the ring would have four different protons. Because each substituent is different, the ring wouldn't have symmetry. Hmm, but that would complicate the NMR.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are in the para position, and both are the same. But no, because one is a carbonyl group and the other is a halogen. So substituents are different.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. If the substituents are -COCH3 and -X, and they are para to each other, then the ring would have symmetry along the axis connecting the two substituents. So the two substituents are in para positions, making the molecule symmetric. So the aromatic protons would be in two sets of equivalent protons.

Wait, in that case, each substituent is para, so the ring has two substituents opposite each other. For example, imagine looking at the ring with the two substituents at 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock. Then the protons at 1 and 2 o'clock would be ortho to the substituents, and the protons at 4 and 5 o'clock would be meta to them. But wait, in such a case, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Let me think, for para substitution, the ortho protons are equivalent, and the meta protons are equivalent.

Wait no, perhaps not. Let me think again. If two substituents are para, each being different, then the ring's symmetry is such that the substituents are opposite each other, but each substituent is unique. So the molecule would actually have a plane of symmetry through the two substituents. So the protons adjacent to substituent A (say, at position 2 and 6) would be equivalent, and the protons adjacent to substituent B (at position 4 and 8, but wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So substituents are at 1 and 4. Then, the protons at 2 and 6 (ortho to substituent 1) are equivalent. The protons at 3 and 5 (ortho to substituent 4) are equivalent. So this would give two sets of doublets in the NMR. Each set integrating to 2H each. So, for the aromatic region, two doublets, each 2H. That matches option C, which has 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). So that's looking promising.

Additionally, the acetyl group's methyl (COCH3) would show up as a singlet around δ 2.3 ppm, as in option C. So that would fit.

But wait, in the FTIR, there's a carbonyl peak and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the structure must have a carbonyl group (like the acetyl) and a halogen attached to the ring.

So looking at option C: the NMR shows two doublets for the aromatic protons, a singlet for the methyl group. That fits the scenario.

What about the other options? Let's check.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). The singlet at 9.9 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. But the substituent would be a -CHO. But earlier analysis suggested that substituent would only add 1 carbon, making the total 7 carbons. Plus, the IR has a carbonyl, which in this case is the aldehyde. But the problem is, the substituent is a halogen, so option A would have a halogen substituent elsewhere. Wait, if the structure is benzaldehyde with a halogen substituent, but that would give 7 + 1 (halogen) carbons? No, because the substituent is -CHO (1 carbon) and -X (no carbon), so the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) +1 (CHO) =7. But the question says 8, so this can't be. So option A is out.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). These look like two sets of doublets, possibly from -OCH2CH2O- or something similar, but that would be in a cyclic structure, maybe a dioxane or similar. But the IR here doesn't match; the carbonyl would be in a ketone or ester, but this NMR doesn't show any carbonyl-related protons. So B is probably incorrect.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 ppm singlet suggests an aromatic proton in a unique environment, perhaps para to something. The 4.8 and 4.6 are likely from something like an ether group, maybe OCH2 groups. The 1.3 ppm is a singlet for 2H, perhaps a CH2 group attached to something. This structure doesn't immediately fit with the required substituents of carbonyl and halogen. So D is probably out.

So the only option that fits is C, which has the aromatic doublets, and a singlet for the methyl group attached to a carbonyl. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. The benzene ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., -COCH₃, an acetyl group), and the other is a halogen (-X). The total number of carbons is 8, with the benzene ring contributing 6 carbons and the substituents contributing 2 carbons (from the acetyl group).

The structure is likely para-substituted, meaning the acetyl group and halogen are opposite each other on the benzene ring. This symmetry results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons: one set ortho to the acetyl group and another set ortho to the halogen. These protons appear as two doublets in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum. The methyl group of the acetyl group (-COCH₃) appears as a singlet around 2.3 ppm due to the deshielding effect of the carbonyl group.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, characteristic of an aldehyde proton. However, the total number of carbons would be 7 (benzene + -CHO), which contradicts the given total of 8 carbons. Thus, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Shows signals consistent with a structure containing ether groups (-OCH₂CH₂O-), but there is no evidence of a carbonyl group in the NMR data, which is required based on the FTIR spectrum. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Displays two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm), consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the methyl group of the acetyl group. This option matches the expected structure and spectral data.
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm, likely from an aromatic proton in a unique environment, and signals for ether groups. However, there is no evidence of a carbonyl group in the NMR data, which is required. This option is incorrect.

The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, as it aligns with the structure of a para-substituted benzene ring with an acetyl group and a halogen substituent.

Answer: C
