Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective. Hmm, let's see. The question is about relativistic space travel, right? So I remember that when objects move at speeds very close to the speed of light, time dilation and length contraction come into play.

So the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really, really fast. The distance to Earth must be considered, but wait, the question is from the astronaut's perspective, so maybe I need to think about length contraction.

Wait, the astronaut is on the spacecraft, so for them, the distance to Earth would be shorter because of length contraction. Oh right, from their frame of reference, the Earth is moving towards them, and the distance is contracted.

But wait, I don't know the actual distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh right, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. Wait, but I think the exact figure isn't given in the problem. Hmm, maybe the problem expects me to ignore the exact distance and just calculate based on the given speed and age of the astronaut.

Wait, the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years. So if the astronaut is 22 years old, they have about 128 more years left. But the question is about whether they'll live long enough to reach Earth.

Wait, but let me think again. The key here is to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Because time dilation affects the astronaut's own clock. So the proper time (tau) is the time experienced by the astronaut. The time measured in the Earth's frame (let's say t) would be longer due to time dilation.

But I think the formula for time dilation is t = gamma * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Wait no, wait. If the astronaut is moving at speed v relative to Earth, then the proper time (tau) is the time experienced by the astronaut, which is shorter than the time measured in Earth's frame (t) by a factor of gamma.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. In this case, the spaceship's frame is moving, so the time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time.

Wait, actually, the proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (departure and arrival) happen at the same place. So for the astronaut, the departure and arrival happen at the same location (the spaceship), so tau is the proper time. But for Earth, the spaceship is moving, so Earth would measure a longer time.

Wait, but the question is about how long does it take from the astronaut's perspective. So maybe I should calculate the proper time.

Wait, but wait. So the distance from Earth to the Large Magellanic Cloud is roughly 160,000 light-years. But from the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted. The length contraction formula is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (distance in Earth's frame) and L is the length in the spaceship's frame.

So L0 is about 160,000 light-years. Let me calculate the gamma factor first. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.99999987c, that's really close to c. So gamma is going to be very large.

Wait, v is 0.99999987 c, so let's calculate beta = v/c = 0.99999987. So beta is approximately 0.99999987.

Calculating gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)

Let me compute 1 - beta^2.

beta^2 = (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 0.99999974 (since (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is small; but maybe I should calculate it more accurately).

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So square of that is approximately:

(1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a² ≈ 1 - 2a when a is tiny. So a = 1.3e-7, so 2a = 2.6e-7. So 1 - 2a ≈ 0.99999974.

Wait, but let's compute beta^2 more accurately.

Wait, 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Let me compute (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. The last term is negligible, so approximately 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - beta^2 = 1 - (approx) 0.99999974 = 2.6e-7. So 1 - beta^2 ≈ 2.6e-7.

Then sqrt(1 - beta^2) is the square root of 2.6e-7. Let me compute that.

The square root of 2.6e-7 is approximately sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5.

Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612. 1e-3.5 is 1e-3.5 = 3.16e-4.

So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

Wait, wait, 1e-3.5 is 10^(-3.5) = 10^(-3) * 10^(-0.5) = 0.001 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162e-4.

So sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.09e-4.

So then gamma is 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1968. So gamma ≈ 1968.

Wait, but wait, that's a huge gamma. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. Let me compute beta^2 as (0.99999987)^2.

Using more precise calculation:

(0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14. The last term is negligible.

So beta^2 ≈ 0.99999974.

Thus 1 - beta^2 ≈ 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5 ≈ as before.

Wait, 2.6e-7 is 2.6 * 10^-7. The square root of that is sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = approx 1.612 * 1e-3.5.

Wait, sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 3.162e-4.

So 1.612 * 3.162e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1965.19... approximately 1965. So about 1965.

Hmm, okay, that's a huge gamma. So the time dilation is significant.

But from the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted.

Wait, the proper length (in Earth's frame) is L0 = 160,000 light-years.

In the spaceship's frame, the length is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - beta^2) ≈ L0 * (5.09e-4).

So L ≈ 160,000 light-years * 5.09e-4.

Let me compute that: 160,000 * 5.09e-4 = 160,000 * 0.000509 = 81.44 light-years.

So from the spaceship's perspective, Earth is only 81.44 light-years away.

Wait, but the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c. So the time experienced by the astronaut is the distance L divided by v.

Time tau = L / v = (81.44 light-years) / (0.99999987c).

But since light-years is distance and c is speed, the time in years is (light-years) / (fraction of c) → light-years / (c) → years, because light travels one light-year per year.

So, (81.44) / (0.99999987) ≈ 81.44 / 1 ≈ 81.44 years.

Wait, that's about 81 years. So the astronaut would experience about 81 years of time.

But wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. 81 years later would make them 103 years old. But the average lifetime is 150 years, so they should live long enough.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the average lifetime is 150 solar years. So the astronaut has about 150 - 22 = 128 years left. But if the journey takes 81 years, they'll reach Earth alive.

So the options are:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years.

So the correct answer would be C) 81 years.

But wait, did I make any mistake? Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, L0 is 160,000 light-years. L = L0 * sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 160,000 * 5.09e-4 ≈ 81.44 light-years.

Time tau = L / v = 81.44 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 81.44 years.

Yes, that looks right.

So the astronaut would experience about 81 years of time during the trip. So the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), which is extremely close to the speed of light. From the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth is contracted due to length contraction.

### Step 1: Length Contraction
The proper length (distance in Earth's frame) is approximately \( L_0 = 160,000 \, \text{light-years} \). The contracted length \( L \) in the astronaut's frame is given by:

\[
L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

Given \( v = 0.99999987c \), we calculate \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} = 0.99999987 \). Then:

\[
1 - \beta^2 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-7}
\]

\[
\sqrt{1 - \beta^2} \approx 5.09 \times 10^{-4}
\]

Thus:

\[
L \approx L_0 \times 5.09 \times 10^{-4} = 160,000 \, \text{light-years} \times 5.09 \times 10^{-4} \approx 81.44 \, \text{light-years}
\]

### Step 2: Time Experienced by the Astronaut
The time experienced by the astronaut (\( \tau \)) is the contracted distance \( L \) divided by the spacecraft's speed \( v \):

\[
\tau = \frac{L}{v} = \frac{81.44 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c}
\]

Since light travels 1 light-year in 1 year, the time is approximately:

\[
\tau \approx \frac{81.44}{0.99999987} \approx 81.44 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the journey. Since the astronaut is 22 years old and the average lifetime is 150 years, they will live long enough to reach Earth.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A)** Incorrect. The astronaut will not die before reaching Earth.
- **B)** Incorrect. The time is not 72 years.
- **C)** Correct. The time experienced by the astronaut is approximately 81 years.
- **D)** Incorrect. The time is not 77 years.

The length contraction formula is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (distance in Earth's frame) and L is the length in the spaceship's frame.

So L0 is about 160,000 light-years. Let me calculate the gamma factor first. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.99999987c, that's really close to c. So gamma is going to be very large.

Wait, v is 0.99999987 c, so let's calculate beta = v/c = 0.99999987. So beta is approximately 0.99999987.

Calculating gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)

Let me compute 1 - beta^2.

beta^2 = (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 0.99999974 (since (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is small; but maybe I should calculate it more accurately).

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So square of that is approximately:

(1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a² ≈ 1 - 2a when a is tiny. So a = 1.3e-7, so 2a = 2.6e-7. So 1 - 2a ≈ 0.99999974.

Wait, but let's compute beta^2 more accurately.

Wait, 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Let me compute (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. The last term is negligible, so approximately 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - beta^2 = 1 - (approx) 0.99999974 = 2.6e-7. So 1 - beta^2 ≈ 2.6e-7.

Then sqrt(1 - beta^2) is the square root of 2.6e-7. Let me compute that.

The square root of 2.6e-7 is approximately sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5.

Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612. 1e-3.5 is 1e-3.5 = 3.16e-4.

So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

Wait, wait, 1e-3.5 is 10^(-3.5) = 10^(-3) * 10^(-0.5) = 0.001 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162e-4.

So sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.09e-4.

So then gamma is 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1968. So gamma ≈ 1968.

Wait, but wait, that's a huge gamma. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. Let me compute beta^2 as (0.99999987)^2.

Using more precise calculation:

(0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14. The last term is negligible.

So beta^2 ≈ 0.99999974.

Thus 1 - beta^2 ≈ 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5 ≈ as before.

Wait, 2.6e-7 is 2.6 * 10^-7. The square root of that is sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = approx 1.612 * 1e-3.5.

Wait, sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 3.162e-4.

So 1.612 * 3.162e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1965.19... approximately 1965. So about 1965.

Hmm, okay, that's a huge gamma. So the time dilation is significant.

But from the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted.

Wait, the proper length (in Earth's frame) is L0 = 160,000 light-years.

In the spaceship's frame, the length is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - beta^2) ≈ L0 * (5.09e-4).

So L ≈ 160,000 light-years * 5.09e-4.

Let me compute that: 160,000 * 5.09e-4 = 160,000 * 0.000509 = 81.44 light-years.

So from the spaceship's perspective, Earth is only 81.44 light-years away.

Wait, but the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c. So the time experienced by the astronaut is the distance L divided by v.

Time tau = L / v = (81.44 light-years) / (0.99999987c).

But since light-years is distance and c is speed, the time in years is (light-years) / (fraction of c) → light-years / (c) → years, because light travels one light-year per year.

So, (81.44) / (0.99999987) ≈ 81.44 / 1 ≈ 81.44 years.

Wait, that's about 81 years. So the astronaut would experience about 81 years of time.

But wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. 81 years later would make them 103 years old. But the average lifetime is 150 years, so they should live long enough.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the average lifetime is 150 solar years. So the astronaut has about 150 - 22 = 128 years left. But if the journey takes 81 years, they'll reach Earth alive.

So the options are:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years.

So the correct answer would be C) 81 years.

But wait, did I make any mistake? Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, L0 is 160,000 light-years. L = L0 * sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 160,000 * 5.09e-4 ≈ 81.44 light-years.

Time tau = L / v = 81.44 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 81.44 years.

Yes, that looks right.

So the astronaut would experience about 81 years of time during the trip. So the correct answer is C.


To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), which is extremely close to the speed of light. From the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth is contracted due to length contraction.

### Step 1: Length Contraction
The proper length (distance in Earth's frame) is approximately \( L_0 = 160,000 \, \text{light-years} \). The contracted length \( L \) in the astronaut's frame is given by:

\[
L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

Given \( v = 0.99999987c \), we calculate \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} = 0.99999987 \). Then:

\[
1 - \beta^2 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-7}
\]

\[
\sqrt{1 - \beta^2} \approx 5.09 \times 10^{-4}
\]

Thus:

\[
L \approx L_0 \times 5.09 \times 10^{-4} = 160,000 \, \text{light-years} \times 5.09 \times 10^{-4} \approx 81.44 \, \text{light-years}
\]

### Step 2: Time Experienced by the Astronaut
The time experienced by the astronaut (\( \tau \)) is the contracted distance \( L \) divided by the spacecraft's speed \( v \):

\[
\tau = \frac{L}{v} = \frac{81.44 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c}
\]

Since light travels 1 light-year in 1 year, the time is approximately:

\[
\tau \approx \frac{81.44}{0.99999987} \approx 81.44 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the journey. Since the astronaut is 22 years old and the average lifetime is 150 years, they will live long enough to reach Earth.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A)** Incorrect. The astronaut will not die before reaching Earth.
- **B)** Incorrect. The time is not 72 years.
- **C)** Correct. The time experienced by the astronaut is approximately 81 years.
- **D)** Incorrect. The time is not 77 years.

Answer: C
