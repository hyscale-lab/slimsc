Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like dibromides) are treated with a strong base like KOH, it usually leads to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So, this should produce an alkene as product 1.

The product is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, that's a carbonyl group, right? So maybe I was wrong about elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide. KOH is a strong base, maybe it's doing an SN2 on each bromide. But adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a rigid molecule. Each Br is on adjacent carbons, so perhaps two elimination reactions happen, but wait, substitution would lead to two hydroxyl groups. But then the IR shows carbonyl. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not substitution but elimination forming a double bond and then further reaction.

Wait, another possibility: when a vicinal dihalide is treated with a base, it can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But the IR at 1720 suggests maybe an ester or ketone. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The initial product after KOH is said to have an IR peak at 1720. That's a carbonyl, so maybe the dihalide is undergoing some kind of substitution to form a ketone.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane could have each Br on adjacent carbons. If each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but that would give a diol. But the IR doesn't show O-H stretches (like broad peaks around 3300), but perhaps the product is different.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming an alkene. For example, when two vicinal bromides lose HBr, forming a double bond. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl peak? That doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is substituted by an -O⁻ group, but then it would be deprotonated. Or maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters, which I don't think is the case here.

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution to form an epoxide. But the IR for epoxides typically doesn't have a peak at 1720; the C-O stretch is around 1200-1300. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the NMR. The product 1's 1H NMR has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So, 2H at 4.79 ppm. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or an alcohol. But wait, the IR has 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. Oh wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone. How?

Wait, maybe the structure is that the two Brs are on adjacent carbons of adamantane. Heating with KOH could cause elimination, forming a double bond. But then, perhaps further reaction occurs. Wait, what's the structure of adamantane? It's a diamondoid, like a four-fused cyclohexane rings in a chair-like structure.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane losing two HBr molecules would form 1,3-diene? No, wait, that's not possible because 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on adjacent carbons, perhaps. Let me think: 1 and 3 positions on a diamondoid structure. So, if each Br is on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons.

Wait, but elimination of two HBr from vicinal dihalide would form a double bond. So, product 1 would be an adamantane with a double bond between C1 and C3? But that seems structurally challenging because of the diamondoid's structure.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Product 1's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's around where an alcohol or an ether CH2 group would appear. But with 10H between 2.41-2.23, which is typical for adamantane's bridgehead CH2 groups. And 1.94 ppm for 2H, maybe another CH2.

Wait, another angle: When a dihalide reacts with KOH, maybe it's a substitution to form a carbonyl group. Like, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- group, leading to a diepoxide or something else. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that typically requires amines.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show 1720. Hmm, getting stuck here.

Wait, maybe the reaction is more like a thermal elimination where each Br is removed, forming a double bond. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → heating with KOH → 1,3-adamantadiene? No, that doesn't seem right because the NMR doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution, but that would require a good leaving group. So, each Br is replaced by an -OH group, making a diol. But then the NMR would have peaks for OH groups, which are usually broad. The NMR doesn't mention broad peaks, so maybe they're exchanged with D2O, but the question says "excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent," so the non-exchanging peaks are considered. Wait, the NMR has 4.79 (2H), which might be a methylene group next to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the KOH is causing a nucleophilic substitution, but since adamantane is a rigid structure, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O⁻, leading to a diepoxide when two OH groups are formed and then lose a water. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is not acting as a base but as a nucleophile. For each Br, substitution occurs, but I'm not sure about the product.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. Epoxides have two adjacent oxygen atoms. The NMR would show a triplet or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. How? Maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH to form a diol, which then undergoes some kind of oxidation. But that's probably not the case here because KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent.

Wait, let me think about the IR. At 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl. So it's either an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an acid. But in the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (2H) is a CH2 group. In a ketone, the carbonyl is adjacent to R groups, but there's no CH2. Hmm, unless it's an ester. For example, an ester group has a carbonyl (around 1720) and adjacent OCH2 groups. So, maybe product 1 is an ester.

But how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane become an ester upon heating with KOH? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that requires an ester with two leaving groups.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide, and the IR is not for carbonyl. Wait, but the IR says 1720, which is carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on the first step. Let me try to think of each step and see if I can find a pattern.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + excess KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720, NMR as given.

Step 2: Product 1 heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide → product 2.

Step 3: Product 2 treated with ozone at -78°C, then dimethylsulfide → product 3.

The question is about the NMR of product 3.

If I can figure out what product 3 is, then I can find the coupling pattern.

Let me backtrack. Product 3 is formed after ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

If product 3's NMR is being considered, the most deshielded hydrogen would be next to a carbonyl, perhaps.

But wait, the problem says 'excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent.' So, for example, any -OH protons would exchange and not be observed.

So, after ozonolysis, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. If it's a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. But depending on the structure, the resulting fragments might have different environments.

But let's think about the earlier steps.

Product 1's NMR: 4.79 (2H). Let's think of this as a CH2 group adjacent to oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is likely the adamantane bridgehead CH2 groups. 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2, perhaps adjacent to the oxygen.

The IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, so product 1 must be a ketone, ester, or aldehyde. But it's a solid, which is more typical for esters or ketones.

Wait, another possibility: Product 1 is an epoxide. Epoxides have a three-membered ring with two oxygen atoms. The IR of an epoxide doesn't have a strong carbonyl peak, unless it's a cyclic ester (which is a lactone, but that's a different scenario).

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution to form an ether. If each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that doesn't directly lead to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement, but that requires vicinal diol and acid, which doesn't seem to apply here.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. But how would that form from a dihalide with KOH?

Wait, let me think about the reaction again. KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Perhaps it's displacing each Br with an -O- group. But in such a case, it would form an oxide, perhaps a cyclic structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a double elimination, forming a double bond and then some further reaction. Let me think, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two equivalents of HBr, it would form a diene. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a triple bond? Unlikely, as KOH usually doesn't promote that without a strong base or specific conditions.

Wait, another approach: What functional group has a carbonyl and a CH2 group near it?

For example, a ketone would have R-CO-R', but that doesn't directly explain the NMR. Alternatively, an ester has R-O-CO-R', which would have the OCH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, let's imagine product 1 is an ester. So, perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen-containing group, such as an ester.

But how would that happen from a dihalide? Maybe via a substitution, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone. If the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination could form a double bond, but if further oxidation occurs, perhaps to a ketone. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent, so that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the dihalide is converted into a gem-diol, which then undergoes some rearrangement. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via a elimination followed by some keto-enol tautomerism or rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Since I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed to the next steps, assuming that product 1 is an epoxide or a ketone, and see where that leads me.

Moving on, product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1, if it's a carbonyl compound, might undergo some kind of acylation.

Wait, product 1 is a ketone. When a ketone is treated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, maybe it's undergoing a Claisen or aldol condensation. Alternatively, if product 1 has an ester group, it could undergo some acylation.

But wait, another thought: If product 1 is an epoxide, then treating it with a Lewis acid might open it. For example, acid-catalyzed ring opening of an epoxide. But without knowing the structure, it's difficult.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a diol, which when treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps undergoes some elimination or rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diester, which when treated with a Lewis acid might form an acylium ion or something else.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis tends to break double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have carbonyls where the double bonds were in product 2.

If the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, which would split into a triplet due to coupling with two adjacent Hs. But the options are more complicated.

Wait, the most deshielded H would likely be near an electronegative group or a carbonyl. So, in product 3, after ozonolysis, if the molecule has a carbonyl group, the Hs adjacent would be split based on their neighboring Hs.

Let me think: Ozonolysis of a diene would give two carbonyl groups. Suppose product 2 is a diene. Then product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, perhaps as two ketones or two aldehydes.

But depending on the structure of the diene, the resulting carbonyl groups would have different environments.

For example, if product 2 is a substituted cyclohexene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. The adjacent Hs would each couple with neighboring groups.

Wait, but the initial product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. So, product 2 is more likely to be a larger molecule, perhaps with a conjugated diene.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. Heating with Al(OiPr)3 (a Friedel-Crafts catalyst) might cause it to undergo some kind of alkylation or acylation, but without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. When treated with Al(OiPr)3, the epoxide might open, perhaps leading to a carbocation, which could rearrange or trap something.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think of the NMR of product 3.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3, not exchanging with D2O.

In ozonolysis, the breaking of the double bond would create carbonyl groups. So, perhaps the product 3 has carbonyl groups, and the Hs adjacent to them would be deshielded.

The coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring Hs and their splitting.

Suppose product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl. Each H in CH2 would be split by the neighboring Hs.

Wait, if it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, and each of those Hs is next to another CH2 group, each could be split into a triplet. But the options suggest more complex splitting.

Alternatively, if the Hs are adjacent to two different sets of Hs, like a CH2 between two CH2 groups, each H might couple with two sets, leading to more splitting.

Wait, considering the options: A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

A triplet is n+1 where n=2, so two neighboring Hs. If a H is next to two Hs on one side and two on the other, it might be a triplet of triplets (each split into triplets), making a 3x3 =9 peak pattern, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, if a H is next to two Hs on one side and another two on another side, it might be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let's imagine product 3 has a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R. Then, the CH2 groups near the carbonyl would each have two Hs. Each H on the CH2 next to CO would be coupled with the adjacent CH2's Hs. So, each H on the first CH2 would see two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if they're also coupled with another set of Hs elsewhere, it could become more complex.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that a CH2 group is between two other CH2 groups, each H would be split by two neighboring Hs on each adjacent group. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is due to coupling with two different sets of Hs, each with two neighboring Hs. For example, each H is next to two Hs on one side and another two on the other.

In that case, the splitting would be (n+1)(m+1), where n and m are the number of neighboring Hs. If each coupling is with two Hs, then (2+1)(2+1)=9 peaks, which is a triplet of triplets. But that's option B.

Alternatively, if a H is next to two Hs on one side and one H on the other, it would be a triplet of doublets, which is not an option here.

Wait, but the most deshielded H would be the one closest to the carbonyl. So, perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and each H in that CH2 is coupled with the adjacent CH2 group's Hs. So, each H in the first CH2 would see two Hs from the adjacent CH2, making a triplet. But if the adjacent CH2 is itself coupled with another group, maybe it's split further.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, leading to a more complex coupling.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. However, based on the options, the most likely answer is a triplet of triplets, but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a pentet, which would be from coupling with four neighboring Hs. But that seems unlikely in this scenario.

Wait, another angle: The initial product 1's NMR has 4.79 (2H). If that's an OCH2 group, perhaps in an ester. Then, product 2 could be an enol ether or something else. Ozonolysis would break any double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and ozonolysis cleaves it into two carbonyl groups. The most deshielded H in product 3 would be from a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

If the structure is, say, RCOCH2CH2CO R, then each CH2 would have Hs adjacent to two Hs. So, each H would be a triplet. But perhaps if there's more coupling, like if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, each H would couple with two Hs on one side and two on the other.

Wait, example: Consider a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O-. Ozonolysis would break the central CH2-CH2 into two carbonyl groups. But that's not right because ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, not single bonds.

Wait, perhaps product 2 has a double bond. Ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyls.

Suppose product 2 is an alkene between two CH2 groups. Ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. So, each end would have a carbonyl. The resulting structure would have CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls.

In such a case, the Hs on CH2 adjacent to carbonyl would each be split by the neighboring Hs. Each H is next to two Hs on the same CH2, so triplet. But if they're also next to another group with Hs, perhaps more splitting.

Wait, if each CH2 is next to two Hs on the same group and two Hs on another group, perhaps from another CH2, then each H would have four neighboring Hs, leading to a quintet (n=4 → 5 peaks). But that's option D: pentet.

Wait, but in reality, each H is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2. So, each H would be a triplet due to the two neighboring Hs. Unless there's another coupling from elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups. Each H is coupled with the two from the same CH2 and perhaps two from another group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but let me think of a specific example. If the structure after ozonolysis is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O- (but that's not correct because ozonolysis doesn't form that). Wait, perhaps it's more like:

Original product 2: CH2-CH2 (double bond?), but no, wait. Ozonolysis of a diene would form two carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a diene, say, CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, giving two aldehydes.

So, product 3 would be OHC-CH2-CH2-CHO. Each CH2 group is between two aldehyde groups.

Wait, no, wait. Ozonolysis of a diene like 1,3-pentadiene would give two carbonyl groups. For example, ozonolysis of 1,3-butadiene gives two formaldehyde molecules. But in a longer chain, it would give two ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, but if product 2 is a cyclic diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. For example, cyclopentene would ozonolyze to give two pentanedial or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is bicyclic, such as adamantene with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls.

In any case, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyls would be deshielded. Each CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl would have Hs that are split by neighboring Hs.

Assuming each CH2 next to the carbonyl has two Hs, each H would be split into a triplet by the two adjacent Hs. But if these CH2 groups are also adjacent to another CH2 group, each H would be coupled with two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but if a H is only coupled with two Hs on one side, it would be a triplet. If it's coupled with two on one side and two on the other, each coupling would be a triplet, making a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if there are two different coupling constants, it might split into a triplet of triplets.

So, putting it all together, the most deshielded H in product 3 (adjacent to a carbonyl) would be part of a CH2 group that's coupled with two Hs on one side and another two Hs on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets. That would match option B.

Wait, but another possibility: the H might be part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2 group, which is next to another CH2, leading to more splitting. But I think in this case, the most likely is a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me imagine a specific structure. Suppose product 3 is a diketone, with a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R. Each CH2 is between two carbonyls. So, each H in the middle CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and possibly two Hs on the neighboring CH2.

Wait, but each H in the middle CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the same CH2 (making a triplet) and perhaps another two Hs from the adjacent CH2. So, each H would be a triplet for the same CH2 and another triplet for the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is with two different groups, each providing two Hs, leading to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of doublets.

I'm getting a bit confused. Another approach: look at the options and think what each implies.

Option B is a triplet of triplets. That would arise if a proton is coupled with two different groups, each of which has two protons. For example, if a CH2 group is next to a CH2 and another CH2, each with two protons, the splitting would be (2+1) for each coupling, leading to 3×3=9 peaks. But the question says 'the most deshielded hydrogen atom,' which would likely be a singlet if it's adjacent to no other Hs, but that's not the case here.

Wait, if the H is in a CH2 group next to another CH2 group, then each H in the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs in the adjacent CH2. That would be a triplet. If there's another adjacent group with Hs, like another CH2, then each H would be split again, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, for example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-R, but the central CH2 is between two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. Then, each H in the central CH2 would be split by the two Hs on each adjacent CH2. That would be (2+1) from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that each CH2 is only adjacent to one other CH2, it would be a triplet.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, the options are limited, and the most likely scenario is that the H is coupled with two different sets of two Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

---

### Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH
1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with excess KOH, leading to a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). This suggests that the reaction involves the formation of a carbonyl-containing compound. The NMR spectrum of product 1 includes peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41–2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) likely corresponds to a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom, while the peaks at 2.41–2.23 ppm and 1.94 ppm correspond to CH₂ groups characteristic of the adamantane structure. Based on the IR and NMR data, product 1 is likely an ester or a ketone.

---

### Step 2: Reaction of product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide
Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates a reaction involving the carbonyl group in product 1, such as a rearrangement or further functionalization. The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined, but it is inferred that product 2 contains a double bond, as ozonolysis is performed in the next step.

---

### Step 3: Ozonolysis of product 2
Ozonolysis is performed on product 2 at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, converting them into carbonyl groups. This suggests that product 2 contains a double bond, and product 3 is formed by breaking this bond to generate carbonyl-containing fragments.

---

### Step 4: NMR analysis of product 3
The question focuses on the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent. The most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyl groups deshield nearby hydrogens. 

In product 3, the hydrogen(s) adjacent to the carbonyl group would couple with neighboring hydrogens. If a hydrogen is adjacent to two hydrogens on one side and two hydrogens on the other, it would exhibit a **triplet of triplets** coupling pattern due to the splitting from two sets of neighboring hydrogens. This is consistent with the structure of product 3 after ozonolysis, where the deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group and flanked by other CH₂ groups.

---

### Critical Analysis of Options
- **A) Triplet**: This would occur if the hydrogen was coupled with only two neighboring hydrogens. However, the presence of additional coupling makes this less likely.
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This occurs when a hydrogen is coupled with two hydrogens on one side and two hydrogens on the other, leading to a complex splitting pattern. This is the most likely scenario based on the structure of product 3.
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would require coupling with one hydrogen on one side and two hydrogens on the other, which is less consistent with the expected structure.
- **D) Pentet**: This would occur if the hydrogen was coupled with four neighboring hydrogens, which is unlikely in this case.

---

### Conclusion
The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 exhibits a **triplet of triplets** coupling pattern due to its interaction with neighboring hydrogens. 

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like dibromides) are treated with a strong base like KOH, it usually leads to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So, this should produce an alkene as product 1.

The product is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, that's a carbonyl group, right? So maybe I was wrong about elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide. KOH is a strong base, maybe it's doing an SN2 on each bromide. But adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a rigid molecule. Each Br is on adjacent carbons, so perhaps two elimination reactions happen, but wait, substitution would lead to two hydroxyl groups. But then the IR shows carbonyl. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not substitution but elimination forming a double bond and then further reaction.

Wait, another possibility: when a vicinal dihalide is treated with a base, it can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But the IR at 1720 suggests maybe an ester or ketone. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The initial product after KOH is said to have an IR peak at 1720. That's a carbonyl, so maybe the dihalide is undergoing some kind of substitution to form a ketone.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane could have each Br on adjacent carbons. If each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but that would give a diol. But the IR doesn't show O-H stretches (like broad peaks around 3300), but perhaps the product is different.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming an alkene. For example, when two vicinal bromides lose HBr, forming a double bond. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl peak? That doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is substituted by an -O⁻ group, but then it would be deprotonated. Or maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters, which I don't think is the case here.

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution to form an epoxide. But the IR for epoxides typically doesn't have a peak at 1720; the C-O stretch is around 1200-1300. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the NMR. The product 1's 1H NMR has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So, 2H at 4.79 ppm. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or an alcohol. But wait, the IR has 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. Oh wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone. How?

Wait, maybe the structure is that the two Brs are on adjacent carbons of adamantane. Heating with KOH could cause elimination, forming a double bond. But then, perhaps further reaction occurs. Wait, what's the structure of adamantane? It's a diamondoid, like a four-fused cyclohexane rings in a chair-like structure.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane losing two HBr molecules would form 1,3-diene? No, wait, that's not possible because 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on adjacent carbons, perhaps. Let me think: 1 and 3 positions on a diamondoid structure. So, if each Br is on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons.

Wait, but elimination of two HBr from vicinal dihalide would form a double bond. So, product 1 would be an adamantane with a double bond between C1 and C3? But that seems structurally challenging because of the diamondoid's structure.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Product 1's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's around where an alcohol or an ether CH2 group would appear. But with 10H between 2.41-2.23, which is typical for adamantane's bridgehead CH2 groups. And 1.94 ppm for 2H, maybe another CH2.

Wait, another angle: When a dihalide reacts with KOH, maybe it's a substitution to form a carbonyl group. Like, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- group, leading to a diepoxide or something else. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that typically requires amines.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show 1720. Hmm, getting stuck here.

Wait, maybe the reaction is more like a thermal elimination where each Br is removed, forming a double bond. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → heating with KOH → 1,3-adamantadiene? No, that doesn't seem right because the NMR doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution, but that would require a good leaving group. So, each Br is replaced by an -OH group, making a diol. But then the NMR would have peaks for OH groups, which are usually broad. The NMR doesn't mention broad peaks, so maybe they're exchanged with D2O, but the question says "excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent," so the non-exchanging peaks are considered. Wait, the NMR has 4.79 (2H), which might be a methylene group next to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the KOH is causing a nucleophilic substitution, but since adamantane is a rigid structure, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O⁻, leading to a diepoxide when two OH groups are formed and then lose a water. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is not acting as a base but as a nucleophile. For each Br, substitution occurs, but I'm not sure about the product.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. Epoxides have two adjacent oxygen atoms. The NMR would show a triplet or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. How? Maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH to form a diol, which then undergoes some kind of oxidation. But that's probably not the case here because KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent.

Wait, let me think about the IR. At 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl. So it's either an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an acid. But in the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (2H) is a CH2 group. In a ketone, the carbonyl is adjacent to R groups, but there's no CH2. Hmm, unless it's an ester. For example, an ester group has a carbonyl (around 1720) and adjacent OCH2 groups. So, maybe product 1 is an ester.

But how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane become an ester upon heating with KOH? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that requires an ester with two leaving groups.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide, and the IR is not for carbonyl. Wait, but the IR says 1720, which is carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on the first step. Let me try to think of each step and see if I can find a pattern.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + excess KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720, NMR as given.

Step 2: Product 1 heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide → product 2.

Step 3: Product 2 treated with ozone at -78°C, then dimethylsulfide → product 3.

The question is about the NMR of product 3.

If I can figure out what product 3 is, then I can find the coupling pattern.

Let me backtrack. Product 3 is formed after ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

If product 3's NMR is being considered, the most deshielded hydrogen would be next to a carbonyl, perhaps.

But wait, the problem says 'excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent.' So, for example, any -OH protons would exchange and not be observed.

So, after ozonolysis, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. If it's a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. But depending on the structure, the resulting fragments might have different environments.

But let's think about the earlier steps.

Product 1's NMR: 4.79 (2H). Let's think of this as a CH2 group adjacent to oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is likely the adamantane bridgehead CH2 groups. 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2, perhaps adjacent to the oxygen.

The IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, so product 1 must be a ketone, ester, or aldehyde. But it's a solid, which is more typical for esters or ketones.

Wait, another possibility: Product 1 is an epoxide. Epoxides have a three-membered ring with two oxygen atoms. The IR of an epoxide doesn't have a strong carbonyl peak, unless it's a cyclic ester (which is a lactone, but that's a different scenario).

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution to form an ether. If each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that doesn't directly lead to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement, but that requires vicinal diol and acid, which doesn't seem to apply here.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. But how would that form from a dihalide with KOH?

Wait, let me think about the reaction again. KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Perhaps it's displacing each Br with an -O- group. But in such a case, it would form an oxide, perhaps a cyclic structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a double elimination, forming a double bond and then some further reaction. Let me think, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two equivalents of HBr, it would form a diene. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a triple bond? Unlikely, as KOH usually doesn't promote that without a strong base or specific conditions.

Wait, another approach: What functional group has a carbonyl and a CH2 group near it?

For example, a ketone would have R-CO-R', but that doesn't directly explain the NMR. Alternatively, an ester has R-O-CO-R', which would have the OCH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, let's imagine product 1 is an ester. So, perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen-containing group, such as an ester.

But how would that happen from a dihalide? Maybe via a substitution, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone. If the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination could form a double bond, but if further oxidation occurs, perhaps to a ketone. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent, so that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the dihalide is converted into a gem-diol, which then undergoes some rearrangement. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via a elimination followed by some keto-enol tautomerism or rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Since I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed to the next steps, assuming that product 1 is an epoxide or a ketone, and see where that leads me.

Moving on, product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1, if it's a carbonyl compound, might undergo some kind of acylation.

Wait, product 1 is a ketone. When a ketone is treated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, maybe it's undergoing a Claisen or aldol condensation. Alternatively, if product 1 has an ester group, it could undergo some acylation.

But wait, another thought: If product 1 is an epoxide, then treating it with a Lewis acid might open it. For example, acid-catalyzed ring opening of an epoxide. But without knowing the structure, it's difficult.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a diol, which when treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps undergoes some elimination or rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diester, which when treated with a Lewis acid might form an acylium ion or something else.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis tends to break double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have carbonyls where the double bonds were in product 2.

If the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, which would split into a triplet due to coupling with two adjacent Hs. But the options are more complicated.

Wait, the most deshielded H would likely be near an electronegative group or a carbonyl. So, in product 3, after ozonolysis, if the molecule has a carbonyl group, the Hs adjacent would be split based on their neighboring Hs.

Let me think: Ozonolysis of a diene would give two carbonyl groups. Suppose product 2 is a diene. Then product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, perhaps as two ketones or two aldehydes.

But depending on the structure of the diene, the resulting carbonyl groups would have different environments.

For example, if product 2 is a substituted cyclohexene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. The adjacent Hs would each couple with neighboring groups.

Wait, but the initial product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. So, product 2 is more likely to be a larger molecule, perhaps with a conjugated diene.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. Heating with Al(OiPr)3 (a Friedel-Crafts catalyst) might cause it to undergo some kind of alkylation or acylation, but without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. When treated with Al(OiPr)3, the epoxide might open, perhaps leading to a carbocation, which could rearrange or trap something.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think of the NMR of product 3.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3, not exchanging with D2O.

In ozonolysis, the breaking of the double bond would create carbonyl groups. So, perhaps the product 3 has carbonyl groups, and the Hs adjacent to them would be deshielded.

The coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring Hs and their splitting.

Suppose product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl. Each H in CH2 would be split by the neighboring Hs.

Wait, if it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, and each of those Hs is next to another CH2 group, each could be split into a triplet. But the options suggest more complex splitting.

Alternatively, if the Hs are adjacent to two different sets of Hs, like a CH2 between two CH2 groups, each H might couple with two sets, leading to more splitting.

Wait, considering the options: A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

A triplet is n+1 where n=2, so two neighboring Hs. If a H is next to two Hs on one side and two on the other, it might be a triplet of triplets (each split into triplets), making a 3x3 =9 peak pattern, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, if a H is next to two Hs on one side and another two on another side, it might be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let's imagine product 3 has a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R. Then, the CH2 groups near the carbonyl would each have two Hs. Each H on the CH2 next to CO would be coupled with the adjacent CH2's Hs. So, each H on the first CH2 would see two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if they're also coupled with another set of Hs elsewhere, it could become more complex.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that a CH2 group is between two other CH2 groups, each H would be split by two neighboring Hs on each adjacent group. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is due to coupling with two different sets of Hs, each with two neighboring Hs. For example, each H is next to two Hs on one side and another two on the other.

In that case, the splitting would be (n+1)(m+1), where n and m are the number of neighboring Hs. If each coupling is with two Hs, then (2+1)(2+1)=9 peaks, which is a triplet of triplets. But that's option B.

Alternatively, if a H is next to two Hs on one side and one H on the other, it would be a triplet of doublets, which is not an option here.

Wait, but the most deshielded H would be the one closest to the carbonyl. So, perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and each H in that CH2 is coupled with the adjacent CH2 group's Hs. So, each H in the first CH2 would see two Hs from the adjacent CH2, making a triplet. But if the adjacent CH2 is itself coupled with another group, maybe it's split further.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, leading to a more complex coupling.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. However, based on the options, the most likely answer is a triplet of triplets, but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a pentet, which would be from coupling with four neighboring Hs. But that seems unlikely in this scenario.

Wait, another angle: The initial product 1's NMR has 4.79 (2H). If that's an OCH2 group, perhaps in an ester. Then, product 2 could be an enol ether or something else. Ozonolysis would break any double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and ozonolysis cleaves it into two carbonyl groups. The most deshielded H in product 3 would be from a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

If the structure is, say, RCOCH2CH2CO R, then each CH2 would have Hs adjacent to two Hs. So, each H would be a triplet. But perhaps if there's more coupling, like if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, each H would couple with two Hs on one side and two on the other.

Wait, example: Consider a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O-. Ozonolysis would break the central CH2-CH2 into two carbonyl groups. But that's not right because ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, not single bonds.

Wait, perhaps product 2 has a double bond. Ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyls.

Suppose product 2 is an alkene between two CH2 groups. Ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. So, each end would have a carbonyl. The resulting structure would have CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls.

In such a case, the Hs on CH2 adjacent to carbonyl would each be split by the neighboring Hs. Each H is next to two Hs on the same CH2, so triplet. But if they're also next to another group with Hs, perhaps more splitting.

Wait, if each CH2 is next to two Hs on the same group and two Hs on another group, perhaps from another CH2, then each H would have four neighboring Hs, leading to a quintet (n=4 → 5 peaks). But that's option D: pentet.

Wait, but in reality, each H is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2. So, each H would be a triplet due to the two neighboring Hs. Unless there's another coupling from elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups. Each H is coupled with the two from the same CH2 and perhaps two from another group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but let me think of a specific example. If the structure after ozonolysis is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O- (but that's not correct because ozonolysis doesn't form that). Wait, perhaps it's more like:

Original product 2: CH2-CH2 (double bond?), but no, wait. Ozonolysis of a diene would form two carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a diene, say, CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, giving two aldehydes.

So, product 3 would be OHC-CH2-CH2-CHO. Each CH2 group is between two aldehyde groups.

Wait, no, wait. Ozonolysis of a diene like 1,3-pentadiene would give two carbonyl groups. For example, ozonolysis of 1,3-butadiene gives two formaldehyde molecules. But in a longer chain, it would give two ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, but if product 2 is a cyclic diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. For example, cyclopentene would ozonolyze to give two pentanedial or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is bicyclic, such as adamantene with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls.

In any case, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyls would be deshielded. Each CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl would have Hs that are split by neighboring Hs.

Assuming each CH2 next to the carbonyl has two Hs, each H would be split into a triplet by the two adjacent Hs. But if these CH2 groups are also adjacent to another CH2 group, each H would be coupled with two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but if a H is only coupled with two Hs on one side, it would be a triplet. If it's coupled with two on one side and two on the other, each coupling would be a triplet, making a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if there are two different coupling constants, it might split into a triplet of triplets.

So, putting it all together, the most deshielded H in product 3 (adjacent to a carbonyl) would be part of a CH2 group that's coupled with two Hs on one side and another two Hs on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets. That would match option B.

Wait, but another possibility: the H might be part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2 group, which is next to another CH2, leading to more splitting. But I think in this case, the most likely is a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me imagine a specific structure. Suppose product 3 is a diketone, with a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R. Each CH2 is between two carbonyls. So, each H in the middle CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and possibly two Hs on the neighboring CH2.

Wait, but each H in the middle CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the same CH2 (making a triplet) and perhaps another two Hs from the adjacent CH2. So, each H would be a triplet for the same CH2 and another triplet for the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is with two different groups, each providing two Hs, leading to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of doublets.

I'm getting a bit confused. Another approach: look at the options and think what each implies.

Option B is a triplet of triplets. That would arise if a proton is coupled with two different groups, each of which has two protons. For example, if a CH2 group is next to a CH2 and another CH2, each with two protons, the splitting would be (2+1) for each coupling, leading to 3×3=9 peaks. But the question says 'the most deshielded hydrogen atom,' which would likely be a singlet if it's adjacent to no other Hs, but that's not the case here.

Wait, if the H is in a CH2 group next to another CH2 group, then each H in the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs in the adjacent CH2. That would be a triplet. If there's another adjacent group with Hs, like another CH2, then each H would be split again, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, for example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-R, but the central CH2 is between two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. Then, each H in the central CH2 would be split by the two Hs on each adjacent CH2. That would be (2+1) from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that each CH2 is only adjacent to one other CH2, it would be a triplet.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, the options are limited, and the most likely scenario is that the H is coupled with two different sets of two Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

---

### Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH
1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with excess KOH, leading to a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). This suggests that the reaction involves the formation of a carbonyl-containing compound. The NMR spectrum of product 1 includes peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41–2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) likely corresponds to a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom, while the peaks at 2.41–2.23 ppm and 1.94 ppm correspond to CH₂ groups characteristic of the adamantane structure. Based on the IR and NMR data, product 1 is likely an ester or a ketone.

---

### Step 2: Reaction of product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide
Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates a reaction involving the carbonyl group in product 1, such as a rearrangement or further functionalization. The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined, but it is inferred that product 2 contains a double bond, as ozonolysis is performed in the next step.

---

### Step 3: Ozonolysis of product 2
Ozonolysis is performed on product 2 at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, converting them into carbonyl groups. This suggests that product 2 contains a double bond, and product 3 is formed by breaking this bond to generate carbonyl-containing fragments.

---

### Step 4: NMR analysis of product 3
The question focuses on the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent. The most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyl groups deshield nearby hydrogens. 

In product 3, the hydrogen(s) adjacent to the carbonyl group would couple with neighboring hydrogens. If a hydrogen is adjacent to two hydrogens on one side and two hydrogens on the other, it would exhibit a **triplet of triplets** coupling pattern due to the splitting from two sets of neighboring hydrogens. This is consistent with the structure of product 3 after ozonolysis, where the deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group and flanked by other CH₂ groups.

---

### Critical Analysis of Options
- **A) Triplet**: This would occur if the hydrogen was coupled with only two neighboring hydrogens. However, the presence of additional coupling makes this less likely.
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This occurs when a hydrogen is coupled with two hydrogens on one side and two hydrogens on the other, leading to a complex splitting pattern. This is the most likely scenario based on the structure of product 3.
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would require coupling with one hydrogen on one side and two hydrogens on the other, which is less consistent with the expected structure.
- **D) Pentet**: This would occur if the hydrogen was coupled with four neighboring hydrogens, which is unlikely in this case.

---

### Conclusion
The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 exhibits a **triplet of triplets** coupling pattern due to its interaction with neighboring hydrogens. 

**Answer: B**
