Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question gives four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Then there are four options, A to D, each making a statement about these matrices. I need to figure out which statement is correct.

First, I'll recall some concepts from quantum mechanics as they relate to matrices. I know that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. The evolution operator, which is the time evolution operator, is a unitary matrix. Also, the exponential of a matrix (like e^X) can relate to the time evolution, but that depends on the matrix's properties.

Let me list out the matrices again for clarity.

W is:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

X is:
i  -1  2i
1   0   1
2i -1  -i

Y is:
0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

Z is:
3   2i  5
-2i -2  -4i
5   4i  4

Now, the options. Let's look at each one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. So, the norm change would mean that e^X isn't unitary, because unitary matrices preserve the norm. The exponential of a matrix depends on whether the original matrix is skew-Hermitian. Because, for a skew-Hermitian matrix A (i.e., A† = -A), e^A is unitary. So, if X is skew-Hermitian, then e^X would be unitary, and the norm would be preserved for any vector. But if X isn't skew-Hermitian, then e^X might not be unitary.

Let me check if X is skew-Hermitian. A skew-Hermitian matrix has the property that X† = -X. So, I'll compute X† and see.

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

The Hermitian conjugate (X†) is the transpose of the complex conjugate of each element.

So, X† will be:

First row: Row 1 of X's conjugate: (i)* is -i; (-1)* is -1; (2i)* is -2i. So first column is (-i, 1, -2i)^T? Wait, no, when you take the transpose. Let me write X and then compute X†.

Original X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So the conjugate of X (X*) would be:
Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Then, X† is the transpose of X*, so columns become rows.

So, X† would be:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Wait, let me double-check. After taking the conjugate, each element becomes its complex conjugate. Then, to get X†, we transpose the matrix.

So the original X* elements are:

First row of X*: i becomes -i; -1 stays -1; 2i becomes -2i.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, X is:

X(1,1)=i → X*(1,1)= -i
X(1,2)= -1 → X*(1,2)= -1
X(1,3)= 2i → X*(1,3)= -2i

X(2,1)=1 → X*(2,1)=1
X(2,2)=0 → remains 0
X(2,3)=1 → X*(2,3)=1

X(3,1)=2i → X*(3,1)= -2i
X(3,2)= -1 → X*(3,2)= -1
X(3,3)= -i → X*(3,3)= i

So the X* matrix is:

[ [ -i, -1, -2i ],
  [ 1, 0, 1 ],
  [ -2i, -1, i ] ]

Now, X† is the transpose of X*, which swaps rows and columns.

So the first row of X† is the first column of X*:

[-i, 1, -2i]

Second row of X† is second column of X*:

[-1, 0, -1]

Third row of X† is third column of X*:

[-2i, 1, i]

So X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Now, if X is skew-Hermitian, then X† should equal -X.

Let's compute -X:

-X is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Wait, that's exactly what X† is! So X† = -X, which makes X skew-Hermitian.

So e^X would be unitary because for a skew-Hermitian matrix A, e^A is unitary. Therefore, e^X is unitary. So, multiplying any vector by e^X would preserve the norm. Therefore, option A is saying that the norm changes, which would be false. So A is incorrect.

But wait, option A says there exists a vector where the norm changes. If e^X is unitary, then for all vectors, the norm is preserved. So e^X would preserve the norm for any vector, making option A incorrect. So A is false.

Option B: (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Hmm. Quantum states are represented by density matrices, which are positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and trace 1. Alternatively, a pure state is a unit vector in the space.

(e^X) is unitary, as we saw. So (e^X)* is its conjugate transpose, which is also unitary. e^{-X} is the inverse of e^X, because for any invertible matrix A, e^{-A} is the inverse of e^A.

So (e^X)* Y e^{-X} would be similar to Y, since it's conjugate-transpose times Y times inverse. Because e^X is unitary, this transformation is a similarity transformation. Similar matrices have the same eigenvalues. So Y is a 3x3 matrix, and this transformation would give another matrix similar to Y. 

But what's Y? Let me look at Y again:

Y is:
0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

Is Y Hermitian? Let's check. Y's elements are all real. So Y is symmetric, hence Y is Hermitian. So Y is a Hermitian matrix, which would make sense for an observable.

But the transformed matrix (e^X)* Y e^{-X} would also be Hermitian because similarity transformations preserve Hermiticity. So this transformed matrix is Hermitian. But is it a quantum state? Quantum states (density matrices) must be positive semi-definite and have trace 1.

Wait, Y has trace 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1. So trace is 1. But is Y positive semi-definite? Let's see. Its eigenvalues must all be non-negative.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a valid density matrix. If so, then (e^X)* Y e^{-X} would also be a valid density matrix, because it's similar to Y, and similar matrices have the same eigenvalues, so if Y is positive definite, so is the transformed version. Thus, option B's statement would be correct.

But wait, I'm not so sure. Because the similarity transformation would indeed produce another density matrix if Y is a density matrix. So (e^X)* Y e^{-X} is a valid quantum state.

Wait, but wait a second: (e^X) is a unitary matrix, so (e^X)* is the inverse of e^X. So the transformation is a conjugation: e^X Y e^{-X}. Wait, no, in the question, it's (e^X)* times Y times e^{-X}. Let me write it as (e^X)† Y e^{-X}, because (e^X)* is e^{X†}, which would be e^{-X} because X is skew-Hermitian (since X† = -X).

Wait, let me think. Since X is skew-Hermitian, X† = -X. So e^{X†} = e^{-X} because the exponential of a matrix's conjugate transpose is the conjugate transpose of the exponential. So (e^X)† = e^{X†} = e^{-X}.

So, (e^X)† Y e^{-X} = e^{-X} Y e^{-X}? No, because (e^X)† is e^{-X}, so the expression is e^{-X} Y e^{-X}.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me clarify: (e^X)† = e^{X†} = e^{-X} because X is skew-Hermitian. So the expression (e^X)† Y e^{-X} = e^{-X} Y e^{-X}.

But that's a similarity transformation as well. So the resulting matrix would be similar to Y, so it would have the same eigenvalues. So if Y is a density matrix (trace 1, Hermitian, positive semi-definite), then this transformed matrix would also be a density matrix. So option B's statement is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The point is, (e^X)* Y e^{-X} is a valid quantum state if Y is a valid state. So B could be correct. But I'm not certain yet; I'll come back to this.

Option C: Z and X represent observables.

Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. So I need to check if Z and X are Hermitian.

X: Let's compute X† again, which we did earlier. X† was:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Compare that to X:

X's rows were:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So X† is not equal to X. So X is not Hermitian. Therefore, X cannot represent an observable. So option C is incorrect because X isn't Hermitian.

Option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

The evolution operator is a unitary matrix. So I need to check if W and X are unitary.

First, W:

W is:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

To check if W is unitary, compute W† W and see if it's the identity matrix.

W is real, so W† = W^T.

W^T is the same as W because W is symmetric (since W is a permutation matrix, it's symmetric only if it's the identity, but W here is not symmetric). Wait, W's transpose is:

Row 1: 0, 0, 1 → column 1 becomes (0,0,1), so W^T is:

0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

Which is the same as W. So W† = W^T = W.

Now, W† W is W^2. Let's compute W squared.

W^2 = W * W.

Compute each element:

First row of W times each column of W.

W is:
Row 1: 0 0 1
Row 2: 0 1 0
Row 3: 1 0 0

Multiply W by W:

Element (1,1): (0)(0)+(0)(0)+(1)(1) = 1
(1,2): (0)(0)+(0)(1)+(1)(0)=0
(1,3): (0)(1)+(0)(0)+(1)(0)=0

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute each element properly.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that W is a permutation matrix. Multiplying it by itself permutes again. Let's see.

W swaps the first and third basis vectors. Applying W twice would swap them back, so W^2 is the identity matrix. Therefore, W is unitary because W† W = I.

So W is unitary.

Now X: Earlier, we found that X is skew-Hermitian. So e^X is unitary, but X itself is not unitary. Wait, no. Wait, X is a matrix, but we need to check if X is unitary. Wait, no, because X is skew-Hermitian, but that doesn't necessarily make it unitary. Let me compute X† X and see if it equals I.

Compute X† X.

X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Multiply X† by X:

Let me compute each element.

First row of X† times first column of X:

(-i)(i) + (1)(1) + (-2i)(2i)
= (-i^2) + 1 + (-4i^2)
Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:
= (1) + 1 + (4) → 1+1+4=6.

Wait, this can't be right because if X were unitary, X† X would be identity. But here, first element is 6, which is way larger than 1. So X is not unitary. Therefore, X cannot be the evolution operator. So option D is incorrect; W is unitary, but X isn't, so option D is false.

Wait but option D says W and X are evolution operators. Since X is not unitary, D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation for X† X. Let me compute X† X correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me re-do the multiplication.

Wait, perhaps I should compute X† X step by step.

X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

So X† X is a 3x3 matrix. Let's compute each element (i,j).

Element (1,1) = Row 1 of X† dot Column 1 of X.

= (-i)(i) + (1)(1) + (-2i)(2i)
= (-i^2) + 1 + (-4i^2)
= (1) + 1 + (4) → 6.

Element (1,2) = Row 1 of X† dot Column 2 of X.

= (-i)(-1) + (1)(0) + (-2i)(-1)
= i + 0 + 2i → 3i.

Element (1,3) = Row 1 of X† dot Column 3 of X.

= (-i)(2i) + (1)(1) + (-2i)(-i)
= (-i)(2i)= (-2i^2)= 2
(1)(1)=1
(-2i)(-i)= (2i^2)= -2
So total: 2 +1 -2 =1.

Wait, let me recheck these calculations.

Wait, (-i)(2i) = (-i)(2i) = -2i^2 = -2*(-1) = 2.

(1)(1) =1.

(-2i)(-i)= (2i^2)= 2*(-1)= -2.

So 2 +1 -2= 1. So (1,3) is 1.

Now element (2,1) is Row 2 of X† dot Column 1 of X.

Row 2 of X† is [-1, 0, -1].

Column 1 of X is [i, 1, 2i].

Dot product: (-1)(i) + 0*(1) + (-1)(2i) = -i +0 -2i = -3i.

Element (2,2): Row 2 of X† dot Column 2 of X.

= (-1)(-1) + 0*(0) + (-1)(-1)
= 1 + 0 +1= 2.

Element (2,3): Row 2 of X† dot Column3 of X.

= (-1)(2i) + 0*(1) + (-1)(-i)
= -2i +0 +i = -i.

Element (3,1): Row3 of X† dot Column1 of X.

Row3 of X† is [-2i, 1, i].

Column1 of X is [i, 1, 2i].

Dot product: (-2i)(i) + (1)(1) + (i)(2i)
= (-2i^2) +1 + (2i^2)
= 2 +1 -2= 1.

Wait, let me compute each term:

(-2i)(i) = -2i^2 = -2*(-1)=2.

(1)(1)=1.

(i)(2i)= 2i^2= 2*(-1)= -2.

So 2 +1 -2=1.

Element (3,2): Row3 of X† dot Column2 of X.

= (-2i)(-1) + (1)(0) + (i)(-1)
= 2i +0 -i = i.

Element (3,3): Row3 of X† dot Column3 of X.

= (-2i)(2i) + (1)(1) + (i)(-i)
= (-4i^2) +1 + (-i^2)
= 4 +1 +1=6.

Wait, let me compute each term:

(-2i)(2i) = -4i^2=4.

(1)(1)=1.

(i)(-i)= -i^2=1.

So 4 +1 +1=6.

So putting it all together, X† X is:

[ [6, 3i, 1],
  [-3i, 2, -i],
  [1, i, 6] ]

This is definitely not the identity matrix. So X is not unitary. Therefore, X cannot be an evolution operator. So option D is incorrect.

Now, returning to option B. Let me reconsider. So (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) is a quantum state. Since Y is a Hermitian matrix with trace 1, and is positive semi-definite? Let me check the eigenvalues of Y to confirm if it's positive semi-definite.

Y is:

0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

Let me compute the eigenvalues. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant and see if it's positive.

But this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, note that Y is a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable and has real eigenvalues. The sum of the eigenvalues (trace) is 1, which is positive.

But for it to be positive semi-definite, all eigenvalues must be ≥0.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the leading principal minors to apply Sylvester's criterion.

The first leading principal minor is 0.5 >0.

The second leading principal minor is the determinant of the top-left 2x2:

|0.5 0.1|
|0.1 0.25|

= (0.5)(0.25) - (0.1)^2 = 0.125 - 0.01 = 0.115 >0.

Third leading principal minor is determinant of Y.

Let me compute det(Y).

The matrix Y:

Row 1: 0.5, 0.1, 0.2
Row 2: 0.1, 0.25, 0.1
Row3: 0.2, 0.1, 0.25

Compute the determinant. Let's expand along the first row.

det(Y) = 0.5 * det( [ [0.25, 0.1], [0.1, 0.25] ]) 
-0.1 * det( [ [0.1, 0.1], [0.2, 0.25] ]) 
+0.2 * det( [ [0.1, 0.25], [0.2, 0.1] ]).

Compute each minor:

First minor (2x2 determinant):
(0.25)(0.25) - (0.1)(0.1) = 0.0625 -0.01=0.0525.

Second minor:
(0.1)(0.25) - (0.1)(0.2) = 0.025 - 0.02 = 0.005.

Third minor:
(0.1)(0.1) - (0.25)(0.2) = 0.01 - 0.05 = -0.04.

So putting it all together:

det(Y) = 0.5 * 0.0525 - 0.1 * 0.005 + 0.2 * (-0.04)
= 0.02625 - 0.0005 -0.008
= 0.02625 - 0.0085 = 0.01775.

Which is positive. So all leading principal minors are positive, so Y is positive definite. Therefore, Y is a valid density matrix (if normalized, but since trace is 1, it's already normalized). So the transformed matrix (e^X)* Y e^{-X} is similar to Y, so it's also positive definite, trace 1, Hermitian. Hence, it's a valid quantum state.

Therefore, option B is correct.

Wait, but wait: (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) would be Y transformed by the unitary (e^X). So it's a valid state. So option B is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought Y is a state, so the transformed version should also be a state. So option B is correct.

Wait, but let me think again about whether (e^X)* Y e^{-X} represents a quantum state. Since Y is a state and e^X is unitary, then the transformed Y should also be a state. So yes, option B is correct.

But wait, I also need to check if option B is correctly formatted. It says (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}). Since (e^X)* is the conjugate transpose of e^X, but since X is skew-Hermitian, e^X is unitary, and its inverse is e^{-X}, which is (e^X)*.

Wait, so (e^X)* Y e^{-X} is the same as e^{-X} Y e^{X} because (e^X)* is e^{-X}.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as a similarity transformation. So the statement in option B is correct.

So, among the options, option B is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing four matrices \( W \), \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \) in the context of quantum mechanics, where observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and the evolution operator is represented by a unitary matrix. The task is to determine which statement among options A to D is correct.

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:  
The statement claims that there exists a vector to which multiplying by \( e^X \) changes the norm. For \( e^X \) to preserve the norm for all vectors, \( e^X \) must be unitary. A matrix \( e^A \) is unitary if \( A \) is skew-Hermitian. \( X \) is checked for skew-Hermiticity by computing \( X^\dagger \) (the Hermitian conjugate of \( X \)) and verifying that \( X^\dagger = -X \). Since this condition holds, \( X \) is skew-Hermitian, and \( e^X \) is unitary. Therefore, the norm of any vector is preserved under multiplication by \( e^X \), making this statement **false**.

#### **Option B**:  
The statement claims that \( (e^X)^\dagger Y e^{-X} \) represents a quantum state. A quantum state is represented by a density matrix, which is positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and has trace 1. \( Y \) is a symmetric matrix with real entries, making it Hermitian. The trace of \( Y \) is \( 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1 \), satisfying the trace condition. To confirm positive semi-definiteness, the leading principal minors of \( Y \) are computed. All minors are positive, confirming that \( Y \) is positive definite. Since \( e^X \) is unitary, the similarity transformation \( (e^X)^\dagger Y e^{-X} \) preserves the eigenvalues and properties of \( Y \), ensuring the transformed matrix is also a valid density matrix. Thus, this statement is **true**.

#### **Option C**:  
The statement claims that \( Z \) and \( X \) represent observables. Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. \( X \) is checked for Hermiticity by comparing \( X^\dagger \) with \( X \). Since \( X^\dagger \neq X \), \( X \) is not Hermitian and cannot represent an observable. \( Z \) is not explicitly checked, but the statement fails due to \( X \) not being Hermitian. Thus, this statement is **false**.

#### **Option D**:  
The statement claims that \( W \) and \( X \) represent the evolution operator of a quantum system. The evolution operator is a unitary matrix. \( W \) is checked for unitarity by computing \( W^\dagger W \). Since \( W \) is symmetric and \( W^\dagger W = I \), \( W \) is unitary. However, \( X \) is not unitary, as shown by computing \( X^\dagger X \), which does not yield the identity matrix. Since both \( W \) and \( X \) must be unitary for this statement to hold, it is **false**.

### Conclusion:  
The only correct statement is **Option B**, as \( (e^X)^\dagger Y e^{-X} \) is a valid quantum state.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question gives four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Then there are four options, A to D, each making a statement about these matrices. I need to figure out which statement is correct.

First, I'll recall some concepts from quantum mechanics as they relate to matrices. I know that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. The evolution operator, which is the time evolution operator, is a unitary matrix. Also, the exponential of a matrix (like e^X) can relate to the time evolution, but that depends on the matrix's properties.

Let me list out the matrices again for clarity.

W is:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

X is:
i  -1  2i
1   0   1
2i -1  -i

Y is:
0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

Z is:
3   2i  5
-2i -2  -4i
5   4i  4

Now, the options. Let's look at each one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. So, the norm change would mean that e^X isn't unitary, because unitary matrices preserve the norm. The exponential of a matrix depends on whether the original matrix is skew-Hermitian. Because, for a skew-Hermitian matrix A (i.e., A† = -A), e^A is unitary. So, if X is skew-Hermitian, then e^X would be unitary, and the norm would be preserved for any vector. But if X isn't skew-Hermitian, then e^X might not be unitary.

Let me check if X is skew-Hermitian. A skew-Hermitian matrix has the property that X† = -X. So, I'll compute X† and see.

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

The Hermitian conjugate (X†) is the transpose of the complex conjugate of each element.

So, X† will be:

First row: Row 1 of X's conjugate: (i)* is -i; (-1)* is -1; (2i)* is -2i. So first column is (-i, 1, -2i)^T? Wait, no, when you take the transpose. Let me write X and then compute X†.

Original X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So the conjugate of X (X*) would be:
Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Then, X† is the transpose of X*, so columns become rows.

So, X† would be:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Wait, let me double-check. After taking the conjugate, each element becomes its complex conjugate. Then, to get X†, we transpose the matrix.

So the original X* elements are:

First row of X*: i becomes -i; -1 stays -1; 2i becomes -2i.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, X is:

X(1,1)=i → X*(1,1)= -i
X(1,2)= -1 → X*(1,2)= -1
X(1,3)= 2i → X*(1,3)= -2i

X(2,1)=1 → X*(2,1)=1
X(2,2)=0 → remains 0
X(2,3)=1 → X*(2,3)=1

X(3,1)=2i → X*(3,1)= -2i
X(3,2)= -1 → X*(3,2)= -1
X(3,3)= -i → X*(3,3)= i

So the X* matrix is:

[ [ -i, -1, -2i ],
  [ 1, 0, 1 ],
  [ -2i, -1, i ] ]

Now, X† is the transpose of X*, which swaps rows and columns.

So the first row of X† is the first column of X*:

[-i, 1, -2i]

Second row of X† is second column of X*:

[-1, 0, -1]

Third row of X† is third column of X*:

[-2i, 1, i]

So X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Now, if X is skew-Hermitian, then X† should equal -X.

Let's compute -X:

-X is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Wait, that's exactly what X† is! So X† = -X, which makes X skew-Hermitian.

So e^X would be unitary because for a skew-Hermitian matrix A, e^A is unitary. Therefore, e^X is unitary. So, multiplying any vector by e^X would preserve the norm. Therefore, option A is saying that the norm changes, which would be false. So A is incorrect.

But wait, option A says there exists a vector where the norm changes. If e^X is unitary, then for all vectors, the norm is preserved. So e^X would preserve the norm for any vector, making option A incorrect. So A is false.

Option B: (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Hmm. Quantum states are represented by density matrices, which are positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and trace 1. Alternatively, a pure state is a unit vector in the space.

(e^X) is unitary, as we saw. So (e^X)* is its conjugate transpose, which is also unitary. e^{-X} is the inverse of e^X, because for any invertible matrix A, e^{-A} is the inverse of e^A.

So (e^X)* Y e^{-X} would be similar to Y, since it's conjugate-transpose times Y times inverse. Because e^X is unitary, this transformation is a similarity transformation. Similar matrices have the same eigenvalues. So Y is a 3x3 matrix, and this transformation would give another matrix similar to Y. 

But what's Y? Let me look at Y again:

Y is:
0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

Is Y Hermitian? Let's check. Y's elements are all real. So Y is symmetric, hence Y is Hermitian. So Y is a Hermitian matrix, which would make sense for an observable.

But the transformed matrix (e^X)* Y e^{-X} would also be Hermitian because similarity transformations preserve Hermiticity. So this transformed matrix is Hermitian. But is it a quantum state? Quantum states (density matrices) must be positive semi-definite and have trace 1.

Wait, Y has trace 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1. So trace is 1. But is Y positive semi-definite? Let's see. Its eigenvalues must all be non-negative.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a valid density matrix. If so, then (e^X)* Y e^{-X} would also be a valid density matrix, because it's similar to Y, and similar matrices have the same eigenvalues, so if Y is positive definite, so is the transformed version. Thus, option B's statement would be correct.

But wait, I'm not so sure. Because the similarity transformation would indeed produce another density matrix if Y is a density matrix. So (e^X)* Y e^{-X} is a valid quantum state.

Wait, but wait a second: (e^X) is a unitary matrix, so (e^X)* is the inverse of e^X. So the transformation is a conjugation: e^X Y e^{-X}. Wait, no, in the question, it's (e^X)* times Y times e^{-X}. Let me write it as (e^X)† Y e^{-X}, because (e^X)* is e^{X†}, which would be e^{-X} because X is skew-Hermitian (since X† = -X).

Wait, let me think. Since X is skew-Hermitian, X† = -X. So e^{X†} = e^{-X} because the exponential of a matrix's conjugate transpose is the conjugate transpose of the exponential. So (e^X)† = e^{X†} = e^{-X}.

So, (e^X)† Y e^{-X} = e^{-X} Y e^{-X}? No, because (e^X)† is e^{-X}, so the expression is e^{-X} Y e^{-X}.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me clarify: (e^X)† = e^{X†} = e^{-X} because X is skew-Hermitian. So the expression (e^X)† Y e^{-X} = e^{-X} Y e^{-X}.

But that's a similarity transformation as well. So the resulting matrix would be similar to Y, so it would have the same eigenvalues. So if Y is a density matrix (trace 1, Hermitian, positive semi-definite), then this transformed matrix would also be a density matrix. So option B's statement is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The point is, (e^X)* Y e^{-X} is a valid quantum state if Y is a valid state. So B could be correct. But I'm not certain yet; I'll come back to this.

Option C: Z and X represent observables.

Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. So I need to check if Z and X are Hermitian.

X: Let's compute X† again, which we did earlier. X† was:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Compare that to X:

X's rows were:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So X† is not equal to X. So X is not Hermitian. Therefore, X cannot represent an observable. So option C is incorrect because X isn't Hermitian.

Option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

The evolution operator is a unitary matrix. So I need to check if W and X are unitary.

First, W:

W is:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

To check if W is unitary, compute W† W and see if it's the identity matrix.

W is real, so W† = W^T.

W^T is the same as W because W is symmetric (since W is a permutation matrix, it's symmetric only if it's the identity, but W here is not symmetric). Wait, W's transpose is:

Row 1: 0, 0, 1 → column 1 becomes (0,0,1), so W^T is:

0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

Which is the same as W. So W† = W^T = W.

Now, W† W is W^2. Let's compute W squared.

W^2 = W * W.

Compute each element:

First row of W times each column of W.

W is:
Row 1: 0 0 1
Row 2: 0 1 0
Row 3: 1 0 0

Multiply W by W:

Element (1,1): (0)(0)+(0)(0)+(1)(1) = 1
(1,2): (0)(0)+(0)(1)+(1)(0)=0
(1,3): (0)(1)+(0)(0)+(1)(0)=0

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute each element properly.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that W is a permutation matrix. Multiplying it by itself permutes again. Let's see.

W swaps the first and third basis vectors. Applying W twice would swap them back, so W^2 is the identity matrix. Therefore, W is unitary because W† W = I.

So W is unitary.

Now X: Earlier, we found that X is skew-Hermitian. So e^X is unitary, but X itself is not unitary. Wait, no. Wait, X is a matrix, but we need to check if X is unitary. Wait, no, because X is skew-Hermitian, but that doesn't necessarily make it unitary. Let me compute X† X and see if it equals I.

Compute X† X.

X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Multiply X† by X:

Let me compute each element.

First row of X† times first column of X:

(-i)(i) + (1)(1) + (-2i)(2i)
= (-i^2) + 1 + (-4i^2)
Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:
= (1) + 1 + (4) → 1+1+4=6.

Wait, this can't be right because if X were unitary, X† X would be identity. But here, first element is 6, which is way larger than 1. So X is not unitary. Therefore, X cannot be the evolution operator. So option D is incorrect; W is unitary, but X isn't, so option D is false.

Wait but option D says W and X are evolution operators. Since X is not unitary, D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation for X† X. Let me compute X† X correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me re-do the multiplication.

Wait, perhaps I should compute X† X step by step.

X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

So X† X is a 3x3 matrix. Let's compute each element (i,j).

Element (1,1) = Row 1 of X† dot Column 1 of X.

= (-i)(i) + (1)(1) + (-2i)(2i)
= (-i^2) + 1 + (-4i^2)
= (1) + 1 + (4) → 6.

Element (1,2) = Row 1 of X† dot Column 2 of X.

= (-i)(-1) + (1)(0) + (-2i)(-1)
= i + 0 + 2i → 3i.

Element (1,3) = Row 1 of X† dot Column 3 of X.

= (-i)(2i) + (1)(1) + (-2i)(-i)
= (-i)(2i)= (-2i^2)= 2
(1)(1)=1
(-2i)(-i)= (2i^2)= -2
So total: 2 +1 -2 =1.

Wait, let me recheck these calculations.

Wait, (-i)(2i) = (-i)(2i) = -2i^2 = -2*(-1) = 2.

(1)(1) =1.

(-2i)(-i)= (2i^2)= 2*(-1)= -2.

So 2 +1 -2= 1. So (1,3) is 1.

Now element (2,1) is Row 2 of X† dot Column 1 of X.

Row 2 of X† is [-1, 0, -1].

Column 1 of X is [i, 1, 2i].

Dot product: (-1)(i) + 0*(1) + (-1)(2i) = -i +0 -2i = -3i.

Element (2,2): Row 2 of X† dot Column 2 of X.

= (-1)(-1) + 0*(0) + (-1)(-1)
= 1 + 0 +1= 2.

Element (2,3): Row 2 of X† dot Column3 of X.

= (-1)(2i) + 0*(1) + (-1)(-i)
= -2i +0 +i = -i.

Element (3,1): Row3 of X† dot Column1 of X.

Row3 of X† is [-2i, 1, i].

Column1 of X is [i, 1, 2i].

Dot product: (-2i)(i) + (1)(1) + (i)(2i)
= (-2i^2) +1 + (2i^2)
= 2 +1 -2= 1.

Wait, let me compute each term:

(-2i)(i) = -2i^2 = -2*(-1)=2.

(1)(1)=1.

(i)(2i)= 2i^2= 2*(-1)= -2.

So 2 +1 -2=1.

Element (3,2): Row3 of X† dot Column2 of X.

= (-2i)(-1) + (1)(0) + (i)(-1)
= 2i +0 -i = i.

Element (3,3): Row3 of X† dot Column3 of X.

= (-2i)(2i) + (1)(1) + (i)(-i)
= (-4i^2) +1 + (-i^2)
= 4 +1 +1=6.

Wait, let me compute each term:

(-2i)(2i) = -4i^2=4.

(1)(1)=1.

(i)(-i)= -i^2=1.

So 4 +1 +1=6.

So putting it all together, X† X is:

[ [6, 3i, 1],
  [-3i, 2, -i],
  [1, i, 6] ]

This is definitely not the identity matrix. So X is not unitary. Therefore, X cannot be an evolution operator. So option D is incorrect.

Now, returning to option B. Let me reconsider. So (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) is a quantum state. Since Y is a Hermitian matrix with trace 1, and is positive semi-definite? Let me check the eigenvalues of Y to confirm if it's positive semi-definite.

Y is:

0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

Let me compute the eigenvalues. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant and see if it's positive.

But this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, note that Y is a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable and has real eigenvalues. The sum of the eigenvalues (trace) is 1, which is positive.

But for it to be positive semi-definite, all eigenvalues must be ≥0.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the leading principal minors to apply Sylvester's criterion.

The first leading principal minor is 0.5 >0.

The second leading principal minor is the determinant of the top-left 2x2:

|0.5 0.1|
|0.1 0.25|

= (0.5)(0.25) - (0.1)^2 = 0.125 - 0.01 = 0.115 >0.

Third leading principal minor is determinant of Y.

Let me compute det(Y).

The matrix Y:

Row 1: 0.5, 0.1, 0.2
Row 2: 0.1, 0.25, 0.1
Row3: 0.2, 0.1, 0.25

Compute the determinant. Let's expand along the first row.

det(Y) = 0.5 * det( [ [0.25, 0.1], [0.1, 0.25] ]) 
-0.1 * det( [ [0.1, 0.1], [0.2, 0.25] ]) 
+0.2 * det( [ [0.1, 0.25], [0.2, 0.1] ]).

Compute each minor:

First minor (2x2 determinant):
(0.25)(0.25) - (0.1)(0.1) = 0.0625 -0.01=0.0525.

Second minor:
(0.1)(0.25) - (0.1)(0.2) = 0.025 - 0.02 = 0.005.

Third minor:
(0.1)(0.1) - (0.25)(0.2) = 0.01 - 0.05 = -0.04.

So putting it all together:

det(Y) = 0.5 * 0.0525 - 0.1 * 0.005 + 0.2 * (-0.04)
= 0.02625 - 0.0005 -0.008
= 0.02625 - 0.0085 = 0.01775.

Which is positive. So all leading principal minors are positive, so Y is positive definite. Therefore, Y is a valid density matrix (if normalized, but since trace is 1, it's already normalized). So the transformed matrix (e^X)* Y e^{-X} is similar to Y, so it's also positive definite, trace 1, Hermitian. Hence, it's a valid quantum state.

Therefore, option B is correct.

Wait, but wait: (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) would be Y transformed by the unitary (e^X). So it's a valid state. So option B is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought Y is a state, so the transformed version should also be a state. So option B is correct.

Wait, but let me think again about whether (e^X)* Y e^{-X} represents a quantum state. Since Y is a state and e^X is unitary, then the transformed Y should also be a state. So yes, option B is correct.

But wait, I also need to check if option B is correctly formatted. It says (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}). Since (e^X)* is the conjugate transpose of e^X, but since X is skew-Hermitian, e^X is unitary, and its inverse is e^{-X}, which is (e^X)*.

Wait, so (e^X)* Y e^{-X} is the same as e^{-X} Y e^{X} because (e^X)* is e^{-X}.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as a similarity transformation. So the statement in option B is correct.

So, among the options, option B is correct.


The question involves analyzing four matrices \( W \), \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \) in the context of quantum mechanics, where observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and the evolution operator is represented by a unitary matrix. The task is to determine which statement among options A to D is correct.

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:  
The statement claims that there exists a vector to which multiplying by \( e^X \) changes the norm. For \( e^X \) to preserve the norm for all vectors, \( e^X \) must be unitary. A matrix \( e^A \) is unitary if \( A \) is skew-Hermitian. \( X \) is checked for skew-Hermiticity by computing \( X^\dagger \) (the Hermitian conjugate of \( X \)) and verifying that \( X^\dagger = -X \). Since this condition holds, \( X \) is skew-Hermitian, and \( e^X \) is unitary. Therefore, the norm of any vector is preserved under multiplication by \( e^X \), making this statement **false**.

#### **Option B**:  
The statement claims that \( (e^X)^\dagger Y e^{-X} \) represents a quantum state. A quantum state is represented by a density matrix, which is positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and has trace 1. \( Y \) is a symmetric matrix with real entries, making it Hermitian. The trace of \( Y \) is \( 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1 \), satisfying the trace condition. To confirm positive semi-definiteness, the leading principal minors of \( Y \) are computed. All minors are positive, confirming that \( Y \) is positive definite. Since \( e^X \) is unitary, the similarity transformation \( (e^X)^\dagger Y e^{-X} \) preserves the eigenvalues and properties of \( Y \), ensuring the transformed matrix is also a valid density matrix. Thus, this statement is **true**.

#### **Option C**:  
The statement claims that \( Z \) and \( X \) represent observables. Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. \( X \) is checked for Hermiticity by comparing \( X^\dagger \) with \( X \). Since \( X^\dagger \neq X \), \( X \) is not Hermitian and cannot represent an observable. \( Z \) is not explicitly checked, but the statement fails due to \( X \) not being Hermitian. Thus, this statement is **false**.

#### **Option D**:  
The statement claims that \( W \) and \( X \) represent the evolution operator of a quantum system. The evolution operator is a unitary matrix. \( W \) is checked for unitarity by computing \( W^\dagger W \). Since \( W \) is symmetric and \( W^\dagger W = I \), \( W \) is unitary. However, \( X \) is not unitary, as shown by computing \( X^\dagger X \), which does not yield the identity matrix. Since both \( W \) and \( X \) must be unitary for this statement to hold, it is **false**.

### Conclusion:  
The only correct statement is **Option B**, as \( (e^X)^\dagger Y e^{-X} \) is a valid quantum state.

**Answer: B**
