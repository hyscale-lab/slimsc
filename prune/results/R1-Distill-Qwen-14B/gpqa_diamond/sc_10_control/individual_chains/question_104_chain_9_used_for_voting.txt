Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, or the closer it is to the star, or something like that.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines: 5 milliangstrom for planet #1 and 7 milliangstrom for planet #2.

Wait, so the question is about the orbital periods. They're asking how many times longer planet #2's period is compared to planet #1's. So we need to find the ratio P2/P1.

I think the RV method relates the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift (K) to the planet's mass and the orbital parameters. The formula I remember is something like K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. But more precisely, the formula involves the mass of the planet and some constants.

The key formula here is probably the one that relates the Doppler shift amplitude (K) to the orbital period (P). Let me recall. Oh right, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p)^2 ) / ( (M_star + M_p) * P ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 AU) )^(1/3) ) ) ? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Alternatively, I think the formula involves Kepler's third law.

Wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less massive than the Sun), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the denominator simplifies.

But wait, perhaps an easier approach is to consider the fact that for two planets around stars of the same mass, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes (K) relates to the cube root of the ratio of their (M_p^2) / (P) terms. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, I think the formula connects K with the planet's mass and orbital period. Let me think. The semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / sqrt(P)) ) ? Hmm, not sure. Wait, I think the Doppler velocity semi-amplitude K can be expressed as:

K = (v) = ( (G * P ) / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can ignore M_p in the denominator. So K ≈ (G P / (2 pi c^3))^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i ) / M_star^(2/3)

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Another approach: if two stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses (since both are Neptune-like), then the ratio of their K values would relate to something about their orbits.

Wait, let's see. If planet #1 has a semi-amplitude K1 and planet #2 has K2, then the ratio K2/K1 would be something involving their orbital periods.

Wait, what are the factors that affect the RV semi-amplitude? The semi-amplitude depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (but since both are detected, their sini is similar, or maybe we can assume it's the same), the mass of the star, and the orbital period.

Alternatively, from another angle: the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The amplitude K is the maximum velocity. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 day) * (1 year) )^(1/3) ) ) ) / (P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula that relates K to the orbital period and the mass. Let me look up the formula in my notes. Oh wait, I can't, but I remember that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period, assuming other factors are constant.

Wait, the formula I think is:

K = ( ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * ( 2 pi G )^(1/3) ) / ( (P c^3 )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps the exact formula isn't necessary if I can find the relation between K and P for the two planets.

Both planets have same M_p (Neptune masses) and same M_star (Sun-like), so M_p and M_star are same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because in K's formula, P is in the denominator under a cube root. So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

Wait, but wait, maybe it's K ∝ ( (M_p) / M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So, if M_p and M_star are same for both, then K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3).

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1 = (something) * (1 / P1^(1/3) ), K2 = (same something) * (1 / P2^(1/3) )

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Therefore, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me write it as K ∝ (1 / P^(1/3))

So K1 = C / P1^(1/3)
K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no, because K1 = C / P1^(1/3)
K2 = C / P2^(1/3)
So K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Yes.

So, the ratio of K1 to K2 is (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, but in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7. So K1 < K2. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So to find P2/P1, we cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait no, wait: we have K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So to find P2/P1, cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3), then:

(K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364

So the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.364 times that of planet #1. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1, meaning P2's period is shorter than P1's. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be P2/P1. Wait, no! Wait, the question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1? So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then P2 is shorter than P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter, so it can't be longer. So perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I have the ratio backwards. Let me re-express.

We have K1 = 5 milli, K2 =7. So K1/K2=5/7.

We said K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the ratio is P2/P1 = 0.364. So it's about 0.36 times. So it's shorter, not longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36, which would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Did I get the relation right? Because K is the semi-amplitude. Let me think again. K is higher when the star is moving more, which happens when the planet is closer (shorter period) or more massive. Since the planets are same mass, the higher K implies shorter period.

Yes, since K2 is larger than K1, planet #2 has a shorter period than planet #1. So P2 is smaller. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, which is option A.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), assuming the planet mass \( M_p \) and star mass \( M_\text{star} \) are constant. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

For the two planets, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is given as \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Thus, the ratio of \( K_1 \) to \( K_2 \) is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Using the proportionality \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3} \), we solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This means planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's. The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, so the ratio \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \) is approximately 0.36.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~0.36**

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1 = (something) * (1 / P1^(1/3) ), K2 = (same something) * (1 / P2^(1/3) )

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Therefore, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me write it as K ∝ (1 / P^(1/3))

So K1 = C / P1^(1/3)
K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no, because K1 = C / P1^(1/3)
K2 = C / P2^(1/3)
So K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Yes.

So, the ratio of K1 to K2 is (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, but in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7. So K1 < K2. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So to find P2/P1, we cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait no, wait: we have K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So to find P2/P1, cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3), then:

(K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the ratio is P2/P1 = 0.364. So it's about 0.36 times. So it's shorter, not longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36.

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Using the proportionality \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3} \), we solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This means planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's. The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, so the ratio \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \) is approximately 0.36.
