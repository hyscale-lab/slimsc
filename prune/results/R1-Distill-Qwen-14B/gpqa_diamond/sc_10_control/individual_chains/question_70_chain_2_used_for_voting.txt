Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down the information given and see what each reaction tells me.

The first part says that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8. I'm trying to think of reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in such a high ratio. Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something else? Or perhaps a metal reacting with a diatomic gas.

Wait, bright red product C. I remember that when sulfur is burned in excess oxygen, it forms SO2, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe when a metal reacts with chlorine gas? Iron reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3, but that's not red. Oh, wait, maybe it's a reaction involving phosphorus? Red phosphorus is a solid, but when it reacts with something... Not sure yet.

Moving on, the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. E is dangerous, so maybe something like chlorine trifluoride or something with fluorine? Alternatively, maybe it's a toxic gas like phosgene, but I'm not sure.

The third reaction says that C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is in water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. Strong acid and weak acid. Strong acids like H2SO4, HCl, HNO3; weak acids like H3PO4, H2S, etc.

Wait, if F is a strong acid and G is weak, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is H3PO4 (weak), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, could it be H2SO4 (strong) and maybe HNO3? Not sure yet.

The fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. Solvents could be something like water, ethanol, maybe something else. Let me think: if B is a gas, maybe O2 or Cl2. D reacting with B in 1:1—could be something like Cl2 + O2 forming some compound. Wait, but H is a solvent. O2 and Cl2 reacting? Maybe to form ClO2? Not sure. Alternatively, if B is H2O, but that's a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2. Let me think: A reacts with 8 equivalents of Cl2 gas. What solid would react with Cl2 in such a ratio? Maybe it's a transition metal. For example, iron reacts with Cl2 in a 1:3 ratio (Fe + 3Cl2 → FeCl3), but here it's 8. Wait, 8 equivalents is 1 mole of A reacting with 8 moles of B. So the formula would be A + 8B → C. If B is Cl2, then each molecule contributes two Cl atoms. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of Cl2 would give 16 Cl atoms. So perhaps A is something like S (sulfur), which reacts with Cl2 to form SCl2, but that's not matching the 8 moles. Wait, maybe A is P (phosphorus). If P reacts with Cl2, it forms PCl5. P has a valency of 5, so each P would need 5 Cl2 molecules to provide 10 Cl atoms? Wait, no. Wait, each PCl5 has 5 Cl per P. So for 1 P, 5 Cl2 would be needed (since each Cl2 gives 2 Cl). So 5 Cl2 → 10 Cl atoms, which gives 2 PCl5 (since each has 5 Cl). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's another element.

Alternatively, thinking about the product when C is made and then reacts with water. If C is, say, SO3, then reacting with water would give H2SO4 and H2O, but that doesn't fit the two acids. Alternatively, if C is CaO, but when it reacts with water, it would form Ca(OH)2, but that's not two acids. Hmm, perhaps C is a salt, and when it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, but F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. Let's think: If C is Na2SO3, then reacting with water would produce 2 NaOH and H2SO3 (which is weak). But that's only one acid. Alternatively, if C is something like NH4NO3, which when heated can decompose, but that's not necessarily in water. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal chloride. Let me think: If C is FeCl3, then when it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze to Fe(OH)3 and HCl. Fe(OH)3 is not an acid, though. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide, but when it reacts with water, it produces H2S (weak acid) and another acid. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of C with water gives back A. So A is the original solid, and the reaction produces two acids. So perhaps A is a metal, and C is its oxide or something else.

Wait, earlier I thought about D reacting with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Let's think about possible B and D. If B is Cl2, then D could be something like O2, but Cl2 + O2 wouldn't form a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is Cl2? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about product E. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces E, which is very hazardous. If E is something like phosgene (COCl2), but how would that form? Alternatively, if E is something like HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous beyond being toxic. Or maybe E is something like H2SO4, but that's a liquid. Alternatively, perhaps E is something like ClF3 or ClF5, which are highly reactive.

Wait, maybe E is Cl2O7 (dichlorine heptoxide), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another thought: E could be a highly toxic gas like sarin or something, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly reactive compound like NO, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me go back to the C reacting with water. Suppose C is SO3. Then, SO3 + H2O → H2SO4 (strong acid) and... Wait, but that's only one acid. Or maybe it's a different oxide. Alternatively, if C is Na2O5 (sodium periodate), then reacting with water would give 2 NaOH and HIO4 (periodic acid). But I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of C with water produces two different acids. So C might be a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids. For example, if C is NaHSO3, then reacting with water would produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (which is a base, not acid). Hmm, not exactly.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a sulfite, nitrite, or similar. For instance, if C is CaSO3, then reacting with water might produce Ca(OH)2 and H2SO3. But again, not two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt. Hmm, not sure. Let me think about the initial reaction: A + 8 B → C. If B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. So the formula would be A + 8 Cl2 → C. So the product C would have 8 Cl atoms from each Cl2 molecule. So if A is something like S (sulfur), then S + 8 Cl2 → SCl2? No, because S has a valence of 2? Wait, no, sulfur typically has a valence of 2, 4, or 6. But 8 Cl2 would contribute 16 Cl atoms. Hmm, perhaps A is a metal with a +3 charge. Let's see: Suppose A is Al. Then, Al + 8 Cl2 → AlCl3? But 1 Al would need 3 Cl2 (6 Cl atoms). So 8 Cl2 would be way more than needed. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe A is a compound with multiple atoms. Let me think, maybe A is P4. Then, P4 + 8 Cl2 → 4 PCl2? But PCl2 is not very common, I think PCl3 and PCl5 are more common. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is not Cl2. Maybe it's another diatomic gas. For example, O2. So A + 8 O2 → C. What solid reacts with O2 to form a red product? Maybe CuO is black, FeO is black, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfur oxide? SO3 is a gas, not a solid. Wait, perhaps A is Fe, and C is Fe3O4? Because Fe reacts with O2 to form Fe3O4, which is a black solid, not red. So that might not fit.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like mercury(II) oxide, but that's red. Or perhaps it's a sulfide or something else. Wait, I remember that PbO2 is dark brown, not red. Maybe it's CuO, which is black, but not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a compound of another element. Wait, what about MnO2? That's a dark brown solid. Maybe not. Alternatively, is there a red oxide? Maybe V2O5 is orange, not red.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur. Sulfur (S8) when burned in O2 forms SO2 (gas) but maybe if it's in excess O2, it forms SO3. But that's a gas as well. Alternatively, maybe when sulfur is treated with Cl2, it forms SCl2, but SCl2 is a liquid, I think. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: The reaction of C with D produces E. D is a gas, and when it reacts with B in 1:1 ratio, it forms H, a solvent. Let's think about B and D. If B is O2 and D is H2, then in 1:1 ratio, they form H2O, which is a solvent. Oh, that makes sense. So D is H2, B is O2. Then H is H2O.

So, if B is O2 and D is H2, then H is H2O (a solvent). That seems plausible.

So, let's re-examine the initial reactions. Solid A reacts with O2 (B) in 8 equivalents to form C. Since O2 is B, and the reaction is A + 8 O2 → C. So, the product C would be a compound formed by A and O. Let me think about a solid that, when reacted with O2 in a high ratio, forms a red product.

Wait, perhaps A is Fe. Fe reacts with O2 to form FeO, Fe3O4, or Fe2O3. FeO is unstable and quickly turns into Fe3O4, which is black. Fe2O3 is reddish, but I'm not sure if it's bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal oxide. Alternatively, maybe A is a non-metal.

Wait, another thought: Sulfur trioxide (SO3) is a gas, but maybe the product C is a solid form, like a hydrate or a different compound. Or perhaps A is another element.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is aluminum. Al reacts with O2 to form Al2O3. Al2O3 is white, but not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, could A be a carbon-based solid? Like graphite or diamond? Unlikely, as their oxides are CO or CO2, which are gases.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Wait, I remember that MnO is a brown solid, but Mn2O5 is dark brown. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide? No, because B is O2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about B being O2. Let me think again about the fourth reaction: D and B in 1:1 ratio form H, a solvent. If D is O2 and B is H2, then H is H2O. That makes sense. Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is O2, same thing.

Wait, but if B is O2 and D is H2, then in the first reaction, A reacts with B (O2) in 8 equivalents to form C. So, A + 8 O2 → C. So, what solid A reacts with O2 in a high ratio to form a bright red product?

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a transition metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, V in +5 oxidation state forms VO2.5, which is a reddish solid. But I'm not entirely sure about its color.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide or another oxygen-containing compound. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a dioxide. Let's think about the reaction. For example, if A is copper, then 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. CuO is black, not red. If A is lead, Pb, then 2 Pb + O2 → 2 PbO, which is yellow, but not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a different kind of compound. Like a nitride? If A is N2, but that's a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur. Let's see: S (sulfur) reacting with O2 to form SO3. But SO3 is a gas, not solid. Unless it's a different form, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite or sulfate. If C is a sulfite, then reacting with water would produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and a base. But in the problem, two acids are formed. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of C with water produces two different acids. For example, if C is something like Ca(ClO)2, then reacting with water might produce HClO (weak acid) and Ca(OH)2 (which isn't an acid). Or maybe C is a more complex compound.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Common strong acids are HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids include H3PO4, H2S, HCN, etc.

If F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (weak), then perhaps C is a sulfide. But when a sulfide reacts with water, it doesn't produce HCl. Wait, unless C is a metal sulfide. Like CuS. CuS + H2O → Cu(OH)2 + H2S↑. But that's one acid (H2S) and a base, which doesn't fit two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacts with water to form Mg(OH)2 and NH3 (which is a weak base, not acid). Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. Na2CO3 reacts with water to give NaOH and CO2 (which is a weak acid, but only one acid). Hmm.

Wait, another thought. Maybe C is a chlorate or some other oxychloride. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed oxide. For example, if C is Pb3O4 (which is a mixture of PbO and Pb2O3), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the reactions again. Let's say B is O2 and D is H2. So, in the first reaction: A + 8 O2 → C. So, A must be a solid that reacts with O2 to form C. C is bright red. Let me think of metals that form red oxides. Oh! I think I remember that Lithium oxide is white, sodium is white, potassium is white. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a +3 oxidation state oxide. Let's say A is Al. Al reacts with O2 to form Al2O3. Al2O3 is white. Not red.

Wait, another thought. Could C be SO3? No, that's a gas. Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound, like a chromium compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is with chlorine gas, not oxygen. Let me re-examine the fourth reaction. D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. If B is Cl2 and D is something else, maybe O2? No, because Cl2 and O2 would require more than 1:1. Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is Cl2. H2 and Cl2 react in 1:1 to form HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is something else. No, because H2O is a liquid.

Wait, perhaps B is H2 and D is O2. Then, H is H2O. So, in the first reaction, A reacts with H2 (B) in 8 equivalents to form C. But no, the initial statement says B is a gas. So B is H2, which is a gas.

Wait, but the first reaction is A (solid) + B (gas) → C. So B is H2? So A reacts with H2 in 8 equivalents. What solid reacts with hydrogen in such a ratio? Maybe a transition metal, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about E. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. D is a gas. If D is H2, then C + 2 H2 → E. E is dangerous. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2. Then, B is something else that forms H when reacted with D in 1:1. Wait, maybe B is H2 and D is Cl2. H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl (which is a gas, not a solvent). So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. So, in the fourth reaction, O2 + H2 → H2O (solvent). That makes sense.

So, B is O2, D is H2. So in the first reaction, A reacts with O2 (8 equivalents) to form C. And C is bright red.

Wait, maybe A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Hmm, perhaps A is iron and C is Fe3O4. But Fe3O4 is black, not red. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Wait, I'm stuck on this.

Another thought: Maybe C is a different kind of compound. For example, maybe it's a nitride or a sulfide. But earlier, I thought of B as O2, so C would be an oxide.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is a non-metal that forms a red oxide. For example, lead dioxide (PbO2) is dark brown. Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is orange. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the symmetry of E. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

So, knowing what E is would help. Let me think about the possible structures of E.

If E is a molecule with a certain symmetry, then its point group would be one of these. For example, O2 is D∞h. Cl2 is also D∞h. H2O is C2v. CO2 is D∞h. SF6 is Oh. SO3 is D3h.

Wait, the options given are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. So, D4h is a point group with a fourfold axis and horizontal mirror planes. D∞h has an infinite symmetry along an axis.

Hmm. Let me try to think of E as a molecule with D∞h symmetry. What molecule has that? For example, O2 has D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, then the symmetry is D∞h. But E is produced when C reacts with D (H2) in 2 equivalents. So C + 2 H2 → E. If E is O2, then that would require C to be something that releases O2 when reacted with H2. That doesn't make much sense, unless C is O3 or another oxygen-containing compound.

Alternatively, perhaps E is another molecule with D∞h symmetry. Like Cl2. If E is Cl2, then C + 2 H2 → Cl2. That doesn't make sense, as H2 and Cl2 usually form HCl.

Wait, perhaps E is a different molecule. Let me think of other possibilities.

Alternatively, maybe E is a diatomic molecule with a linear structure, which would have D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, Cl2, etc., then the symmetry is D∞h.

But if E is O2, then how does that fit into the reactions?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to piece together the compounds.

- B is O2 (since in the fourth reaction, D is H2, B is O2 → H2O)
- So, first reaction: A (solid) + 8 O2 → C (bright red)
- Second reaction: C + 2 H2 → E (extremely hazardous)
- Third reaction: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)

So, let's figure out what C could be.

If A is a metal, when it reacts with O2 in a high ratio, perhaps it forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, Fe reacting with O2 forms Fe3O4, which is black, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is SO3. But SO3 is a gas, not a solid. Alternatively, maybe C is a solid form of a sulfur oxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a different kind of compound. Let me think about the third reaction again. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is strong acid, G is weak acid.

What if C is a sulfate? For example, if C is CaSO4, then reacting with water might not produce acids. Alternatively, if C is a sulfite, like CaSO3, then reacting with water could produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and Ca(OH)2. But that's only one acid, not two.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed oxide. For example, if C is Na2O2 (sodium peroxide), then reacting with water would produce NaOH and O2. But NaOH is a strong base, not acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a metal chloride. For example, if C is AlCl3, then reacting with water would not produce acids but hydrolyze to form HCl and Al(OH)3. HCl is a strong acid, and Al(OH)3 is amphoteric, but not an acid. So that would give only one acid, HCl.

Wait, but the problem states two different acids F and G. So, perhaps C is a more complex salt.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate. For example, if C is Ca(NO3)2, then reacting with water would just stay as is, not produce acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the initial steps. 

Wait, maybe A is carbon. Carbon reacts with O2 in a high ratio. Well, carbon can form CO or CO2, but those are gases. C would form a gas, not a solid. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Wait, I'm not recalling any. Alternatively, maybe the product C is not an oxide but another compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. If C is a sulfide, then reacting with water might produce H2S (weak acid) and another acid. For example, if C is FeS, then FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 and H2S↑. But that's only one acid. Alternatively, if C is a metal carbide, like CaC2, which reacts with water to produce C2H2 (acetylene) and Ca(OH)2. Not acids.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reaction C + 2 H2 → E. E is extremely hazardous. So, if H2 is D, then E is a product of C and H2. For C, perhaps it's a compound that when reacted with H2 gives a dangerous gas. Maybe E is HCN, but that would require C to be a cyanide, but I'm not sure how that fits.

Alternatively, if E is NH3, but that's not extremely hazardous in low concentrations. Alternatively, E could be something like HCl, but that's not from C + H2.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. For example, O2 or Cl2 have D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, then the symmetry is D∞h. But how would C react with H2 to form O2? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe E is Cl2. Then C + 2 H2 → Cl2. But that would imply C is Cl- something, and H2 is fuel, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps E is a different molecule. Maybe E is a more complex molecule, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction C + 2 H2 → E is a decomposition reaction. Maybe C is a compound that releases E when heated with H2. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about E's structure. If E has D∞h symmetry, possible candidates are O2, Cl2, CO2 (but CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry). So, if E is CO2, then the symmetry is D∞h. But how would that fit?

Wait, but CO2 is a product of what reaction? Let me think: If C is a carbonate, then reacting with H2 (D) would produce CO2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (H2) to form E. So C + 2 H2 → E. If E is CO2, then what would C be? Maybe a carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is another diatomic molecule. For example, if E is N2O, but that's not D∞h.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the possible structures of E based on the options.

The options for the symmetry group are:

A) C2: This is a twofold rotation axis. A molecule like H2O has C2v symmetry, not C2. Maybe a molecule like CS2 or something else.

B) D4h: This has a fourfold axis and horizontal mirrors. Examples include SO2 (but SO2 has D∞h symmetry, doesn't it? Or is it D3h?), or maybe something else.

Wait, SO2 has a bent structure, which is V-shaped, so its symmetry is D∞h? Or is it C2v? Wait, no. SO2 is a bent molecule with a bond angle around 120 degrees. Its point group is D3h because it has a threefold axis (from the three atoms: S, O, O), but wait, actually, the molecule has a C2 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and two mirror planes. So I think SO2 is D∞h? Or maybe C2v. I'm getting a bit confused here.

C) D∞h: This is a linear molecule with inversion and other symmetry elements. O2, Cl2, CO2, etc., have D∞h symmetry.

D) C2v: This is a bent molecule with a twofold axis and two vertical mirror planes. H2O has C2v symmetry.

So, if E is O2, then its symmetry is D∞h. If E is H2O, it's C2v. If E is CO2, it's D∞h.

But E is extremely hazardous. O2 is not extremely hazardous on its own, but perhaps in high concentrations. Alternatively, if E is Cl2, which is highly toxic.

Wait, Cl2 has D∞h symmetry. So if E is Cl2, then the symmetry group is D∞h.

So, how would Cl2 form from C reacting with H2? That would require C to be something that, when reacted with H2, releases Cl2. That seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound.

Wait, let me think of the first reaction. If A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C, and C is a chloride. For example, if A is Cl2, but that's a gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a high chloride. For example, if A is Fe, then 8 equivalents of Cl2 would form FeCl4? But FeCl4 is not a common compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a different metal.

Wait, perhaps I should pivot. If E is Cl2, then its symmetry is D∞h. So the answer would be option C) D∞h.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me see if I can find another way to confirm.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of compound E based on the given reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - The high stoichiometric ratio (1:8) suggests that each molecule of A reacts with 8 molecules of B.  
   - B is likely a diatomic gas. If B is O₂, A could be a metal or non-metal forming a high oxidation state compound.  
   - The bright red color of C suggests it might be a compound like SO₃ or a red oxide, though no definitive identification is made here.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce extremely hazardous product E.  
   - D is a gas, and E is described as highly dangerous.  
   - If D is H₂, E could be a diatomic molecule like O₂ or Cl₂, both of which are highly reactive or toxic.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak).  
   - This indicates that C is likely an oxide or chloride that hydrolyzes to form acids.  
   - For example, if C is SO₃, it could hydrolyze to form H₂SO₄ (strong acid) and H₂O, though this does not fully align with the two acids described.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.  
   - If B is O₂ and D is H₂, their reaction forms H₂O, a common solvent. This suggests B = O₂ and D = H₂.

5. **Symmetry of E**:  
   - The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E.  
   - If E is O₂ or Cl₂, both are linear diatomic molecules with D∞h symmetry.  
   - Other options like H₂O (C₂v) or SO₂ (D∞h or C₂v) were considered but do not align as well with the description of E as extremely hazardous.  
   - Given the options provided, the most likely symmetry group for E is D∞h, consistent with linear diatomic molecules like O₂ or Cl₂.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.  
Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down the information given and see what each reaction tells me.

The first part says that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8. I'm trying to think of reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in such a high ratio. Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something else? Or perhaps a metal reacting with a diatomic gas.

Wait, bright red product C. I remember that when sulfur is burned in excess oxygen, it forms SO2, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe when a metal reacts with chlorine gas? Iron reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3, but that's not red. Oh, wait, maybe it's a reaction involving phosphorus? Red phosphorus is a solid, but when it reacts with something... Not sure yet.

Moving on, the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. E is dangerous, so maybe something like chlorine trifluoride or something with fluorine? Alternatively, maybe it's a toxic gas like phosgene, but I'm not sure.

The third reaction says that C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is in water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. Strong acid and weak acid. Strong acids like H2SO4, HCl, HNO3; weak acids like H3PO4, H2S, etc.

Wait, if F is a strong acid and G is weak, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is H3PO4 (weak), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, could it be H2SO4 (strong) and maybe HNO3? Not sure yet.

The fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. Solvents could be something like water, ethanol, maybe something else. Let me think: if B is a gas, maybe O2 or Cl2. D reacting with B in 1:1—could be something like Cl2 + O2 forming some compound. Wait, but H is a solvent. O2 and Cl2 reacting? Maybe to form ClO2? Not sure. Alternatively, if B is H2O, but that's a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2. Let me think: A reacts with 8 equivalents of Cl2 gas. What solid would react with Cl2 in such a ratio? Maybe it's a transition metal. For example, iron reacts with Cl2 in a 1:3 ratio (Fe + 3Cl2 → FeCl3), but here it's 8. Wait, 8 equivalents is 1 mole of A reacting with 8 moles of B. So the formula would be A + 8B → C. If B is Cl2, then each molecule contributes two Cl atoms. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of Cl2 would give 16 Cl atoms. So perhaps A is something like S (sulfur), which reacts with Cl2 to form SCl2, but that's not matching the 8 moles. Wait, maybe A is P (phosphorus). If P reacts with Cl2, it forms PCl5. P has a valency of 5, so each P would need 5 Cl2 molecules to provide 10 Cl atoms? Wait, no. Wait, each PCl5 has 5 Cl per P. So for 1 P, 5 Cl2 would be needed (since each Cl2 gives 2 Cl). So 5 Cl2 → 10 Cl atoms, which gives 2 PCl5 (since each has 5 Cl). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's another element.

Alternatively, thinking about the product when C is made and then reacts with water. If C is, say, SO3, then reacting with water would give H2SO4 and H2O, but that doesn't fit the two acids. Alternatively, if C is CaO, but when it reacts with water, it would form Ca(OH)2, but that's not two acids. Hmm, perhaps C is a salt, and when it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, but F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. Let's think: If C is Na2SO3, then reacting with water would produce 2 NaOH and H2SO3 (which is weak). But that's only one acid. Alternatively, if C is something like NH4NO3, which when heated can decompose, but that's not necessarily in water. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal chloride. Let me think: If C is FeCl3, then when it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze to Fe(OH)3 and HCl. Fe(OH)3 is not an acid, though. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide, but when it reacts with water, it produces H2S (weak acid) and another acid. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of C with water gives back A. So A is the original solid, and the reaction produces two acids. So perhaps A is a metal, and C is its oxide or something else.

Wait, earlier I thought about D reacting with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Let's think about possible B and D. If B is Cl2, then D could be something like O2, but Cl2 + O2 wouldn't form a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is Cl2? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about product E. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces E, which is very hazardous. If E is something like phosgene (COCl2), but how would that form? Alternatively, if E is something like HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous beyond being toxic. Or maybe E is something like H2SO4, but that's a liquid. Alternatively, perhaps E is something like ClF3 or ClF5, which are highly reactive.

Wait, maybe E is Cl2O7 (dichlorine heptoxide), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another thought: E could be a highly toxic gas like sarin or something, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly reactive compound like NO, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me go back to the C reacting with water. Suppose C is SO3. Then, SO3 + H2O → H2SO4 (strong acid) and... Wait, but that's only one acid. Or maybe it's a different oxide. Alternatively, if C is Na2O5 (sodium periodate), then reacting with water would give 2 NaOH and HIO4 (periodic acid). But I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of C with water produces two different acids. So C might be a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids. For example, if C is NaHSO3, then reacting with water would produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (which is a base, not acid). Hmm, not exactly.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a sulfite, nitrite, or similar. For instance, if C is CaSO3, then reacting with water might produce Ca(OH)2 and H2SO3. But again, not two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt. Hmm, not sure. Let me think about the initial reaction: A + 8 B → C. If B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. So the formula would be A + 8 Cl2 → C. So the product C would have 8 Cl atoms from each Cl2 molecule. So if A is something like S (sulfur), then S + 8 Cl2 → SCl2? No, because S has a valence of 2? Wait, no, sulfur typically has a valence of 2, 4, or 6. But 8 Cl2 would contribute 16 Cl atoms. Hmm, perhaps A is a metal with a +3 charge. Let's see: Suppose A is Al. Then, Al + 8 Cl2 → AlCl3? But 1 Al would need 3 Cl2 (6 Cl atoms). So 8 Cl2 would be way more than needed. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe A is a compound with multiple atoms. Let me think, maybe A is P4. Then, P4 + 8 Cl2 → 4 PCl2? But PCl2 is not very common, I think PCl3 and PCl5 are more common. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is not Cl2. Maybe it's another diatomic gas. For example, O2. So A + 8 O2 → C. What solid reacts with O2 to form a red product? Maybe CuO is black, FeO is black, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfur oxide? SO3 is a gas, not a solid. Wait, perhaps A is Fe, and C is Fe3O4? Because Fe reacts with O2 to form Fe3O4, which is a black solid, not red. So that might not fit.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like mercury(II) oxide, but that's red. Or perhaps it's a sulfide or something else. Wait, I remember that PbO2 is dark brown, not red. Maybe it's CuO, which is black, but not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a compound of another element. Wait, what about MnO2? That's a dark brown solid. Maybe not. Alternatively, is there a red oxide? Maybe V2O5 is orange, not red.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur. Sulfur (S8) when burned in O2 forms SO2 (gas) but maybe if it's in excess O2, it forms SO3. But that's a gas as well. Alternatively, maybe when sulfur is treated with Cl2, it forms SCl2, but SCl2 is a liquid, I think. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: The reaction of C with D produces E. D is a gas, and when it reacts with B in 1:1 ratio, it forms H, a solvent. Let's think about B and D. If B is O2 and D is H2, then in 1:1 ratio, they form H2O, which is a solvent. Oh, that makes sense. So D is H2, B is O2. Then H is H2O.

So, if B is O2 and D is H2, then H is H2O (a solvent). That seems plausible.

So, let's re-examine the initial reactions. Solid A reacts with O2 (B) in 8 equivalents to form C. Since O2 is B, and the reaction is A + 8 O2 → C. So, the product C would be a compound formed by A and O. Let me think about a solid that, when reacted with O2 in a high ratio, forms a red product.

Wait, perhaps A is Fe. Fe reacts with O2 to form FeO, Fe3O4, or Fe2O3. FeO is unstable and quickly turns into Fe3O4, which is black. Fe2O3 is reddish, but I'm not sure if it's bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal oxide. Alternatively, maybe A is a non-metal.

Wait, another thought: Sulfur trioxide (SO3) is a gas, but maybe the product C is a solid form, like a hydrate or a different compound. Or perhaps A is another element.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is aluminum. Al reacts with O2 to form Al2O3. Al2O3 is white, but not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, could A be a carbon-based solid? Like graphite or diamond? Unlikely, as their oxides are CO or CO2, which are gases.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Wait, I remember that MnO is a brown solid, but Mn2O5 is dark brown. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide? No, because B is O2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about B being O2. Let me think again about the fourth reaction: D and B in 1:1 ratio form H, a solvent. If D is O2 and B is H2, then H is H2O. That makes sense. Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is O2, same thing.

Wait, but if B is O2 and D is H2, then in the first reaction, A reacts with B (O2) in 8 equivalents to form C. So, A + 8 O2 → C. So, what solid A reacts with O2 in a high ratio to form a bright red product?

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a transition metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, V in +5 oxidation state forms VO2.5, which is a reddish solid. But I'm not entirely sure about its color.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide or another oxygen-containing compound. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a dioxide. Let's think about the reaction. For example, if A is copper, then 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. CuO is black, not red. If A is lead, Pb, then 2 Pb + O2 → 2 PbO, which is yellow, but not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a different kind of compound. Like a nitride? If A is N2, but that's a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur. Let's see: S (sulfur) reacting with O2 to form SO3. But SO3 is a gas, not solid. Unless it's a different form, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite or sulfate. If C is a sulfite, then reacting with water would produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and a base. But in the problem, two acids are formed. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of C with water produces two different acids. For example, if C is something like Ca(ClO)2, then reacting with water might produce HClO (weak acid) and Ca(OH)2 (which isn't an acid). Or maybe C is a more complex compound.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Common strong acids are HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids include H3PO4, H2S, HCN, etc.

If F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (weak), then perhaps C is a sulfide. But when a sulfide reacts with water, it doesn't produce HCl. Wait, unless C is a metal sulfide. Like CuS. CuS + H2O → Cu(OH)2 + H2S↑. But that's one acid (H2S) and a base, which doesn't fit two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacts with water to form Mg(OH)2 and NH3 (which is a weak base, not acid). Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. Na2CO3 reacts with water to give NaOH and CO2 (which is a weak acid, but only one acid). Hmm.

Wait, another thought. Maybe C is a chlorate or some other oxychloride. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed oxide. For example, if C is Pb3O4 (which is a mixture of PbO and Pb2O3), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the reactions again. Let's say B is O2 and D is H2. So, in the first reaction: A + 8 O2 → C. So, A must be a solid that reacts with O2 to form C. C is bright red. Let me think of metals that form red oxides. Oh! I think I remember that Lithium oxide is white, sodium is white, potassium is white. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a +3 oxidation state oxide. Let's say A is Al. Al reacts with O2 to form Al2O3. Al2O3 is white. Not red.

Wait, another thought. Could C be SO3? No, that's a gas. Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound, like a chromium compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is with chlorine gas, not oxygen. Let me re-examine the fourth reaction. D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. If B is Cl2 and D is something else, maybe O2? No, because Cl2 and O2 would require more than 1:1. Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is Cl2. H2 and Cl2 react in 1:1 to form HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is something else. No, because H2O is a liquid.

Wait, perhaps B is H2 and D is O2. Then, H is H2O. So, in the first reaction, A reacts with H2 (B) in 8 equivalents to form C. But no, the initial statement says B is a gas. So B is H2, which is a gas.

Wait, but the first reaction is A (solid) + B (gas) → C. So B is H2? So A reacts with H2 in 8 equivalents. What solid reacts with hydrogen in such a ratio? Maybe a transition metal, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about E. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. D is a gas. If D is H2, then C + 2 H2 → E. E is dangerous. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2. Then, B is something else that forms H when reacted with D in 1:1. Wait, maybe B is H2 and D is Cl2. H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl (which is a gas, not a solvent). So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. So, in the fourth reaction, O2 + H2 → H2O (solvent). That makes sense.

So, B is O2, D is H2. So in the first reaction, A reacts with O2 (8 equivalents) to form C. And C is bright red.

Wait, maybe A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Hmm, perhaps A is iron and C is Fe3O4. But Fe3O4 is black, not red. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Wait, I'm stuck on this.

Another thought: Maybe C is a different kind of compound. For example, maybe it's a nitride or a sulfide. But earlier, I thought of B as O2, so C would be an oxide.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is a non-metal that forms a red oxide. For example, lead dioxide (PbO2) is dark brown. Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is orange. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the symmetry of E. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

So, knowing what E is would help. Let me think about the possible structures of E.

If E is a molecule with a certain symmetry, then its point group would be one of these. For example, O2 is D∞h. Cl2 is also D∞h. H2O is C2v. CO2 is D∞h. SF6 is Oh. SO3 is D3h.

Wait, the options given are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. So, D4h is a point group with a fourfold axis and horizontal mirror planes. D∞h has an infinite symmetry along an axis.

Hmm. Let me try to think of E as a molecule with D∞h symmetry. What molecule has that? For example, O2 has D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, then the symmetry is D∞h. But E is produced when C reacts with D (H2) in 2 equivalents. So C + 2 H2 → E. If E is O2, then that would require C to be something that releases O2 when reacted with H2. That doesn't make much sense, unless C is O3 or another oxygen-containing compound.

Alternatively, perhaps E is another molecule with D∞h symmetry. Like Cl2. If E is Cl2, then C + 2 H2 → Cl2. That doesn't make sense, as H2 and Cl2 usually form HCl.

Wait, perhaps E is a different molecule. Let me think of other possibilities.

Alternatively, maybe E is a diatomic molecule with a linear structure, which would have D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, Cl2, etc., then the symmetry is D∞h.

But if E is O2, then how does that fit into the reactions?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to piece together the compounds.

- B is O2 (since in the fourth reaction, D is H2, B is O2 → H2O)
- So, first reaction: A (solid) + 8 O2 → C (bright red)
- Second reaction: C + 2 H2 → E (extremely hazardous)
- Third reaction: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)

So, let's figure out what C could be.

If A is a metal, when it reacts with O2 in a high ratio, perhaps it forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, Fe reacting with O2 forms Fe3O4, which is black, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is SO3. But SO3 is a gas, not a solid. Alternatively, maybe C is a solid form of a sulfur oxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a different kind of compound. Let me think about the third reaction again. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is strong acid, G is weak acid.

What if C is a sulfate? For example, if C is CaSO4, then reacting with water might not produce acids. Alternatively, if C is a sulfite, like CaSO3, then reacting with water could produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and Ca(OH)2. But that's only one acid, not two.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed oxide. For example, if C is Na2O2 (sodium peroxide), then reacting with water would produce NaOH and O2. But NaOH is a strong base, not acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a metal chloride. For example, if C is AlCl3, then reacting with water would not produce acids but hydrolyze to form HCl and Al(OH)3. HCl is a strong acid, and Al(OH)3 is amphoteric, but not an acid. So that would give only one acid, HCl.

Wait, but the problem states two different acids F and G. So, perhaps C is a more complex salt.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate. For example, if C is Ca(NO3)2, then reacting with water would just stay as is, not produce acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the initial steps. 

Wait, maybe A is carbon. Carbon reacts with O2 in a high ratio. Well, carbon can form CO or CO2, but those are gases. C would form a gas, not a solid. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Wait, I'm not recalling any. Alternatively, maybe the product C is not an oxide but another compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. If C is a sulfide, then reacting with water might produce H2S (weak acid) and another acid. For example, if C is FeS, then FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 and H2S↑. But that's only one acid. Alternatively, if C is a metal carbide, like CaC2, which reacts with water to produce C2H2 (acetylene) and Ca(OH)2. Not acids.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reaction C + 2 H2 → E. E is extremely hazardous. So, if H2 is D, then E is a product of C and H2. For C, perhaps it's a compound that when reacted with H2 gives a dangerous gas. Maybe E is HCN, but that would require C to be a cyanide, but I'm not sure how that fits.

Alternatively, if E is NH3, but that's not extremely hazardous in low concentrations. Alternatively, E could be something like HCl, but that's not from C + H2.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. For example, O2 or Cl2 have D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, then the symmetry is D∞h. But how would C react with H2 to form O2? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe E is Cl2. Then C + 2 H2 → Cl2. But that would imply C is Cl- something, and H2 is fuel, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps E is a different molecule. Maybe E is a more complex molecule, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction C + 2 H2 → E is a decomposition reaction. Maybe C is a compound that releases E when heated with H2. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about E's structure. If E has D∞h symmetry, possible candidates are O2, Cl2, CO2 (but CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry). So, if E is CO2, then the symmetry is D∞h. But how would that fit?

Wait, but CO2 is a product of what reaction? Let me think: If C is a carbonate, then reacting with H2 (D) would produce CO2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (H2) to form E. So C + 2 H2 → E. If E is CO2, then what would C be? Maybe a carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is another diatomic molecule. For example, if E is N2O, but that's not D∞h.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the possible structures of E based on the options.

The options for the symmetry group are:

A) C2: This is a twofold rotation axis. A molecule like H2O has C2v symmetry, not C2. Maybe a molecule like CS2 or something else.

B) D4h: This has a fourfold axis and horizontal mirrors. Examples include SO2 (but SO2 has D∞h symmetry, doesn't it? Or is it D3h?), or maybe something else.

Wait, SO2 has a bent structure, which is V-shaped, so its symmetry is D∞h? Or is it C2v? Wait, no. SO2 is a bent molecule with a bond angle around 120 degrees. Its point group is D3h because it has a threefold axis (from the three atoms: S, O, O), but wait, actually, the molecule has a C2 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and two mirror planes. So I think SO2 is D∞h? Or maybe C2v. I'm getting a bit confused here.

C) D∞h: This is a linear molecule with inversion and other symmetry elements. O2, Cl2, CO2, etc., have D∞h symmetry.

D) C2v: This is a bent molecule with a twofold axis and two vertical mirror planes. H2O has C2v symmetry.

So, if E is O2, then its symmetry is D∞h. If E is H2O, it's C2v. If E is CO2, it's D∞h.

But E is extremely hazardous. O2 is not extremely hazardous on its own, but perhaps in high concentrations. Alternatively, if E is Cl2, which is highly toxic.

Wait, Cl2 has D∞h symmetry. So if E is Cl2, then the symmetry group is D∞h.

So, how would Cl2 form from C reacting with H2? That would require C to be something that, when reacted with H2, releases Cl2. That seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound.

Wait, let me think of the first reaction. If A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C, and C is a chloride. For example, if A is Cl2, but that's a gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a high chloride. For example, if A is Fe, then 8 equivalents of Cl2 would form FeCl4? But FeCl4 is not a common compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a different metal.

Wait, perhaps I should pivot. If E is Cl2, then its symmetry is D∞h. So the answer would be option C) D∞h.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me see if I can find another way to confirm.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of compound E based on the given reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - The high stoichiometric ratio (1:8) suggests that each molecule of A reacts with 8 molecules of B.  
   - B is likely a diatomic gas. If B is O₂, A could be a metal or non-metal forming a high oxidation state compound.  
   - The bright red color of C suggests it might be a compound like SO₃ or a red oxide, though no definitive identification is made here.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce extremely hazardous product E.  
   - D is a gas, and E is described as highly dangerous.  
   - If D is H₂, E could be a diatomic molecule like O₂ or Cl₂, both of which are highly reactive or toxic.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak).  
   - This indicates that C is likely an oxide or chloride that hydrolyzes to form acids.  
   - For example, if C is SO₃, it could hydrolyze to form H₂SO₄ (strong acid) and H₂O, though this does not fully align with the two acids described.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.  
   - If B is O₂ and D is H₂, their reaction forms H₂O, a common solvent. This suggests B = O₂ and D = H₂.

5. **Symmetry of E**:  
   - The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E.  
   - If E is O₂ or Cl₂, both are linear diatomic molecules with D∞h symmetry.  
   - Other options like H₂O (C₂v) or SO₂ (D∞h or C₂v) were considered but do not align as well with the description of E as extremely hazardous.  
   - Given the options provided, the most likely symmetry group for E is D∞h, consistent with linear diatomic molecules like O₂ or Cl₂.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.  
Answer: C
