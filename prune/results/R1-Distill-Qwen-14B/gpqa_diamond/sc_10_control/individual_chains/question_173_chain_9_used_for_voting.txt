Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about estimating the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron. The given information is that the electron is traveling at a speed v = 2 × 10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. The options are from A to D, each representing different orders of magnitude in joules.

Hmm, right. So this seems like a problem involving Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. I remember that the Uncertainty Principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The principle is often expressed as Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Since the question is about the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), I think I need to relate this to the uncertainty in momentum. Because energy and momentum are related, especially in the context of the Uncertainty Principle. For a non-relativistic particle, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So if I can find the uncertainty in momentum, I can find the uncertainty in energy.

First, let's jot down the given values:

- v = 2 × 10^8 m/s (electron speed)
- Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^(-9) meters = 1 × 10^(-10) m

Wait, but wait. The speed is given as v, but the momentum is p = m*v. But since the electron is moving at a high speed, I should consider whether relativistic effects are important. Wait, 2×10^8 m/s is about 66% the speed of light (since c is ~3×10^8 m/s), so relativistic effects might be non-negligible. But I'm not sure if the problem expects me to use the relativistic formula for momentum or not.

But maybe the problem is intended to be solved using the non-relativistic approach. Let me proceed with non-relativistic first and see.

So, for a non-relativistic particle, the momentum p is m*v, where m is the mass of the electron. The mass of an electron is about 9.1 × 10^(-31) kg.

But wait, the problem gives us Δx, the uncertainty in position. Using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the minimum uncertainty in momentum Δp is approximately ħ/(2Δx). But sometimes, the approximate minimum is considered as ħ/(Δx) because the ½ factor is considered part of the uncertainty in practice.

Wait, the exact expression is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty would be when Δp = ħ/(2Δx). So using that, perhaps.

So let me compute Δp.

Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m.

So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). But wait, I've also heard that sometimes people use Δp ≈ ħ/Δx as an order-of-magnitude estimate. Because the factor of 2 is small compared to the uncertainties. Maybe the question is looking for an approximate estimate, so I can use Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx).

Let me compute both ways.

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. So ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s.

So using Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx):

Δp = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-10 m) = 1.05e-24 kg·m/s.

If I take the 2 into account, it would be half that, ~5e-25 kg·m/s. But since we're looking for an approximate order of magnitude, either way, it's going to be on the order of 1e-24.

Now, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m). So the uncertainty in energy ΔE will be (Δp)^2/(2m).

Let me compute that.

ΔE ≈ ( (Δp)^2 ) / (2m )

Plugging in the numbers:

( (1e-24)^2 ) / (2 * 9.1e-31 )

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

(1e-24)^2 = 1e-48.

Denominator is 2 * 9.1e-31 = 1.82e-30.

So ΔE ≈ (1e-48) / (1.82e-30) = approximately 5.5e-19 J.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, (1e-24)^2 is 1e-48. 1e-48 divided by ~1.82e-30 is (1 / 1.82 ) * 1e-48+30 = approx 0.55 * 1e-18 = 5.5e-19 J.

So that's about 1e-19 J. Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J.

But wait, I used Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx) which is 1e-24 kg·m/s. But if I had used the minimum uncertainty as ħ/(2Δx), then Δp would be 5e-25 kg·m/s.

Let me see what effect that would have on ΔE.

(5e-25)^2 = 25e-50 = 2.5e-49.

Divide by 1.82e-30: 2.5e-49 / 1.82e-30 ≈ 1.37e-19 J.

Which is about the same order of magnitude, 1e-19 J. So even if I include the factor of 2, it's still around 1e-19.

So option C is 1e-19 J.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I haven't missed any exponents.

Δp is ħ/(Δx) = (1e-34 / 1e-10) ) → Wait, no, I think I messed up the exponents earlier. Wait, ħ is 1e-34 J·s, and Δx is 1e-10 m.

So 1e-34 divided by 1e-10 is 1e-24. So that's correct.

So (1e-24)^2 is 1e-48.

Divided by 2*(9.1e-31 kg) → 1.82e-30 kg.

So 1e-48 / 1.82e-30 = (1 /1.82 ) * 1e-18 ≈ 0.55 * 1e-18 = 5.5e-19 J.

Which is 5.5e-19 J, so ~1e-18? Wait, no, 5.5e-19 is 5.5 × 10^-19, which is option C.

But wait, I think I should also think about relativistic effects. Because 2e8 m/s is about 0.666c, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light. So using the non-relativistic kinetic energy formula might not be accurate.

Wait, the relativistic kinetic energy is given by E = (γ - 1)mc², where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since the question is about the uncertainty in energy, perhaps it's better to use relativistic momentum. Hmm, this could complicate things.

But wait, the problem statement just says to estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy. Maybe it's intended to use the non-relativistic approach, given the nature of the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy uncertainty is just the kinetic energy uncertainty, so even if the speed is relativistic, but the momentum is known, so we can proceed.

Wait, but the point is, the momentum uncertainty comes from the position uncertainty via the Uncertainty Principle, which is a quantum mechanical concept, and the energy uncertainty would be based on that.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on whether to use relativistic momentum or not. Let me think.

If I use relativistic momentum, p = γmv, where γ is the Lorentz factor, sqrt(1/(1 - (v²/c²))).

But let's compute γ for v=2e8 m/s.

v = 2e8 m/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

v²/c² = (4e16)/(9e16) ) = 4/9 ≈ 0.4444.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.4444 = 0.5556.

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(0.5556) ≈ 0.7454.

So γ = 1 / 0.7454 ≈ 1.342.

So γ is approximately 1.34. So the relativistic momentum would be p = γmv ≈ 1.34 * m_e * v.

But when considering the uncertainty in momentum, since Δp is based on the Uncertainty Principle, and v is given, but Δp is ħ/(Δx), which doesn't depend on v directly.

Wait, but wait, no. The momentum is p = γmv, but the uncertainty in momentum comes from the Uncertainty Principle, which is Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx), so the same as before.

But when calculating the energy, if I use the relativistic energy, then E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ), but that's for the total energy.

But the kinetic energy is E_kinetic = E - mc².

Alternatively, the kinetic energy can be written as (p²c²)/(2γ m c²) ? Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe the non-relativistic approach is acceptable, but perhaps we should use the relativistic formula for kinetic energy.

Wait, but the problem is about the uncertainty in energy, so maybe the approach is simply to use ΔE = ΔK ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m), regardless of whether the speed is relativistic or not.

But maybe the correct approach is to calculate Δp as before, and then compute the kinetic energy uncertainty based on whether the speed is relativistic.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, E = p²/(2m). In the relativistic case, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ), which is the total energy.

But the kinetic energy is E_kinetic = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ) - mc².

But for small p, E_kinetic ≈ pc²/(2m), but when p is not small, the approximation isn't valid.

Wait, let me think about the magnitude of p in this case.

Δp is about 1e-24 kg m/s.

Mass of electron m = 9.1e-31 kg.

mc² = 9.1e-31 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 9.1e-31 * 9e16 = 8.19e-14 J.

Now, pc = (1e-24 kg m/s) * 3e8 m/s = 3e-16 J.

So pc is 3e-16 J, mc² is 8e-14 J. So pc is about 3.7% of mc².

So perhaps the non-relativistic approximation is not perfect, but it's probably acceptable for an order of magnitude estimate.

So using the non-relativistic formula, ΔE ≈ ( (1e-24)^2 ) / (2 * 9.1e-31 )

Compute that:

(1e-24)^2 = 1e-48.

Divide by 2 * 9.1e-31 → 1.82e-30.

So 1e-48 / 1.82e-30 = 5.5e-19 J.

Which is 5.5e-19 J, so the order is 1e-19, which is option C.

But wait, another approach: perhaps instead of using the kinetic energy, we can calculate the momentum and then compute the uncertainty in energy using the relativistic formula.

Let me try that.

Compute the relativistic energy E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 )

So ΔE would be the uncertainty in E. But since we're dealing with the uncertainty in p (Δp), E depends on p, so the uncertainty in E can be found by taking the derivative.

But this seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can approximate.

Let me denote E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 )

The uncertainty in E, ΔE, is approximately |dE/dp| * Δp.

dE/dp = (pc) / sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 )

So ΔE ≈ [ (pc) / E ] * Δp

But E ≈ mc² when p is small compared to mc. But in our case, p is about 1e-24 kg m/s.

Wait, let me compute pc and mc^2.

pc = (1e-24 kg m/s) * (3e8 m/s) = 3e-16 J.

mc² = (9.1e-31 kg) * (9e16 m²/s²) )= 8.19e-14 J.

So pc is about 3.67e-3 times mc². So about 0.367% of mc². So E is approximately mc² + (pc)^2/(2mc²), but that's the non-relativistic approximation.

Wait, but let's compute E:

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 )

= sqrt( (3e-16)^2 + (8.19e-14)^2 )

= sqrt( 9e-32 + 6.7e-27 )

≈ sqrt(6.7e-27) ≈ 8.19e-14 J.

So E is approximately mc², which is 8.19e-14 J.

So dE/dp is (pc) / E = (3e-16) / 8.19e-14 ≈ 3e-3.

So ΔE ≈ (3e-3) * Δp.

Wait, Δp is 1e-24 kg m/s. So ΔE ≈ 3e-3 * 1e-24 = 3e-27 J.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier the non-relativistic approach gave 5e-19 J. There's a huge discrepancy here.

Wait, why is that? Because the relativistic approach for E as a function of p leads to a very small ΔE when E is approximately mc², because the derivative is small.

But that's contradictory to the earlier non-relativistic approach. Hmm. Where am I wrong here?

Wait, perhaps because the momentum p is not the same as the relativistic momentum. Oh wait, no. The Uncertainty Principle gives the same Δp regardless of the velocity, because it's a quantum mechanical effect. So maybe the approach to calculate ΔE using the non-relativistic kinetic energy is the correct way.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts here. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives the uncertainty in momentum, but the relation between momentum and energy depends on whether it's relativistic or not.

Wait, but the question is about the energy uncertainty, not the momentum. So perhaps the correct way is to use the non-relativistic approach here because the problem doesn't specify using relativity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be non-relativistic, considering that 2e8 m/s is a high speed but not so high that relativistic effects would cause a major change in the order of magnitude of the result.

Wait, but the non-relativistic approach gave me approximately 5.5e-19 J, and the relativistic approach gave me 3e-27 J, which is way smaller. That can't be right, so I must have made a mistake in the relativistic calculation.

Let me re-examine the relativistic approach.

Wait, perhaps I confused the variables. Let's try this again.

E is the total energy, so E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 )

The derivative of E with respect to p is (pc^2) / E.

So, ΔE ≈ (pc^2)/E * Δp

But since E ≈ mc² + (p^2 c^4)/(2m c^4) )? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 )

So, dE/dp = (pc) / sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 ) ) = (pc) / E

So, yes, that's correct.

So, let me compute (pc):

p is the momentum, which is m_e * v, but that's the average momentum. But the uncertainty in momentum is Δp = ħ/(Δx), which is about 1e-24 kg·m/s, as earlier.

So, let me compute (pc) = (1e-24 kg·m/s) * (3e8 m/s) = 3e-16 J.

mc² is 9.1e-31 kg * (3e8)^2 = 9.1e-31 * 9e16 = 8.19e-14 J.

So, E = sqrt( (3e-16)^2 + (8.19e-14)^2 ) ≈ 8.19e-14 J.

So, dE/dp = (3e-16 J) / (8.19e-14 J) ≈ 3.67e-3.

So, ΔE ≈ 3.67e-3 * Δp = 3.67e-3 * 1e-24 = 3.67e-27 J.

Which is way smaller than the non-relativistic case.

But this can't be right, because the non-relativistic approach gives a much larger value. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing kinetic energy with total energy. In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), but the total energy is (p² c²)/(2m) + mc².

Wait, but when calculating the uncertainty in energy, it's the uncertainty in kinetic energy that's being considered, perhaps. Or is it the total energy?

Wait, the question says, "minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron." That could be the total energy. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not considering relativistic effects, and thus we should proceed with the non-relativistic approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is intended to be solved with the non-relativistic approach, given that the options are all in the 1e-16 to 1e-18 J range, which aligns with the non-relativistic calculation.

So, the non-relativistic approach gives ΔE ≈ 5.5e-19 J, which is option C.

But wait, why is the relativistic approach giving such a different answer? Because in the relativistic case, the energy is approximately mc², and the derivative is small, making ΔE much smaller. But perhaps the problem is not expecting that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the relativistic relation between energy and momentum to find the uncertainty in energy.

Wait, another approach: the energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2.

The uncertainty in E can be found using the product of the uncertainties, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the uncertainty principle for energy and time, but that's a different relation.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me go back to the initial approach.

As per the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2.

Assuming Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx), so Δp = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-10 m) ) = (1.05e-34 ) / (2e-10 ) = 5.25e-25 J·s/m.

Wait, wait a second. Let me compute that correctly.

Δx is 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m.

So Δp = ħ / (2Δx ) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-10 m) )

Let me compute that:

1.0545718e-34 / (2e-10) = (1.0545718 / 2 ) * 1e-34+10 = 0.5272859e-24 = 5.272859e-25 J·s/m → kg·m/s.

So Δp ≈ 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m).

So ΔK = (Δp)^2/(2m ) = ( (5.27e-25 )^2 ) / (2 * 9.1e-31 )

Compute (5.27e-25)^2 = 27.77e-50 = 2.777e-49.

Divide by 2 * 9.1e-31 = 1.82e-30.

So 2.777e-49 / 1.82e-30 = approx 1.528e-19 J.

Which is about 1.5e-19 J. So approximately 1e-19 J, which is option C.

So, the uncertainty in energy is approximately 1e-19 J, which is option C.

But wait, the confusion arises because I thought of using the relativistic approach but that led to a much smaller value. However, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering relativity, and the non-relativistic approach is sufficient.

So, with all that, I think the correct answer is option C, ~1e-19 J.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy \( \Delta E \) of an electron traveling with a speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and an uncertainty in position \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is the reduced Planck's constant. From this, the minimum uncertainty in momentum is:

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
\]

Given \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Next, the uncertainty in kinetic energy \( \Delta K \) is related to the uncertainty in momentum by the non-relativistic kinetic energy formula:

\[
\Delta K = \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m},
\]

where \( m = 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of the electron. Substituting \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \):

\[
\Delta K = \frac{(5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \times 9.1 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]

First, compute \( (\Delta p)^2 \):

\[
(\Delta p)^2 = (5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2 = 27.77 \times 10^{-50} = 2.777 \times 10^{-49}.
\]

Next, compute the denominator:

\[
2 \times 9.1 \times 10^{-31} = 1.82 \times 10^{-30}.
\]

Now, divide:

\[
\Delta K = \frac{2.777 \times 10^{-49}}{1.82 \times 10^{-30}} \approx 1.528 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

This result is approximately \( 1 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option C.

While relativistic effects were considered, the relativistic kinetic energy formula was not necessary for this order-of-magnitude estimate. The non-relativistic approach suffices, as the problem does not explicitly require relativistic corrections. Thus, the minimum uncertainty in energy is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about estimating the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron. The given information is that the electron is traveling at a speed v = 2 × 10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. The options are from A to D, each representing different orders of magnitude in joules.

Hmm, right. So this seems like a problem involving Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. I remember that the Uncertainty Principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The principle is often expressed as Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Since the question is about the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), I think I need to relate this to the uncertainty in momentum. Because energy and momentum are related, especially in the context of the Uncertainty Principle. For a non-relativistic particle, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So if I can find the uncertainty in momentum, I can find the uncertainty in energy.

First, let's jot down the given values:

- v = 2 × 10^8 m/s (electron speed)
- Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^(-9) meters = 1 × 10^(-10) m

Wait, but wait. The speed is given as v, but the momentum is p = m*v. But since the electron is moving at a high speed, I should consider whether relativistic effects are important. Wait, 2×10^8 m/s is about 66% the speed of light (since c is ~3×10^8 m/s), so relativistic effects might be non-negligible. But I'm not sure if the problem expects me to use the relativistic formula for momentum or not.

But maybe the problem is intended to be solved using the non-relativistic approach. Let me proceed with non-relativistic first and see.

So, for a non-relativistic particle, the momentum p is m*v, where m is the mass of the electron. The mass of an electron is about 9.1 × 10^(-31) kg.

But wait, the problem gives us Δx, the uncertainty in position. Using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the minimum uncertainty in momentum Δp is approximately ħ/(2Δx). But sometimes, the approximate minimum is considered as ħ/(Δx) because the ½ factor is considered part of the uncertainty in practice.

Wait, the exact expression is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty would be when Δp = ħ/(2Δx). So using that, perhaps.

So let me compute Δp.

Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m.

So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). But wait, I've also heard that sometimes people use Δp ≈ ħ/Δx as an order-of-magnitude estimate. Because the factor of 2 is small compared to the uncertainties. Maybe the question is looking for an approximate estimate, so I can use Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx).

Let me compute both ways.

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. So ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s.

So using Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx):

Δp = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-10 m) = 1.05e-24 kg·m/s.

If I take the 2 into account, it would be half that, ~5e-25 kg·m/s. But since we're looking for an approximate order of magnitude, either way, it's going to be on the order of 1e-24.

Now, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m). So the uncertainty in energy ΔE will be (Δp)^2/(2m).

Let me compute that.

ΔE ≈ ( (Δp)^2 ) / (2m )

Plugging in the numbers:

( (1e-24)^2 ) / (2 * 9.1e-31 )

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

(1e-24)^2 = 1e-48.

Denominator is 2 * 9.1e-31 = 1.82e-30.

So ΔE ≈ (1e-48) / (1.82e-30) = approximately 5.5e-19 J.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, (1e-24)^2 is 1e-48. 1e-48 divided by ~1.82e-30 is (1 / 1.82 ) * 1e-48+30 = approx 0.55 * 1e-18 = 5.5e-19 J.

So that's about 1e-19 J. Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J.

But wait, I used Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx) which is 1e-24 kg·m/s. But if I had used the minimum uncertainty as ħ/(2Δx), then Δp would be 5e-25 kg·m/s.

Let me see what effect that would have on ΔE.

(5e-25)^2 = 25e-50 = 2.5e-49.

Divide by 1.82e-30: 2.5e-49 / 1.82e-30 ≈ 1.37e-19 J.

Which is about the same order of magnitude, 1e-19 J. So even if I include the factor of 2, it's still around 1e-19.

So option C is 1e-19 J.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I haven't missed any exponents.

Δp is ħ/(Δx) = (1e-34 / 1e-10) ) → Wait, no, I think I messed up the exponents earlier. Wait, ħ is 1e-34 J·s, and Δx is 1e-10 m.

So 1e-34 divided by 1e-10 is 1e-24. So that's correct.

So (1e-24)^2 is 1e-48.

Divided by 2*(9.1e-31 kg) → 1.82e-30 kg.

So 1e-48 / 1.82e-30 = (1 /1.82 ) * 1e-18 ≈ 0.55 * 1e-18 = 5.5e-19 J.

Which is 5.5e-19 J, so ~1e-18? Wait, no, 5.5e-19 is 5.5 × 10^-19, which is option C.

But wait, I think I should also think about relativistic effects. Because 2e8 m/s is about 0.666c, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light. So using the non-relativistic kinetic energy formula might not be accurate.

Wait, the relativistic kinetic energy is given by E = (γ - 1)mc², where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since the question is about the uncertainty in energy, perhaps it's better to use relativistic momentum. Hmm, this could complicate things.

But wait, the problem statement just says to estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy. Maybe it's intended to use the non-relativistic approach, given the nature of the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy uncertainty is just the kinetic energy uncertainty, so even if the speed is relativistic, but the momentum is known, so we can proceed.

Wait, but the point is, the momentum uncertainty comes from the position uncertainty via the Uncertainty Principle, which is a quantum mechanical concept, and the energy uncertainty would be based on that.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on whether to use relativistic momentum or not. Let me think.

If I use relativistic momentum, p = γmv, where γ is the Lorentz factor, sqrt(1/(1 - (v²/c²))).

But let's compute γ for v=2e8 m/s.

v = 2e8 m/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

v²/c² = (4e16)/(9e16) ) = 4/9 ≈ 0.4444.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.4444 = 0.5556.

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(0.5556) ≈ 0.7454.

So γ = 1 / 0.7454 ≈ 1.342.

So γ is approximately 1.34. So the relativistic momentum would be p = γmv ≈ 1.34 * m_e * v.

But when considering the uncertainty in momentum, since Δp is based on the Uncertainty Principle, and v is given, but Δp is ħ/(Δx), which doesn't depend on v directly.

Wait, but wait, no. The momentum is p = γmv, but the uncertainty in momentum comes from the Uncertainty Principle, which is Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx), so the same as before.

But when calculating the energy, if I use the relativistic energy, then E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ), but that's for the total energy.

But the kinetic energy is E_kinetic = E - mc².

Alternatively, the kinetic energy can be written as (p²c²)/(2γ m c²) ? Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe the non-relativistic approach is acceptable, but perhaps we should use the relativistic formula for kinetic energy.

Wait, but the problem is about the uncertainty in energy, so maybe the approach is simply to use ΔE = ΔK ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m), regardless of whether the speed is relativistic or not.

But maybe the correct approach is to calculate Δp as before, and then compute the kinetic energy uncertainty based on whether the speed is relativistic.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, E = p²/(2m). In the relativistic case, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ), which is the total energy.

But the kinetic energy is E_kinetic = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ) - mc².

But for small p, E_kinetic ≈ pc²/(2m), but when p is not small, the approximation isn't valid.

Wait, let me think about the magnitude of p in this case.

Δp is about 1e-24 kg m/s.

Mass of electron m = 9.1e-31 kg.

mc² = 9.1e-31 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 9.1e-31 * 9e16 = 8.19e-14 J.

Now, pc = (1e-24 kg m/s) * 3e8 m/s = 3e-16 J.

So pc is 3e-16 J, mc² is 8e-14 J. So pc is about 3.7% of mc².

So perhaps the non-relativistic approximation is not perfect, but it's probably acceptable for an order of magnitude estimate.

So using the non-relativistic formula, ΔE ≈ ( (1e-24)^2 ) / (2 * 9.1e-31 )

Compute that:

(1e-24)^2 = 1e-48.

Divide by 2 * 9.1e-31 → 1.82e-30.

So 1e-48 / 1.82e-30 = 5.5e-19 J.

Which is 5.5e-19 J, so the order is 1e-19, which is option C.

But wait, another approach: perhaps instead of using the kinetic energy, we can calculate the momentum and then compute the uncertainty in energy using the relativistic formula.

Let me try that.

Compute the relativistic energy E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 )

So ΔE would be the uncertainty in E. But since we're dealing with the uncertainty in p (Δp), E depends on p, so the uncertainty in E can be found by taking the derivative.

But this seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can approximate.

Let me denote E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 )

The uncertainty in E, ΔE, is approximately |dE/dp| * Δp.

dE/dp = (pc) / sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 )

So ΔE ≈ [ (pc) / E ] * Δp

But E ≈ mc² when p is small compared to mc. But in our case, p is about 1e-24 kg m/s.

Wait, let me compute pc and mc^2.

pc = (1e-24 kg m/s) * (3e8 m/s) = 3e-16 J.

mc² = (9.1e-31 kg) * (9e16 m²/s²) )= 8.19e-14 J.

So pc is about 3.67e-3 times mc². So about 0.367% of mc². So E is approximately mc² + (pc)^2/(2mc²), but that's the non-relativistic approximation.

Wait, but let's compute E:

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 )

= sqrt( (3e-16)^2 + (8.19e-14)^2 )

= sqrt( 9e-32 + 6.7e-27 )

≈ sqrt(6.7e-27) ≈ 8.19e-14 J.

So E is approximately mc², which is 8.19e-14 J.

So dE/dp is (pc) / E = (3e-16) / 8.19e-14 ≈ 3e-3.

So ΔE ≈ (3e-3) * Δp.

Wait, Δp is 1e-24 kg m/s. So ΔE ≈ 3e-3 * 1e-24 = 3e-27 J.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier the non-relativistic approach gave 5e-19 J. There's a huge discrepancy here.

Wait, why is that? Because the relativistic approach for E as a function of p leads to a very small ΔE when E is approximately mc², because the derivative is small.

But that's contradictory to the earlier non-relativistic approach. Hmm. Where am I wrong here?

Wait, perhaps because the momentum p is not the same as the relativistic momentum. Oh wait, no. The Uncertainty Principle gives the same Δp regardless of the velocity, because it's a quantum mechanical effect. So maybe the approach to calculate ΔE using the non-relativistic kinetic energy is the correct way.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts here. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives the uncertainty in momentum, but the relation between momentum and energy depends on whether it's relativistic or not.

Wait, but the question is about the energy uncertainty, not the momentum. So perhaps the correct way is to use the non-relativistic approach here because the problem doesn't specify using relativity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be non-relativistic, considering that 2e8 m/s is a high speed but not so high that relativistic effects would cause a major change in the order of magnitude of the result.

Wait, but the non-relativistic approach gave me approximately 5.5e-19 J, and the relativistic approach gave me 3e-27 J, which is way smaller. That can't be right, so I must have made a mistake in the relativistic calculation.

Let me re-examine the relativistic approach.

Wait, perhaps I confused the variables. Let's try this again.

E is the total energy, so E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 )

The derivative of E with respect to p is (pc^2) / E.

So, ΔE ≈ (pc^2)/E * Δp

But since E ≈ mc² + (p^2 c^4)/(2m c^4) )? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 )

So, dE/dp = (pc) / sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 ) ) = (pc) / E

So, yes, that's correct.

So, let me compute (pc):

p is the momentum, which is m_e * v, but that's the average momentum. But the uncertainty in momentum is Δp = ħ/(Δx), which is about 1e-24 kg·m/s, as earlier.

So, let me compute (pc) = (1e-24 kg·m/s) * (3e8 m/s) = 3e-16 J.

mc² is 9.1e-31 kg * (3e8)^2 = 9.1e-31 * 9e16 = 8.19e-14 J.

So, E = sqrt( (3e-16)^2 + (8.19e-14)^2 ) ≈ 8.19e-14 J.

So, dE/dp = (3e-16 J) / (8.19e-14 J) ≈ 3.67e-3.

So, ΔE ≈ 3.67e-3 * Δp = 3.67e-3 * 1e-24 = 3.67e-27 J.

Which is way smaller than the non-relativistic case.

But this can't be right, because the non-relativistic approach gives a much larger value. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing kinetic energy with total energy. In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), but the total energy is (p² c²)/(2m) + mc².

Wait, but when calculating the uncertainty in energy, it's the uncertainty in kinetic energy that's being considered, perhaps. Or is it the total energy?

Wait, the question says, "minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron." That could be the total energy. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not considering relativistic effects, and thus we should proceed with the non-relativistic approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is intended to be solved with the non-relativistic approach, given that the options are all in the 1e-16 to 1e-18 J range, which aligns with the non-relativistic calculation.

So, the non-relativistic approach gives ΔE ≈ 5.5e-19 J, which is option C.

But wait, why is the relativistic approach giving such a different answer? Because in the relativistic case, the energy is approximately mc², and the derivative is small, making ΔE much smaller. But perhaps the problem is not expecting that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the relativistic relation between energy and momentum to find the uncertainty in energy.

Wait, another approach: the energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2.

The uncertainty in E can be found using the product of the uncertainties, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the uncertainty principle for energy and time, but that's a different relation.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me go back to the initial approach.

As per the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2.

Assuming Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx), so Δp = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-10 m) ) = (1.05e-34 ) / (2e-10 ) = 5.25e-25 J·s/m.

Wait, wait a second. Let me compute that correctly.

Δx is 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m.

So Δp = ħ / (2Δx ) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-10 m) )

Let me compute that:

1.0545718e-34 / (2e-10) = (1.0545718 / 2 ) * 1e-34+10 = 0.5272859e-24 = 5.272859e-25 J·s/m → kg·m/s.

So Δp ≈ 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m).

So ΔK = (Δp)^2/(2m ) = ( (5.27e-25 )^2 ) / (2 * 9.1e-31 )

Compute (5.27e-25)^2 = 27.77e-50 = 2.777e-49.

Divide by 2 * 9.1e-31 = 1.82e-30.

So 2.777e-49 / 1.82e-30 = approx 1.528e-19 J.

Which is about 1.5e-19 J. So approximately 1e-19 J, which is option C.

So, the uncertainty in energy is approximately 1e-19 J, which is option C.

But wait, the confusion arises because I thought of using the relativistic approach but that led to a much smaller value. However, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering relativity, and the non-relativistic approach is sufficient.

So, with all that, I think the correct answer is option C, ~1e-19 J.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy \( \Delta E \) of an electron traveling with a speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and an uncertainty in position \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is the reduced Planck's constant. From this, the minimum uncertainty in momentum is:

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
\]

Given \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Next, the uncertainty in kinetic energy \( \Delta K \) is related to the uncertainty in momentum by the non-relativistic kinetic energy formula:

\[
\Delta K = \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m},
\]

where \( m = 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of the electron. Substituting \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \):

\[
\Delta K = \frac{(5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \times 9.1 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]

First, compute \( (\Delta p)^2 \):

\[
(\Delta p)^2 = (5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2 = 27.77 \times 10^{-50} = 2.777 \times 10^{-49}.
\]

Next, compute the denominator:

\[
2 \times 9.1 \times 10^{-31} = 1.82 \times 10^{-30}.
\]

Now, divide:

\[
\Delta K = \frac{2.777 \times 10^{-49}}{1.82 \times 10^{-30}} \approx 1.528 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

This result is approximately \( 1 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option C.

While relativistic effects were considered, the relativistic kinetic energy formula was not necessary for this order-of-magnitude estimate. The non-relativistic approach suffices, as the problem does not explicitly require relativistic corrections. Thus, the minimum uncertainty in energy is:
