Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. But let's tackle it step by step. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, HCl, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, sounds a bit complicated, but let me think.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe I should start by figuring out how much acid and base I have in total. Since the problem gives me concentrations and volumes, I can calculate the moles of each component.

Let's list out each solution:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base)

Wait, but wait: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? So it will dissociate completely, providing OH- ions. And HCl is a strong acid, so it will provide H+ ions. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely.

I think I should calculate the moles of each. Moles are calculated as concentration (M) multiplied by volume (L). But the volumes are in mL, so I need to convert them first.

Starting with each solution:

1. CH3COOH:
Concentration = 0.1 M, Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L.
Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since acetic acid is CH3COOH, which is a monoprotic acid, each mole gives one H+ when it dissociates, but since it's weak, not all will dissociate.

2. HCl:
Concentration = 0.2 M, Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L.
Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates into H+ and Cl-.

3. Ba(OH)2:
Concentration = 0.3 M, Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L.
Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But wait, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So the OH- moles are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when you mix these, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait a second, but HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely donate H+ ions. The acetic acid, being weak, will only partially donate, but perhaps in the presence of a strong base, it might not dissociate much. Hmm, maybe I need to consider the neutralization reactions.

So, first, let's calculate the total moles of H+ from all sources and the moles of OH-.

But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so in the presence of a strong base like OH-, perhaps the reaction would be: the OH- reacts with the H+ ions first.

So, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH. But since CH3COOH is weak, maybe only a small amount of its H+ is available. Hmm, but if the OH- is present, maybe it will deprotonate the acetic acid as well.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The strong base will react with the strong acid first, right? Because the strong acid completely dissociates.

So first, the H+ from HCl (0.08 moles) will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2. The OH- is 0.18 moles.

So the reaction would be H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles, and OH- is 0.18. So after neutralizing all H+ from HCl, how much OH- remains?

0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- left.

Now, what's left is the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH (which can donate H+), and 0.10 moles of OH-.

So OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH. Since CH3COOH is a weak acid, it won't donate all its H+ quickly, but OH- is a strong base, so it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

The reaction is: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So each mole of OH- will consume a mole of CH3COOH and produce a mole of acetate (CH3COO^-).

So, we have 0.10 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

Since OH- is 0.10 and CH3COOH is 0.05, the CH3COOH will be completely neutralized, and OH- will have 0.05 left.

Wait, let me see: 0.10 moles OH- will react with 0.05 moles CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles OH-.

Because the OH- is in excess after reacting with both HCl and then CH3COOH.

So after all reactions, the remaining species in solution are:

- 0.05 moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2)
- The acetate ions (CH3COO^-) from the neutralization of CH3COOH, which is 0.05 moles.

Wait, but what about the chloride ions from HCl and the Ba^2+ from Ba(OH)2? Well, they are spectator ions and don't affect the pH directly.

But wait, the total solution volume is the sum of the three solutions: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

If the solution is basic because there's excess OH-, then the pH can be found using pOH first.

pOH = -log [OH-] → then pH = 14 - pOH.

Calculating [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

So pOH = -log(0.0416667).

I can calculate this. Let's see: log(0.0416667) is log(4.16667e-2).

Log(4.16667) is approximately 0.6198, so log(4.16667e-2) is 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802.

But wait, wait, no. Wait, the logarithm of 0.0416667 is log(4.16667 *10^-2) = log(4.16667) + log(10^-2) = 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802. So pOH is 1.3802.

Then pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198, which is approximately 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I account for all possible reactions correctly? Let me double-check.

HCl is a strong acid, so 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 gives 0.09 *2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

After HCl's H+ (0.08) reacts with OH-, 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- left.

Then, the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH (which can donate 0.05 H+) react with the remaining OH-.

But wait, OH- is a strong base, so it will deprotonate the acetic acid: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So yes, 0.05 moles of OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles of OH- unreacted.

Therefore, the solution has excess OH-, making it basic. The OH- concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 L, leading to a pOH of about 1.38, so pH 12.62.

Wait, but another thing to consider: when you mix the solutions, all the H+ from HCl is neutralized by the OH- from Ba(OH)2, except for what's left. Then the OH- reacts with the acetic acid's H+. If there's any OH- left after that, the solution is basic.

So yes, everything seems to check out. The pH would be around 12.62, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the reaction between the acids and bases in the mixture. The given solutions are:

1. **500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (acetic acid)**:  
   Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
   CH₃COOH is a weak acid, so it partially dissociates to release H⁺ ions.

2. **400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (strong acid)**:  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).  
   HCl fully dissociates, contributing \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

3. **300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (strong base)**:  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, contributing \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

### Reaction Between H⁺ and OH⁻
The strong acid (HCl) reacts with the strong base (Ba(OH)₂):  
\[
\text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O}.
\]  
- Total H⁺ from HCl: \( 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).  
- Total OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).  
After neutralization, \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \) remain.

### Reaction Between Remaining OH⁻ and CH₃COOH
The remaining OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:  
\[
\text{OH⁻} + \text{CH₃COOH} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O}.
\]  
- Moles of CH₃COOH: \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
- Moles of OH⁻: \( 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).  
CH₃COOH is completely neutralized, leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \) unreacted.

### Final Solution
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of OH⁻ in the solution is:  
\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{\text{moles of OH⁻}}{\text{total volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
\]  
The pOH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is then:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Conclusion
The pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

So first, the H+ from HCl (0.08 moles) will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2. The OH- is 0.18 moles.

So the reaction would be H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles, and OH- is 0.18. So after neutralizing all H+ from HCl, how much OH- remains?

0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- left.

Now, what's left is the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH (which can donate H+), and 0.10 moles of OH-.

So OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH. Since CH3COOH is a weak acid, it won't donate all its H+ quickly, but OH- is a strong base, so it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

The reaction is: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So each mole of OH- will consume a mole of CH3COOH and produce a mole of acetate (CH3COO^-).

So, we have 0.10 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

Since OH- is 0.10 and CH3COOH is 0.05, the CH3COOH will be completely neutralized, and OH- will have 0.05 left.

Wait, let me see: 0.10 moles OH- will react with 0.05 moles CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles OH-.

Because the OH- is in excess after reacting with both HCl and then CH3COOH.

But wait, the total solution volume is the sum of the three solutions: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

If the solution is basic because there's excess OH-, then the pH can be found using pOH first.

pOH = -log [OH-] → then pH = 14 - pOH.

Calculating [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

So pOH = -log(0.0416667).

I can calculate this. Let's see: log(0.0416667) is log(4.16667e-2).

Log(4.16667) is approximately 0.6198, so log(4.16667e-2) is 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802.

But wait, wait, no. Wait, the logarithm of 0.0416667 is log(4.16667 *10^-2) = log(4.16667) + log(10^-2) = 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802. So pOH is 1.3802.

Then pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198, which is approximately 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I account for all possible reactions correctly? Let me double-check.

HCl is a strong acid, so 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 gives 0.09 *2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.
