Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options provided. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid

And the options are combinations of A and B from H3O+, NaHSO3, HCl, and CH3COOH.

Alright, let's tackle the first reaction. Butan-2-one is also known as methylacetone, right? Its structure is (CH3)2CO. NaCN is sodium cyanide, which is a source of CN- ions. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, so what's happening here? 

Wait, when ketones react with cyanide, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. So the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, adding to the ketone. But adding HCN would typically form a cyanohydrin. So for the formation of a cyanohydrin, the conditions usually involve an acid catalyst, right? Because the H+ protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group, then the CN- attacks.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN in the presence of an acid (A). So A should be an acid. The options for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3. Well, H3O+ is a strong acid, and NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid, I think. So for the cyanohydrin formation, we usually use a strong acid as a catalyst. So that would mean A is H3O+.

Wait, but NaHSO3 is also an acid. HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+. So for the first step, I think the reagent A is H3O+.

So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. So options A and B are possible.

Now moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it reacts with B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) is being converted to a carboxylic acid (COOH). How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. The typical conditions for nitrile to carboxylic acid are either strong acidic or basic conditions, but with heating. Wait, but in this case, the reagent B is in H2O. So what's the reagent here?

Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acid or base. Let me think: under acidic conditions, you might use HCl, H2SO4. Under basic conditions, you might use NaOH, KOH. But wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the conditions would likely be acidic hydrolysis.

Wait, but the starting material already has a hydroxyl group. So the nitrile is next to a hydroxyl group, which might influence the reaction. Hmm.

Wait, the structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile in the first product. So in the second reaction, the nitrile is being converted to a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid.

Nitrile hydrolysis: in acidic conditions, with H2O and a strong acid like HCl. Or in basic conditions, but then you usually get a carboxylate which would require acid workup to get the acid.

But in this reaction, the product is the carboxylic acid, so perhaps the hydrolysis is done under acidic conditions.

So the reagent B could be HCl. Let's think: if the reagent is HCl, then B would be HCl.

Looking at the options, which options have B as HCl? Option A has B as HCl. Option C has B as HCl, but A is NaHSO3. So if I'm right that B is HCl, then the options A and C could be possible.

Wait, but in the first reaction, if A is H3O+, then option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl. Option C has A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl. 

Wait, but in the first reaction, the reagent is H3O+ or NaHSO3. So if A is H3O+, then the first reaction is using acid to catalyze the cyanide addition.

Now, the second reaction requires HCl. So looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So option A would have both A and B as correct.

But wait, I should make sure. Let me think about each step again.

First Reaction: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

So it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. The reaction is:

(CH3)2CO + CN- → (CH3)2C(OH)CN.

Cyanohydrin formation typically uses an acid catalyst. So A is an acid. So H3O+ is a strong acid, which would be suitable. Alternatively, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (HSO3^- is a weak acid), but maybe it's not as strong as H3O+.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

In the second reaction, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the adjacent carbon. So when nitriles are hydrolyzed under acidic conditions, they form carboxylic acids. The typical conditions for nitrile to carboxylic acid is using strong acid, like HCl, and water, perhaps under heat.

So reagent B is HCl. The reaction would be something like:

R-CN + H2O (HCl) → R-COOH.

So in the second reaction, B is HCl.

So combining both, A is H3O+ and B is HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl → Yes, this matches.

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH → So B would be acetic acid. Not sure about that.

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl → So A is not acid enough for the first step.

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH → B is acid, but perhaps.

Wait, but could the second reaction use a weak acid? Let me think. Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acidic conditions. Because under weak acid conditions, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as readily.

Wait, but sometimes nitriles can be hydrolyzed in dilute acid, but for the formation of the carboxylic acid, you need strong acid. So HCl is a strong acid, so option A for B is correct.

So the correct answer would be option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the first reaction. Why would NaHSO3 not be suitable? Because NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

Wait, but in the first reaction, NaCN is providing the cyanide ion. So the acid catalyst (H+) would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic, allowing CN- to attack. So if A is NaHSO3, which is H+ in solution, maybe that's also possible.

Wait, so if A is NaHSO3, that's an acid (HSO3^- is a weak acid, but it can donate a proton). So the first reaction might work with that as well.

Wait, but if A is NaHSO3, which is a stronger acid than NaCN? Or maybe the concentration matters. Alternatively, perhaps NaHSO3 is used in another type of reaction.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the first reaction uses a base, but that doesn't seem right. No, the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition, so acid is needed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

If the answer is option A, then the reagents are A=H3O+ and B=HCl. Let me see if that makes sense.

But wait, let me think about the second reaction again. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. When you hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids, you can have the following steps:

R-CN + H2O → R-COOH (with HCl as catalyst)

In the presence of HCl, the nitrile group is protonated, making it more electrophilic, and then attacked by water.

So B is HCl, which is correct.

Therefore, option A is correct: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

But wait, what about option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl. So for the first reaction, using NaHSO3 as the acid. Is that a possibility? NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+.

Wait, but in the presence of NaHSO3 and NaCN, will the reaction proceed? The H+ from NaHSO3 could protonate the carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe NaHSO3 is a suitable acid for the first step. So if both A and B in option C are correct, then that would also be a possible answer.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the first reaction. So in the first reaction, using NaHSO3 as the acid, would the reaction proceed? It would, but maybe H3O+ is a stronger acid, making the reaction go faster.

But the question is about selecting the suitable reagents, not the fastest or most efficient.

So if both H3O+ and NaHSO3 could work as acid catalysts for the cyanohydrin formation, then either option A or C could be correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure if NaHSO3 is a suitable acid for that reaction. Some sources say that in the formation of cyanohydrins, a strong acid like HCl or H2SO4 is used. Alternatively, maybe a weak acid like acetic acid isn't strong enough. So perhaps H3O+ (which is a strong acid) is required.

Wait, but H3O+ is a strong acid, but in practice, you'd use something like HCl or H2SO4 as the source. H3O+ is more of a concept than a real reagent, as it's just the aqueous proton.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagent A is HCl. Wait, but the options don't have HCl as a choice for A. The options for A are H3O+ and NaHSO3.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction uses H3O+ as the acid. So the correct answer would be option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but another possibility is that the first reaction uses HCN and a base, but I don't think that's the case. Because the product is a cyanohydrin, which is formed under acidic conditions.

So, to sum up:

First reaction needs acid (A), so options A and C have A as H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Second reaction needs HCl (B), so options A and C have B as HCl.

Which one is correct?

Wait, let me check the other options. Option B has B as CH3COOH, which is a weak acid. Probably not strong enough for the hydrolysis to carboxylic acid. So option B is probably wrong.

Option D has B as CH3COOH, so same as above.

So between A and C. But if the first reaction requires a strong acid, then option A (H3O+) is correct for A.

But wait, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and sulfite ions. If H+ is sufficient, perhaps it can act as an acid catalyst. So in that case, option C could be correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think about the possible products.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and acid to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the product has the OH and CN on the same carbon.

In the second reaction, that product is treated with reagent B (H2O) to give the corresponding acid.

So, in the first reaction, the reagent is acid, which can be either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

In the second reaction, reagent B is HCl.

So, the correct answer would be option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the first reaction uses a base, but no, because the product is a cyanohydrin, which requires acid.

So, I think option A is correct.

The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the suitable reagents A and B from the given options. Here's the analysis:

### Reaction 1:
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**

This reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin, which typically requires an acid catalyst. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen of the ketone, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and allowing the cyanide ion (CN⁻) to attack. 

- **Option A (H₃O⁺)**: H₃O⁺ is a strong acid and a suitable catalyst for this reaction.
- **Option C (NaHSO₃)**: NaHSO₃ provides H⁺ ions (via HSO₃⁻), which can also act as an acid catalyst. However, H₃O⁺ is generally more effective for this type of reaction.

Thus, **H₃O⁺ (A)** is the better choice for the first reaction.

---

### Reaction 2:
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**

This reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Such hydrolysis typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl. 

- **Option A (HCl)**: HCl is a strong acid and is suitable for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.
- **Option B (CH₃COOH)**: Acetic acid is a weak acid and may not be strong enough to efficiently drive the reaction to completion.

Thus, **HCl (B)** is the correct choice for the second reaction.

---

### Final Answer:
Combining the above analyses, the correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options provided. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid

And the options are combinations of A and B from H3O+, NaHSO3, HCl, and CH3COOH.

Alright, let's tackle the first reaction. Butan-2-one is also known as methylacetone, right? Its structure is (CH3)2CO. NaCN is sodium cyanide, which is a source of CN- ions. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, so what's happening here? 

Wait, when ketones react with cyanide, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. So the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, adding to the ketone. But adding HCN would typically form a cyanohydrin. So for the formation of a cyanohydrin, the conditions usually involve an acid catalyst, right? Because the H+ protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group, then the CN- attacks.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN in the presence of an acid (A). So A should be an acid. The options for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3. Well, H3O+ is a strong acid, and NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid, I think. So for the cyanohydrin formation, we usually use a strong acid as a catalyst. So that would mean A is H3O+.

Wait, but NaHSO3 is also an acid. HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+. So for the first step, I think the reagent A is H3O+.

So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. So options A and B are possible.

Now moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it reacts with B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) is being converted to a carboxylic acid (COOH). How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. The typical conditions for nitrile to carboxylic acid are either strong acidic or basic conditions, but with heating. Wait, but in this case, the reagent B is in H2O. So what's the reagent here?

Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acid or base. Let me think: under acidic conditions, you might use HCl, H2SO4. Under basic conditions, you might use NaOH, KOH. But wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the conditions would likely be acidic hydrolysis.

Wait, but the starting material already has a hydroxyl group. So the nitrile is next to a hydroxyl group, which might influence the reaction. Hmm.

Wait, the structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile in the first product. So in the second reaction, the nitrile is being converted to a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid.

Nitrile hydrolysis: in acidic conditions, with H2O and a strong acid like HCl. Or in basic conditions, but then you usually get a carboxylate which would require acid workup to get the acid.

But in this reaction, the product is the carboxylic acid, so perhaps the hydrolysis is done under acidic conditions.

So the reagent B could be HCl. Let's think: if the reagent is HCl, then B would be HCl.

Looking at the options, which options have B as HCl? Option A has B as HCl. Option C has B as HCl, but A is NaHSO3. So if I'm right that B is HCl, then the options A and C could be possible.

Wait, but in the first reaction, if A is H3O+, then option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl. Option C has A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl. 

Wait, but in the first reaction, the reagent is H3O+ or NaHSO3. So if A is H3O+, then the first reaction is using acid to catalyze the cyanide addition.

Now, the second reaction requires HCl. So looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So option A would have both A and B as correct.

But wait, I should make sure. Let me think about each step again.

First Reaction: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

So it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. The reaction is:

(CH3)2CO + CN- → (CH3)2C(OH)CN.

Cyanohydrin formation typically uses an acid catalyst. So A is an acid. So H3O+ is a strong acid, which would be suitable. Alternatively, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (HSO3^- is a weak acid), but maybe it's not as strong as H3O+.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

In the second reaction, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the adjacent carbon. So when nitriles are hydrolyzed under acidic conditions, they form carboxylic acids. The typical conditions for nitrile to carboxylic acid is using strong acid, like HCl, and water, perhaps under heat.

So reagent B is HCl. The reaction would be something like:

R-CN + H2O (HCl) → R-COOH.

So in the second reaction, B is HCl.

So combining both, A is H3O+ and B is HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl → Yes, this matches.

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH → So B would be acetic acid. Not sure about that.

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl → So A is not acid enough for the first step.

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH → B is acid, but perhaps.

Wait, but could the second reaction use a weak acid? Let me think. Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acidic conditions. Because under weak acid conditions, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as readily.

Wait, but sometimes nitriles can be hydrolyzed in dilute acid, but for the formation of the carboxylic acid, you need strong acid. So HCl is a strong acid, so option A for B is correct.

So the correct answer would be option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the first reaction. Why would NaHSO3 not be suitable? Because NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

Wait, but in the first reaction, NaCN is providing the cyanide ion. So the acid catalyst (H+) would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic, allowing CN- to attack. So if A is NaHSO3, which is H+ in solution, maybe that's also possible.

Wait, so if A is NaHSO3, that's an acid (HSO3^- is a weak acid, but it can donate a proton). So the first reaction might work with that as well.

Wait, but if A is NaHSO3, which is a stronger acid than NaCN? Or maybe the concentration matters. Alternatively, perhaps NaHSO3 is used in another type of reaction.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the first reaction uses a base, but that doesn't seem right. No, the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition, so acid is needed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

If the answer is option A, then the reagents are A=H3O+ and B=HCl. Let me see if that makes sense.

But wait, let me think about the second reaction again. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. When you hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids, you can have the following steps:

R-CN + H2O → R-COOH (with HCl as catalyst)

In the presence of HCl, the nitrile group is protonated, making it more electrophilic, and then attacked by water.

So B is HCl, which is correct.

Therefore, option A is correct: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

But wait, what about option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl. So for the first reaction, using NaHSO3 as the acid. Is that a possibility? NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+.

Wait, but in the presence of NaHSO3 and NaCN, will the reaction proceed? The H+ from NaHSO3 could protonate the carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe NaHSO3 is a suitable acid for the first step. So if both A and B in option C are correct, then that would also be a possible answer.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the first reaction. So in the first reaction, using NaHSO3 as the acid, would the reaction proceed? It would, but maybe H3O+ is a stronger acid, making the reaction go faster.

But the question is about selecting the suitable reagents, not the fastest or most efficient.

So if both H3O+ and NaHSO3 could work as acid catalysts for the cyanohydrin formation, then either option A or C could be correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure if NaHSO3 is a suitable acid for that reaction. Some sources say that in the formation of cyanohydrins, a strong acid like HCl or H2SO4 is used. Alternatively, maybe a weak acid like acetic acid isn't strong enough. So perhaps H3O+ (which is a strong acid) is required.

Wait, but H3O+ is a strong acid, but in practice, you'd use something like HCl or H2SO4 as the source. H3O+ is more of a concept than a real reagent, as it's just the aqueous proton.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagent A is HCl. Wait, but the options don't have HCl as a choice for A. The options for A are H3O+ and NaHSO3.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction uses H3O+ as the acid. So the correct answer would be option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but another possibility is that the first reaction uses HCN and a base, but I don't think that's the case. Because the product is a cyanohydrin, which is formed under acidic conditions.

So, to sum up:

First reaction needs acid (A), so options A and C have A as H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Second reaction needs HCl (B), so options A and C have B as HCl.

Which one is correct?

Wait, let me check the other options. Option B has B as CH3COOH, which is a weak acid. Probably not strong enough for the hydrolysis to carboxylic acid. So option B is probably wrong.

Option D has B as CH3COOH, so same as above.

So between A and C. But if the first reaction requires a strong acid, then option A (H3O+) is correct for A.

But wait, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and sulfite ions. If H+ is sufficient, perhaps it can act as an acid catalyst. So in that case, option C could be correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think about the possible products.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and acid to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the product has the OH and CN on the same carbon.

In the second reaction, that product is treated with reagent B (H2O) to give the corresponding acid.

So, in the first reaction, the reagent is acid, which can be either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

In the second reaction, reagent B is HCl.

So, the correct answer would be option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the first reaction uses a base, but no, because the product is a cyanohydrin, which requires acid.

So, I think option A is correct.


The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the suitable reagents A and B from the given options. Here's the analysis:

### Reaction 1:
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**

This reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin, which typically requires an acid catalyst. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen of the ketone, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and allowing the cyanide ion (CN⁻) to attack. 

- **Option A (H₃O⁺)**: H₃O⁺ is a strong acid and a suitable catalyst for this reaction.
- **Option C (NaHSO₃)**: NaHSO₃ provides H⁺ ions (via HSO₃⁻), which can also act as an acid catalyst. However, H₃O⁺ is generally more effective for this type of reaction.

Thus, **H₃O⁺ (A)** is the better choice for the first reaction.

### Reaction 2:
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**

This reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Such hydrolysis typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl. 

- **Option A (HCl)**: HCl is a strong acid and is suitable for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.
- **Option B (CH₃COOH)**: Acetic acid is a weak acid and may not be strong enough to efficiently drive the reaction to completion.

Thus, **HCl (B)** is the correct choice for the second reaction.

---

### Final Answer:
Combining the above analyses, the correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
