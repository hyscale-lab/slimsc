Okay, so I'm trying to solve this particle physics question about the decay of a boson. Hmm, the question gives me the Lagrangian interaction term and the mass of the boson X as 6 GeV. I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

First, I remember that when a particle decays, the mass of the decaying particle (the parent) must be at least twice the mass of the daughter particles. That's the basic rule for decay kinematics. So X can decay into two fermions if their combined mass is less than or equal to X's mass.

Looking at the Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I should parse this correctly. The interaction term probably involves ψ_f (fermion fields) and X. So the interaction is something like Yukawa coupling, where the boson X couples to fermions.

So the decay process would be X → f f̄, right? So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it can couple to.

Now, what fermions are involved? The Lagrangian seems to have ψ_f, which I think is a generic fermion field. But the options have specific particles, so I need to figure out which fermions are allowed.

Wait, the interaction term is written as -λ f ψ_f bar ψ_f (ῡ + X). Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the notation. Oh wait, perhaps the term is like ψ_f bar X ψ_f. So X couples to ψ_f fermions.

So the boson X can decay into any fermion pair that it can couple to. But what are these fermions? The options list various quarks and leptons.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So the mass of the fermion pairs must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. So each fermion must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV because 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. I'm thinking about the rest mass. For example, electrons and neutrinos are very light, so their mass is negligible. But for quarks, their masses are not as small as electrons, but I need to remember their approximate masses.

Let me list the masses of the known fermions:

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1777 MeV (1.777 GeV)
- Neutrinos: even lighter, but since the problem doesn't involve neutrinos, I can ignore them.

Quarks (masses vary, but here's an approximate idea):
- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, but wait. The top quark is way too heavy. X is 6 GeV, so top quarks are out because 2m_t is about 346 GeV, way bigger than 6 GeV.

So possible fermions are those with m_f ≤3 GeV.

So let's see:

For quarks:
- u: 2.2 MeV → totally allowed.
- d: 4.7 MeV → allowed (0.0047 GeV, way below 3 GeV)
- s: 95 MeV → 0.095 GeV → allowed.
- c: ~1.27 GeV → 2m_c = ~2.54 GeV → 2.54 GeV <6 GeV → yes, allowed.
- b: 4.7 GeV → 2m_b =9.4 GeV >6 GeV → no, decay into b bbar not allowed.
- t: way too heavy.

Leptons:
- e: ~0.5 MeV → allowed.
- mu: ~105 MeV → allowed.
- tau: ~1.777 GeV → 2m_tau ≈ 3.554 GeV >6 GeV? Wait, wait. Wait, 2m_tau for tau is 2 * 1.777 GeV = 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. Oh no, wait! Wait a second, I think I messed up. Because 2m_f has to be ≤ m_X.

Wait, m_X is 6 GeV. So 2m_f must be ≤6 GeV. So m_f ≤3 GeV.

Tau is about 1.777 GeV. So 2m_tau is ~3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau-antitau pair is allowed.

Wait, wait, but wait. Wait, I thought the tau is 1.777 GeV, so 2*1.777 is 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau decay is allowed.

But wait, the mass of the tau is about 1.777 GeV. So 2m_tau is 3.554 GeV <6 GeV. So yes, X can decay into tau and anti-tau.

What about muons? 105 MeV is 0.105 GeV. 2m_mu is ~0.21 GeV. So allowed.

Electrons: same, even smaller.

So allowed fermion pairs are:

u, d, s, c, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but wait. Wait, for the quarks, their masses may be lower, but when considering decay, the rest mass isn't the only thing—what about binding energy? But in mass terms, the main factor is the rest mass. So as long as 2m_f ≤ m_X, it's allowed.

So for each fermion f, if m_f ≤3 GeV, then X can decay into f f̄.

So let me check each option:

Option A) X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau^-, e+ e^-.

Wait, but b has mass ~4.7 GeV. So 2m_b=9.4 GeV>6 GeV → so decay into b bbar is not allowed. So option A is incorrect because it includes b.

Option B) X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Wait, c has mass 1.27 GeV. 2m_c=2.54 GeV ≤6 GeV → allowed.

Tau: as above, allowed.

Mu: allowed.

e: allowed.

So in option B, the decay includes c cbar. But wait, what about the tau? Oh yes, B includes tau as well.

But looking at the options, option B is:

c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but wait, what about the top quark? No, top is too heavy.

But wait, the interaction term in the Lagrangian: the term is written as including ψ_f. So what are the allowed fermion species that X can couple to? Because the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I'm not correctly interpreting the fields here.

Wait, perhaps the interaction is Yukawa-like: X couples to a fermion ψ_f. So for each ψ_f, X can decay into ψ_f ψ_f̄.

But the problem is, the Lagrangian isn't specifying which fermions ψ_f are involved. So perhaps X can couple to any fermion. So the possible decay channels are any f f̄ with 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So for X with m=6 GeV, any fermion with m_f ≤3 GeV can be produced as a pair.

So looking at the fermions:

Quarks:
u: 2.2 MeV → allowed.
d: 4.7 MeV → allowed.
s: ~95 MeV → allowed.
c: ~1.27 GeV → allowed. 2m_c=2.54 GeV.
b: 4.7 GeV → 2m=9.4 GeV>6 GeV → not allowed.
t: way too big.

Leptons:
e: allowed.
mu: allowed.
tau: 1.777 GeV → 2m=3.55 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.

So the possible decay channels are:

u, d, s, c, tau, mu, e.

Wait a second. So X can decay into any of these fermion pairs.

Now looking at the options:

Option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that looks correct.

Wait, but option B is:

c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Wait, but in option B, the available decay channels include c, which is allowed, but does the interaction actually allow X to couple to c quarks?

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps this is a Yukawa coupling term. The form is similar to ψ_f^† X ψ_f, so X couples to ψ_f. So for each ψ_f, which is a fermion doublet or something?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, so X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So whatever fermions are in ψ_f, X can decay into them.

But the problem doesn't specify which fermions ψ_f are. So perhaps in this problem, all possible fermions are considered. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair as long as the mass allows.

But wait, perhaps the question is about the specific fermions that the Lagrangian allows. For example, if the Lagrangian is written for a particular fermion, say, up-type quarks, then X can decay into up quarks, but not others. But the problem doesn't specify, so I think the interaction is general, allowing X to couple to all possible fermions.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only fermions that are present in the Standard Model and that X can couple to. Since the problem statement doesn't restrict, I think it's about any fermion, provided the mass allows.

So with X's mass of 6 GeV, the allowed fermions are:

u, d, s, c, tau, mu, e.

So decay modes include any f f̄ where f is one of these. Now looking at the options, option B is:

c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but option B includes c and tau, which are allowed. So the decay channels are X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is:

c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

So that's correct. But wait, the problem gives four options, and option B is one of them.

But wait, what about the bottom quark? As discussed earlier, it's too heavy. So decay into b bbar is not allowed, so option A is incorrect because it includes b.

So the correct answer should include all the allowed fermions except those that are too heavy.

Now looking at the options:

Option B lists c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Option D: includes b, which is not allowed. So D is wrong.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But top quark is way too heavy, so C is incorrect.

Option B is the only one that includes all allowed fermions except the ones that are too heavy.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the quark masses again.

s quark: ~95 MeV → 0.095 GeV. 2m_s=0.19 GeV, way below 6 GeV. So s sbar is allowed.

c quark: ~1.27 GeV. 2m_c =2.54 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.

So the allowed quarks are u, d, s, c.

Leptons: e, mu, tau (since 2m_tau=3.55 GeV <6 GeV).

So the decay channels are X→ u ubar, d dbar, s sbar, c cbar, e+ e−, mu+ mu−, tau+ tau−.

Looking at the options, which option includes all of these?

Option B includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. So option B.

Wait, but option B also includes c cbar. So that's correct.

So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order, we analyze the given Lagrangian and the mass of \( X \), which is 6 GeV. The interaction term in the Lagrangian implies that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)) if the total mass of the pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). Specifically, the condition is:

\[
2m_f \leq m_X
\]

where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \), and \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This means that \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) for the decay to be allowed.

### Fermion Masses (approximate values in GeV)
- **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy, \( 2m_b = 9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
- **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (way too heavy)
- **Electron (\( e \))**: \( 0.000511 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( 2m_\tau = 3.554 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \))

### Allowed Decays
From the above, the fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are:
- Quarks: \( u, d, s, c \)
- Leptons: \( e, \mu, \tau \)

Thus, the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are:
\[
X \to u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c}, e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( m_t = 173 \, \text{GeV} \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \) with \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

Tau is about 1.777 GeV. So 2m_tau is ~3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau-antitau pair is allowed.

Wait, wait, but wait. Wait, I thought the tau is 1.777 GeV, so 2*1.777 is 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau decay is allowed.

But wait, the mass of the tau is about 1.777 GeV. So 2m_tau is 3.554 GeV <6 GeV. So yes, X can decay into tau and anti-tau.

What about muons? 105 MeV is 0.105 GeV. 2m_mu is ~0.21 GeV. So allowed.

Wait, but b has mass ~4.7 GeV. So 2m_b=9.4 GeV>6 GeV → so decay into b bbar is not allowed. So option A is incorrect because it includes b.

Option B) X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Wait, c has mass 1.27 GeV. 2m_c=2.54 GeV ≤6 GeV → allowed.

Tau: as above, allowed.

Mu: allowed.

So in option B, the decay includes c cbar. But wait, what about the tau? Oh yes, B includes tau as well.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is:

c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

So that's correct. But wait, the problem gives four options, and option B is one of them.

But wait, what about the bottom quark? As discussed earlier, it's too heavy. So decay into b bbar is not allowed, so option A is incorrect because it includes b.

So the correct answer should include all the allowed fermions except those that are too heavy.

Option D: includes b, which is not allowed. So D is wrong.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But top quark is way too heavy, so C is incorrect.

Option B is the only one that includes all allowed fermions except the ones that are too heavy.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the quark masses again.

s quark: ~95 MeV → 0.095 GeV. 2m_s=0.19 GeV, way below 6 GeV. So s sbar is allowed.

c quark: ~1.27 GeV. 2m_c =2.54 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.

So the allowed quarks are u, d, s, c.

Leptons: e, mu, tau (since 2m_tau=3.55 GeV <6 GeV).

So the decay channels are X→ u ubar, d dbar, s sbar, c cbar, e+ e−, mu+ mu−, tau+ tau−.

Looking at the options, which option includes all of these?

Option B includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. So option B.

Wait, but option B also includes c cbar. So that's correct.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order, we analyze the given Lagrangian and the mass of \( X \), which is 6 GeV. The interaction term in the Lagrangian implies that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)) if the total mass of the pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). Specifically, the condition is:

\[
2m_f \leq m_X
\]

where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \), and \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This means that \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) for the decay to be allowed.

### Fermion Masses (approximate values in GeV)
- **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy, \( 2m_b = 9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
- **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (way too heavy)
- **Electron (\( e \))**: \( 0.000511 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( 2m_\tau = 3.554 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \))

### Allowed Decays
From the above, the fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are:
- Quarks: \( u, d, s, c \)
- Leptons: \( e, \mu, \tau \)

Thus, the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are:
\[
X \to u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c}, e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( m_t = 173 \, \text{GeV} \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \) with \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

Answer: B
