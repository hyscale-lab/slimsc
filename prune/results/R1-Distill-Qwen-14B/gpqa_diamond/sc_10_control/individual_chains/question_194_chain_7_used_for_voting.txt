Okay, so I have this physics problem here about spins and the partition function. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says there are three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). I need to find the partition function Z. The options are given, so maybe I can work it out step by step.

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So each state contributes a term based on its energy.

Since each spin can be ±1, each has two possibilities. For three spins, the number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. So there are 8 terms to consider.

But maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8 states. Let me think about the symmetry. The energy expression is symmetric in all three spins, so perhaps I can group the states based on how many spins are aligned or anti-aligned.

Wait, the energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Alternatively, this can be written as E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Each term S_i S_j is 1 if the spins are the same (aligned) and -1 if opposite.

So for each pair, the product is either +1 or -1. The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can thus vary based on the states.

Let me consider different cases based on the number of pairs that are aligned.

Wait, another approach: I can note that the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be rewritten in terms of the total spin or something else. Alternatively, perhaps express the sum in a different way.

Wait, let's consider that each term S_i S_j is 1 if S_i = S_j, else -1.

So think about the number of pairs that are aligned. For three spins, there are three pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3).

Each pair contributes +1 if aligned, -1 if not. So the sum would be (number of aligned pairs)*1 + (number of unaligned pairs)*(-1). Since there are 3 pairs, let me denote the number of aligned pairs as m. Then the sum is m*(1) + (3 - m)*(-1) = m - (3 - m) = 2m - 3.

So E = -J * (2m -3) = J*(3 - 2m).

Hmm, but m can be 0,1,2,3, but wait, for three spins, the maximum number of aligned pairs is 3? No, because if all are aligned, all three pairs are aligned. So m can be 0,1,2,3.

Wait, but for three spins, can you have all three pairs aligned? Only if all three spins are the same. Because if S1=S2=S3, then S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. So m=3. If two are aligned and one is not, wait, no. Let's think: maybe if S1 and S2 are aligned, S1 and S3 are aligned, then S2 must equal S3, so S2 and S3 are aligned. So m can't be 2. Wait, that makes sense. So if two pairs are aligned, the third must also be aligned. So m can only be 0,1,3.

Wait, wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Suppose S1 and S2 are aligned, S1 and S3 are anti-aligned. Then S2 and S3 would be anti-aligned as well. So for S1 = S2, S3 = -S1. So S2 and S3 would be anti-aligned. So in this case, m=1 aligned pair. Because S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So sum is 1-1-1 = -1. So E is  J*(3 - 2m). Wait, m is the number of aligned pairs. So in this case, m=1. So E would be J*(3 - 2*1) = J*(1) = J.

Wait, but in the case where two pairs are aligned, what happens? Let me see. Suppose S1 and S2 are aligned, S2 and S3 are aligned. Then S1 and S3 must be aligned as well. So m=3 in that case. So the possible values of m are 0, 1, 3.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think about m=2. Suppose S1 and S2 are aligned, S1 and S3 are anti-aligned, S2 and S3 are anti-aligned. Then the sum would be 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. But in that case, how many aligned pairs are there? Only 1. So m=1.

So perhaps m cannot be 2. Therefore, the possible values of m are 0,1,3.

Wait, but wait another scenario: what if S1 and S2 are aligned, S2 and S3 are aligned, but S1 and S3 are not? No, that's impossible. Because if S2 = S1 and S2 = S3, then S1 must equal S3. So m=3 if two pairs are aligned.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe a better approach is to consider the possible configurations.

Let me list all possible 8 states:

Each spin can be up (+1) or down (-1). Let's denote each state as (S1, S2, S3).

1. (1,1,1)
2. (1,1,-1)
3. (1,-1,1)
4. (1,-1,-1)
5. (-1,1,1)
6. (-1,1,-1)
7. (-1,-1,1)
8. (-1,-1,-1)

Now, for each state, calculate the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, then E, then exp(-βE), and sum all.

Alternatively, since the energy depends only on the number of aligned pairs, perhaps group the states by the number of aligned pairs.

Wait, for each state, let's compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

State 1: (1,1,1)
Each product is 1, so sum is 3. E = -J*(3) = -3J.

State 2: (1,1,-1)
S1S2 =1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

State 3: (1,-1,1)
S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.

State4: (1,-1,-1)
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1-1+1 =-1. E= J.

State5: (-1,1,1)
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1-1+1 =-1. E= J.

State6: (-1,1,-1)
S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 =-1. E= J.

State7: (-1,-1,1)
S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum:1 -1 -1= -1. E= J.

State8: (-1,-1,-1)
Each product is 1, sum is 3. E= -3J.

Wait, so grouping the states by their energies:

- Energy E = -3J occurs for states 1 and 8. So two states.
- Energy E = J occurs for states 2,3,4,5,6,7. So six states.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E).

So Z = [number of states with E=-3J] * exp(-β*(-3J)) + [number of states with E=J] * exp(-β*J).

Wait, because E is per state, each state contributes exp(-β E). So:

Z = 2 * exp(3 J β) + 6 * exp(-J β).

Because for the two states with E=-3J: exp(-βE) = exp(3Jβ).

For the six states with E=J: exp(-β E) = exp(-J β).

So Z = 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

Looking at the options:

Option B is Z= 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

Wait, the options:

A) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)
B) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)
C) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)
D) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)

So yes, option B matches.

To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \right).
\]

The partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]

where \( \beta = \frac{1}{kT} \). Since there are three spins, there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. Each state is represented by \( (S_1, S_2, S_3) \), and the energy \( E \) depends on the products \( S_i S_j \), which are \( +1 \) if the spins are aligned and \( -1 \) if they are anti-aligned.

### Step 1: Enumerate all states and calculate their energies
The eight states are:

1. \( (1, 1, 1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(3) = -3J \).
2. \( (1, 1, -1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
3. \( (1, -1, 1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
4. \( (1, -1, -1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
5. \( (-1, 1, 1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
6. \( (-1, 1, -1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
7. \( (-1, -1, 1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
8. \( (-1, -1, -1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(3) = -3J \).

### Step 2: Group states by energy
From the above, the energies are:

- \( E = -3J \): Occurs for states 1 and 8 (2 states).
- \( E = J \): Occurs for states 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (6 states).

### Step 3: Calculate the partition function
The partition function is:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E}.
\]

For \( E = -3J \), the contribution is:

\[
2 \cdot e^{-\beta (-3J)} = 2 \cdot e^{3J\beta}.
\]

For \( E = J \), the contribution is:

\[
6 \cdot e^{-\beta J}.
\]

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
Comparing with the given options:

- **A)** \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) — Incorrect.
- **B)** \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) — Correct.
- **C)** \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) — Incorrect.
- **D)** \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) — Incorrect.

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about spins and the partition function. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says there are three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). I need to find the partition function Z. The options are given, so maybe I can work it out step by step.

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So each state contributes a term based on its energy.

Since each spin can be ±1, each has two possibilities. For three spins, the number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. So there are 8 terms to consider.

But maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8 states. Let me think about the symmetry. The energy expression is symmetric in all three spins, so perhaps I can group the states based on how many spins are aligned or anti-aligned.

Wait, the energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Alternatively, this can be written as E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Each term S_i S_j is 1 if the spins are the same (aligned) and -1 if opposite.

So for each pair, the product is either +1 or -1. The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can thus vary based on the states.

Let me consider different cases based on the number of pairs that are aligned.

Wait, another approach: I can note that the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be rewritten in terms of the total spin or something else. Alternatively, perhaps express the sum in a different way.

Wait, let's consider that each term S_i S_j is 1 if S_i = S_j, else -1.

So think about the number of pairs that are aligned. For three spins, there are three pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3).

Each pair contributes +1 if aligned, -1 if not. So the sum would be (number of aligned pairs)*1 + (number of unaligned pairs)*(-1). Since there are 3 pairs, let me denote the number of aligned pairs as m. Then the sum is m*(1) + (3 - m)*(-1) = m - (3 - m) = 2m - 3.

So E = -J * (2m -3) = J*(3 - 2m).

Hmm, but m can be 0,1,2,3, but wait, for three spins, the maximum number of aligned pairs is 3? No, because if all are aligned, all three pairs are aligned. So m can be 0,1,2,3.

Wait, but for three spins, can you have all three pairs aligned? Only if all three spins are the same. Because if S1=S2=S3, then S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. So m=3. If two are aligned and one is not, wait, no. Let's think: maybe if S1 and S2 are aligned, S1 and S3 are aligned, then S2 must equal S3, so S2 and S3 are aligned. So m can't be 2. Wait, that makes sense. So if two pairs are aligned, the third must also be aligned. So m can only be 0,1,3.

Wait, wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Suppose S1 and S2 are aligned, S1 and S3 are anti-aligned. Then S2 and S3 would be anti-aligned as well. So for S1 = S2, S3 = -S1. So S2 and S3 would be anti-aligned. So in this case, m=1 aligned pair. Because S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So sum is 1-1-1 = -1. So E is  J*(3 - 2m). Wait, m is the number of aligned pairs. So in this case, m=1. So E would be J*(3 - 2*1) = J*(1) = J.

Wait, but in the case where two pairs are aligned, what happens? Let me see. Suppose S1 and S2 are aligned, S2 and S3 are aligned. Then S1 and S3 must be aligned as well. So m=3 in that case. So the possible values of m are 0, 1, 3.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think about m=2. Suppose S1 and S2 are aligned, S1 and S3 are anti-aligned, S2 and S3 are anti-aligned. Then the sum would be 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. But in that case, how many aligned pairs are there? Only 1. So m=1.

So perhaps m cannot be 2. Therefore, the possible values of m are 0,1,3.

Wait, but wait another scenario: what if S1 and S2 are aligned, S2 and S3 are aligned, but S1 and S3 are not? No, that's impossible. Because if S2 = S1 and S2 = S3, then S1 must equal S3. So m=3 if two pairs are aligned.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe a better approach is to consider the possible configurations.

Let me list all possible 8 states:

Each spin can be up (+1) or down (-1). Let's denote each state as (S1, S2, S3).

1. (1,1,1)
2. (1,1,-1)
3. (1,-1,1)
4. (1,-1,-1)
5. (-1,1,1)
6. (-1,1,-1)
7. (-1,-1,1)
8. (-1,-1,-1)

Now, for each state, calculate the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, then E, then exp(-βE), and sum all.

Alternatively, since the energy depends only on the number of aligned pairs, perhaps group the states by the number of aligned pairs.

Wait, for each state, let's compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

State 1: (1,1,1)
Each product is 1, so sum is 3. E = -J*(3) = -3J.

State 2: (1,1,-1)
S1S2 =1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

State 3: (1,-1,1)
S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.

State4: (1,-1,-1)
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1-1+1 =-1. E= J.

State5: (-1,1,1)
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1-1+1 =-1. E= J.

State6: (-1,1,-1)
S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 =-1. E= J.

State7: (-1,-1,1)
S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum:1 -1 -1= -1. E= J.

State8: (-1,-1,-1)
Each product is 1, sum is 3. E= -3J.

Wait, so grouping the states by their energies:

- Energy E = -3J occurs for states 1 and 8. So two states.
- Energy E = J occurs for states 2,3,4,5,6,7. So six states.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E).

So Z = [number of states with E=-3J] * exp(-β*(-3J)) + [number of states with E=J] * exp(-β*J).

Wait, because E is per state, each state contributes exp(-β E). So:

Z = 2 * exp(3 J β) + 6 * exp(-J β).

Because for the two states with E=-3J: exp(-βE) = exp(3Jβ).

For the six states with E=J: exp(-β E) = exp(-J β).

So Z = 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

Looking at the options:

Option B is Z= 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

Wait, the options:

A) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)
B) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)
C) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)
D) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)

So yes, option B matches.


To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \right).
\]

The partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]

where \( \beta = \frac{1}{kT} \). Since there are three spins, there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. Each state is represented by \( (S_1, S_2, S_3) \), and the energy \( E \) depends on the products \( S_i S_j \), which are \( +1 \) if the spins are aligned and \( -1 \) if they are anti-aligned.

### Step 1: Enumerate all states and calculate their energies
The eight states are:

1. \( (1, 1, 1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(3) = -3J \).
2. \( (1, 1, -1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
3. \( (1, -1, 1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
4. \( (1, -1, -1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
5. \( (-1, 1, 1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
6. \( (-1, 1, -1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
7. \( (-1, -1, 1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).
8. \( (-1, -1, -1) \): \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(3) = -3J \).

### Step 2: Group states by energy
From the above, the energies are:

- \( E = -3J \): Occurs for states 1 and 8 (2 states).
- \( E = J \): Occurs for states 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (6 states).

### Step 3: Calculate the partition function
The partition function is:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E}.
\]

For \( E = -3J \), the contribution is:

\[
2 \cdot e^{-\beta (-3J)} = 2 \cdot e^{3J\beta}.
\]

For \( E = J \), the contribution is:

\[
6 \cdot e^{-\beta J}.
\]

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
Comparing with the given options:

- **A)** \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) — Incorrect.
- **B)** \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) — Correct.
- **C)** \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) — Incorrect.
- **D)** \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) — Incorrect.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
