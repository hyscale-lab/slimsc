Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The problem says that cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Then product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to form product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to get product 3. Finally, product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride to form product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present on product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

First, I need to go through each step and figure out what each product is.

Starting with cyclohexanone. Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? So it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group (O=). The first reaction is treating it with bromine. Oh wait, bromine adding to a ketone... Hmm. Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you treat a ketone with bromine (Br2), what happens? Oh, wait, bromine can add to the carbonyl group. Wait, but wait, maybe it's an addition reaction. But wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh wait, wait, wait. Oh! Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone has a ketone, which is a good electrophilic site. But adding bromine to a ketone... I think I remember that ketones can undergo some kind of addition with bromine. Oh wait, no, maybe it's a bromination via an enolate? Or perhaps a different mechanism.

Wait, no. Wait. Another possibility: when a ketone is treated with bromine, it might form a dibromide through a conjugate addition. Or, wait, maybe the ketone is undergoing a bromohydrin formation? No, that's when you have something like HBr and H2O. Alternatively, perhaps it's an allylic bromination? Oh wait, wait, no—cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let's think again. Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When treated with Br2, perhaps it undergoes a bromination on the ring. Wait, but cyclohexanone is a saturated ring. Adding Br2 might not be possible for substitution. Unless it's an alpha bromination. Oh! Right, alpha bromination. So the ketone's alpha carbons are more reactive. So maybe cyclohexanone is treated with Br2 in some conditions where the alpha position undergoes bromination.

So the starting material is cyclohexanone. Its structure is a six-membered ring with one oxygen as a ketone. The alpha carbons are the two adjacent to the carbonyl. So each of those has two hydrogen atoms (since cyclohexanone is a chair conformation, but maybe the structure has two equivalent alpha positions? Wait, no. Wait, in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is in a chair conformation, but the two alpha carbons are equivalent in the chair. So when treated with Br2, it would undergo bromination on the alpha position. So product 1 would be 2-bromocyclohexanone, but wait, wait. Wait, maybe the bromine adds to the carbonyl? No, because adding Br2 to a ketone would probably give a diester or something, but maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a halogenation using another method.

Wait, perhaps the first step is an addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group. So, cyclohexanone has O=C-(CH2)5-C=O? No, wait, no. Cyclohexanone is (CH2)5-C=O. So the carbonyl is at one position. Adding Br2 to the carbonyl would lead to a diaddition, perhaps giving a vicinal dihalide. Wait, but ketones don't typically add Br2 in such a way, because that's more for alkenes. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe the first step is a ring-opening addition. But cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts bromination? But wait, cyclohexanone isn't aromatic, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the first step is the formation of an epoxide, but no, that's with peracids. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again. What are the possible reactions of cyclohexanone with bromine?

Oh, wait, maybe it's a bromination at the alpha position. So the alpha carbons (the two adjacent to the ketone) get brominated. So the product would be 2-bromocyclohexanone or 3-bromocyclohexanone? Wait, but the numbering would place the ketone at position 1, so the adjacent carbons are 2 and 6, which are equivalent in the chair conformation. So adding a bromine to either would give the same product, 2-bromocyclohexanone. So product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.

Then, product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to form product 2. So heating 2-bromocyclohexanone with NaOH. That sounds like a hydrolysis reaction. Wait, but with NaOH, maybe an elimination or substitution occurs.

Wait, 2-bromocyclohexanone has a Br on the alpha carbon. Heating with NaOH (a strong base) might lead to an elimination reaction. Wait, but where? Let's think. The ketone is at C1, Br is at C2. When you eliminate, you lose H from C1 or C3. Wait, but wait, the base would deprotonate a beta hydrogen, leading to an elimination. But in a cyclic ketone, maybe elimination occurs, forming a double bond.

Wait, so if we have 2-bromocyclohexanone and treat it with a base like NaOH, perhaps it undergoes elimination to form cyclohexenone. Specifically, the Br is on C2, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but in that case, the double bond would be between C1 and C2, but C1 is the carbonyl. So that would not be possible because the carbonyl would be at C1, and a double bond between C1 and C2 would mean the carbonyl is part of an enone, which is possible. Wait, but wait, when you eliminate from 2-bromocyclohexanone, the Br is on C2. So when the base removes a proton from C3, you form a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, but let me think about the structure.

Wait, the structure of 2-bromocyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with the ketone at C1 and Br at C2. So the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. So when the base abstracts a hydrogen, say from C3, which is adjacent to C2, elimination occurs between C2 and C3, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. So the product would be cyclohexenone, with the double bond between C2 and C3. So product 2 is 2-cyclohexenone.

Wait, but wait, when you eliminate, the double bond would form between the alpha carbon (C2) and the adjacent (beta) carbon (C3), leading to a cyclohexenone with the double bond between C2 and C3. So product 2 is 2-cyclohexenone.

Next step: product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to form product 3. Thionyl chloride is commonly used to convert carboxylic acids to acid chlorides, but in this case, product 2 is a ketone (2-cyclohexenone). Wait, wait, 2-cyclohexenone has a ketone group, so treating it with SOCl2 would convert the ketone to an acid chloride. Wait, but wait, ketones cannot form acid chlorides as easily as carboxylic acids can. Wait, no, actually, ketones can be converted to acid chlorides using SOCl2, but that's not the usual case. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, product 2 is 2-cyclohexenone, which is a cyclic ketone with a double bond. Thionyl chloride reacts with ketones to form ketone chlorides. So, 2-cyclohexenone would react with SOCl2 to form 2-cyclohexenone chloride. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is not a ketone. Wait, no, 2-cyclohexenone is a ketone. So, upon treatment with SOCl2 and pyridine, the ketone would become a chloroketone, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of an acid chloride, but since it's a ketone, maybe it's forming an acyl chloride. Wait, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is an aldehyde. Wait, no, product 2 is from the elimination of 2-bromocyclohexanone, which gives 2-cyclohexenone, which is a ketone with a double bond. So, when treated with SOCl2, perhaps the ketone is converted into a chloroalkane. Wait, but wait, another possibility: maybe the double bond is being converted into something else. Wait, another thought: maybe the ketone is converted into an acid chloride, but that's not correct because ketones can't become acid chlorides; they become chlorides. Wait, no, wait. No, ketones are R-CO-R', and treating with SOCl2 would convert the carbonyl into an acyl chloride, R-COCl. So 2-cyclohexenone would become 2-cyclohexenyl chloride, but that's an acid chloride.

Wait, but I'm not too confident about this. Alternatively, maybe the double bond is getting involved. So, 2-cyclohexenone is a cyclic ketone with a double bond between C2 and C3. When treated with SOCl2, perhaps the double bond remains, and the ketone becomes an acid chloride. So product 3 would be 2-cyclohexenone chloride, which is an acid chloride. But wait, another thought: maybe the thionyl chloride is reacting with the ketone to make an acyl chloride, which is then more reactive.

Then, product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (often called LIA or LDA, but wait, wait, no. Wait, no, LDA is Lithium diisopropylamide. LIA is something else. Wait, the reagent here is LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent. So, when an acid chloride is treated with a strong reducing agent like this, what happens?

Wait, acid chlorides (acyl chlorides) are typically reduced to alcohols using LiAlH4. The acyl chloride RCOCl would be reduced to RCH2OH. But wait, wait, what about the presence of the double bond in the ring?

Wait, so product 3 is an acid chloride with a double bond. When reduced with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong hydride donor, the carbonyl (from the acid chloride) would be reduced. So the acyl chloride (RCOCl) becomes RCH2Cl? Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

Wait, the reaction of an acid chloride with LiAlH4 would typically proceed as follows: RCOCl + LiAlH4 → RCH2LiAlCl + ...? No, wait, I think when you reduce an acyl chloride with LiAlH4, you get an alcohol. So RCOCl → RCH2OH after reduction. But in this case, the acyl chloride is part of a cyclohexenone ring. So, the ring would have the double bond and the acyl group.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. So, product 3 is 2-cyclohexenone chloride. When treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent, the acyl chloride (RCOCl) would be reduced to RCH2OH. But wait, in a cyclic system, this would form a secondary alcohol. So, the ketone is converted to an alcohol. So, product 4 would be 2-cyclohexanol. But wait, wait, the ring has a double bond. So, let me try to visualize this.

Wait, 2-cyclohexenone is a six-membered ring with a ketone at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3. When that ketone is reduced to an alcohol, you get a secondary alcohol at C1, and the double bond remains between C2 and C3. So product 4 is 2-cyclohexanol with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, that's cyclohexanol with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-cyclohexanol with a double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, but another thought: when you reduce an acid chloride (which is the product 3) with a strong hydride donor, maybe it's a two-step process. The acid chloride is first converted to an acyl lithium intermediate, but perhaps I'm mixing up reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is not an acid chloride. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the steps.

Wait, product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone. Then product 1 is treated with NaOH, which gives product 2. I initially thought it was via elimination to form a double bond, so product 2 would be 2-cyclohexenone. But perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: when 2-bromocyclohexanone is treated with NaOH, it could undergo substitution. The bromide is at C2, which is adjacent to the carbonyl. So, perhaps the NaOH would perform an SN2 substitution, replacing Br with OH. That would give 2-hydroxycyclohexanone.

Wait, but wait, in that case, the product would be 2-hydroxycyclohexanone. Then, when product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride, maybe the hydroxyl group is converted to a chloride. So product 3 would be 2-chlorocyclohexanone.

Then, when product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent, the ketone group would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So product 4 would be 2-chlorocyclohexanol.

But wait, that doesn't seem to fit because LiAlH4 typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, but if there's a leaving group like Cl, perhaps it could undergo elimination or other reactions. Alternatively, maybe the Cl is deprotonated and leaves, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I need to re-examine the steps again.

Let me go back and try each step carefully.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine. Possible reactions: alpha bromination, allylic bromination, addition to carbonyl.

Wait, wait. I think another possibility is that the carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with Br2 to form a brominated product. But in what way?

Wait, perhaps it's a diaddition to the carbonyl, forming a dibromide. So, the ketone O=C-R would add Br2 to form OBr-CBr-R. But that's probably not correct because ketones don't add Br2 like alkenes do. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution. Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the reaction is an electrophilic substitution. But cyclohexanone isn't aromatic, so that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of a bromoalkane via an elimination-addition mechanism. Oh wait, like the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, which brominates the alpha position. So in that case, product 1 would indeed be 2-bromocyclohexanone.

So, product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.

Step 2: product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with NaOH.

Heating with NaOH could lead to elimination, forming an enone. If the Br is at C2 and the ketone is at C1, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but wait, C1 is already a carbonyl. So that can't form a double bond because the carbonyl is already a double bond.

Wait, so elimination would form a double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure would look like a cyclohexene ring with a ketone at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3, making it 2-cyclohexenone.

So product 2 is 2-cyclohexenone.

Step 3: product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine to form product 3.

Thionyl chloride typically converts carboxylic acids to acid chlorides, but it can also react with ketones. So, when a ketone reacts with SOCl2, it forms an acyl chloride. So 2-cyclohexenone would become 2-cyclohexenone chloride, which would have a structure where the ketone group is replaced by Cl, like O=C-Cl.

Wait, but wait, 2-cyclohexenone has a double bond between C2 and C3, and the ketone is at C1. So, when converting the ketone to an acyl chloride, product 3 would be 2-cyclohexenone chloride, which is an acyl chloride.

Step 4: product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(t-Bu)3), which is a strong reducing agent, to form product 4.

So, the acyl chloride (product 3) is now reduced. The reduction of an acyl chloride typically produces a primary alcohol. But in this case, the acyl chloride is part of a ring, so the reduction would lead to a secondary alcohol.

Wait, no. Wait, acyl chloride RCOCl upon reduction with LiAlH4 would yield RCH2OH. So, in this case, R is the cyclohexenyl group. So the product would be cyclohexenylmethanol. Wait, but wait, the structure would be a cyclohexene ring with a CH2OH group attached at position 1, where the ketone was. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agent reduces the carbonyl group (now an acyl chloride) to a CH2 group, leading to an alcohol. So, the ketone at position 1 becomes CH2OH, and the double bond is still present between C2 and C3.

So the product 4 would be 1-(cyclohex-2-enyl)ethanol, or more accurately, cyclohexenylmethanol, where the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure would be a six-membered ring with a double bond between C2 and C3, and a CH2OH group attached to C1.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure again. The starting material is 2-cyclohexenone, which is cyclohexanone with a double bond between C2 and C3. So the ketone is at C1, and the double bond is between C2 and C3. When the ketone is converted to an acyl chloride (product 3), it's RCOCl. Then, when reduced, the ketone group (COCl) becomes CH2OH. So the product 4 is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C2 and C3, and a CH2OH group at C1.

So product 4 is 1-(cyclohex-2-enyl)ethanol, which can also be called 2-cyclohexenylmethanol.

Now, the question is: how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present on product 4.

So, we need to look at the structure of product 4 and count the distinct protons.

Let me sketch the structure mentally.

Product 4 is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C2 and C3. At position C1, there's a CH2OH group. So, the structure is:

- C1: CH2OH
- C2: double bond to C3
- C4, C5, C6: each have two CH2 groups, but wait, the ring is cyclohexene, so the structure is:

C1 is connected to C2 and C6.

C2 is connected to C1 and C3, with a double bond to C3.

C3 is connected to C2 and C4, with a double bond to C2.

C4 is connected to C3 and C5.

C5 is connected to C4 and C6.

C6 is connected to C5 and C1.

And C1 has a CH2OH group attached.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Positions:

1: CH2OH group attached to the ring.

2: double bond between 2 and 3.

So, the ring is cyclohexene with the double bond between C2 and C3, and a CH2OH group at C1.

Now, let's analyze the symmetry and the distinct hydrogens.

Each position in the ring will have a certain number of equivalent hydrogens, but because of the substituents, some might be non-equivalent.

Let me number the positions:

1: CH2OH attached. So, C1 has two CH2 groups (the CH2OH is -CH2-OH, so the C1 is CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, no, wait. The structure is a six-membered ring, so the C1 is connected to two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6). The C1 also has a CH2OH group attached. So, the structure at C1 is CH2OH attached to the ring. Wait, no: the C1 is bonded to the two adjacent carbons in the ring (C2 and C6) and has a CH2OH substituent. So, the C1 is a quaternary carbon? No, wait, no. C1 is part of the ring and has three single bonds: to C2, C6, and the CH2OH group. So, C1 is a secondary carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more accurately described as:

The ring is cyclohexene with a substituent at C1. C1 has a CH2OH group attached, so the structure is CH2OH-C1 connected to C2 and C6.

The double bond is between C2 and C3.

So, the substituents on the ring are:

- C1: CH2OH
- C2: double bond to C3

Now, let's look at each position.

C1: CH2OH group. This group has two hydrogen atoms, but they are identical because the CH2 group is attached to the ring. So, the two Hs on CH2OH are equivalent.

C2: in the double bond, so it's a vinylic carbon. It's connected to C1 and C3. The Hs on C2 (if any) would be part of the double bond. Wait, no, in a double bond between C2 and C3, each of them has two substituents. In cyclohexene, each double bond carbon is bonded to two other ring carbons and two Hs, but in this case, C2 is bonded to C1 (which has a substituent) and C3. So, the structure is more accurately a substituted cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of the molecule as follows:

The ring is cyclohexene with a substituent at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3.

So, the substituent at C1 is CH2OH, making the structure something like:

CH2OH-C1-C2=C3-C4-C5-C6.

Wait, so the ring is:

C1 is connected to C2 (double bond) and C6.

Wait, no. Another way: the ring has six carbons, with a double bond between C2 and C3. So, the ring is: C1 is connected to C2 and C6. C2 is connected to C1, C3, and has a double bond to C3. C3 is connected to C2 (double bond), C4, and C4. C4 is connected to C3 and C5. C5 connected to C4 and C6. C6 connected to C5 and C1.

Now, the substituent is at C1: CH2OH.

So, the structure of product 4 is a cyclohexene ring with a CH2OH group at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3.

Now, to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

Let's list all possible Hs and determine their equivalence.

1. The CH2OH group: the two Hs on the CH2 are equivalent because they're attached to the same carbon and in a symmetric environment.

2. C1: It's attached to the CH2OH group and the two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6). The Hs on C1 would be looking at different substituents, so they are distinct from each other. Wait, but C1 is a carbon in the ring, and its Hs are attached to a substituted carbon. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in cyclohexane, each CH2 has two Hs. But in this case, C1 is attached to CH2OH and two ring carbons. So, the structure at C1 is CH(CH2OH)(C2)(C6). Wait, no, C1 is a carbon in the ring, so it must have four bonds. So, C1 is connected to two ring carbons (C2 and C6), the CH2OH group, and another H? Wait, no, that's possible. Wait, wait, no: in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is CH2. But when a substituent is attached, like CH2OH, the carbon (C1) would have three bonds: two to adjacent ring carbons and one to the substituent, leaving one H. So, C1 would have CH(CH2OH)(C2)(C6) and one H. Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like this: The ring is cyclohexene with a substituent at C1. So, C1 has a CH2OH group attached to it, and the ring is otherwise similar to cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the molecule as a cyclohexene ring with the substituent at C1, and the double bond between C2 and C3.

So, the substituent at C1 is a CH2OH group, so the structure at C1 is:

C1 is connected to:

- C2 (ring)
- C6 (ring)
- CH2OH (substituent)

Wait, but that would only account for three bonds. So, perhaps C1 has a fourth bond, which is a hydrogen. So, it's CH(CH2OH)(C2)(C6)H. Hmm, but that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a substituent at C1 as CH2OH, making the structure at C1 a CH2 group attached to the ring and the OH group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of the molecule as a cyclohexene ring with a CH2OH group attached at C1. So, the ring has a substituent at C1, which is a CH2OH group, and a double bond between C2 and C3.

Now, the question is about the distinct H atoms on the product 4 molecule.

Let me list all the possible H environments.

1. The CH2OH group: the two Hs on CH2 are equivalent because they're on the same carbon and in a symmetric environment. So, that's one type of H.

2. The H on C1: Since C1 is attached to the CH2OH group and two other ring carbons, the H on C1 is unique. So, that's another type.

3. The Hs adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, C2 and C3 are each sp2 hybridized. Each of them has two substituents (from the ring) and two Hs. But wait, in a cyclohexene ring, each double bond carbon is connected to two Hs.

Wait, no. In a typical cyclohexene, each double bond carbon has two substituents (the adjacent ring carbons) and two Hs. So, when there's a substituent attached to C1, how does that affect the substituents on C2 and C3?

Wait, perhaps in this case, C2 and C3 have substituents due to the ring structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on C2 and C3 are:

- C2 is connected to C1 (which has CH2OH), C3, and two Hs.

- C3 is connected to C2 (double bond), C4, and two Hs.

Wait, no, that can't be right because, with the substituent on C1, the substituents on C2 and C3 would vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C2 and C3 are such that each has two Hs, but they are in different environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on C2 and C3 are equivalent due to symmetry.

Wait, but given the substituent on C1, the molecule might not be symmetrical across the C2-C3 double bond.

So, to analyze the Hs:

1. The CH2OH group has two Hs (equivalent).

2. The C1 has one H (distinct from all others).

3. The C2 has two Hs, which may be equivalent or not.

4. The C3 has two Hs, which may be equivalent or not.

5. The C4, C5, and C6 have Hs that may be equivalent or not.

Wait, but let me think in terms of symmetry. The molecule is 1-(cyclohex-2-enyl)ethanol. The substituent is at C1, and the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, the molecule is not symmetrical across the double bond because of the substituent at C1.

So, the Hs on C2 and C3 may not be equivalent. Let's consider each:

- C2: attached to C1 (which has CH2OH) and C3. So, the two Hs on C2 are in an environment influenced by the substituent on C1. Are they equivalent? Probably not, because the substituent breaks the symmetry. So, the two Hs on C2 would be distinct. Wait, but wait, in a double bond, each C is sp2 hybridized, and each has two Hs. But in this case, one H is on the same side as the substituent, and the other is on the opposite side. Are they in the same environment? Probably not, so each H on C2 would be distinct.

Wait, but wait, if the substituent is on C1, then the Hs on C2 would not be equivalent because of the different substituents around them.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on C2 and C3 are in different environments, making each of their Hs unique.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the molecule's symmetry. The molecule's plane of symmetry would be through the C1 and the center of the double bond, but with the substituent at C1, that symmetry may be broken.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes some Hs equivalent.

But perhaps the easiest way is to count all possible distinct Hs, considering their environments.

Let me proceed step by step.

1. The CH2OH group: 2 Hs (equivalent).

2. C1: 1 H (unique).

3. C2: two Hs. Are they equivalent? Since C2 is attached to C1 (which has CH2OH) and C3, which is part of the double bond, the two Hs on C2 are in different environments. So, each H on C2 is unique.

Wait, but in reality, in a double bond, the substituents on each carbon can lead to axial and equatorial positions, but in this case, perhaps the substituent on C1 would cause the Hs on C2 to be non-equivalent.

So, C2 would have two distinct Hs.

4. C3: two Hs. Similarly, the substituent on C1 affects the environment of C3's Hs. Are they equivalent? Probably not, so two distinct Hs.

5. C4: this carbon is in the ring, connected to C3 and C5. It's a CH2 group, but in a ring, the substituents around it may affect the environment.

Wait, but in the cyclohexene ring, C4 is adjacent to the double bond. So, C4 has two Hs. Are they equivalent? Because the ring is not symmetrical anymore due to the substituent at C1, the Hs on C4 may be distinct from those on C5 and C6.

Wait, let's think about the structure.

C4 is connected to C3 and C5. The ring is cyclohexene, so the positions are:

C1: CH2OH

C2: double bond to C3.

C4: connected to C3 (double bond) and C5.

C5: connected to C4 and C6.

C6: connected to C5 and C1.

So, the ring is a six-membered ring with a substituent at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3.

The substituent at C1 breaks the symmetry, so the Hs on C4 may be different from those on C5 and C6.

Let me consider each:

- C4: two Hs. Are they equivalent? Since it's in a ring with a substituent, perhaps they are not equivalent. But maybe in this structure, the ring is symmetric in some way.

Wait, perhaps the substituent at C1 creates a plane of symmetry that makes some Hs equivalent. Let me think: If C1 has the substituent, and the double bond is between C2 and C3, the molecule's symmetry would be along an axis that goes through C1 and the midpoint between C4 and C6.

Wait, perhaps not. It's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to count all possible distinct Hs without assuming symmetry.

So, let's proceed:

- CH2OH group: 2 Hs (type A).

- C1: 1 H (type B).

- C2: 2 Hs (types C and D).

- C3: 2 Hs (types E and F).

- C4: 2 Hs (types G and H).

- C5: 2 Hs (types I and J).

- C6: 2 Hs (types K and L).

Wait, but that would give 12 Hs, which seems way too high. Wait, no, no. Wait, the molecule is cyclohexene with a substituent. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the molecule has a six-membered ring, so each carbon in the ring is connected to two other ring carbons and may have a substituent or H.

But perhaps it's better to count the number of distinct environments.

Let me try a different approach.

The substituent is on C1 (CH2OH), and the double bond is between C2 and C3.

So, the substituent affects the symmetry of the molecule, making certain Hs unique.

Let's consider each carbon's Hs:

1. C1: CH2OH group attached. So, C1's substituent is -CH2OH. Therefore, C1 has two Hs on its CH2 group, which are equivalent. So, type A: 2 H.

2. C2: Double bond to C3. So, C2 has two Hs. Are they equivalent? In a trans or cis arrangement? But without knowing the configuration, perhaps it's best to assume they are non-equivalent. So, two Hs (type B and C).

3. C3: Double bond to C2. Two Hs, possibly non-equivalent (type D and E).

4. C4: connected to C3 and C5. Two Hs. Are they equivalent? If the ring is not symmetric, perhaps not. So, two Hs (types F and G).

5. C5: connected to C4 and C6. Two Hs (types H and I).

6. C6: connected to C5 and C1. Two Hs. Are they equivalent? Since C1 has a substituent, perhaps the Hs on C6 are in different environments. So, two Hs (types J and K).

Wait, but this approach is leading to too many types.

Alternatively, perhaps some of these Hs are equivalent.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes some Hs equivalent.

The substituent is at C1, and the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry that cuts through C1 and the midpoint between C4 and C6.

If that's the case, then some Hs would be mirror images of each other and thus equivalent.

So, let's see:

- The two Hs on C2: perhaps they are on opposite sides of the double bond, but due to the substituent, they might be non-equivalent.

- The two Hs on C3: similarly, perhaps non-equivalent.

- The Hs on C4 and C6: maybe they are equivalent because of the symmetry plane.

Wait, perhaps the ring has a plane that makes C4 and C6 symmetrical. So, the Hs on C4 and C6 would be equivalent.

Similarly, perhaps the Hs on C5 are equivalent.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of numbering the atoms and considering their environments.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the distinct Hs based on their positions.

Let me try to list each position's Hs and determine if they're equivalent.

1. CH2OH group: 2 Hs (A).

2. C1: 1 H (B).

3. C2: two Hs (C and D).

4. C3: two Hs (E and F).

5. C4: two Hs (G and H).

6. C5: two Hs (I and J).

7. C6: two Hs (K and L).

Wait, but that's 12 Hs in total, which can't be right because a cyclohexene ring has 10 Hs (each CH2 has two Hs), but with substituents, perhaps it's different.

Wait, no. Wait, the molecule is 1-(cyclohex-2-enyl)ethanol. So the structure is:

- A cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C2 and C3.

- A CH2OH group attached to C1.

Each CH2 in the ring contributes two Hs, except for the substituted C1, which has a CH2OH group. So, the ring would have:

- C1: CH2OH (so CH2 group: two Hs).

Wait, but wait, no. C1 is part of the ring. So, each ring carbon has two Hs, but if a substituent is attached, like CH2OH, then C1 would have only one H (since it's connected to the ring and the substituent). So, C1: 1 H (attached to the ring) and the CH2OH group has two Hs.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to count all Hs again.

The molecule has:

- CH2OH group: 2 Hs.

- C1: 1 H (since it's connected to two ring carbons and the substituent).

- C2: two Hs (sp2 hybridized).

- C3: two Hs (sp2 hybridized).

- C4: two Hs (sp3 hybridized).

- C5: two Hs (sp3 hybridized).

- C6: two Hs (sp3 hybridized).

Wait, but that would make a total of 2 (CH2OH) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2) + 2 (C3) + 2 (C4) + 2 (C5) + 2 (C6) = 13 Hs. But that can't be right because the molecule should have fewer.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure. Let me think again.

The product is formed by reducing the acyl chloride (from 2-cyclohexenone) to an alcohol. So, the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a CH2OH group at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3.

So, each carbon in the ring:

- C1: CH2OH (so, two Hs on CH2, and another H attached to the ring? No, because it's part of the ring. Wait, perhaps the ring structure is such that C1 is connected to two ring carbons and the CH2OH group, which would leave it with one H. So, C1 has one H.

- C2: double bond to C3, so two Hs.

- C3: double bond to C2, so two Hs.

- C4: connected to C3 and C5, so two Hs.

- C5: connected to C4 and C6, so two Hs.

- C6: connected to C5 and C1, so two Hs.

Then, the CH2OH group has two Hs.

So, total Hs: 1 (C1) + 2 (C2) + 2 (C3) + 2 (C4) + 2 (C5) + 2 (C6) + 2 (CH2OH) = 13 Hs. But that's not possible because a cyclohexene ring typically has 10 Hs (each CH2 has two Hs, but with substituents, some may have one H). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that C1 has a CH2OH group, making it a CH2 group. So, C1 is part of the ring and has two Hs.

Wait, no. Maybe I should think in terms of the actual structure. The molecule is 1-(cyclohex-2-enyl)ethanol. So, the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an ethanol group (-CH2OH) attached at C1.

In that case, the structure would be:

- The ring is cyclohexene with a double bond between C2 and C3.

- C1 has a CH2OH substituent, so it's a secondary carbon.

So, the substituent is at C1, and the ring is otherwise similar to cyclohexene.

Now, the Hs:

1. CH2OH group: two Hs (equivalent).

2. C1: two Hs (since it's a CH2 group in the ring, but attached to the substituent). Wait, no. Wait, in a cyclohexane ring, each C is CH2. But when a substituent is attached, the hybridization changes. So, C1 would be connected to two ring carbons, the substituent, and another H. So, C1 would have two Hs? No, wait: in a cyclohexane ring, each C has two Hs. But when a substituent is attached, one of those Hs is replaced by the substituent. So, C1 would have one H.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about the structure again.

In cyclohexane, each carbon is CH2, so each has two Hs. When a substituent is attached, like CH2OH, the carbon (C1) would have one substituent (CH2OH) and two ring bonds, leaving one H. So, C1 has one H.

So, the Hs are:

- CH2OH: 2 Hs.

- C1: 1 H.

- C2: two Hs (double bond).

- C3: two Hs (double bond).

- C4: two Hs.

- C5: two Hs.

- C6: two Hs.

So, total Hs: 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 13? That can't be right because the molecule must have fewer Hs. I must be getting something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the substituent is at C1, making it a CH group (with one H) and the ring as cyclohexene. So, let me recount.

- CH2OH group: 2 Hs.

- C1: connected to two ring carbons and the substituent, so one H.

- C2: double bond, two Hs.

- C3: double bond, two Hs.

- C4: two Hs.

- C5: two Hs.

- C6: two Hs.

Wait, that's 2 +1 +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 = 13. That's impossible because a cyclohexene ring with substituents can't have that many Hs.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol or something else, but that doesn't fit the steps given.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me re-examine the steps again.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Assuming it's an alpha bromination, product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.

Step 2: product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH → product 2.

Heating with NaOH leads to elimination, forming 2-cyclohexenone.

Step 3: product 2 (2-cyclohexenone) + SOCl2 → product 3 (2-cyclohexenone chloride).

Step 4: product 3 + LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → product 4.

So, the reduction of 2-cyclohexenone chloride with a strong reducing agent would reduce the carbonyl to a CH2 group, giving a secondary alcohol.

So, product 4 would be 2-cyclohexanol.

Wait, wait, no. Because the starting material after step 3 is 2-cyclohexenone chloride, which is an acyl chloride. So, when reduced, the acyl chloride becomes a primary alcohol. But wait, in the ring, it would be a secondary alcohol.

Wait, no. Let me think: the structure of 2-cyclohexenone is a ring with a ketone at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3. When the ketone is converted to an acyl chloride (product 3), it's O=C-Cl. Upon reduction with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, the acyl chloride is reduced to a primary alcohol, RCH2OH. But in the ring, the position where the ketone was is now RCH2OH, making it a secondary alcohol because it's attached to two ring carbons.

So, product 4 is 1-(cyclohex-2-enyl)ethanol, which is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C2 and C3, and a CH2OH group attached to C1.

Now, the structure is correct, so let's count the distinct Hs.

The molecule is a cyclohexene ring with a CH2OH substituent at C1.

Now, let's list the H environments:

1. The two Hs on the CH2OH group are equivalent → 1 type.

2. The H on C1 (ring position) → another type.

3. The two Hs on C2 (double bond) → perhaps two types because they're on a double bond carbon, which is sp2 hybridized. Are they equivalent? Since the substituent is on C1, which is adjacent, the two Hs on C2 may not be equivalent. So, two types.

4. The two Hs on C3 (double bond) → similar to C2, perhaps two types.

5. The Hs on C4, C5, and C6: let's see.

C4 is connected to C3 (double bond) and C5.

C5 is connected to C4 and C6.

C6 is connected to C5 and C1.

The substituent is on C1, so the ring's symmetry is broken. Therefore, the Hs on C4, C5, and C6 may all be in different environments.

So, C4 has two Hs (equivalent?), C5 has two Hs (equivalent?), C6 has two Hs (equivalent?).

Wait, but due to the substituent, perhaps C6's Hs are in a different environment than C4 and C5.

So, perhaps:

- C4: two Hs (equivalent).

- C5: two Hs (equivalent).

- C6: two Hs (equivalent).

Wait, but without symmetry, perhaps they're not equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps C4 and C6 are equivalent due to the substituent's position.

Wait, the substituent is on C1, which is adjacent to C2 and C6. So, C6 is next to C1, which has the substituent. Therefore, the Hs on C6 are distinct from those on C4 and C5.

So, in this case:

- C4: two Hs (type A).

- C5: two Hs (type B).

- C6: two Hs (type C).

So, putting it all together:

1. CH2OH: 2 Hs → 1 type.

2. C1: 1 H → 1 type.

3. C2: 2 Hs → 2 types.

4. C3: 2 Hs → 2 types.

5. C4: 2 Hs → 1 type.

6. C5: 2 Hs → 1 type.

7. C6: 2 Hs → 1 type.

Wait, but that would give 1 (CH2OH) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2) + 2 (C3) + 1 (C4) + 1 (C5) + 1 (C6) = 9 types. But that can't be right because the options don't have 9.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcounting. Maybe some of these Hs are equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on C4 and C6 are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.

Wait, considering the substituent is on C1, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry that makes C4 and C6's Hs equivalent. So, C4 and C6 each have two Hs, but their Hs are equivalent.

So, that reduces the count:

- C4 and C6: 2 Hs each, but equivalent → 1 type.

- C5: two Hs, another type.

So, now the count is:

1. CH2OH: 1.

2. C1: 1.

3. C2: 2.

4. C3: 2.

5. C4 and C6: 1.

6. C5: 1.

Total: 1+1+2+2+1+1=8.

But wait, that would give 8 types, which is option B.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the Hs on C2 and C3 are each split into two types because of their positions relative to the substituent.

So, if that's the case, the total would be 8.

Looking back at the options, option B is 8.

The problem involves determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4, formed through a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1**  
   Cyclohexanone undergoes alpha-bromination, forming **2-bromocyclohexanone** (product 1). The bromine is added to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.

2. **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH → Product 2**  
   Heating with NaOH leads to elimination of HBr, forming **2-cyclohexenone** (product 2). The bromine is removed, and a double bond is formed between C2 and C3.

3. **Step 3: Product 2 (2-cyclohexenone) + SOCl₂, Pyridine → Product 3**  
   Thionyl chloride converts the ketone group into an acid chloride, forming **2-cyclohexenone chloride** (product 3).

4. **Step 4: Product 3 + LiAlH(t-Bu)₃ → Product 4**  
   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride reduces the acid chloride to a primary alcohol. The resulting product is **1-(cyclohex-2-enyl)ethanol** (product 4), where the ketone is replaced by a CH₂OH group at C1, and the double bond remains between C2 and C3.

5. **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**  
   - **CH₂OH group**: 2 equivalent hydrogens.  
   - **C1**: 1 unique hydrogen attached to the carbon bearing the CH₂OH group.  
   - **C2**: 2 unique hydrogens on the double-bonded carbon.  
   - **C3**: 2 unique hydrogens on the double-bonded carbon.  
   - **C4**: 2 equivalent hydrogens.  
   - **C5**: 2 equivalent hydrogens.  
   - **C6**: 2 equivalent hydrogens.  

   Total: **8 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms**.

Thus, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 is **8**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The problem says that cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Then product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to form product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to get product 3. Finally, product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride to form product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present on product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

First, I need to go through each step and figure out what each product is.

Starting with cyclohexanone. Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? So it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group (O=). The first reaction is treating it with bromine. Oh wait, bromine adding to a ketone... Hmm. Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you treat a ketone with bromine (Br2), what happens? Oh, wait, bromine can add to the carbonyl group. Wait, but wait, maybe it's an addition reaction. But wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh wait, wait, wait. Oh! Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone has a ketone, which is a good electrophilic site. But adding bromine to a ketone... I think I remember that ketones can undergo some kind of addition with bromine. Oh wait, no, maybe it's a bromination via an enolate? Or perhaps a different mechanism.

Wait, no. Wait. Another possibility: when a ketone is treated with bromine, it might form a dibromide through a conjugate addition. Or, wait, maybe the ketone is undergoing a bromohydrin formation? No, that's when you have something like HBr and H2O. Alternatively, perhaps it's an allylic bromination? Oh wait, wait, no—cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let's think again. Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When treated with Br2, perhaps it undergoes a bromination on the ring. Wait, but cyclohexanone is a saturated ring. Adding Br2 might not be possible for substitution. Unless it's an alpha bromination. Oh! Right, alpha bromination. So the ketone's alpha carbons are more reactive. So maybe cyclohexanone is treated with Br2 in some conditions where the alpha position undergoes bromination.

So the starting material is cyclohexanone. Its structure is a six-membered ring with one oxygen as a ketone. The alpha carbons are the two adjacent to the carbonyl. So each of those has two hydrogen atoms (since cyclohexanone is a chair conformation, but maybe the structure has two equivalent alpha positions? Wait, no. Wait, in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is in a chair conformation, but the two alpha carbons are equivalent in the chair. So when treated with Br2, it would undergo bromination on the alpha position. So product 1 would be 2-bromocyclohexanone, but wait, wait. Wait, maybe the bromine adds to the carbonyl? No, because adding Br2 to a ketone would probably give a diester or something, but maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a halogenation using another method.

Wait, perhaps the first step is an addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group. So, cyclohexanone has O=C-(CH2)5-C=O? No, wait, no. Cyclohexanone is (CH2)5-C=O. So the carbonyl is at one position. Adding Br2 to the carbonyl would lead to a diaddition, perhaps giving a vicinal dihalide. Wait, but ketones don't typically add Br2 in such a way, because that's more for alkenes. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe the first step is a ring-opening addition. But cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts bromination? But wait, cyclohexanone isn't aromatic, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the first step is the formation of an epoxide, but no, that's with peracids. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again. What are the possible reactions of cyclohexanone with bromine?

Oh, wait, maybe it's a bromination at the alpha position. So the alpha carbons (the two adjacent to the ketone) get brominated. So the product would be 2-bromocyclohexanone or 3-bromocyclohexanone? Wait, but the numbering would place the ketone at position 1, so the adjacent carbons are 2 and 6, which are equivalent in the chair conformation. So adding a bromine to either would give the same product, 2-bromocyclohexanone. So product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.

Then, product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to form product 2. So heating 2-bromocyclohexanone with NaOH. That sounds like a hydrolysis reaction. Wait, but with NaOH, maybe an elimination or substitution occurs.

Wait, 2-bromocyclohexanone has a Br on the alpha carbon. Heating with NaOH (a strong base) might lead to an elimination reaction. Wait, but where? Let's think. The ketone is at C1, Br is at C2. When you eliminate, you lose H from C1 or C3. Wait, but wait, the base would deprotonate a beta hydrogen, leading to an elimination. But in a cyclic ketone, maybe elimination occurs, forming a double bond.

Wait, so if we have 2-bromocyclohexanone and treat it with a base like NaOH, perhaps it undergoes elimination to form cyclohexenone. Specifically, the Br is on C2, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but in that case, the double bond would be between C1 and C2, but C1 is the carbonyl. So that would not be possible because the carbonyl would be at C1, and a double bond between C1 and C2 would mean the carbonyl is part of an enone, which is possible. Wait, but wait, when you eliminate from 2-bromocyclohexanone, the Br is on C2. So when the base removes a proton from C3, you form a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, but let me think about the structure.

Wait, the structure of 2-bromocyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with the ketone at C1 and Br at C2. So the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. So when the base abstracts a hydrogen, say from C3, which is adjacent to C2, elimination occurs between C2 and C3, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. So the product would be cyclohexenone, with the double bond between C2 and C3. So product 2 is 2-cyclohexenone.

Wait, but wait, when you eliminate, the double bond would form between the alpha carbon (C2) and the adjacent (beta) carbon (C3), leading to a cyclohexenone with the double bond between C2 and C3. So product 2 is 2-cyclohexenone.

Next step: product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to form product 3. Thionyl chloride is commonly used to convert carboxylic acids to acid chlorides, but in this case, product 2 is a ketone (2-cyclohexenone). Wait, wait, 2-cyclohexenone has a ketone group, so treating it with SOCl2 would convert the ketone to an acid chloride. Wait, but wait, ketones cannot form acid chlorides as easily as carboxylic acids can. Wait, no, actually, ketones can be converted to acid chlorides using SOCl2, but that's not the usual case. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, product 2 is 2-cyclohexenone, which is a cyclic ketone with a double bond. Thionyl chloride reacts with ketones to form ketone chlorides. So, 2-cyclohexenone would react with SOCl2 to form 2-cyclohexenone chloride. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is not a ketone. Wait, no, 2-cyclohexenone is a ketone. So, upon treatment with SOCl2 and pyridine, the ketone would become a chloroketone, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of an acid chloride, but since it's a ketone, maybe it's forming an acyl chloride. Wait, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is an aldehyde. Wait, no, product 2 is from the elimination of 2-bromocyclohexanone, which gives 2-cyclohexenone, which is a ketone with a double bond. So, when treated with SOCl2, perhaps the ketone is converted into a chloroalkane. Wait, but wait, another possibility: maybe the double bond is being converted into something else. Wait, another thought: maybe the ketone is converted into an acid chloride, but that's not correct because ketones can't become acid chlorides; they become chlorides. Wait, no, wait. No, ketones are R-CO-R', and treating with SOCl2 would convert the carbonyl into an acyl chloride, R-COCl. So 2-cyclohexenone would become 2-cyclohexenyl chloride, but that's an acid chloride.

Wait, but I'm not too confident about this. Alternatively, maybe the double bond is getting involved. So, 2-cyclohexenone is a cyclic ketone with a double bond between C2 and C3. When treated with SOCl2, perhaps the double bond remains, and the ketone becomes an acid chloride. So product 3 would be 2-cyclohexenone chloride, which is an acid chloride. But wait, another thought: maybe the thionyl chloride is reacting with the ketone to make an acyl chloride, which is then more reactive.

Then, product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (often called LIA or LDA, but wait, wait, no. Wait, no, LDA is Lithium diisopropylamide. LIA is something else. Wait, the reagent here is LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent. So, when an acid chloride is treated with a strong reducing agent like this, what happens?

Wait, acid chlorides (acyl chlorides) are typically reduced to alcohols using LiAlH4. The acyl chloride RCOCl would be reduced to RCH2OH. But wait, wait, what about the presence of the double bond in the ring?

Wait, so product 3 is an acid chloride with a double bond. When reduced with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong hydride donor, the carbonyl (from the acid chloride) would be reduced. So the acyl chloride (RCOCl) becomes RCH2Cl? Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

Wait, the reaction of an acid chloride with LiAlH4 would typically proceed as follows: RCOCl + LiAlH4 → RCH2LiAlCl + ...? No, wait, I think when you reduce an acyl chloride with LiAlH4, you get an alcohol. So RCOCl → RCH2OH after reduction. But in this case, the acyl chloride is part of a cyclohexenone ring. So, the ring would have the double bond and the acyl group.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. So, product 3 is 2-cyclohexenone chloride. When treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent, the acyl chloride (RCOCl) would be reduced to RCH2OH. But wait, in a cyclic system, this would form a secondary alcohol. So, the ketone is converted to an alcohol. So, product 4 would be 2-cyclohexanol. But wait, wait, the ring has a double bond. So, let me try to visualize this.

Wait, 2-cyclohexenone is a six-membered ring with a ketone at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3. When that ketone is reduced to an alcohol, you get a secondary alcohol at C1, and the double bond remains between C2 and C3. So product 4 is 2-cyclohexanol with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, that's cyclohexanol with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-cyclohexanol with a double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, but another thought: when you reduce an acid chloride (which is the product 3) with a strong hydride donor, maybe it's a two-step process. The acid chloride is first converted to an acyl lithium intermediate, but perhaps I'm mixing up reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is not an acid chloride. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the steps.

Wait, product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone. Then product 1 is treated with NaOH, which gives product 2. I initially thought it was via elimination to form a double bond, so product 2 would be 2-cyclohexenone. But perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: when 2-bromocyclohexanone is treated with NaOH, it could undergo substitution. The bromide is at C2, which is adjacent to the carbonyl. So, perhaps the NaOH would perform an SN2 substitution, replacing Br with OH. That would give 2-hydroxycyclohexanone.

Wait, but wait, in that case, the product would be 2-hydroxycyclohexanone. Then, when product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride, maybe the hydroxyl group is converted to a chloride. So product 3 would be 2-chlorocyclohexanone.

Then, when product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent, the ketone group would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So product 4 would be 2-chlorocyclohexanol.

But wait, that doesn't seem to fit because LiAlH4 typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, but if there's a leaving group like Cl, perhaps it could undergo elimination or other reactions. Alternatively, maybe the Cl is deprotonated and leaves, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I need to re-examine the steps again.

Let me go back and try each step carefully.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine. Possible reactions: alpha bromination, allylic bromination, addition to carbonyl.

Wait, wait. I think another possibility is that the carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with Br2 to form a brominated product. But in what way?

Wait, perhaps it's a diaddition to the carbonyl, forming a dibromide. So, the ketone O=C-R would add Br2 to form OBr-CBr-R. But that's probably not correct because ketones don't add Br2 like alkenes do. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution. Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the reaction is an electrophilic substitution. But cyclohexanone isn't aromatic, so that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of a bromoalkane via an elimination-addition mechanism. Oh wait, like the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, which brominates the alpha position. So in that case, product 1 would indeed be 2-bromocyclohexanone.

So, product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.

Step 2: product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with NaOH.

Heating with NaOH could lead to elimination, forming an enone. If the Br is at C2 and the ketone is at C1, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but wait, C1 is already a carbonyl. So that can't form a double bond because the carbonyl is already a double bond.

Wait, so elimination would form a double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure would look like a cyclohexene ring with a ketone at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3, making it 2-cyclohexenone.

So product 2 is 2-cyclohexenone.

Step 3: product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine to form product 3.

Thionyl chloride typically converts carboxylic acids to acid chlorides, but it can also react with ketones. So, when a ketone reacts with SOCl2, it forms an acyl chloride. So 2-cyclohexenone would become 2-cyclohexenone chloride, which would have a structure where the ketone group is replaced by Cl, like O=C-Cl.

Wait, but wait, 2-cyclohexenone has a double bond between C2 and C3, and the ketone is at C1. So, when converting the ketone to an acyl chloride, product 3 would be 2-cyclohexenone chloride, which is an acyl chloride.

Step 4: product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(t-Bu)3), which is a strong reducing agent, to form product 4.

So, the acyl chloride (product 3) is now reduced. The reduction of an acyl chloride typically produces a primary alcohol. But in this case, the acyl chloride is part of a ring, so the reduction would lead to a secondary alcohol.

Wait, no. Wait, acyl chloride RCOCl upon reduction with LiAlH4 would yield RCH2OH. So, in this case, R is the cyclohexenyl group. So the product would be cyclohexenylmethanol. Wait, but wait, the structure would be a cyclohexene ring with a CH2OH group attached at position 1, where the ketone was. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agent reduces the carbonyl group (now an acyl chloride) to a CH2 group, leading to an alcohol. So, the ketone at position 1 becomes CH2OH, and the double bond is still present between C2 and C3.

So the product 4 would be 1-(cyclohex-2-enyl)ethanol, or more accurately, cyclohexenylmethanol, where the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure would be a six-membered ring with a double bond between C2 and C3, and a CH2OH group attached to C1.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure again. The starting material is 2-cyclohexenone, which is cyclohexanone with a double bond between C2 and C3. So the ketone is at C1, and the double bond is between C2 and C3. When the ketone is converted to an acyl chloride (product 3), it's RCOCl. Then, when reduced, the ketone group (COCl) becomes CH2OH. So the product 4 is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C2 and C3, and a CH2OH group at C1.

So product 4 is 1-(cyclohex-2-enyl)ethanol, which can also be called 2-cyclohexenylmethanol.

Now, the question is: how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present on product 4.

So, we need to look at the structure of product 4 and count the distinct protons.

Let me sketch the structure mentally.

Product 4 is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C2 and C3. At position C1, there's a CH2OH group. So, the structure is:

- C1: CH2OH
- C2: double bond to C3
- C4, C5, C6: each have two CH2 groups, but wait, the ring is cyclohexene, so the structure is:

C1 is connected to C2 and C6.

C2 is connected to C1 and C3, with a double bond to C3.

C3 is connected to C2 and C4, with a double bond to C2.

C4 is connected to C3 and C5.

C5 is connected to C4 and C6.

C6 is connected to C5 and C1.

And C1 has a CH2OH group attached.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Positions:

1: CH2OH group attached to the ring.

2: double bond between 2 and 3.

So, the ring is cyclohexene with the double bond between C2 and C3, and a CH2OH group at C1.

Now, let's analyze the symmetry and the distinct hydrogens.

Each position in the ring will have a certain number of equivalent hydrogens, but because of the substituents, some might be non-equivalent.

Let me number the positions:

1: CH2OH attached. So, C1 has two CH2 groups (the CH2OH is -CH2-OH, so the C1 is CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, no, wait. The structure is a six-membered ring, so the C1 is connected to two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6). The C1 also has a CH2OH group attached. So, the structure at C1 is CH2OH attached to the ring. Wait, no: the C1 is bonded to the two adjacent carbons in the ring (C2 and C6) and has a CH2OH substituent. So, the C1 is a quaternary carbon? No, wait, no. C1 is part of the ring and has three single bonds: to C2, C6, and the CH2OH group. So, C1 is a secondary carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more accurately described as:

The ring is cyclohexene with a substituent at C1. C1 has a CH2OH group attached, so the structure is CH2OH-C1 connected to C2 and C6.

The double bond is between C2 and C3.

So, the substituents on the ring are:

- C1: CH2OH
- C2: double bond to C3

Now, let's look at each position.

C1: CH2OH group. This group has two hydrogen atoms, but they are identical because the CH2 group is attached to the ring. So, the two Hs on CH2OH are equivalent.

C2: in the double bond, so it's a vinylic carbon. It's connected to C1 and C3. The Hs on C2 (if any) would be part of the double bond. Wait, no, in a double bond between C2 and C3, each of them has two substituents. In cyclohexene, each double bond carbon is bonded to two other ring carbons and two Hs, but in this case, C2 is bonded to C1 (which has a substituent) and C3. So, the structure is more accurately a substituted cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of the molecule as follows:

The ring is cyclohexene with a substituent at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3.

So, the substituent at C1 is CH2OH, making the structure something like:

CH2OH-C1-C2=C3-C4-C5-C6.

Wait, so the ring is:

C1 is connected to C2 (double bond) and C6.

Wait, no. Another way: the ring has six carbons, with a double bond between C2 and C3. So, the ring is: C1 is connected to C2 and C6. C2 is connected to C1, C3, and has a double bond to C3. C3 is connected to C2 (double bond), C4, and C4. C4 is connected to C3 and C5. C5 connected to C4 and C6. C6 connected to C5 and C1.

Now, the substituent is at C1: CH2OH.

So, the structure of product 4 is a cyclohexene ring with a CH2OH group at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3.

Now, to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

Let's list all possible Hs and determine their equivalence.

1. The CH2OH group: the two Hs on the CH2 are equivalent because they're attached to the same carbon and in a symmetric environment.

2. C1: It's attached to the CH2OH group and the two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6). The Hs on C1 would be looking at different substituents, so they are distinct from each other. Wait, but C1 is a carbon in the ring, and its Hs are attached to a substituted carbon. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in cyclohexane, each CH2 has two Hs. But in this case, C1 is attached to CH2OH and two ring carbons. So, the structure at C1 is CH(CH2OH)(C2)(C6). Wait, no, C1 is a carbon in the ring, so it must have four bonds. So, C1 is connected to two ring carbons (C2 and C6), the CH2OH group, and another H? Wait, no, that's possible. Wait, wait, no: in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is CH2. But when a substituent is attached, like CH2OH, the carbon (C1) would have three bonds: two to adjacent ring carbons and one to the substituent, leaving one H. So, C1 would have CH(CH2OH)(C2)(C6) and one H. Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like this: The ring is cyclohexene with a substituent at C1. So, C1 has a CH2OH group attached to it, and the ring is otherwise similar to cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the molecule as a cyclohexene ring with the substituent at C1, and the double bond between C2 and C3.

So, the substituent at C1 is a CH2OH group, so the structure at C1 is:

C1 is connected to:

- C2 (ring)
- C6 (ring)
- CH2OH (substituent)

Wait, but that would only account for three bonds. So, perhaps C1 has a fourth bond, which is a hydrogen. So, it's CH(CH2OH)(C2)(C6)H. Hmm, but that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a substituent at C1 as CH2OH, making the structure at C1 a CH2 group attached to the ring and the OH group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of the molecule as a cyclohexene ring with a CH2OH group attached at C1. So, the ring has a substituent at C1, which is a CH2OH group, and a double bond between C2 and C3.

Now, the question is about the distinct H atoms on the product 4 molecule.

Let me list all the possible H environments.

1. The CH2OH group: the two Hs on CH2 are equivalent because they're on the same carbon and in a symmetric environment. So, that's one type of H.

2. The H on C1: Since C1 is attached to the CH2OH group and two other ring carbons, the H on C1 is unique. So, that's another type.

3. The Hs adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, C2 and C3 are each sp2 hybridized. Each of them has two substituents (from the ring) and two Hs. But wait, in a cyclohexene ring, each double bond carbon is connected to two Hs.

Wait, no. In a typical cyclohexene, each double bond carbon has two substituents (the adjacent ring carbons) and two Hs. So, when there's a substituent attached to C1, how does that affect the substituents on C2 and C3?

Wait, perhaps in this case, C2 and C3 have substituents due to the ring structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on C2 and C3 are:

- C2 is connected to C1 (which has CH2OH), C3, and two Hs.

- C3 is connected to C2 (double bond), C4, and two Hs.

Wait, no, that can't be right because, with the substituent on C1, the substituents on C2 and C3 would vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C2 and C3 are such that each has two Hs, but they are in different environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on C2 and C3 are equivalent due to symmetry.

Wait, but given the substituent on C1, the molecule might not be symmetrical across the C2-C3 double bond.

So, to analyze the Hs:

1. The CH2OH group has two Hs (equivalent).

2. The C1 has one H (distinct from all others).

3. The C2 has two Hs, which may be equivalent or not.

4. The C3 has two Hs, which may be equivalent or not.

5. The C4, C5, and C6 have Hs that may be equivalent or not.

Wait, but let me think in terms of symmetry. The molecule is 1-(cyclohex-2-enyl)ethanol. The substituent is at C1, and the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, the molecule is not symmetrical across the double bond because of the substituent at C1.

So, the Hs on C2 and C3 may not be equivalent. Let's consider each:

- C2: attached to C1 (which has CH2OH) and C3. So, the two Hs on C2 are in an environment influenced by the substituent on C1. Are they equivalent? Probably not, because the substituent breaks the symmetry. So, the two Hs on C2 would be distinct. Wait, but wait, in a double bond, each C is sp2 hybridized, and each has two Hs. But in this case, one H is on the same side as the substituent, and the other is on the opposite side. Are they in the same environment? Probably not, so each H on C2 would be distinct.

Wait, but wait, if the substituent is on C1, then the Hs on C2 would not be equivalent because of the different substituents around them.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on C2 and C3 are in different environments, making each of their Hs unique.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the molecule's symmetry. The molecule's plane of symmetry would be through the C1 and the center of the double bond, but with the substituent at C1, that symmetry may be broken.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes some Hs equivalent.

But perhaps the easiest way is to count all possible distinct Hs, considering their environments.

Let me proceed step by step.

1. The CH2OH group: 2 Hs (equivalent).

2. C1: 1 H (unique).

3. C2: two Hs. Are they equivalent? Since C2 is attached to C1 (which has CH2OH) and C3, which is part of the double bond, the two Hs on C2 are in different environments. So, each H on C2 is unique.

Wait, but in reality, in a double bond, the substituents on each carbon can lead to axial and equatorial positions, but in this case, perhaps the substituent on C1 would cause the Hs on C2 to be non-equivalent.

So, C2 would have two distinct Hs.

4. C3: two Hs. Similarly, the substituent on C1 affects the environment of C3's Hs. Are they equivalent? Probably not, so two distinct Hs.

5. C4: this carbon is in the ring, connected to C3 and C5. It's a CH2 group, but in a ring, the substituents around it may affect the environment.

Wait, but in the cyclohexene ring, C4 is adjacent to the double bond. So, C4 has two Hs. Are they equivalent? Because the ring is not symmetrical anymore due to the substituent at C1, the Hs on C4 may be distinct from those on C5 and C6.

Wait, let's think about the structure.

C4 is connected to C3 and C5. The ring is cyclohexene, so the positions are:

C1: CH2OH

C2: double bond to C3.

C4: connected to C3 (double bond) and C5.

C5: connected to C4 and C6.

C6: connected to C5 and C1.

So, the ring is a six-membered ring with a substituent at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3.

The substituent at C1 breaks the symmetry, so the Hs on C4 may be different from those on C5 and C6.

Let me consider each:

- C4: two Hs. Are they equivalent? Since it's in a ring with a substituent, perhaps they are not equivalent. But maybe in this structure, the ring is symmetric in some way.

Wait, perhaps the substituent at C1 creates a plane of symmetry that makes some Hs equivalent. Let me think: If C1 has the substituent, and the double bond is between C2 and C3, the molecule's symmetry would be along an axis that goes through C1 and the midpoint between C4 and C6.

Wait, perhaps not. It's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to count all possible distinct Hs without assuming symmetry.

So, let's proceed:

- CH2OH group: 2 Hs (type A).

- C1: 1 H (type B).

- C2: 2 Hs (types C and D).

- C3: 2 Hs (types E and F).

- C4: 2 Hs (types G and H).

- C5: 2 Hs (types I and J).

- C6: 2 Hs (types K and L).

Wait, but that would give 12 Hs, which seems way too high. Wait, no, no. Wait, the molecule is cyclohexene with a substituent. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the molecule has a six-membered ring, so each carbon in the ring is connected to two other ring carbons and may have a substituent or H.

But perhaps it's better to count the number of distinct environments.

Let me try a different approach.

The substituent is on C1 (CH2OH), and the double bond is between C2 and C3.

So, the substituent affects the symmetry of the molecule, making certain Hs unique.

Let's consider each carbon's Hs:

1. C1: CH2OH group attached. So, C1's substituent is -CH2OH. Therefore, C1 has two Hs on its CH2 group, which are equivalent. So, type A: 2 H.

2. C2: Double bond to C3. So, C2 has two Hs. Are they equivalent? In a trans or cis arrangement? But without knowing the configuration, perhaps it's best to assume they are non-equivalent. So, two Hs (type B and C).

3. C3: Double bond to C2. Two Hs, possibly non-equivalent (type D and E).

4. C4: connected to C3 and C5. Two Hs. Are they equivalent? If the ring is not symmetric, perhaps not. So, two Hs (types F and G).

5. C5: connected to C4 and C6. Two Hs (types H and I).

6. C6: connected to C5 and C1. Two Hs. Are they equivalent? Since C1 has a substituent, perhaps the Hs on C6 are in different environments. So, two Hs (types J and K).

Wait, but this approach is leading to too many types.

Alternatively, perhaps some of these Hs are equivalent.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes some Hs equivalent.

The substituent is at C1, and the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry that cuts through C1 and the midpoint between C4 and C6.

If that's the case, then some Hs would be mirror images of each other and thus equivalent.

So, let's see:

- The two Hs on C2: perhaps they are on opposite sides of the double bond, but due to the substituent, they might be non-equivalent.

- The two Hs on C3: similarly, perhaps non-equivalent.

- The Hs on C4 and C6: maybe they are equivalent because of the symmetry plane.

Wait, perhaps the ring has a plane that makes C4 and C6 symmetrical. So, the Hs on C4 and C6 would be equivalent.

Similarly, perhaps the Hs on C5 are equivalent.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of numbering the atoms and considering their environments.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the distinct Hs based on their positions.

Let me try to list each position's Hs and determine if they're equivalent.

1. CH2OH group: 2 Hs (A).

2. C1: 1 H (B).

3. C2: two Hs (C and D).

4. C3: two Hs (E and F).

5. C4: two Hs (G and H).

6. C5: two Hs (I and J).

7. C6: two Hs (K and L).

Wait, but that's 12 Hs in total, which can't be right because a cyclohexene ring has 10 Hs (each CH2 has two Hs), but with substituents, perhaps it's different.

Wait, no. Wait, the molecule is 1-(cyclohex-2-enyl)ethanol. So the structure is:

- A cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C2 and C3.

- A CH2OH group attached to C1.

Each CH2 in the ring contributes two Hs, except for the substituted C1, which has a CH2OH group. So, the ring would have:

- C1: CH2OH (so CH2 group: two Hs).

Wait, but wait, no. C1 is part of the ring. So, each ring carbon has two Hs, but if a substituent is attached, like CH2OH, then C1 would have only one H (since it's connected to the ring and the substituent). So, C1: 1 H (attached to the ring) and the CH2OH group has two Hs.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to count all Hs again.

The molecule has:

- CH2OH group: 2 Hs.

- C1: 1 H (since it's connected to two ring carbons and the substituent).

- C2: two Hs (sp2 hybridized).

- C3: two Hs (sp2 hybridized).

- C4: two Hs (sp3 hybridized).

- C5: two Hs (sp3 hybridized).

- C6: two Hs (sp3 hybridized).

Wait, but that would make a total of 2 (CH2OH) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2) + 2 (C3) + 2 (C4) + 2 (C5) + 2 (C6) = 13 Hs. But that can't be right because the molecule should have fewer.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure. Let me think again.

The product is formed by reducing the acyl chloride (from 2-cyclohexenone) to an alcohol. So, the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a CH2OH group at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3.

So, each carbon in the ring:

- C1: CH2OH (so, two Hs on CH2, and another H attached to the ring? No, because it's part of the ring. Wait, perhaps the ring structure is such that C1 is connected to two ring carbons and the CH2OH group, which would leave it with one H. So, C1 has one H.

- C2: double bond to C3, so two Hs.

- C3: double bond to C2, so two Hs.

- C4: connected to C3 and C5, so two Hs.

- C5: connected to C4 and C6, so two Hs.

- C6: connected to C5 and C1, so two Hs.

Then, the CH2OH group has two Hs.

So, total Hs: 1 (C1) + 2 (C2) + 2 (C3) + 2 (C4) + 2 (C5) + 2 (C6) + 2 (CH2OH) = 13 Hs. But that's not possible because a cyclohexene ring typically has 10 Hs (each CH2 has two Hs, but with substituents, some may have one H). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that C1 has a CH2OH group, making it a CH2 group. So, C1 is part of the ring and has two Hs.

Wait, no. Maybe I should think in terms of the actual structure. The molecule is 1-(cyclohex-2-enyl)ethanol. So, the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an ethanol group (-CH2OH) attached at C1.

In that case, the structure would be:

- The ring is cyclohexene with a double bond between C2 and C3.

- C1 has a CH2OH substituent, so it's a secondary carbon.

So, the substituent is at C1, and the ring is otherwise similar to cyclohexene.

Now, the Hs:

1. CH2OH group: two Hs (equivalent).

2. C1: two Hs (since it's a CH2 group in the ring, but attached to the substituent). Wait, no. Wait, in a cyclohexane ring, each C is CH2. But when a substituent is attached, the hybridization changes. So, C1 would be connected to two ring carbons, the substituent, and another H. So, C1 would have two Hs? No, wait: in a cyclohexane ring, each C has two Hs. But when a substituent is attached, one of those Hs is replaced by the substituent. So, C1 would have one H.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about the structure again.

In cyclohexane, each carbon is CH2, so each has two Hs. When a substituent is attached, like CH2OH, the carbon (C1) would have one substituent (CH2OH) and two ring bonds, leaving one H. So, C1 has one H.

So, the Hs are:

- CH2OH: 2 Hs.

- C1: 1 H.

- C2: two Hs (double bond).

- C3: two Hs (double bond).

- C4: two Hs.

- C5: two Hs.

- C6: two Hs.

So, total Hs: 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 13? That can't be right because the molecule must have fewer Hs. I must be getting something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the substituent is at C1, making it a CH group (with one H) and the ring as cyclohexene. So, let me recount.

- CH2OH group: 2 Hs.

- C1: connected to two ring carbons and the substituent, so one H.

- C2: double bond, two Hs.

- C3: double bond, two Hs.

- C4: two Hs.

- C5: two Hs.

- C6: two Hs.

Wait, that's 2 +1 +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 = 13. That's impossible because a cyclohexene ring with substituents can't have that many Hs.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol or something else, but that doesn't fit the steps given.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me re-examine the steps again.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Assuming it's an alpha bromination, product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.

Step 2: product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH → product 2.

Heating with NaOH leads to elimination, forming 2-cyclohexenone.

Step 3: product 2 (2-cyclohexenone) + SOCl2 → product 3 (2-cyclohexenone chloride).

Step 4: product 3 + LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → product 4.

So, the reduction of 2-cyclohexenone chloride with a strong reducing agent would reduce the carbonyl to a CH2 group, giving a secondary alcohol.

So, product 4 would be 2-cyclohexanol.

Wait, wait, no. Because the starting material after step 3 is 2-cyclohexenone chloride, which is an acyl chloride. So, when reduced, the acyl chloride becomes a primary alcohol. But wait, in the ring, it would be a secondary alcohol.

Wait, no. Let me think: the structure of 2-cyclohexenone is a ring with a ketone at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3. When the ketone is converted to an acyl chloride (product 3), it's O=C-Cl. Upon reduction with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, the acyl chloride is reduced to a primary alcohol, RCH2OH. But in the ring, the position where the ketone was is now RCH2OH, making it a secondary alcohol because it's attached to two ring carbons.

So, product 4 is 1-(cyclohex-2-enyl)ethanol, which is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C2 and C3, and a CH2OH group attached to C1.

Now, the structure is correct, so let's count the distinct Hs.

The molecule is a cyclohexene ring with a CH2OH substituent at C1.

Now, let's list the H environments:

1. The two Hs on the CH2OH group are equivalent → 1 type.

2. The H on C1 (ring position) → another type.

3. The two Hs on C2 (double bond) → perhaps two types because they're on a double bond carbon, which is sp2 hybridized. Are they equivalent? Since the substituent is on C1, which is adjacent, the two Hs on C2 may not be equivalent. So, two types.

4. The two Hs on C3 (double bond) → similar to C2, perhaps two types.

5. The Hs on C4, C5, and C6: let's see.

C4 is connected to C3 (double bond) and C5.

C5 is connected to C4 and C6.

C6 is connected to C5 and C1.

The substituent is on C1, so the ring's symmetry is broken. Therefore, the Hs on C4, C5, and C6 may all be in different environments.

So, C4 has two Hs (equivalent?), C5 has two Hs (equivalent?), C6 has two Hs (equivalent?).

Wait, but due to the substituent, perhaps C6's Hs are in a different environment than C4 and C5.

So, perhaps:

- C4: two Hs (equivalent).

- C5: two Hs (equivalent).

- C6: two Hs (equivalent).

Wait, but without symmetry, perhaps they're not equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps C4 and C6 are equivalent due to the substituent's position.

Wait, the substituent is on C1, which is adjacent to C2 and C6. So, C6 is next to C1, which has the substituent. Therefore, the Hs on C6 are distinct from those on C4 and C5.

So, in this case:

- C4: two Hs (type A).

- C5: two Hs (type B).

- C6: two Hs (type C).

So, putting it all together:

1. CH2OH: 2 Hs → 1 type.

2. C1: 1 H → 1 type.

3. C2: 2 Hs → 2 types.

4. C3: 2 Hs → 2 types.

5. C4: 2 Hs → 1 type.

6. C5: 2 Hs → 1 type.

7. C6: 2 Hs → 1 type.

Wait, but that would give 1 (CH2OH) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2) + 2 (C3) + 1 (C4) + 1 (C5) + 1 (C6) = 9 types. But that can't be right because the options don't have 9.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcounting. Maybe some of these Hs are equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on C4 and C6 are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.

Wait, considering the substituent is on C1, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry that makes C4 and C6's Hs equivalent. So, C4 and C6 each have two Hs, but their Hs are equivalent.

So, that reduces the count:

- C4 and C6: 2 Hs each, but equivalent → 1 type.

- C5: two Hs, another type.

So, now the count is:

1. CH2OH: 1.

2. C1: 1.

3. C2: 2.

4. C3: 2.

5. C4 and C6: 1.

6. C5: 1.

Total: 1+1+2+2+1+1=8.

But wait, that would give 8 types, which is option B.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the Hs on C2 and C3 are each split into two types because of their positions relative to the substituent.

So, if that's the case, the total would be 8.

Looking back at the options, option B is 8.


The problem involves determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4, formed through a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1**  
   Cyclohexanone undergoes alpha-bromination, forming **2-bromocyclohexanone** (product 1). The bromine is added to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.

2. **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH → Product 2**  
   Heating with NaOH leads to elimination of HBr, forming **2-cyclohexenone** (product 2). The bromine is removed, and a double bond is formed between C2 and C3.

3. **Step 3: Product 2 (2-cyclohexenone) + SOCl₂, Pyridine → Product 3**  
   Thionyl chloride converts the ketone group into an acid chloride, forming **2-cyclohexenone chloride** (product 3).

4. **Step 4: Product 3 + LiAlH(t-Bu)₃ → Product 4**  
   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride reduces the acid chloride to a primary alcohol. The resulting product is **1-(cyclohex-2-enyl)ethanol** (product 4), where the ketone is replaced by a CH₂OH group at C1, and the double bond remains between C2 and C3.

5. **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**  
   - **CH₂OH group**: 2 equivalent hydrogens.  
   - **C1**: 1 unique hydrogen attached to the carbon bearing the CH₂OH group.  
   - **C2**: 2 unique hydrogens on the double-bonded carbon.  
   - **C3**: 2 unique hydrogens on the double-bonded carbon.  
   - **C4**: 2 equivalent hydrogens.  
   - **C5**: 2 equivalent hydrogens.  
   - **C6**: 2 equivalent hydrogens.  

   Total: **8 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms**.

Thus, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 is **8**.

**Answer: B**
