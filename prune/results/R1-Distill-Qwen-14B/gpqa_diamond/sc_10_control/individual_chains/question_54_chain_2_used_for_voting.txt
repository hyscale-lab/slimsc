Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. The question is about ring-closing metathesis, which I remember is a reaction where a metal catalyst facilitates the redistribution of alkene fragments. The goal is to figure out which starting material would give the desired cyclohexene product when this metathesis occurs.

The product in question is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, cyclohexene has a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are at positions 3,4 (which are methyl groups) and position 5 (isopropyl). The double bond is at position 1, so between carbons 1 and 2.

Now, ring-closing metathesis typically involves two alkenes (double bonds) in a diene. The catalyst (like Grubbs) would break and reform the double bonds, connecting the ends to form a ring. So the starting material must be an octadiene (since cyclohexene is six-membered, the starting chain would need to be longer, probably eight carbons, but I'm not sure yet).

Wait, let me think. The product is a six-membered ring. So the chain before metathesis should have two double bonds in positions that, when the ends are joined, form the ring. The number of carbons in the starting material should be such that when the rings form, the substituents end up in the right places.

Let me consider the structure of the product again. The substituents are at 3,4 (dimethyl) and 5 (isopropyl). So the ring has six carbons arranged in a circle. The starting material is probably an octadiene, which upon metathesis would lose two carbons as the ring forms. Wait, no, perhaps the starting material is longer. Let me think in terms of the metathesis mechanism.

In ring-closing metathesis, two alkenes are present in the starting molecule. The catalyst will break each double bond and then reconnect them in a way that forms a ring. So the number of carbons in the product ring would be determined by the distance between the two double bonds in the starting material.

For example, if the starting material has double bonds at positions 1 and 7 of an octadiene, the ring would form when the ends are connected. Let me count. So, suppose we have a molecule like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, that's not right. Maybe the starting material has two double bonds, and upon metathesis, they form a ring.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to imagine the product as a cyclohexene. So the cyclohexene has six carbons, and the substituents are in specific positions. The starting material must be a diene where, after metathesis, the substituents end up correctly.

Another approach: The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me draw that. Carbon 1 has a double bond to carbon 2. Then, the substituents: carbon 3 has a methyl, carbon 4 has a methyl, and carbon 5 has an isopropyl group.

Now, the starting material before metathesis would have two double bonds. Let's say the starting molecule is an octadiene. The positions of the double bonds will determine where the ring closure happens.

In ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes are on either end of a chain. The catalyst will break each double bond and rearrange them to form a ring. The key is to determine the correct positions of the double bonds in the starting material so that when they undergo metathesis, the substituents end up at the correct positions.

Let me consider the structure of each option.

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the molecule is eight carbons long. Double bonds at positions 1 and 7. That would mean between C1-C2 and C7-C8. Wait, but octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at 1 and 7, but wait, octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8. But wait, octa is eight carbons. So, positions 1 and 7 are the first and seventh carbons. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because between 1 and 7 in an eight-carbon chain, the positions are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So the double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8. Hmm, but that's at the ends. When metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break both and reconnect, perhaps forming a ring. Let me imagine the chain:

The chain would have substituents at C3 and C4 (methyl groups) and C5 (isopropyl). So positions 3 and 4 are methyl, position 5 is isopropyl. Let me imagine the structure:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, wait. No, because it's octa-1,7-diene, so the double bonds are at the ends. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, wait, octa-1,7-diene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, wait, wait, no. An octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at positions 1 and 7, but that would require 1-2 and 7-8 double bonds. But with 8 carbons, positions 7-8 would be the last two. So the molecule would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, wait, that can't be right because octa-1,7-diene would imply 8 carbons with double bonds at 1 and 7, but that would require 8 carbons, so positions 1-2 and 7-8. But that's impossible because that would need 9 carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. No, wait, octa-1,7-diene would have 8 carbons, with double bonds between 1-2 and 7-8. But wait, that would require that the chain is long enough. Let me count: 1,2; then 3,4; 5,6; 7,8. So the double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 7-8. So the molecule would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, but that's only eight carbons. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. But wait, that ends at 8. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. But that's only 8 carbons, so the double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8. But that would mean the end is double-bonded, which would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, that would require 8 carbons, but the double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8 would only be possible if there are 8 carbons, but that would require 7,8 to have a double bond, which is the 8th carbon being a CH2, but that's not possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider the product: it's a cyclohexene. The substituents are at positions 3,4 (dimethyl) and 5 (isopropyl). So in the ring, the substituents are in specific positions relative to each other.

In ring-closing metathesis, the starting material will have substituents that will end up in those positions once the ring is formed. So the substituents in the starting material must be positioned such that when the ring forms, their positions in the ring match the product.

Let me think about the positions in the starting material. Suppose the starting material is a diene, say, with substituents at positions that are a certain distance apart. The ring will form when the two double bonds undergo metathesis, so the substituents on each double bond will end up adjacent in the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has substituents that, when the ring forms, they end up in the correct positions. For example, if the starting material is an octene with substituents in certain positions, upon metathesis, they'll form the cyclohexene.

Another approach: ring-closing metathesis generally forms rings by connecting two ends of a chain. So, the product is a ring, and the starting material is a diene in a chain. The substituents in the starting material must be positioned such that when the ring forms, they are at the correct positions.

Let me try to model the starting material. The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So the ring has six carbons, with substituents at 3,4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). The double bond is between 1 and 2.

The starting material would have two alkenes, and the substituents would be in positions that, when the ring forms, they are in their correct positions.

Let me think about the structure of the starting material. Suppose the starting material is an octadiene. Let's imagine the structure before metathesis. Let's say the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, but that's 10 carbons, which can't be right. Wait, no, octa is 8 carbons. So the correct structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, that's nine carbons again. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should count the carbons. The product is cyclohexene, which is six-membered. The starting material must be a diene longer than six carbons, so perhaps eight carbons (octadiene). So the starting material has eight carbons and two double bonds.

Let me imagine that the starting material is an octadiene where the two double bonds are at positions that, upon ring closure, form the cyclohexene ring with substituents in the correct positions.

When two double bonds undergo metathesis, the catalyst breaks each double bond and swaps the ends. So, for example, if I have a chain with double bonds at positions i and j, the metathesis would connect the ends to form a ring.

Let me take option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me get the structure right. Octa-2,6-diene has double bonds between 2-3 and 6-7. So, positions 2-3 and 6-7. So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2.

Wait, but with substituents at 3,4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl) in the product. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should better draw this out mentally. Let's consider the starting material as an octadiene with substituents at certain positions.

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So, structure:

Carbons 1 to 8.

Double bonds between 2-3 and 6-7.

At carbon 3: methyl.

Carbon 4: methyl.

Carbon 5: isopropyl.

So, the structure would be:

1: CH2-

2: CH-

Double bond 2-3: so CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2?

Wait, maybe:

Position 1: CH3-CH2-

Position 2: CH2=CH-

Wait, no, perhaps better to write the structure as:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, but that's nine carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, let me think about the positions. The starting material is an octadiene, so eight carbons. The substituents are at positions 3,4,5 in the chain.

When the metathesis occurs, the double bonds (at 2 and 6) will be broken, and the ends will connect. So, after metathesis, the substituents at positions 3 and 4 would end up adjacent in the ring, and the substituent at 5 would be in position 5 of the ring.

Wait, perhaps the positions in the starting material are such that when the ring forms, the substituents are at the correct positions.

Let me think of the starting material as:

R1-CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2-R2.

Wait, no, the starting material doesn't have R1 and R2. It's a diene with substituents at specific positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an eight-carbon chain with substituents and double bonds at 2 and 6. Let me imagine the chain as:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, that's nine carbons. So I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about how the ring forms.

In ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes (double bonds) in the starting material will rearrange. The catalyst takes the two alkenes and swaps their ends, forming a new ring. So, the number of carbons in the ring is the number of carbons between the two double bonds plus one.

Wait, for example, if the starting material has double bonds at 1 and 4 in a five-carbon chain, that would form a three-membered ring because 4-1=3, but I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps the key is to figure out how many carbons are between the two double bonds in the starting material. The product is a six-membered ring, so the starting material must have a chain where the two double bonds are four carbons apart. Because, when the metathesis happens, the ring would consist of the six carbons: from one end to the other, including the two former ends.

Wait, let me think of it another way. If the starting material is an octadiene, and the two double bonds are at positions 1 and 5, then the number of carbons between them is 3 (positions 2,3,4). So when the ring forms, the ring would have 5 carbons? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the number of carbons in the ring would be the number of carbons between the two double bonds plus two (the two ends). So, if the starting material has double bonds at positions 1 and 5 in an octadiene, that's 5-1=4 carbons in between. So the ring would have 4+2=6 carbons. That makes sense because the product is cyclohexene.

So, the starting material must have two double bonds separated by four carbons. So, the positions of the double bonds would be such that the number of carbons between them is four.

Wait, so if the starting material is octadiene with double bonds at positions 1 and 5, then the number of carbons between them is 5-1-1 =3? Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Wait, the starting material is an octadiene, which has eight carbons. Let's imagine the two double bonds are at positions 1 and 5.

So, structure: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, but that would be an 8-carbon chain with double bonds at 1-2 and 5-6. Wait, no, that would be the case if the double bonds are at positions 1 and 5.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think that the starting material is an octadiene with double bonds located such that when the ring closes, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Going back to the product, the substituents are at 3,4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So, in the starting material, these substituents would be positioned on the chain such that when the ring forms, they're correctly placed.

So, perhaps in the starting material, the substituents are located in positions that, when the ring forms, they become the 3,4,5 positions.

Let me try to model this.

Suppose the starting material is an octadiene with substituents at positions 3,4,5.

The double bonds are at positions 1 and 6. Because when the ring forms, the substituents from positions 3 and 4 would be in the ring as positions 3 and 4, and substituent at 5 would be in position 5.

Wait, that might make sense.

So, starting material would have double bonds at 1 and 6. Let's see:

Positions:

1: CH2=CH-

...
5: CH(CH2CH3)
6: CH2=CH-

But wait, the starting material would be 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Wait, then the substituents are at 3,4,5. So when the ring forms, the substituents would end up in positions 3,4,5 of the ring.

But let's see what each option offers.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, no, octa-1,6-diene has double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7. So the chain is 8 carbons, double bonds between 1-2 and 6-7.

So substituents are at 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH(CH3)), and 5 (CH(CH2CH3)).

So the structure would be:

1: CH2=CH-

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH3)

4: CH(CH3)

5: CH(CH2CH3)

6: CH2-

7: CH2=CH-

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me write it correctly:

The starting material is octa-1,6-diene, so positions 1-2 and 6-7 have double bonds.

So:

Carbons 1-8:

1: CH2=CH-

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH3)

4: CH(CH3)

5: CH(CH2CH3)

6: CH2-

7: CH2=CH-

Wait, but that's only eight carbons. So positions 1-2 are double bond, and 6-7 are double bond.

So the structure would look like:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, that's nine carbons again. Hmm, perhaps I need to recount.

Wait, octa means eight carbons. So positions 1 to 8.

So, positions 1-2 double bond: CH2=CH-.

Position 3: CH2.

Position 4: CH(CH3).

Position 5: CH(CH3).

Position 6: CH(CH2CH3).

Position 7: CH2.

Position 8: CH2=CH?

Wait, that can't be. Because octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

1: CH2=CH-

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH3)

4: CH(CH3)

5: CH(CH2CH3)

6: CH2-

7: CH2=CH-

But that would require 7 carbons, not 8. Hmm, I'm getting stuck on this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B or C.

Let me think again about the product.

The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.

The substituents are at 3,4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl), and the double bond is at 1.

So, when the ring forms, the substituents must be positioned accordingly.

In the starting material, the substituents must be arranged such that when the ring forms, they end up at positions 3,4,5.

So, the starting material must have substituents at positions 3,4,5, and the double bonds at positions that when the ring forms, the substituents are correctly positioned.

If the starting material has double bonds at positions 2 and 6, then the number of carbons between them is 3 (positions 3,4,5). So, when the ring forms, the substituents at 3,4,5 would be in the ring at positions 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, no, octa-2,6-diene would have double bonds at positions 2-3 and 6-7.

So substituents at 3,4,5:

3: CH(CH3)

4: CH(CH3)

5: CH(CH2CH3)

So when the ring forms, the substituents are at 3,4,5, which correspond to the product.

Wait, but the ring would be formed by connecting the two double bonds. So, the metathesis would swap the ends.

So, for octa-2,6-diene, the structure would be:

1: CH2-

2: CH2-

3: CH2=CH-

Wait, no. Let me think of the starting material as:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, but that's nine carbons. I think I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct starting material is option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

In this case, the double bonds are at 2 and 6. So, when the catalyst breaks the double bonds, it would connect the ends to form a ring. The substituents at 3,4,5 would end up in the ring at positions 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me try to count the positions in the product.

In the product, the six-membered ring has substituents at 3,4,5. So, in the starting material, substituents at 3,4,5 would be connected in such a way that they end up in these positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's substituents are positioned such that when the ring forms, the positions are correct.

Let me think about the positions in the starting material.

If the starting material has double bonds at 2 and 6, then the chain is:

positions 1-2 (double bond), 3-4, 5-6 (double bond), and 7-8.

Wait, but that's octa-2,6-diene. So, the substituents are at 3,4,5.

When the ring forms, the number of carbons between the two double bonds is four (from 2 to 6), so the ring would have six carbons, which matches the product.

So, in the starting material, substituents at 3,4,5 would, upon ring formation, end up at positions 3,4,5 of the ring.

Thus, option B is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene. So the substituents are at 3,4,5, which would translate to the correct positions in the product.

Alternatively, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of the product's structure.

The product has substituents at 3,4 (methyl) and 5 (isopropyl). So, when the ring is formed, the substituents in the starting material must be positioned such that during the ring closure, they end up at the correct positions.

In the starting material, if the substituents are at 3,4,5, then after the ring forms, they would be at 3,4,5 in the ring.

So the starting material must have substituents at 3,4,5, and double bonds at 2 and 6.

Which option matches that?

Looking at the options:

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So, substituents at 3,4 (methyl) and 5 (isopropyl), with double bonds at 2 and 6.

So when the metathesis occurs, the ring forms, and the substituents are correctly positioned.

Therefore, the correct starting material is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the structure of the product and the requirements of the reaction. Ring-closing metathesis involves a metal catalyst that breaks and reforms double bonds to form a ring. The starting material must be a diene with two double bonds positioned such that, upon metathesis, the substituents end up in the correct positions in the product.

The product, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, is a six-membered ring with a double bond at position 1, a methyl group at position 3, another methyl group at position 4, and an isopropyl group at position 5. The starting material must therefore be an octadiene with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5, and double bonds positioned such that the ring forms correctly.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 7, with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. However, the double bonds at positions 1 and 7 are too far apart to form a six-membered ring. This option does not satisfy the requirements for ring-closing metathesis.

2. **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 2 and 6, with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. The distance between the double bonds (positions 2 and 6) is ideal for forming a six-membered ring. Upon metathesis, the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 will end up in the correct positions in the product. This option is consistent with the requirements.

3. **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 6, with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. However, the double bonds at positions 1 and 6 are positioned such that the ring formed would not have the correct substituent arrangement. This option does not satisfy the requirements.

4. **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 7, with substituents at positions 4, 5, and 6. The substituents are not positioned correctly to match the product, and the double bonds are too far apart to form a six-membered ring. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene** (Option B), as it has the appropriate substituents and double bond positions to form the desired product via ring-closing metathesis.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. The question is about ring-closing metathesis, which I remember is a reaction where a metal catalyst facilitates the redistribution of alkene fragments. The goal is to figure out which starting material would give the desired cyclohexene product when this metathesis occurs.

The product in question is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, cyclohexene has a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are at positions 3,4 (which are methyl groups) and position 5 (isopropyl). The double bond is at position 1, so between carbons 1 and 2.

Now, ring-closing metathesis typically involves two alkenes (double bonds) in a diene. The catalyst (like Grubbs) would break and reform the double bonds, connecting the ends to form a ring. So the starting material must be an octadiene (since cyclohexene is six-membered, the starting chain would need to be longer, probably eight carbons, but I'm not sure yet).

Wait, let me think. The product is a six-membered ring. So the chain before metathesis should have two double bonds in positions that, when the ends are joined, form the ring. The number of carbons in the starting material should be such that when the rings form, the substituents end up in the right places.

Let me consider the structure of the product again. The substituents are at 3,4 (dimethyl) and 5 (isopropyl). So the ring has six carbons arranged in a circle. The starting material is probably an octadiene, which upon metathesis would lose two carbons as the ring forms. Wait, no, perhaps the starting material is longer. Let me think in terms of the metathesis mechanism.

In ring-closing metathesis, two alkenes are present in the starting molecule. The catalyst will break each double bond and then reconnect them in a way that forms a ring. So the number of carbons in the product ring would be determined by the distance between the two double bonds in the starting material.

For example, if the starting material has double bonds at positions 1 and 7 of an octadiene, the ring would form when the ends are connected. Let me count. So, suppose we have a molecule like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, that's not right. Maybe the starting material has two double bonds, and upon metathesis, they form a ring.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to imagine the product as a cyclohexene. So the cyclohexene has six carbons, and the substituents are in specific positions. The starting material must be a diene where, after metathesis, the substituents end up correctly.

Another approach: The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me draw that. Carbon 1 has a double bond to carbon 2. Then, the substituents: carbon 3 has a methyl, carbon 4 has a methyl, and carbon 5 has an isopropyl group.

Now, the starting material before metathesis would have two double bonds. Let's say the starting molecule is an octadiene. The positions of the double bonds will determine where the ring closure happens.

In ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes are on either end of a chain. The catalyst will break each double bond and rearrange them to form a ring. The key is to determine the correct positions of the double bonds in the starting material so that when they undergo metathesis, the substituents end up at the correct positions.

Let me consider the structure of each option.

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the molecule is eight carbons long. Double bonds at positions 1 and 7. That would mean between C1-C2 and C7-C8. Wait, but octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at 1 and 7, but wait, octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8. But wait, octa is eight carbons. So, positions 1 and 7 are the first and seventh carbons. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because between 1 and 7 in an eight-carbon chain, the positions are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So the double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8. Hmm, but that's at the ends. When metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break both and reconnect, perhaps forming a ring. Let me imagine the chain:

The chain would have substituents at C3 and C4 (methyl groups) and C5 (isopropyl). So positions 3 and 4 are methyl, position 5 is isopropyl. Let me imagine the structure:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, wait. No, because it's octa-1,7-diene, so the double bonds are at the ends. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, wait, octa-1,7-diene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, wait, wait, no. An octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at positions 1 and 7, but that would require 1-2 and 7-8 double bonds. But with 8 carbons, positions 7-8 would be the last two. So the molecule would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, wait, that can't be right because octa-1,7-diene would imply 8 carbons with double bonds at 1 and 7, but that would require 8 carbons, so positions 1-2 and 7-8. But that's impossible because that would need 9 carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. No, wait, octa-1,7-diene would have 8 carbons, with double bonds between 1-2 and 7-8. But wait, that would require that the chain is long enough. Let me count: 1,2; then 3,4; 5,6; 7,8. So the double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 7-8. So the molecule would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, but that's only eight carbons. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. But wait, that ends at 8. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. But that's only 8 carbons, so the double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8. But that would mean the end is double-bonded, which would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, that would require 8 carbons, but the double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8 would only be possible if there are 8 carbons, but that would require 7,8 to have a double bond, which is the 8th carbon being a CH2, but that's not possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider the product: it's a cyclohexene. The substituents are at positions 3,4 (dimethyl) and 5 (isopropyl). So in the ring, the substituents are in specific positions relative to each other.

In ring-closing metathesis, the starting material will have substituents that will end up in those positions once the ring is formed. So the substituents in the starting material must be positioned such that when the ring forms, their positions in the ring match the product.

Let me think about the positions in the starting material. Suppose the starting material is a diene, say, with substituents at positions that are a certain distance apart. The ring will form when the two double bonds undergo metathesis, so the substituents on each double bond will end up adjacent in the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has substituents that, when the ring forms, they end up in the correct positions. For example, if the starting material is an octene with substituents in certain positions, upon metathesis, they'll form the cyclohexene.

Another approach: ring-closing metathesis generally forms rings by connecting two ends of a chain. So, the product is a ring, and the starting material is a diene in a chain. The substituents in the starting material must be positioned such that when the ring forms, they are at the correct positions.

Let me try to model the starting material. The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So the ring has six carbons, with substituents at 3,4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). The double bond is between 1 and 2.

The starting material would have two alkenes, and the substituents would be in positions that, when the ring forms, they are in their correct positions.

Let me think about the structure of the starting material. Suppose the starting material is an octadiene. Let's imagine the structure before metathesis. Let's say the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, but that's 10 carbons, which can't be right. Wait, no, octa is 8 carbons. So the correct structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, that's nine carbons again. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should count the carbons. The product is cyclohexene, which is six-membered. The starting material must be a diene longer than six carbons, so perhaps eight carbons (octadiene). So the starting material has eight carbons and two double bonds.

Let me imagine that the starting material is an octadiene where the two double bonds are at positions that, upon ring closure, form the cyclohexene ring with substituents in the correct positions.

When two double bonds undergo metathesis, the catalyst breaks each double bond and swaps the ends. So, for example, if I have a chain with double bonds at positions i and j, the metathesis would connect the ends to form a ring.

Let me take option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me get the structure right. Octa-2,6-diene has double bonds between 2-3 and 6-7. So, positions 2-3 and 6-7. So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2.

Wait, but with substituents at 3,4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl) in the product. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should better draw this out mentally. Let's consider the starting material as an octadiene with substituents at certain positions.

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So, structure:

Carbons 1 to 8.

Double bonds between 2-3 and 6-7.

At carbon 3: methyl.

Carbon 4: methyl.

Carbon 5: isopropyl.

So, the structure would be:

1: CH2-

2: CH-

Double bond 2-3: so CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2?

Wait, maybe:

Position 1: CH3-CH2-

Position 2: CH2=CH-

Wait, no, perhaps better to write the structure as:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, but that's nine carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, let me think about the positions. The starting material is an octadiene, so eight carbons. The substituents are at positions 3,4,5 in the chain.

When the metathesis occurs, the double bonds (at 2 and 6) will be broken, and the ends will connect. So, after metathesis, the substituents at positions 3 and 4 would end up adjacent in the ring, and the substituent at 5 would be in position 5 of the ring.

Wait, perhaps the positions in the starting material are such that when the ring forms, the substituents are at the correct positions.

Let me think of the starting material as:

R1-CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2-R2.

Wait, no, the starting material doesn't have R1 and R2. It's a diene with substituents at specific positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an eight-carbon chain with substituents and double bonds at 2 and 6. Let me imagine the chain as:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, that's nine carbons. So I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about how the ring forms.

In ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes (double bonds) in the starting material will rearrange. The catalyst takes the two alkenes and swaps their ends, forming a new ring. So, the number of carbons in the ring is the number of carbons between the two double bonds plus one.

Wait, for example, if the starting material has double bonds at 1 and 4 in a five-carbon chain, that would form a three-membered ring because 4-1=3, but I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps the key is to figure out how many carbons are between the two double bonds in the starting material. The product is a six-membered ring, so the starting material must have a chain where the two double bonds are four carbons apart. Because, when the metathesis happens, the ring would consist of the six carbons: from one end to the other, including the two former ends.

Wait, let me think of it another way. If the starting material is an octadiene, and the two double bonds are at positions 1 and 5, then the number of carbons between them is 3 (positions 2,3,4). So when the ring forms, the ring would have 5 carbons? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the number of carbons in the ring would be the number of carbons between the two double bonds plus two (the two ends). So, if the starting material has double bonds at positions 1 and 5 in an octadiene, that's 5-1=4 carbons in between. So the ring would have 4+2=6 carbons. That makes sense because the product is cyclohexene.

So, the starting material must have two double bonds separated by four carbons. So, the positions of the double bonds would be such that the number of carbons between them is four.

Wait, so if the starting material is octadiene with double bonds at positions 1 and 5, then the number of carbons between them is 5-1-1 =3? Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Wait, the starting material is an octadiene, which has eight carbons. Let's imagine the two double bonds are at positions 1 and 5.

So, structure: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, but that would be an 8-carbon chain with double bonds at 1-2 and 5-6. Wait, no, that would be the case if the double bonds are at positions 1 and 5.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think that the starting material is an octadiene with double bonds located such that when the ring closes, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Going back to the product, the substituents are at 3,4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So, in the starting material, these substituents would be positioned on the chain such that when the ring forms, they're correctly placed.

So, perhaps in the starting material, the substituents are located in positions that, when the ring forms, they become the 3,4,5 positions.

Let me try to model this.

Suppose the starting material is an octadiene with substituents at positions 3,4,5.

The double bonds are at positions 1 and 6. Because when the ring forms, the substituents from positions 3 and 4 would be in the ring as positions 3 and 4, and substituent at 5 would be in position 5.

Wait, that might make sense.

So, starting material would have double bonds at 1 and 6. Let's see:

Positions:

1: CH2=CH-

...
5: CH(CH2CH3)
6: CH2=CH-

But wait, the starting material would be 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Wait, then the substituents are at 3,4,5. So when the ring forms, the substituents would end up in positions 3,4,5 of the ring.

But let's see what each option offers.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, no, octa-1,6-diene has double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7. So the chain is 8 carbons, double bonds between 1-2 and 6-7.

So substituents are at 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH(CH3)), and 5 (CH(CH2CH3)).

So the structure would be:

1: CH2=CH-

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH3)

4: CH(CH3)

5: CH(CH2CH3)

6: CH2-

7: CH2=CH-

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me write it correctly:

The starting material is octa-1,6-diene, so positions 1-2 and 6-7 have double bonds.

So:

Carbons 1-8:

1: CH2=CH-

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH3)

4: CH(CH3)

5: CH(CH2CH3)

6: CH2-

7: CH2=CH-

Wait, but that's only eight carbons. So positions 1-2 are double bond, and 6-7 are double bond.

So the structure would look like:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, that's nine carbons again. Hmm, perhaps I need to recount.

Wait, octa means eight carbons. So positions 1 to 8.

So, positions 1-2 double bond: CH2=CH-.

Position 3: CH2.

Position 4: CH(CH3).

Position 5: CH(CH3).

Position 6: CH(CH2CH3).

Position 7: CH2.

Position 8: CH2=CH?

Wait, that can't be. Because octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

1: CH2=CH-

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH3)

4: CH(CH3)

5: CH(CH2CH3)

6: CH2-

7: CH2=CH-

But that would require 7 carbons, not 8. Hmm, I'm getting stuck on this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B or C.

Let me think again about the product.

The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.

The substituents are at 3,4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl), and the double bond is at 1.

So, when the ring forms, the substituents must be positioned accordingly.

In the starting material, the substituents must be arranged such that when the ring forms, they end up at positions 3,4,5.

So, the starting material must have substituents at positions 3,4,5, and the double bonds at positions that when the ring forms, the substituents are correctly positioned.

If the starting material has double bonds at positions 2 and 6, then the number of carbons between them is 3 (positions 3,4,5). So, when the ring forms, the substituents at 3,4,5 would be in the ring at positions 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, no, octa-2,6-diene would have double bonds at positions 2-3 and 6-7.

So substituents at 3,4,5:

3: CH(CH3)

4: CH(CH3)

5: CH(CH2CH3)

So when the ring forms, the substituents are at 3,4,5, which correspond to the product.

Wait, but the ring would be formed by connecting the two double bonds. So, the metathesis would swap the ends.

So, for octa-2,6-diene, the structure would be:

1: CH2-

2: CH2-

3: CH2=CH-

Wait, no. Let me think of the starting material as:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, but that's nine carbons. I think I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct starting material is option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

In this case, the double bonds are at 2 and 6. So, when the catalyst breaks the double bonds, it would connect the ends to form a ring. The substituents at 3,4,5 would end up in the ring at positions 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me try to count the positions in the product.

In the product, the six-membered ring has substituents at 3,4,5. So, in the starting material, substituents at 3,4,5 would be connected in such a way that they end up in these positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's substituents are positioned such that when the ring forms, the positions are correct.

Let me think about the positions in the starting material.

If the starting material has double bonds at 2 and 6, then the chain is:

positions 1-2 (double bond), 3-4, 5-6 (double bond), and 7-8.

Wait, but that's octa-2,6-diene. So, the substituents are at 3,4,5.

When the ring forms, the number of carbons between the two double bonds is four (from 2 to 6), so the ring would have six carbons, which matches the product.

So, in the starting material, substituents at 3,4,5 would, upon ring formation, end up at positions 3,4,5 of the ring.

Thus, option B is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene. So the substituents are at 3,4,5, which would translate to the correct positions in the product.

Alternatively, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of the product's structure.

The product has substituents at 3,4 (methyl) and 5 (isopropyl). So, when the ring is formed, the substituents in the starting material must be positioned such that during the ring closure, they end up at the correct positions.

In the starting material, if the substituents are at 3,4,5, then after the ring forms, they would be at 3,4,5 in the ring.

So the starting material must have substituents at 3,4,5, and double bonds at 2 and 6.

Which option matches that?

Looking at the options:

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So, substituents at 3,4 (methyl) and 5 (isopropyl), with double bonds at 2 and 6.

So when the metathesis occurs, the ring forms, and the substituents are correctly positioned.

Therefore, the correct starting material is option B.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the structure of the product and the requirements of the reaction. Ring-closing metathesis involves a metal catalyst that breaks and reforms double bonds to form a ring. The starting material must be a diene with two double bonds positioned such that, upon metathesis, the substituents end up in the correct positions in the product.

The product, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, is a six-membered ring with a double bond at position 1, a methyl group at position 3, another methyl group at position 4, and an isopropyl group at position 5. The starting material must therefore be an octadiene with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5, and double bonds positioned such that the ring forms correctly.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 7, with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. However, the double bonds at positions 1 and 7 are too far apart to form a six-membered ring. This option does not satisfy the requirements for ring-closing metathesis.

2. **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 2 and 6, with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. The distance between the double bonds (positions 2 and 6) is ideal for forming a six-membered ring. Upon metathesis, the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 will end up in the correct positions in the product. This option is consistent with the requirements.

3. **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 6, with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. However, the double bonds at positions 1 and 6 are positioned such that the ring formed would not have the correct substituent arrangement. This option does not satisfy the requirements.

4. **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 7, with substituents at positions 4, 5, and 6. The substituents are not positioned correctly to match the product, and the double bonds are too far apart to form a six-membered ring. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene** (Option B), as it has the appropriate substituents and double bond positions to form the desired product via ring-closing metathesis.

Answer: B
