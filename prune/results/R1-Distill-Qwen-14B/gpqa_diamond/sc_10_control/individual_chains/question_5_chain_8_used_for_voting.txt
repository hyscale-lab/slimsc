Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when an operator is applied. So, the operator in question here is P, and we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, so direction n is in the x-z plane, which means its y-component is zero. So the direction vector can be written in terms of angles, maybe. Like, if it's in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis, I think. So the direction vector n would be something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or wait, no, wait, maybe (cosθ, 0, sinθ) if θ is the angle from the x-axis? No, wait, wait, no. Let me think. In spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the positive z-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the azimuthal angle φ is zero, because it's along the x-z plane, so it's along the same plane as the x and z axes. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since x is sinθ cosφ, but φ is zero here, so x becomes sinθ, and z is cosθ.

But wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, Pz. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So the operator P itself would be the vector operator, which can be written as P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Wait, but each component is (ħ/2) times a matrix, so perhaps the operator is (ħ/2)(σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) · n, since the operator along direction n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction's components.

Wait, because the operator in the direction n is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), that would make P = sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z, because n_y is zero. Because the direction is in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero.

So, the operator P is given by (ħ/2) [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ].

Because each component P_x, P_y, P_z is (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective Pauli matrices. So σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting, P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

So that gives us the matrix for P as:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ],
          [sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, let me double-check the matrix multiplication. Let me compute sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z.

σ_x is:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

σ_z is:
[ [1, 0],
  [0, -1] ]

So sinθ σ_x is:
[ [0 * sinθ, 1 * sinθ],
  [1 * sinθ, 0 * sinθ] ]
= [ [0, sinθ],
    [sinθ, 0] ]

cosθ σ_z is:
[ [cosθ * 1, 0],
  [0, cosθ*(-1)] ]
= [ [cosθ, 0],
    [0, -cosθ] ]

Adding these together:
[ [cosθ + 0, sinθ + 0],
  [sinθ + 0, 0 + (-cosθ)] ]
= [ [cosθ, sinθ],
    [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So P is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

The general approach for finding eigenvectors is to solve (P - λ I) v = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue, I is the identity matrix, and v is the eigenvector.

So let me write the matrix (P - λ I). Since λ is +ħ/2, and I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

So P is:
(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ],
         [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So subtracting λ I, which is (ħ/2) I, because λ is (ħ/2).

Wait, no. Wait, the identity matrix multiplied by λ would be λ I. So the matrix P is (ħ/2) times the 2x2 matrix. So the equation (P - λ I) is [ (ħ/2) * ( ... ) ] - λ I = 0.

Wait, maybe it's easier to factor out the (ħ/2) factor. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write the matrix as (ħ/2) multiplied by the 2x2 matrix M, where M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. So P = (ħ/2) M.

So the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = λ |v>, which becomes (ħ/2) M |v> = λ |v> → M |v> = (2λ/ħ) |v>.

But λ is given as +ħ/2, so (2λ/ħ) = 1. So the equation is M |v> = |v>.

So M - I = 0, where I is the identity matrix. So the matrix M - I is:

[ cosθ - 1, sinθ          ]
[ sinθ,      -cosθ - 1 ]

The determinant of this matrix must be zero for non-trivial solutions. So det(M - I) = 0.

The determinant is (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ) = ?

Let me compute it:

= [ (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) ] - [ sin^2θ ]

First, expand (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1):
= (cosθ)(-cosθ) + (cosθ)(-1) -1*(-cosθ) -1*1
= -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ + (-1)
= -cos²θ -1

Wait, let me compute (a - b)(-a - b) where a = cosθ, b=1.

(a - b)(-a - b) = -(a - b)(a + b) ) = -(a² - b²) )= -(cos²θ -1) )= -( - sin²θ )= sin²θ.

Wait, wait, that's a better way. Let me compute (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1):

= (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = (-cosθ)(cosθ) - cosθ *1 +1 * cosθ +1 * 1

= -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ +1

= -cos²θ +1

= 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ.

So the determinant is (1 - cos²θ) - sin²θ = sin²θ - sin²θ = 0. Which makes sense because we're looking for eigenvectors, so the equation is consistent.

So, the equation (M - I) v = 0 gives us the system:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0

These are two equations. Let's take the first equation: (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 → [ (1 - cosθ) v1 = sinθ v2 ] → v1 = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] v2.

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So substituting:

v1 = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ] v2 = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] v2 = cot(theta/2) v2.

So v1 = cot(theta/2) v2.

Let me pick v2 as a parameter, say, v2 = 1. Then v1 = cot(theta/2).

But wait, theta is an angle, so theta/2 is between 0 and pi/2 if theta is between 0 and pi. So cot(theta/2) is positive in that range.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T.

But I need to normalize this vector. The normalization condition is |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = 1.

So |cot(theta/2)|^2 + 1 = 1 → cot^2(theta/2) + 1 = csc^2(theta/2) = 1/sin^2(theta/2).

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt( csc^2(theta/2) ) ) = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, let me compute that. cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2). So:

v1 = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ) ] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2)

v2 = sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait a second. Is this the correct solution? Let me think again.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation for the operator P is (P - λ I) |v> = 0, and we found that the eigenvector, when scaled, is proportional to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. But wait, that seems a bit simplistic. Let me check the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Because when I wrote P as (ħ/2) M, and set lambda to +ħ/2, then M |v> = |v>, implying that M has eigenvalue 1 for this vector. Wait, but let me compute M acting on this vector.

M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So M acting on [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T would give:

First component: cosθ * cos(theta/2) + sinθ * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta - theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2)

Second component: sinθ * cos(theta/2) + (-cosθ) * sin(theta/2) = sin(theta - theta/2) - cos(theta) sin(theta/2) ?

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me compute each component step by step.

First component:

cosθ * cos(theta/2) + sinθ * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2) cosθ + sin(theta/2) sinθ.

Using the identity cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB.

Wait, but theta is the variable. Let me set A = theta, B = theta/2. Then A - B = theta/2.

So this would be cos(theta - theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2).

Wait, but cos(theta - theta/2) is cos(theta/2), so the first component is cos(theta/2). 

Second component: sinθ * cos(theta/2) - cosθ * sin(theta/2).

Which is sin(theta - theta/2) ) = sin(theta/2). 

So M acting on [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T gives [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is indeed the same vector. So that's correct. So M |v> = |v>, so this is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. So when I scale it by (ħ/2), the operator P acting on this vector gives (ħ/2) |v>, which is the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So yes, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, wait, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), right? Let me check the options.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but the problem says the eigenvector is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So does that affect anything about the eigenvector's form? Or is the solution general for any theta in that plane?

Yes, I think the solution is correct. So the normalized eigenvector components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which is option C.

Wait, but wait. The problem statement is a bit ambiguous about the direction. Let me think again. The vector is in the x-z plane, which as I thought earlier, has n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but that's for a unit vector in the x-z plane. But in the problem, the operator is along n, which is in x-z. So the operator P is in the direction of n, which is (n_x, 0, n_z), and the eigenvector we found is for that direction.

But wait, the eigenvector I found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is a spin-up state in the direction of n. Because in spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates along a direction n are |+> and |->, which have components involving cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), where theta is the polar angle.

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is indeed [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, normalized.

Looking again at the options:

Option C states (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by some cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So why would those factors be present? Well, maybe if the direction is not arbitrary but fixed. But in this problem, the direction is arbitrary. So perhaps the answer is option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the initial setup again. The operator P is given as:

P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But in our case, n is in the x-z plane, so n_y =0. So P is n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, perhaps I need to double-check the initial expression for the operator. Because the operator P along direction n is given by P = n · σ multiplied by ħ/2, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the matrix. Let me re-calculate M.

M = sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z.

So M is:

[ cosθ, sinθ ]
[ sinθ, -cosθ ]

Yes, that's correct. So the matrix P is (ħ/2) * M.

So the eigenvalues of M are 1 and -1, because any rotation matrix in 2x2 has eigenvalues ±1. So when we're looking for eigenvalue +ħ/2, the corresponding M eigenvalue is 1. So our calculation holds.

Therefore, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, which is option C.

So looking at the options, the correct one is C.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined as $\vec{P} = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P}$, where $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane, and $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$. Each component is given as $\hbar/2$ times a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalue equation is $(P - \lambda I)|v\rangle = 0$, where $\lambda = +\hbar/2$ and $I$ is the identity matrix.

### Step 1: Construct the operator matrix
The operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ in the x-z plane is:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.
\]
Substituting the given components:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]
we find:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left( \vec{P} - \lambda I \right)|v\rangle = 0,
\]
where $\lambda = +\hbar/2$ and $I$ is the identity matrix. Substituting $\vec{P}$:
\[
\vec{P} - \lambda I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The determinant of this matrix must be zero for non-trivial solutions:
\[
\det\left( \vec{P} - \lambda I \right) = (\cos\theta - 1)(-\cos\theta - 1) - \sin^2\theta = 0.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)(-\cos\theta - 1) = \sin^2\theta.
\]
This is satisfied for all $\theta$, confirming the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$.

### Step 3: Find the eigenvector
From the eigenvalue equation, the system of equations is:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0, \quad \sin\theta v_1 + (-\cos\theta - 1)v_2 = 0.
\]
From the first equation:
\[
v_1 = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} v_2.
\]
Using trigonometric identities, $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we find:
\[
v_1 = \cot(\theta/2) v_2.
\]
Letting $v_2 = 1$, the eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
|v\rangle \propto \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The normalization condition is:
\[
|\cos(\theta/2)|^2 + |\sin(\theta/2)|^2 = 1.
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The normalized eigenvector matches **Option C**, which is:
\[
\left( \cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2) \right).
\]

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when an operator is applied. So, the operator in question here is P, and we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, so direction n is in the x-z plane, which means its y-component is zero. So the direction vector can be written in terms of angles, maybe. Like, if it's in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis, I think. So the direction vector n would be something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or wait, no, wait, maybe (cosθ, 0, sinθ) if θ is the angle from the x-axis? No, wait, wait, no. Let me think. In spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the positive z-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the azimuthal angle φ is zero, because it's along the x-z plane, so it's along the same plane as the x and z axes. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since x is sinθ cosφ, but φ is zero here, so x becomes sinθ, and z is cosθ.

But wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, Pz. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So the operator P itself would be the vector operator, which can be written as P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Wait, but each component is (ħ/2) times a matrix, so perhaps the operator is (ħ/2)(σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) · n, since the operator along direction n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction's components.

Wait, because the operator in the direction n is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), that would make P = sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z, because n_y is zero. Because the direction is in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero.

So, the operator P is given by (ħ/2) [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ].

Because each component P_x, P_y, P_z is (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective Pauli matrices. So σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting, P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

So that gives us the matrix for P as:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ],
          [sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, let me double-check the matrix multiplication. Let me compute sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z.

σ_x is:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

σ_z is:
[ [1, 0],
  [0, -1] ]

So sinθ σ_x is:
[ [0 * sinθ, 1 * sinθ],
  [1 * sinθ, 0 * sinθ] ]
= [ [0, sinθ],
    [sinθ, 0] ]

cosθ σ_z is:
[ [cosθ * 1, 0],
  [0, cosθ*(-1)] ]
= [ [cosθ, 0],
    [0, -cosθ] ]

Adding these together:
[ [cosθ + 0, sinθ + 0],
  [sinθ + 0, 0 + (-cosθ)] ]
= [ [cosθ, sinθ],
    [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So P is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

The general approach for finding eigenvectors is to solve (P - λ I) v = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue, I is the identity matrix, and v is the eigenvector.

So let me write the matrix (P - λ I). Since λ is +ħ/2, and I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

So P is:
(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ],
         [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So subtracting λ I, which is (ħ/2) I, because λ is (ħ/2).

Wait, no. Wait, the identity matrix multiplied by λ would be λ I. So the matrix P is (ħ/2) times the 2x2 matrix. So the equation (P - λ I) is [ (ħ/2) * ( ... ) ] - λ I = 0.

Wait, maybe it's easier to factor out the (ħ/2) factor. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write the matrix as (ħ/2) multiplied by the 2x2 matrix M, where M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. So P = (ħ/2) M.

So the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = λ |v>, which becomes (ħ/2) M |v> = λ |v> → M |v> = (2λ/ħ) |v>.

But λ is given as +ħ/2, so (2λ/ħ) = 1. So the equation is M |v> = |v>.

So M - I = 0, where I is the identity matrix. So the matrix M - I is:

[ cosθ - 1, sinθ          ]
[ sinθ,      -cosθ - 1 ]

The determinant of this matrix must be zero for non-trivial solutions. So det(M - I) = 0.

The determinant is (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ) = ?

Let me compute it:

= [ (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) ] - [ sin^2θ ]

First, expand (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1):
= (cosθ)(-cosθ) + (cosθ)(-1) -1*(-cosθ) -1*1
= -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ + (-1)
= -cos²θ -1

Wait, let me compute (a - b)(-a - b) where a = cosθ, b=1.

(a - b)(-a - b) = -(a - b)(a + b) ) = -(a² - b²) )= -(cos²θ -1) )= -( - sin²θ )= sin²θ.

Wait, wait, that's a better way. Let me compute (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1):

= (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = (-cosθ)(cosθ) - cosθ *1 +1 * cosθ +1 * 1

= -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ +1

= -cos²θ +1

= 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ.

So the determinant is (1 - cos²θ) - sin²θ = sin²θ - sin²θ = 0. Which makes sense because we're looking for eigenvectors, so the equation is consistent.

So, the equation (M - I) v = 0 gives us the system:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0

These are two equations. Let's take the first equation: (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 → [ (1 - cosθ) v1 = sinθ v2 ] → v1 = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] v2.

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So substituting:

v1 = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ] v2 = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] v2 = cot(theta/2) v2.

So v1 = cot(theta/2) v2.

Let me pick v2 as a parameter, say, v2 = 1. Then v1 = cot(theta/2).

But wait, theta is an angle, so theta/2 is between 0 and pi/2 if theta is between 0 and pi. So cot(theta/2) is positive in that range.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T.

But I need to normalize this vector. The normalization condition is |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = 1.

So |cot(theta/2)|^2 + 1 = 1 → cot^2(theta/2) + 1 = csc^2(theta/2) = 1/sin^2(theta/2).

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt( csc^2(theta/2) ) ) = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, let me compute that. cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2). So:

v1 = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ) ] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2)

v2 = sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait a second. Is this the correct solution? Let me think again.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation for the operator P is (P - λ I) |v> = 0, and we found that the eigenvector, when scaled, is proportional to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. But wait, that seems a bit simplistic. Let me check the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Because when I wrote P as (ħ/2) M, and set lambda to +ħ/2, then M |v> = |v>, implying that M has eigenvalue 1 for this vector. Wait, but let me compute M acting on this vector.

M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So M acting on [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T would give:

First component: cosθ * cos(theta/2) + sinθ * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta - theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2)

Second component: sinθ * cos(theta/2) + (-cosθ) * sin(theta/2) = sin(theta - theta/2) - cos(theta) sin(theta/2) ?

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me compute each component step by step.

First component:

cosθ * cos(theta/2) + sinθ * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2) cosθ + sin(theta/2) sinθ.

Using the identity cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB.

Wait, but theta is the variable. Let me set A = theta, B = theta/2. Then A - B = theta/2.

So this would be cos(theta - theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2).

Wait, but cos(theta - theta/2) is cos(theta/2), so the first component is cos(theta/2). 

Second component: sinθ * cos(theta/2) - cosθ * sin(theta/2).

Which is sin(theta - theta/2) ) = sin(theta/2). 

So M acting on [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T gives [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is indeed the same vector. So that's correct. So M |v> = |v>, so this is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. So when I scale it by (ħ/2), the operator P acting on this vector gives (ħ/2) |v>, which is the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So yes, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, wait, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), right? Let me check the options.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but the problem says the eigenvector is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So does that affect anything about the eigenvector's form? Or is the solution general for any theta in that plane?

Yes, I think the solution is correct. So the normalized eigenvector components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which is option C.

Wait, but wait. The problem statement is a bit ambiguous about the direction. Let me think again. The vector is in the x-z plane, which as I thought earlier, has n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but that's for a unit vector in the x-z plane. But in the problem, the operator is along n, which is in x-z. So the operator P is in the direction of n, which is (n_x, 0, n_z), and the eigenvector we found is for that direction.

But wait, the eigenvector I found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is a spin-up state in the direction of n. Because in spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates along a direction n are |+> and |->, which have components involving cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), where theta is the polar angle.

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is indeed [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, normalized.

Looking again at the options:

Option C states (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by some cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So why would those factors be present? Well, maybe if the direction is not arbitrary but fixed. But in this problem, the direction is arbitrary. So perhaps the answer is option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the initial setup again. The operator P is given as:

P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But in our case, n is in the x-z plane, so n_y =0. So P is n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, perhaps I need to double-check the initial expression for the operator. Because the operator P along direction n is given by P = n · σ multiplied by ħ/2, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the matrix. Let me re-calculate M.

M = sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z.

So M is:

[ cosθ, sinθ ]
[ sinθ, -cosθ ]

Yes, that's correct. So the matrix P is (ħ/2) * M.

So the eigenvalues of M are 1 and -1, because any rotation matrix in 2x2 has eigenvalues ±1. So when we're looking for eigenvalue +ħ/2, the corresponding M eigenvalue is 1. So our calculation holds.

Therefore, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, which is option C.

So looking at the options, the correct one is C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined as $\vec{P} = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P}$, where $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane, and $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$. Each component is given as $\hbar/2$ times a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalue equation is $(P - \lambda I)|v\rangle = 0$, where $\lambda = +\hbar/2$ and $I$ is the identity matrix.

### Step 1: Construct the operator matrix
The operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ in the x-z plane is:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.
\]
Substituting the given components:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]
we find:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left( \vec{P} - \lambda I \right)|v\rangle = 0,
\]
where $\lambda = +\hbar/2$ and $I$ is the identity matrix. Substituting $\vec{P}$:
\[
\vec{P} - \lambda I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The determinant of this matrix must be zero for non-trivial solutions:
\[
\det\left( \vec{P} - \lambda I \right) = (\cos\theta - 1)(-\cos\theta - 1) - \sin^2\theta = 0.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)(-\cos\theta - 1) = \sin^2\theta.
\]
This is satisfied for all $\theta$, confirming the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$.

### Step 3: Find the eigenvector
From the eigenvalue equation, the system of equations is:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0, \quad \sin\theta v_1 + (-\cos\theta - 1)v_2 = 0.
\]
From the first equation:
\[
v_1 = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} v_2.
\]
Using trigonometric identities, $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we find:
\[
v_1 = \cot(\theta/2) v_2.
\]
Letting $v_2 = 1$, the eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
|v\rangle \propto \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The normalization condition is:
\[
|\cos(\theta/2)|^2 + |\sin(\theta/2)|^2 = 1.
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The normalized eigenvector matches **Option C**, which is:
\[
\left( \cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2) \right).
\]
