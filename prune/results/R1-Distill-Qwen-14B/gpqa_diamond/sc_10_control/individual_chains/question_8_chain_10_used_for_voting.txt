Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the setup is that someone is doing an experiment on white lupine plants to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). They know that at least one of these is a transcription factor acting upstream of others.

The main question is about the interactions between these genes based on how resistant the mutants are to the pathogen. The resistance levels are given as percentages of the control (wild-type). The higher the percentage, the more resistant the plant is. So 100% is the same as the wild type, whereas 0% means all plants are infected.

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% resistance. So less than wild type but not super bad. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance, but not as much as others.
- g2: 0% resistance. So completely susceptible. That's a big hit.
- g3: 50% resistance. So only half as resistant as wild type.
- g1g3: 10%. Super susceptible.
- g2g3: 0%. Also super susceptible.
- g1g2: 0%. Same as g2.

Hmm. The wild-type is 100%, so the question is about the gene interactions.

The options give different conclusions about which gene is the transcription factor and the relationships between them. I need to figure out which option fits the data.

First, let's think about what each observation means.

g2 knockout is 0% resistance. That's a big drop. So G2 might be a critical gene for resistance, perhaps the transcription factor upstream of others. Because if a gene's product is necessary for activating other genes, then its knockout would disable the whole pathway, leading to no resistance.

Alternatively, G2's product could be part of a necessary pathway. But since G2's mutant is 0%, that suggests that without G2, the plant can't resist at all. So perhaps G2 is an essential gene for the resistance mechanism.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2 is 0%. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is the same as when G2 is knocked out alone. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because if both are knocked out, the effect is the same as G2 alone. Wait, epistatic means that one gene's pathway is downstream of another. So if G2 is epistatic to G1, that would mean that G2 is downstream of G1. Because the epistatic gene's mutation masks the phenotype of the other.

Wait, another way: if mutation in G2 leads to a more severe phenotype than G1, then G2 is epistatic to G1. Because G2's effect is downstream, so the pathway is blocked earlier, which is more severe.

So in this case, g2 has 0% resistance, and in g1g2, it's also 0%. So the phenotype of g1g2 is the same as g2. That implies that G2 is epistatic to G1. So the pathway goes G1 → G2. Or perhaps G2 is downstream.

Wait, another way: in genetic terms, if a double mutant g1g2 has the same phenotype as g2, that suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the G2 mutation is masking the effect of G1's mutation.

So in the pathway, G1 might be upstream of G2. So when G2 is knocked out, it doesn't matter if G1 is functioning or not; the pathway is blocked at G2.

So, if G1 is upstream of G2, G2 is downstream, and G2 is epistatic to G1.

So that would suggest that G2 is the transcription factor because it's downstream and perhaps acting as a master regulator.

Now, looking at the other double mutants.

g1g3: 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is even lower than either G1 or G3 alone. Wait, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So knocking out both gives 10%—much lower. That suggests that their functions are additive or perhaps they are in separate pathways.

Alternatively, if they were in the same pathway, the double mutant might have a more severe phenotype than the worse of the two.

Wait, but 10% is worse than both. So maybe they contribute to the same pathway, but in a redundant way. Or perhaps they're in parallel pathways. Alternatively, perhaps G3 is downstream of G1.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the other double mutants.

g2g3: 0% resistance. So when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, it's as bad as when G2 is knocked out alone. So the phenotype is the same as g2. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

Wait, because the double mutant g2g3 has the same resistance as g2 (0%). So the effect of G3 knockout is masked by G2's knockout. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

So if G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G2 is the gene which, when knocked out, gives the most severe phenotype, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor.

Wait, the problem states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor upstream of others. So if G2 is a transcription factor, and it's upstream of G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would disable the entire pathway, leading to 0% resistance.

But wait, let's check what the other data says.

For example, the g3 mutant is 50% resistant. So when only G3 is knocked out, the resistance is halved. So G3's function contributes, but isn't as critical as G2.

Now, for the double mutant g1g3, it's 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is much lower than either alone. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance, and knocking both out adds up the negative effect.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but redundant, so knocking both out would be worse than just one.

Wait, but if G1 is upstream of G2 and G3, then knocking out G1 would affect both G2 and G3. But in the data, G1 knockout is 75% resistance, which is better than G3's 50% and G2's 0%. Hmm.

Wait, maybe G1 is upstream of G2, and G3 is downstream of G2? Or maybe G3 is downstream of G1, but G2 is also downstream.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So, if G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed (assuming they are regulated by G2's product). But in the data, the g2 mutant is 0% resistance, which would make sense if G2 is the TF. However, looking at the single mutants, g1 is 75%, and g3 is 50%. So without G1, they have some resistance, and without G3, even less.

But wait, if G2 is the TF for both, then in g1, G2 is still present. So perhaps G2 is a TF that activates G3, but not G1. Or maybe G1 is not regulated by G2.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but in separate pathways. So knocking out G2 would disable both, leading to 0% resistance. Knocking out G1 would disable only its pathway, so some resistance remains (75%). Knocking out G3 would disable its pathway, leading to 50% resistance.

In that case, G2 is the transcription factor because its knockout leads to the most severe phenotype. And G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 because the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 have the same phenotype as g2.

Now, looking at the other double mutant, g1g3: their resistance is 10%. That's worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate, additive pathways. So they each contribute some resistance, but when both are knocked out, the resistance drops much further.

Wait, but when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 pathways are disabled, leading to 0% resistance. So G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

So, the hierarchy is G2 → G1 and G3. So G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.

But wait, in the g1 mutant, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than the wild type? No, the wild type is 100%. So g1 is 75%, which is less than wild type. So without G1, the resistance is lower, implying that G1 is contributing to the resistance.

Similarly, without G3, resistance is 50%, which is worse than without G1.

So perhaps G3's function is more critical than G1's.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%—much lower than either. So the combined effect is worse than either.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway, and knocking both out makes it much worse.

But wait, if G2 is the TF upstream of both, then knocking out G2 would disable both, leading to 0% resistance. Which matches the data.

Wait, but in the g1g3 case, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than both, but not as bad as when G2 is knocked out.

So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in a separate pathway that's additive to the pathway controlled by G2.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this by considering each option and see which fits.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, if G1 is the TF, then knocking G1 would have the most severe phenotype. But in the data, g2 is the most severe, with 0%. So option A doesn't fit because the data suggests G2 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, same promoter? That would mean G1 and G3 are co-regulated, perhaps. Not sure. If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the double mutant g1g3 would have the same phenotype as the worse of the two. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So if G3 were epistatic, then the phenotype might be the same as G3's (50%) or worse than G1's (75%) but in the data it's 10%, which is worse than both. So perhaps this option isn't correct.

Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. So G1 and G3 have multiple effects. But in this context, I'm not sure. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the double mutant g1g3 would have the same phenotype as the worse of the two. But in the data, it's worse than either, so maybe that's not the case.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy is when two genes perform the same function. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking both out would have a worse effect than either alone. That fits with the data: g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either (75% and 50%). So if they are redundant, their combined knockout would have a more severe phenotype.

But wait, what about the other double mutants? Let's see.

If G2 is the transcription factor, then its knockout would disable any downstream genes. So in the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% (same as g2). So G2 is epistatic to G1, which fits with G2 being upstream.

g2g3: 0% (same as g2), so G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

g1g3: 10% (worse than either), which suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway, perhaps as redundant genes.

So option D says that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the g1g3 double mutant, the phenotype would be the same as the more severe of the two.

But in the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. Their double is 10%, which is worse than both. So if G1 is epistatic, the double mutant would have the same as G1 or G3, whichever is worse. But here, it's worse, so perhaps that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting epistatic relationships wrong.

Epistasis refers to the position of a gene in a pathway. If Gene A is epistatic to Gene B, it means that the pathway flows through A to B. So, the pathway is B → A. Because when you have a mutation in A, the pathway is blocked whether B is functioning or not.

So, if you have a double mutant of A and B, the phenotype is the same as the mutant with the earlier gene (A), because the pathway is blocked at A.

In this problem, the data shows that the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 have the same phenotype as g2. So, that suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because in g1g2, the phenotype is same as g2; same with g2g3.

So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, meaning G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3.

Wait no, because if G2 is epistatic, it would be downstream. So the pathway would be G1 → G2 and G3 → G2. That way, knocking out G2 blocks both pathways.

But then how about the g1g3 mutant? Their resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. That suggests that both G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway, but perhaps in a redundant or additive way.

So, the model would be:

G1 and G3 are in one pathway that contributes to resistance, and G2 is in another pathway. But when G2 is knocked out, the other pathway can't function, leading to 0% resistance. But that doesn't fit because in the g1g3 double mutant, G2 is still present, leading to 10% resistance.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe another approach would help.

Let me think about the possible hierarchy:

If G2 is a transcription factor (TF) that activates G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would prevent both G1 and G3 from being expressed. However, in the data, the g1 mutant is 75% resistance, which is higher than g2 (0%). So, if G2 activates G1, then in the g1 mutant, G2 is still active and perhaps can activate G3. But the g1 mutant is 75%, and g3 is 50%, so maybe G3 is more dependent on G2.

Wait, maybe G2 is the TF that activates both G1 and G3. Then in the g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to no resistance (0%). But in the g1 mutant, G2 and G3 are expressed. G3 contributes to 50% resistance. But in the data, the g1 mutant is 75%. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is not regulated by G2. So G2 is the TF for G3, but G1 is controlled by another factor.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the TF for G3, and G1 is not downstream. Then, g2 knockout would disable G3, leading to 0% resistance. But the data shows that g3 is 50% resistant. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, in the data, g3 is 50% resistance. So, when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is halved. So G3 contributes to resistance but isn't the only component.

So, maybe G3 is downstream of G2, and G1 is another component that's not regulated by G2.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, both activated by G2.

So, G2 is the TF upstream of both G1 and G3. So knocking out G2 would disable both pathways, leading to 0% resistance. Knocking out G1 would leave G3 to contribute 50% resistance, but wait, in the data, g1 is 75% resistance. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is upstream of G3, and G1 is in a separate pathway. So knocking G2 would disable G3's pathway, but G1's pathway can still function, leading to some resistance.

In that case, let's look at the data:

g1: 75% resistance. So G1's pathway contributes 75% resistance when G2 is present. But when G2 is knocked out (g2), resistance is 0%. So perhaps G2 is not involved in G1's pathway. That complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is in a separate pathway from G2 and G3. So G2 is the TF for G3, and G1 is a separate gene that contributes to resistance.

So, when G2 is knocked out, G3 can't function, leading to 0% resistance. But when G1 is knocked out, the other pathway (G2 and G3) can still function, leading to 75% resistance.

Wait, but then in g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. So G3's pathway is gone, and G1's is also gone. So what's left? Maybe some other pathway contributes 10% resistance.

Hmm, but this is getting too speculative.

Looking back at the options, maybe option C or D.

Option C says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. But in this context, perhaps G1 and G3 affect resistance but also other traits. Not sure if that's relevant here.

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other. So knocking both out would have a more severe effect than either alone. Which matches the data, as g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than both.

But if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the double mutant g1g3 would have the same phenotype as G1's mutant (75%) or worse than G3 (50%). But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse than both. So that would suggest that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, but their combined knockout makes the resistance much worse.

Wait, but if they are redundant, then knocking out both would have a more severe effect than either, which fits. So in a redundant system, each gene can do the same job, so knocking both out removes all redundancy, leading to a more severe phenotype.

So, in this case, the data suggests that G1 and G3 are redundant. So their combined knockout makes the resistance much worse than either alone.

So, looking back at the options, option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But wait, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the phenotype of g1g3 would be same as the worse of the two. But in the data, it's worse than both, implying perhaps that they are additive, not redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps gene redundancy means that each gene contributes some function, and both are necessary for full resistance, but knocking out both leads to more severe resistance loss.

Wait, another angle: the presence of G2 affects G1 and G3. So in wild type, G2 is active and both G1 and G3 are expressed. If G2 is a TF, then in g2 mutant, G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

But in the data, the g1 mutant is 75% resistance. So, in the absence of G1, G2 and G3 are present and active. So perhaps G3 contributes to 50% of the resistance, and G1 contributes another 25%, bringing the total to 75% when G1 is present. So, if G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 50% (from G3), but the data says g1 is 75%. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G2 is upstream of both. But without G2, the pathway is blocked, leading to 0% resistance. Without G1, the pathway is partially functional, leading to some resistance.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway downstream of G2.

So, G2 → G1 → G3, or G2 → G3 → another gene.

But this is getting too vague.

Let me try to see which option aligns with the data.

The data points:

- g2 is 0%. So G2 is critical.

- All double mutants involving G2 (g1g2, g2g3) are 0%. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

So G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3? No, wait, it's the opposite. If G2 is downstream, then the presence of G2's function is necessary for the pathway to proceed.

Wait, no, because if G2 is epistatic (meaning downstream), the presence of a mutation in G2 masks the effect of mutations upstream (like G1 or G3). So if G2 is downstream, then knocking it out would lead to the same phenotype as knocking out any gene upstream of it.

So, G2 is the last step in a pathway, so knocking it out would disable the entire pathway. So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, which are upstream.

So, if G2 is the transcription factor, then it's the last step, and all other genes are upstream, meaning their products are necessary for G2's function.

But in the data, the g1 mutant has 75% resistance. So, without G1, there's still 75% resistance. So, G1 is upstream of G2, but without G1, G2 is still functional enough to provide some resistance.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because if G2 is the transcription factor, then without G1, G2 should still be active, but perhaps G1 is part of a different pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a pathway that is parallel to G2's pathway. So, both G2 and G1/G3 contribute to the overall resistance.

In that case, G2 is a transcription factor activating a major pathway, while G1 and G3 are in another pathway. So, knocking out G2 would disable its pathway, but the other pathway (G1 and G3) would still contribute. But in the data, the g2 mutant is 0%, which suggests that without G2, no resistance. So that can't be.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option A: G1 is TF. But g2 is 0%, which is worse than g1 (75%). So G2's knockout is worse than G1's, which doesn't fit if G1 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 have same promoter (so maybe co-regulated). G3 is epistatic to G1. So, if G3 is epistatic, then in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be same as the worse of G1 and G3. But the data says 10%, worse than either. So this doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. G1 is epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy would mean G1 affects multiple traits, not just resistance. Not sure. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the double mutant would have phenotype of G1 or G3, whichever is worse. But data is worse than both. So this doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. G1 is epistatic to G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that both G1 and G3 can perform the same function. So, knocking out both would lead to a more severe phenotype than either alone. That fits with the data for g1g3 (10% < 50% and 75%). 

But does G1 being epistatic to G3 fit? If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the double mutant would have the same phenotype as the more severe of the two. Since g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, the double would be 50% if G3 is epistatic, or 75% if G1 is epistatic. But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse than both. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the concept of epistasis here.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic to G3, their pathways are in a linear order, like G3 → G1. So, if G1 is knocked out, the pathway is blocked regardless of G3's state. So in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be same as g1 (75%). But in the data, it's 10%, which is less than 75%. So that would suggest that G3 is epistatic to G1, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Let's think in terms of the pathway.

If the pathway is G3 → G1 → resistance.

Then, knocking out G1 would block the pathway, leading to no resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is some resistance. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if the pathway is G1 → G3 → resistance. Then, knocking out G1 would prevent G3 from being expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But data says g1 is 75%, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, both contributing to resistance. So, knocking either one out reduces resistance, and knocking both out reduces it further.

In that model, the double mutant g1g3 would have the sum of both losses, leading to 10% (since 75% + 50% isn't additive; that's not how percentages work. Oh, wait, perhaps it's multiplicative. 75% is 3/4, 50% is 1/2. If both contribute, perhaps 3/4 * 1/2 = 3/8 = 37.5%, but the data is 10%. So that's not matching.)

Alternatively, maybe each contributes 25% and 25%, so together 50%, but the data is 10%, which doesn't fit.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for which option correctly identifies the hierarchy.

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the pathway is G3 → G1. So knocking out G1 would block the pathway, making the phenotype same as if G3 is knocked out (g3 is 50%, but in reality, g1 is 75%). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is upstream of G3.

So, if G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean G1 is downstream, which doesn't fit because the data shows that g1 has higher resistance than g3.

Wait, no, G1 as being downstream would mean that the pathway is G3 → G1. So knocking out G3 would prevent G1 from being expressed. But in the data, g3 is 50%, and g1 is 75%, which suggests that G1's function is more critical, but without G3, the resistance is worse than without G1. So perhaps G1 is upstream of G3.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Another approach: suppose G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream.

In the wild type, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed.

- g2: G2 is knocked out → no expression of G1 and G3 → 0% resistance.

- g1: G1 is knocked out → G2 and G3 are still active. If G3 contributes 50% resistance, then why is g1 at 75%? That suggests that G1 contributes 25% resistance.

Wait, no. If G1 is knocked out, but G3 is active, then the resistance would be determined by G3's contribution. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So perhaps G1 contributes more than G3.

Wait, but that doesn't add up. If G1 is knocked out, and G3 is still active, then why is resistance higher than when G3 is knocked out?

Hmm, perhaps the model is that G1's pathway is more effective than G3's. So, without G1, the resistance is still higher than without G3.

This is getting too confusing. Let me try to think about what each option implies.

Option D: G2 is the transcription factor. G1 and G3 are redundant. G1 is epistatic to G3.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would have a worse effect than either alone. So, in g1g3, 10% is worse than 75% and 50%, which fits.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the double mutant, the phenotype would be same as G1's mutant (75%) or worse than G3's mutant (50%). But the data shows 10%, which is worse than both. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the term 'epistatic towards' in the option doesn't mean that the double mutant's phenotype is the same as the more severe single mutant, but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the hierarchy is that G3 is downstream of G1. So, G1 controls G3. If that's the case, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which could be lower than either because in addition to G1's knockout, G3 is also knocked out (but if G3 is downstream of G1, then G3's knockout wouldn't add anything beyond G1's knockout, unless G3 has another function).

Hmm.

Maybe the best way is to pick the option that correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, leading to the conclusion that G2 is downstream.

Wait, but earlier data suggested that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, meaning it's downstream.

So, the correct option should state that G2 is the TF, and that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because G2's data is worse.

Option B: G2 is TF. So possible.

Option C: G2 is TF. Possible.

Option D: G2 is TF. Possible.

So options B, C, D have G2 as TF.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

g1g3 is 10%. So, in the absence of both G1 and G3, resistance is very low.

If G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and are redundant, then their combined knockout would lead to a worse phenotype than either alone. Which fits.

So, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which would fit with g1g3 being much worse.

Now, the epistasis part.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, in the double mutant, the phenotype would be same as G1's. But the data shows it's worse than both, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the epistatic relationship in option D refers to G1 being upstream of G3. So, G1 is epistatic to G3. So, the pathway is G3 → G1. So, if G1 is knocked out, the pathway is blocked regardless of G3.

But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. So if G1 is downstream of G3, then knocking out G1 would prevent the pathway from working, leading to lower resistance than G3's. But the data shows higher resistance in g1 than g3. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the pathway is G1 → G3. So, G1 is upstream of G3. If G1 is knocked out, then G3 can't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75%, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the pathway is that G2 activates both G1 and G3, which are in separate pathways.

So, G2 is the TF. G1 is in one pathway, G3 in another.

In the g1 mutant, G3's pathway is active, contributing 50% resistance. But data shows g1 is 75%. So that suggests that G1's pathway is more important.

Wait, but G1's knockout leads to higher resistance than G3's. So perhaps G1's pathway contributes more.

But this is getting too speculative.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I'll have to make an educated guess.

The data shows that G2 is the most critical gene. So it's likely the transcription factor.

The double mutants involving G2 have the same phenotype as G2 alone, indicating G2 is epistatic to the others.

Among the options, options B, C, and D have G2 as TF.

Option D says G1 and G3 are redundant, which fits with the g1g3 double mutant.

So, option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, but the epistatic part might not fit. But given the options, this seems the most plausible.

Alternatively, option A is wrong because G1 isn't the TF. Option B's gene redundancy part may not fit. Hmm.

After considering all the points, I think the best answer is option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the double mutant g1g3's 10% is worse than either, which fits with redundancy. So, option D's first part is correct.

The epistasis part in option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the double mutant, the phenotype is worse than both, which suggests additive or redundant effects, not epistatic.

So perhaps option D's statement about epistasis is incorrect.

Looking back, I think the correct epistatic relationship is that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, since the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 have the same phenotype as g2.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, meaning it's downstream.

But in the options, none of them directly state this. Let's read the options again.

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. But what about G3? The data shows g2g3 is 0%, same as g2.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but no, because option A says G1 is the TF, which isn't the case.

Wait, the options are:

A) G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

B) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 share promoter (same regulation), G3 is epistatic to G1.

C) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

D) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Given that, the correct option must have G2 as TF, and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, none of them directly say that G2 is epistatic to both. But options B, C, D have G2 as TF.

Option B says G3 is epistatic to G1. That would mean that the double mutant g1g3 would have the same phenotype as g3 (50%). But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse. So option B isn't correct.

Option C says G1 is epistatic to G3. So the double mutant would have the same phenotype as G1 (75%). But data says 10%, so this isn't correct.

Option D says G1 is epistatic to G3. Same issue as above.

Wait, none of the options correctly capture the fact that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not fully confident.

Another approach: think of epistatic as which gene is downstream. So if G2 is downstream, then it's epistatic to any upstream genes.

So, in option D, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant, which makes sense.

But the statement about G1 being epistatic to G3 isn't supported by the data. Because the double mutant is worse than either.

Hmm.

I think the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Additionally, G1 and G3 are redundant. So the correct option would be the one stating that G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

But looking at the options, none of them mention both G1 and G3 being epistatic to G2.

Wait, option D says: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But if G1 is epistatic to G3, then g1g3 would have the same phenotype as G1 (75%), but the data shows 10%. So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than both. This suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but are not redundant—they might be additive. So each contributes some part of the resistance, and both are needed for full resistance.

In that case, their combined knockout leads to much lower resistance.

But in terms of epistasis, perhaps G2 is the only one that's epistatic to others.

After all this, I think the correct option is D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about the epistatic part. Maybe I should conclude that option D is correct.

The experiment investigates the role of three genes (G1, G2, and G3) in anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The data shows resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to determine the gene interactions and hierarchy based on the resistance phenotypes. The key observations and conclusions are as follows:

1. **G2 is the most critical gene**: The g2 mutant has 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is essential for resistance. This suggests that G2 is likely the transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of other genes.

2. **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**: The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both show 0% resistance, the same as g2. This indicates that G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3, and its knockout masks the effects of G1 and G3 mutations.

3. **G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not fully independent**: The single mutants g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) show partial resistance, suggesting that both genes contribute to resistance but are not as critical as G2. The double mutant g1g3 shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

4. **Interpretation of epistasis**: The option states that G1 is epistatic to G3. If this were true, the double mutant g1g3 would have the same phenotype as the more severe single mutant (g3, 50%). However, the data shows that g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than both single mutants. This suggests that G1 and G3 are not strictly epistatic but may act in a redundant or additive manner.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. G1 is not the transcription factor, as g2 shows 0% resistance, indicating G2 is the critical gene.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While G2 is the TF, the claim that G3 is epistatic to G1 is inconsistent with the data. The double mutant g1g3 shows 10%, which is worse than either single mutant, not the same as g3 (50%).
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While G2 is the TF, the claim that G1 and G3 show pleiotropy is not supported by the data. Pleiotropy refers to genes affecting multiple traits, which is not evident here.
- **Option D**: Partially correct. G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, as their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype (10%) than either single mutant. However, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than both single mutants.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible interpretation is that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype. However, the claim about G1 being epistatic to G3 in Option D is not fully supported by the data. Despite this, Option D is the closest to the observed data compared to the other options.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the setup is that someone is doing an experiment on white lupine plants to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). They know that at least one of these is a transcription factor acting upstream of others.

The main question is about the interactions between these genes based on how resistant the mutants are to the pathogen. The resistance levels are given as percentages of the control (wild-type). The higher the percentage, the more resistant the plant is. So 100% is the same as the wild type, whereas 0% means all plants are infected.

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% resistance. So less than wild type but not super bad. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance, but not as much as others.
- g2: 0% resistance. So completely susceptible. That's a big hit.
- g3: 50% resistance. So only half as resistant as wild type.
- g1g3: 10%. Super susceptible.
- g2g3: 0%. Also super susceptible.
- g1g2: 0%. Same as g2.

Hmm. The wild-type is 100%, so the question is about the gene interactions.

The options give different conclusions about which gene is the transcription factor and the relationships between them. I need to figure out which option fits the data.

First, let's think about what each observation means.

g2 knockout is 0% resistance. That's a big drop. So G2 might be a critical gene for resistance, perhaps the transcription factor upstream of others. Because if a gene's product is necessary for activating other genes, then its knockout would disable the whole pathway, leading to no resistance.

Alternatively, G2's product could be part of a necessary pathway. But since G2's mutant is 0%, that suggests that without G2, the plant can't resist at all. So perhaps G2 is an essential gene for the resistance mechanism.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2 is 0%. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is the same as when G2 is knocked out alone. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because if both are knocked out, the effect is the same as G2 alone. Wait, epistatic means that one gene's pathway is downstream of another. So if G2 is epistatic to G1, that would mean that G2 is downstream of G1. Because the epistatic gene's mutation masks the phenotype of the other.

Wait, another way: if mutation in G2 leads to a more severe phenotype than G1, then G2 is epistatic to G1. Because G2's effect is downstream, so the pathway is blocked earlier, which is more severe.

So in this case, g2 has 0% resistance, and in g1g2, it's also 0%. So the phenotype of g1g2 is the same as g2. That implies that G2 is epistatic to G1. So the pathway goes G1 → G2. Or perhaps G2 is downstream.

Wait, another way: in genetic terms, if a double mutant g1g2 has the same phenotype as g2, that suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the G2 mutation is masking the effect of G1's mutation.

So in the pathway, G1 might be upstream of G2. So when G2 is knocked out, it doesn't matter if G1 is functioning or not; the pathway is blocked at G2.

So, if G1 is upstream of G2, G2 is downstream, and G2 is epistatic to G1.

So that would suggest that G2 is the transcription factor because it's downstream and perhaps acting as a master regulator.

Now, looking at the other double mutants.

g1g3: 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is even lower than either G1 or G3 alone. Wait, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So knocking out both gives 10%—much lower. That suggests that their functions are additive or perhaps they are in separate pathways.

Alternatively, if they were in the same pathway, the double mutant might have a more severe phenotype than the worse of the two.

Wait, but 10% is worse than both. So maybe they contribute to the same pathway, but in a redundant way. Or perhaps they're in parallel pathways. Alternatively, perhaps G3 is downstream of G1.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the other double mutants.

g2g3: 0% resistance. So when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, it's as bad as when G2 is knocked out alone. So the phenotype is the same as g2. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

Wait, because the double mutant g2g3 has the same resistance as g2 (0%). So the effect of G3 knockout is masked by G2's knockout. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

So if G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G2 is the gene which, when knocked out, gives the most severe phenotype, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor.

Wait, the problem states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor upstream of others. So if G2 is a transcription factor, and it's upstream of G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would disable the entire pathway, leading to 0% resistance.

But wait, let's check what the other data says.

For example, the g3 mutant is 50% resistant. So when only G3 is knocked out, the resistance is halved. So G3's function contributes, but isn't as critical as G2.

Now, for the double mutant g1g3, it's 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is much lower than either alone. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance, and knocking both out adds up the negative effect.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but redundant, so knocking both out would be worse than just one.

Wait, but if G1 is upstream of G2 and G3, then knocking out G1 would affect both G2 and G3. But in the data, G1 knockout is 75% resistance, which is better than G3's 50% and G2's 0%. Hmm.

Wait, maybe G1 is upstream of G2, and G3 is downstream of G2? Or maybe G3 is downstream of G1, but G2 is also downstream.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So, if G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed (assuming they are regulated by G2's product). But in the data, the g2 mutant is 0% resistance, which would make sense if G2 is the TF. However, looking at the single mutants, g1 is 75%, and g3 is 50%. So without G1, they have some resistance, and without G3, even less.

But wait, if G2 is the TF for both, then in g1, G2 is still present. So perhaps G2 is a TF that activates G3, but not G1. Or maybe G1 is not regulated by G2.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but in separate pathways. So knocking out G2 would disable both, leading to 0% resistance. Knocking out G1 would disable only its pathway, so some resistance remains (75%). Knocking out G3 would disable its pathway, leading to 50% resistance.

In that case, G2 is the transcription factor because its knockout leads to the most severe phenotype. And G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 because the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 have the same phenotype as g2.

Now, looking at the other double mutant, g1g3: their resistance is 10%. That's worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate, additive pathways. So they each contribute some resistance, but when both are knocked out, the resistance drops much further.

Wait, but when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 pathways are disabled, leading to 0% resistance. So G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

So, the hierarchy is G2 → G1 and G3. So G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.

But wait, in the g1 mutant, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than the wild type? No, the wild type is 100%. So g1 is 75%, which is less than wild type. So without G1, the resistance is lower, implying that G1 is contributing to the resistance.

Similarly, without G3, resistance is 50%, which is worse than without G1.

So perhaps G3's function is more critical than G1's.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%—much lower than either. So the combined effect is worse than either.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway, and knocking both out makes it much worse.

But wait, if G2 is the TF upstream of both, then knocking out G2 would disable both, leading to 0% resistance. Which matches the data.

Wait, but in the g1g3 case, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than both, but not as bad as when G2 is knocked out.

So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in a separate pathway that's additive to the pathway controlled by G2.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this by considering each option and see which fits.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, if G1 is the TF, then knocking G1 would have the most severe phenotype. But in the data, g2 is the most severe, with 0%. So option A doesn't fit because the data suggests G2 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, same promoter? That would mean G1 and G3 are co-regulated, perhaps. Not sure. If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the double mutant g1g3 would have the same phenotype as the worse of the two. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So if G3 were epistatic, then the phenotype might be the same as G3's (50%) or worse than G1's (75%) but in the data it's 10%, which is worse than both. So perhaps this option isn't correct.

Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. So G1 and G3 have multiple effects. But in this context, I'm not sure. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the double mutant g1g3 would have the same phenotype as the worse of the two. But in the data, it's worse than either, so maybe that's not the case.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy is when two genes perform the same function. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking both out would have a worse effect than either alone. That fits with the data: g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either (75% and 50%). So if they are redundant, their combined knockout would have a more severe phenotype.

But wait, what about the other double mutants? Let's see.

If G2 is the transcription factor, then its knockout would disable any downstream genes. So in the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% (same as g2). So G2 is epistatic to G1, which fits with G2 being upstream.

g2g3: 0% (same as g2), so G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

g1g3: 10% (worse than either), which suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway, perhaps as redundant genes.

So option D says that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the g1g3 double mutant, the phenotype would be the same as the more severe of the two.

But in the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. Their double is 10%, which is worse than both. So if G1 is epistatic, the double mutant would have the same as G1 or G3, whichever is worse. But here, it's worse, so perhaps that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting epistatic relationships wrong.

Epistasis refers to the position of a gene in a pathway. If Gene A is epistatic to Gene B, it means that the pathway flows through A to B. So, the pathway is B → A. Because when you have a mutation in A, the pathway is blocked whether B is functioning or not.

So, if you have a double mutant of A and B, the phenotype is the same as the mutant with the earlier gene (A), because the pathway is blocked at A.

In this problem, the data shows that the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 have the same phenotype as g2. So, that suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because in g1g2, the phenotype is same as g2; same with g2g3.

So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, meaning G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3.

Wait no, because if G2 is epistatic, it would be downstream. So the pathway would be G1 → G2 and G3 → G2. That way, knocking out G2 blocks both pathways.

But then how about the g1g3 mutant? Their resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. That suggests that both G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway, but perhaps in a redundant or additive way.

So, the model would be:

G1 and G3 are in one pathway that contributes to resistance, and G2 is in another pathway. But when G2 is knocked out, the other pathway can't function, leading to 0% resistance. But that doesn't fit because in the g1g3 double mutant, G2 is still present, leading to 10% resistance.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe another approach would help.

Let me think about the possible hierarchy:

If G2 is a transcription factor (TF) that activates G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would prevent both G1 and G3 from being expressed. However, in the data, the g1 mutant is 75% resistance, which is higher than g2 (0%). So, if G2 activates G1, then in the g1 mutant, G2 is still active and perhaps can activate G3. But the g1 mutant is 75%, and g3 is 50%, so maybe G3 is more dependent on G2.

Wait, maybe G2 is the TF that activates both G1 and G3. Then in the g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to no resistance (0%). But in the g1 mutant, G2 and G3 are expressed. G3 contributes to 50% resistance. But in the data, the g1 mutant is 75%. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is not regulated by G2. So G2 is the TF for G3, but G1 is controlled by another factor.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the TF for G3, and G1 is not downstream. Then, g2 knockout would disable G3, leading to 0% resistance. But the data shows that g3 is 50% resistant. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, in the data, g3 is 50% resistance. So, when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is halved. So G3 contributes to resistance but isn't the only component.

So, maybe G3 is downstream of G2, and G1 is another component that's not regulated by G2.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, both activated by G2.

So, G2 is the TF upstream of both G1 and G3. So knocking out G2 would disable both pathways, leading to 0% resistance. Knocking out G1 would leave G3 to contribute 50% resistance, but wait, in the data, g1 is 75% resistance. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is upstream of G3, and G1 is in a separate pathway. So knocking G2 would disable G3's pathway, but G1's pathway can still function, leading to some resistance.

In that case, let's look at the data:

g1: 75% resistance. So G1's pathway contributes 75% resistance when G2 is present. But when G2 is knocked out (g2), resistance is 0%. So perhaps G2 is not involved in G1's pathway. That complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is in a separate pathway from G2 and G3. So G2 is the TF for G3, and G1 is a separate gene that contributes to resistance.

So, when G2 is knocked out, G3 can't function, leading to 0% resistance. But when G1 is knocked out, the other pathway (G2 and G3) can still function, leading to 75% resistance.

Wait, but then in g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. So G3's pathway is gone, and G1's is also gone. So what's left? Maybe some other pathway contributes 10% resistance.

Hmm, but this is getting too speculative.

Looking back at the options, maybe option C or D.

Option C says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. But in this context, perhaps G1 and G3 affect resistance but also other traits. Not sure if that's relevant here.

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other. So knocking both out would have a more severe effect than either alone. Which matches the data, as g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than both.

But if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the double mutant g1g3 would have the same phenotype as G1's mutant (75%) or worse than G3 (50%). But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse than both. So that would suggest that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, but their combined knockout makes the resistance much worse.

Wait, but if they are redundant, then knocking out both would have a more severe effect than either, which fits. So in a redundant system, each gene can do the same job, so knocking both out removes all redundancy, leading to a more severe phenotype.

So, in this case, the data suggests that G1 and G3 are redundant. So their combined knockout makes the resistance much worse than either alone.

So, looking back at the options, option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But wait, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the phenotype of g1g3 would be same as the worse of the two. But in the data, it's worse than both, implying perhaps that they are additive, not redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps gene redundancy means that each gene contributes some function, and both are necessary for full resistance, but knocking out both leads to more severe resistance loss.

Wait, another angle: the presence of G2 affects G1 and G3. So in wild type, G2 is active and both G1 and G3 are expressed. If G2 is a TF, then in g2 mutant, G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

But in the data, the g1 mutant is 75% resistance. So, in the absence of G1, G2 and G3 are present and active. So perhaps G3 contributes to 50% of the resistance, and G1 contributes another 25%, bringing the total to 75% when G1 is present. So, if G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 50% (from G3), but the data says g1 is 75%. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G2 is upstream of both. But without G2, the pathway is blocked, leading to 0% resistance. Without G1, the pathway is partially functional, leading to some resistance.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway downstream of G2.

So, G2 → G1 → G3, or G2 → G3 → another gene.

But this is getting too vague.

Let me try to see which option aligns with the data.

The data points:

- g2 is 0%. So G2 is critical.

- All double mutants involving G2 (g1g2, g2g3) are 0%. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

So G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3? No, wait, it's the opposite. If G2 is downstream, then the presence of G2's function is necessary for the pathway to proceed.

Wait, no, because if G2 is epistatic (meaning downstream), the presence of a mutation in G2 masks the effect of mutations upstream (like G1 or G3). So if G2 is downstream, then knocking it out would lead to the same phenotype as knocking out any gene upstream of it.

So, G2 is the last step in a pathway, so knocking it out would disable the entire pathway. So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, which are upstream.

So, if G2 is the transcription factor, then it's the last step, and all other genes are upstream, meaning their products are necessary for G2's function.

But in the data, the g1 mutant has 75% resistance. So, without G1, there's still 75% resistance. So, G1 is upstream of G2, but without G1, G2 is still functional enough to provide some resistance.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because if G2 is the transcription factor, then without G1, G2 should still be active, but perhaps G1 is part of a different pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a pathway that is parallel to G2's pathway. So, both G2 and G1/G3 contribute to the overall resistance.

In that case, G2 is a transcription factor activating a major pathway, while G1 and G3 are in another pathway. So, knocking out G2 would disable its pathway, but the other pathway (G1 and G3) would still contribute. But in the data, the g2 mutant is 0%, which suggests that without G2, no resistance. So that can't be.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option A: G1 is TF. But g2 is 0%, which is worse than g1 (75%). So G2's knockout is worse than G1's, which doesn't fit if G1 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 have same promoter (so maybe co-regulated). G3 is epistatic to G1. So, if G3 is epistatic, then in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be same as the worse of G1 and G3. But the data says 10%, worse than either. So this doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. G1 is epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy would mean G1 affects multiple traits, not just resistance. Not sure. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the double mutant would have phenotype of G1 or G3, whichever is worse. But data is worse than both. So this doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. G1 is epistatic to G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that both G1 and G3 can perform the same function. So, knocking out both would lead to a more severe phenotype than either alone. That fits with the data for g1g3 (10% < 50% and 75%). 

But does G1 being epistatic to G3 fit? If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the double mutant would have the same phenotype as the more severe of the two. Since g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, the double would be 50% if G3 is epistatic, or 75% if G1 is epistatic. But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse than both. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the concept of epistasis here.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic to G3, their pathways are in a linear order, like G3 → G1. So, if G1 is knocked out, the pathway is blocked regardless of G3's state. So in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be same as g1 (75%). But in the data, it's 10%, which is less than 75%. So that would suggest that G3 is epistatic to G1, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Let's think in terms of the pathway.

If the pathway is G3 → G1 → resistance.

Then, knocking out G1 would block the pathway, leading to no resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is some resistance. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if the pathway is G1 → G3 → resistance. Then, knocking out G1 would prevent G3 from being expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But data says g1 is 75%, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, both contributing to resistance. So, knocking either one out reduces resistance, and knocking both out reduces it further.

In that model, the double mutant g1g3 would have the sum of both losses, leading to 10% (since 75% + 50% isn't additive; that's not how percentages work. Oh, wait, perhaps it's multiplicative. 75% is 3/4, 50% is 1/2. If both contribute, perhaps 3/4 * 1/2 = 3/8 = 37.5%, but the data is 10%. So that's not matching.)

Alternatively, maybe each contributes 25% and 25%, so together 50%, but the data is 10%, which doesn't fit.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for which option correctly identifies the hierarchy.

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the pathway is G3 → G1. So knocking out G1 would block the pathway, making the phenotype same as if G3 is knocked out (g3 is 50%, but in reality, g1 is 75%). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is upstream of G3.

So, if G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean G1 is downstream, which doesn't fit because the data shows that g1 has higher resistance than g3.

Wait, no, G1 as being downstream would mean that the pathway is G3 → G1. So knocking out G3 would prevent G1 from being expressed. But in the data, g3 is 50%, and g1 is 75%, which suggests that G1's function is more critical, but without G3, the resistance is worse than without G1. So perhaps G1 is upstream of G3.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Another approach: suppose G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream.

In the wild type, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed.

- g2: G2 is knocked out → no expression of G1 and G3 → 0% resistance.

- g1: G1 is knocked out → G2 and G3 are still active. If G3 contributes 50% resistance, then why is g1 at 75%? That suggests that G1 contributes 25% resistance.

Wait, no. If G1 is knocked out, but G3 is active, then the resistance would be determined by G3's contribution. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So perhaps G1 contributes more than G3.

Wait, but that doesn't add up. If G1 is knocked out, and G3 is still active, then why is resistance higher than when G3 is knocked out?

Hmm, perhaps the model is that G1's pathway is more effective than G3's. So, without G1, the resistance is still higher than without G3.

This is getting too confusing. Let me try to think about what each option implies.

Option D: G2 is the transcription factor. G1 and G3 are redundant. G1 is epistatic to G3.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would have a worse effect than either alone. So, in g1g3, 10% is worse than 75% and 50%, which fits.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the double mutant, the phenotype would be same as G1's mutant (75%) or worse than G3's mutant (50%). But the data shows 10%, which is worse than both. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the term 'epistatic towards' in the option doesn't mean that the double mutant's phenotype is the same as the more severe single mutant, but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the hierarchy is that G3 is downstream of G1. So, G1 controls G3. If that's the case, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which could be lower than either because in addition to G1's knockout, G3 is also knocked out (but if G3 is downstream of G1, then G3's knockout wouldn't add anything beyond G1's knockout, unless G3 has another function).

Hmm.

Maybe the best way is to pick the option that correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, leading to the conclusion that G2 is downstream.

Wait, but earlier data suggested that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, meaning it's downstream.

So, the correct option should state that G2 is the TF, and that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because G2's data is worse.

Option B: G2 is TF. So possible.

Option C: G2 is TF. Possible.

Option D: G2 is TF. Possible.

So options B, C, D have G2 as TF.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

g1g3 is 10%. So, in the absence of both G1 and G3, resistance is very low.

If G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and are redundant, then their combined knockout would lead to a worse phenotype than either alone. Which fits.

So, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which would fit with g1g3 being much worse.

Now, the epistasis part.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, in the double mutant, the phenotype would be same as G1's. But the data shows it's worse than both, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the epistatic relationship in option D refers to G1 being upstream of G3. So, G1 is epistatic to G3. So, the pathway is G3 → G1. So, if G1 is knocked out, the pathway is blocked regardless of G3.

But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. So if G1 is downstream of G3, then knocking out G1 would prevent the pathway from working, leading to lower resistance than G3's. But the data shows higher resistance in g1 than g3. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the pathway is G1 → G3. So, G1 is upstream of G3. If G1 is knocked out, then G3 can't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75%, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the pathway is that G2 activates both G1 and G3, which are in separate pathways.

So, G2 is the TF. G1 is in one pathway, G3 in another.

In the g1 mutant, G3's pathway is active, contributing 50% resistance. But data shows g1 is 75%. So that suggests that G1's pathway is more important.

Wait, but G1's knockout leads to higher resistance than G3's. So perhaps G1's pathway contributes more.

But this is getting too speculative.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I'll have to make an educated guess.

The data shows that G2 is the most critical gene. So it's likely the transcription factor.

The double mutants involving G2 have the same phenotype as G2 alone, indicating G2 is epistatic to the others.

Among the options, options B, C, and D have G2 as TF.

Option D says G1 and G3 are redundant, which fits with the g1g3 double mutant.

So, option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, but the epistatic part might not fit. But given the options, this seems the most plausible.

Alternatively, option A is wrong because G1 isn't the TF. Option B's gene redundancy part may not fit. Hmm.

After considering all the points, I think the best answer is option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the double mutant g1g3's 10% is worse than either, which fits with redundancy. So, option D's first part is correct.

The epistasis part in option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the double mutant, the phenotype is worse than both, which suggests additive or redundant effects, not epistatic.

So perhaps option D's statement about epistasis is incorrect.

Looking back, I think the correct epistatic relationship is that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, since the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 have the same phenotype as g2.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, meaning it's downstream.

But in the options, none of them directly state this. Let's read the options again.

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. But what about G3? The data shows g2g3 is 0%, same as g2.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but no, because option A says G1 is the TF, which isn't the case.

Wait, the options are:

A) G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

B) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 share promoter (same regulation), G3 is epistatic to G1.

C) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

D) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Given that, the correct option must have G2 as TF, and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, none of them directly say that G2 is epistatic to both. But options B, C, D have G2 as TF.

Option B says G3 is epistatic to G1. That would mean that the double mutant g1g3 would have the same phenotype as g3 (50%). But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse. So option B isn't correct.

Option C says G1 is epistatic to G3. So the double mutant would have the same phenotype as G1 (75%). But data says 10%, so this isn't correct.

Option D says G1 is epistatic to G3. Same issue as above.

Wait, none of the options correctly capture the fact that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not fully confident.

Another approach: think of epistatic as which gene is downstream. So if G2 is downstream, then it's epistatic to any upstream genes.

So, in option D, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant, which makes sense.

But the statement about G1 being epistatic to G3 isn't supported by the data. Because the double mutant is worse than either.

Hmm.

I think the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Additionally, G1 and G3 are redundant. So the correct option would be the one stating that G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

But looking at the options, none of them mention both G1 and G3 being epistatic to G2.

Wait, option D says: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But if G1 is epistatic to G3, then g1g3 would have the same phenotype as G1 (75%), but the data shows 10%. So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than both. This suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but are not redundant—they might be additive. So each contributes some part of the resistance, and both are needed for full resistance.

In that case, their combined knockout leads to much lower resistance.

But in terms of epistasis, perhaps G2 is the only one that's epistatic to others.

After all this, I think the correct option is D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about the epistatic part. Maybe I should conclude that option D is correct.


The experiment investigates the role of three genes (G1, G2, and G3) in anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The data shows resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to determine the gene interactions and hierarchy based on the resistance phenotypes. The key observations and conclusions are as follows:

1. **G2 is the most critical gene**: The g2 mutant has 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is essential for resistance. This suggests that G2 is likely the transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of other genes.

2. **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**: The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both show 0% resistance, the same as g2. This indicates that G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3, and its knockout masks the effects of G1 and G3 mutations.

3. **G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not fully independent**: The single mutants g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) show partial resistance, suggesting that both genes contribute to resistance but are not as critical as G2. The double mutant g1g3 shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

4. **Interpretation of epistasis**: The option states that G1 is epistatic to G3. If this were true, the double mutant g1g3 would have the same phenotype as the more severe single mutant (g3, 50%). However, the data shows that g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than both single mutants. This suggests that G1 and G3 are not strictly epistatic but may act in a redundant or additive manner.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. G1 is not the transcription factor, as g2 shows 0% resistance, indicating G2 is the critical gene.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While G2 is the TF, the claim that G3 is epistatic to G1 is inconsistent with the data. The double mutant g1g3 shows 10%, which is worse than either single mutant, not the same as g3 (50%).
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While G2 is the TF, the claim that G1 and G3 show pleiotropy is not supported by the data. Pleiotropy refers to genes affecting multiple traits, which is not evident here.
- **Option D**: Partially correct. G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, as their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype (10%) than either single mutant. However, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than both single mutants.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible interpretation is that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype. However, the claim about G1 being epistatic to G3 in Option D is not fully supported by the data. Despite this, Option D is the closest to the observed data compared to the other options.
