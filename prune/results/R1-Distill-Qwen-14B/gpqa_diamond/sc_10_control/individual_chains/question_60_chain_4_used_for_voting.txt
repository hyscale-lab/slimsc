Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, so there's this advanced civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a spacecraft that can travel at a speed of 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The aliens have an average lifetime of about 150 solar years. They're aiming for Earth. The question is about how long the journey would take from the astronaut's perspective, specifically a 22-year-old astronaut. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember this has to do with special relativity, specifically time dilation. Because when you're moving at speeds close to the speed of light, time passes differently for you compared to someone back on Earth. So there's the concept of proper time and the time measured in the moving frame versus the stationary frame.

Wait, the astronaut is the one on the spacecraft, so their frame of reference is the moving one. The proper time (the time they experience) is shorter than the coordinate time (the time measured from Earth's frame). Because from Earth's perspective, the spacecraft is moving, so the distance to Earth would be contracted. Or wait, no, it's the other way around. Let me think.

Oh right, the distance between the starting point (Large Magellanic Cloud) and Earth would be large, but from the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted because of their high speed. So the time they experience would be less than what someone watching from Earth would think.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, let's clarify. Proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. So for the astronaut, the journey is happening in their frame, so the time they experience is the proper time. The Earth would observe a longer time because of time dilation.

Wait, no, no, wait. I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline the problem.

The distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud: I think the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. But I'm not exactly sure; maybe it's 170,000 or so. But the exact number might not be needed here because the question is about the astronaut's experienced time, which is their proper time.

So the key is to calculate the proper time for the journey, considering the effects of time dilation and length contraction.

Wait, when the spacecraft is moving at a high speed v relative to Earth, the distance as measured by the astronaut is length-contracted. So the distance they have to travel is less than what Earth measures. So the time they experience would be (contracted distance) / (their speed). But wait, from the astronaut's perspective, Earth is moving towards them at speed v, so the distance is contracted.

Alternatively, using the Lorentz factor gamma (γ) to account for time dilation. The proper time τ is related to the coordinate time t by τ = t / γ, where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but maybe it's better to compute the proper time using the formula for time experienced in the moving frame. Hmm.

Wait, the spacecraft is moving at v = 0.99999987c. Let me compute gamma (γ) first. Because gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v is 0.99999987c, so v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2, which is approximately (1 - 3e-7)^2. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-6, because 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013, which is 1.3e-7. Wait, no, wait: 0.99999987 is 1 - (1.3e-7), right? Wait, 1e-6 is 0.000001. 1.3e-7 is 0.00000013.

So v² is (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. Since (1.3e-7)^2 is negligible, we can approximate v² ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-7. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute that.

Wait, sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5. Wait, 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2. Hmm.

Wait, 2.6e-7 is 2.6 * 1e-7. The square root of 2.6 is about 1.612. So sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 1.612e-3.5. But 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4 (since 1e-3 is 0.001, 1e-4 is 0.0001, so 1e-3.5 is about 0.000316). So 1.612e-3.5 is approximately 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

So gamma = 1 / (5.09e-4) ≈ 1965. So gamma is approximately 1965.

Wait, that's a very high gamma. So the time experienced by the astronaut is much shorter than the Earth's frame.

But what's the proper time? The proper time τ is given by τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

But wait, let me think about the distance. From Earth's frame, the distance is D. So the time for the journey is t_earth = D / v. Because the spacecraft is moving at speed v. So t_earth = D/(0.99999987c).

But from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted. So the contracted distance is L = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D / gamma. So the time experienced by the astronaut is τ = L / v = (D / gamma) / v = D/(v gamma) = t_earth / gamma.

So either way, the astronaut's proper time is t_earth / gamma.

Alternatively, using the formula for proper time in special relativity.

Wait, the proper time τ is the time experienced by the astronaut. So the formula is τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

So I need to find t_earth first. But wait, I don't know the exact distance D between Earth and the LMC. Let me think. The LMC is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So D ≈ 163,000 ly.

So t_earth = D / v. Since v ≈ 0.99999987c, so t_earth ≈ (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ (163,000 / 0.99999987) years. Wait, because 1 ly at c takes 1 year. So t_earth ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1 / ~1) ≈ 163,000 years. Wait, that can't be right because 0.99999987 is very close to 1, so it's almost 163,000 years.

Wait, but no, wait. Let me compute 1 / 0.99999987.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-6. So 1 / (1 - x) ≈ 1 + x when x is small. So 1/(0.99999987) ≈ 1 + 1.3e-6 ≈ 1.0000013. So t_earth ≈ 163,000 * 1.0000013 ≈ 163,000 + (163,000 * 1.3e-6) ≈ 163,000 + 0.2119 ≈ 163,000.212 years.

So t_earth ≈ ~163,000 years.

So the proper time τ is t_earth / gamma. We had gamma ≈ 1965.

So τ ≈ 163,000 / 1965 ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 163,000 by 1965. Let's see: 1965 * 80 = 157,200. 163,000 - 157,200 = 5,800. 5,800 / 1965 ≈ 2.95. So total is about 82.95 years. So approximately 83 years.

Wait, but the options are 72, 77, 81, etc. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, let me recheck gamma.

v = 0.99999987c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 = approx 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ let's calculate this more accurately.

sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5.

sqrt(2.6) is approximately 1.612, and 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. So gamma is 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1968. So gamma is approximately 1968.

So with gamma about 1968, then τ = t_earth / 1968 ≈ 163,000 / 1968 ≈ let's compute this.

163,000 divided by 1968.

Let me compute 1968 * 80 = 157,440.

Subtracting from 163,000: 163,000 - 157,440 = 5,560.

Now, 5,560 / 1968 ≈ 2.828.

So τ ≈ 80 + 2.828 ≈ 82.828 years. So about 83 years.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C) 81 years, D) 77 years. Wait, 83 isn't an option. The options are B)72, C)81, D)77, A) astronaut dies.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the distance.

Wait, I assumed D is 163,000 light-years, but perhaps the actual distance is different. Let me double-check.

The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. The distance is about 160,000 to 170,000 light-years. Let me average at about 165,000 light-years.

So D = 165,000 ly.

t_earth = D / v = 165,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 165,000 * 1.0000013 ≈ 165,000 + (165,000 * 1.3e-6) ≈ 165,000 + 0.2145 ≈ 165,000.2145 years.

Then τ = t_earth / gamma = 165000.2145 / 1968 ≈ let's compute.

1968 * 83 = let's see: 80 *1968 = 157,440. 3 *1968=5,904. So 83 *1968=157,440 +5,904=163,344.

Wait, D is 165,000, so 163,344 is less than D. So 83 gives 163,344, which is under. The difference is 165,000 -163,344 =1,656.

So 1,656 /1968 ≈ 0.839.

So 83 + 0.839 ≈ 83.839 years. So approximately 83.8 years.

Wait, but the options don't have 83. Hmm. The closest option is C) 81, but that's 2.8 years off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me compute gamma precisely.

v = 0.99999987c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.999999740... So 1 - v² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

Then sqrt(1 - v²) = sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) = approx 5.099e-4.

So gamma = 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1962. So gamma is approximately 1962.

Then τ = 165000 / 1962 ≈ let's compute 165000 /1962.

1962 * 80 = 156,960.

165000-156960=8040.

8040 /1962 ≈ 4.086.

So τ ≈ 80 +4.086=84.086 years. So about 84 years.

Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are 72, 77, 81, die.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the distance to the LMC but the distance to Earth. Oh wait, the LMC is much farther, so if the spacecraft is traveling from the LMC to Earth, then D is about 160k ly.

But wait, the problem says "their destination in mind, they are determined to travel... to Earth." So Earth is the destination, so the distance is 163,000 ly.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old. So the question is, how old will he be when he arrives? So 84 years would make him 22 +84=106 years old. But the average lifetime is 150 years, so he would live to 106, which is possible. So he wouldn't die before reaching Earth.

But the options don't have 84. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different distance, like the distance to the Andromeda galaxy or something else, but no, the question says LMC, which is much closer than Andromeda.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 0.99999987c, which is an extremely high speed, so gamma is quite large, but perhaps I miscalculated gamma.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for proper time experienced by the astronaut, which is τ = (D / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or since from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted.

Wait, okay, from the perspective of the astronaut, the distance is D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So D' = D / gamma.

So the time they experience is τ = D' / v = (D / gamma) / v = D/(v gamma) = (D/v) * (1/gamma) = t_earth / gamma.

So same as before.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute this more accurately. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

v =0.99999987c.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999974.

1 - v²/c² = 0.00000026.

sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) = approx 5.099e-4.

gamma = 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1962.

So back to t_earth: D is 163,000 ly.

t_earth = 163,000 / (0.99999987) ≈ 163,000 * 1.0000013 ≈ 163,000.212 years.

tau = t_earth / gamma = 163,000.212 / 1962 ≈ let me compute that.

Compute 163,000 / 1962.

1962 times 80 is 156,960. Subtract from 163,000: 163,000 - 156,960 = 6,040.

6,040 /1962 ≈ approx 3.07 years.

So 80 + 3.07 = 83.07 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 83 years.

But options don't include that. Hmm. Wait, the closest option is C)81, but that's 2 years off.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the average lifetime is 150 years, but the astronaut is 22. So 22 +83=105, which is under 150, so he would survive. So the correct answer would be that it takes about 83 years, but no option is exactly that.

Wait, perhaps the distance is shorter. If the astronaut is from the LMC, which is about 160,000 ly away, but maybe the problem is using a different distance. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is expecting to use a different formula, like the time experienced is t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), not t_earth / gamma. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the proper time can be found using the formula τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

So t_earth is 163,000 / (0.99999987) ≈ 163,000 years.

So τ = 163000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) ≈ 163000 * 5.099e-4 ≈ 163000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 83.0 years.

Same as before.

So the proper time is about 83 years. So the astronaut would be 22 +83=105 years old upon arrival.

But none of the options have 83. So perhaps I made a mistake in the distance.

Wait, the LMC might be about 160,000 ly away, but perhaps the problem is assuming a different distance, like the distance to the center of the galaxy, which is about 25,000 ly. No, that's not right. The LMC is much further.

Wait, maybe the speed is 0.99999987c, which is 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Let me compute gamma for that speed.

Let me compute 1 - v^2 more accurately.

v = 0.99999987

v^2 = 0.99999974000009 (approx).

So 1 - v^2 = 1 - 0.99999974000009 = 0.00000025999991.

Taking the square root of that: sqrt(0.00000025999991) = sqrt(2.5999991e-7) ≈ approximately 5.099e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1962.

So, same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is assuming that the speed is so high that the distance is effectively zero, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another approach: maybe the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c, so the time experienced is D/(v * gamma). Wait, that's the same as before. So I'm back to the same place.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the time experienced as t_earth * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), which is again the same as proper time.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately. Let me compute gamma exactly.

v = 0.99999987.

Compute 1 - v²: 1 - (0.99999987)^2.

Let me compute v²:

0.99999987^2 = ?

Well, (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b².

Let a = 1, b = 1.3e-7.

So (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2.

= 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14.

So 1 - v² ≈ 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - v²) = sqrt(2.6e-7) = 5.099e-4.

Gamma = 1/5.099e-4 ≈ 1962.

So, same result.

Hmm, so why the answer isn't matching the options. The options don't have 83. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years

So 83 is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the distance is much smaller. Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the LMC but another location. The question says the civilization is in the LMC, so D is about 160,000 ly.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic velocity addition formula or something else. Or perhaps the distance is the distance to the Andromeda galaxy, but that's about 2.5 million ly, which would make the time even longer. No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem. The question says the astronaut is 22 years old, and we're to find the time from his perspective. So the proper time is about 83 years, so he would be 105 upon arrival. So option A says he will die before reaching Earth (since his average lifetime is 150, 105 is less than that, so he would live). So option A is incorrect.

The other options are 72,77,81 years. My calculation is about 83, which is closest to option C) 81, but it's a bit off. Perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the speed is given as 0.99999987 c, but the exact value leads to a lower gamma. Let me compute v again.

Wait, maybe I should compute 1 - v squared more accurately.

v = 0.99999987.

Compute v^2:

0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Let me compute this without approximation.

0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7.

So v^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2.6e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2.

(1.3e-7)^2 = 1.69e-14, which is negligible.

So v^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - v^2 = 2.6e-7.

sqrt(2.6e-7) = 5.099e-4.

Gamma is 1962.

So, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approximation. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Compute 2.6e-7 = 0.00000026.

sqrt(0.00000026) = 0.0005099 approximately.

So gamma is 1/0.0005099 = 1962.7.

So more precisely, gamma ≈ 1963.

Thus, tau = 163,000 / 1963 ≈ 163,000 /1963.

Let me compute: 1963 *83 = 163,  let's compute 1963 *80=157,040; 1963 *3=5,889. So 83 *1963 = 157,040 +5,889=162,929.

So 162,929 is less than 163,000 by 71. So 83 + (71 /1963) ≈83 +0.036≈83.036 years.

So about 83.04 years.

So none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is 83, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the time from Earth's frame, but that can't be. From the astronaut's perspective, the time is shorter.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the distance is just the distance to the LMC as 163,000 ly, but the speed is so high that time experienced is negligible. Hmm, no, 0.99999987c is very close to c, but not by a negligible amount.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for time as t = D/(v), but without considering relativity. So, from Earth's frame, the time is about 163,000 years, but the astronaut's time is t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²). So 163,000 * 5.099e-4 ≈83 years.

Same result.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 2000, but that would give 163,000 /2000=81.5 years, which is 81.5, close to option C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is 150,000 ly, which would give 150,000/1962≈76.4 years. Which is close to option D)77.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the distance as 150,000 ly. So let me compute that.

If D = 150,000 ly, t_earth=150,000 /0.99999987 ≈150,000 *1.0000013 ≈150,000.195 years.

tau =150,000.195 /1962≈ 76.4 years.

So that would be approximately 76 years, close to option D)77.

But why would the problem use 150,000 ly as the distance? The actual LMC is about 160,000 ly away.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Let me think about the time experienced from the astronaut's frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using length contraction but in a different way. From the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted by gamma. So L = D / gamma.

So time is L / v = (D / gamma) / v = D/(v gamma) = t_earth / gamma.

Same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the astronaut's speed is so high that the distance is effectively zero, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the time experienced as (D/(v)) * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), which is the same as tau.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the time dilation factor, not the distance contraction. But no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute v as a fraction of c and compute the exact gamma.

v =0.99999987c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999974000009.

So 1 - v² = 0.00000025999991.

sqrt(0.00000025999991) = approx 0.0005099.

Gamma = 1/0.0005099 ≈1962.

So, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the average lifetime as a hint. The astronaut has an average lifetime of 150 years, but he is 22 now. So with an experienced time of 83 years, he would be 105, which is under 150, so he'd live.

So, the correct answer would be that he doesn't die, so option A is incorrect, and the experienced time is 83 years, but none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)81, which is the closest to 83.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma, and the actual gamma is higher.

Wait, let's compute gamma more precisely.

Compute gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/sqrt(2.5999991e-7) = approx 1/5.099e-4 ≈ 1962.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, considering the relativistic velocity, but perhaps the calculation is meant to be approximate.

So, with gamma around 2000, and D = 163,000 ly, tau = 163,000 /2000 ≈81.5 years, which is 81.5, close to option C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes the distance is 160,000 ly, leading to 160,000/1962≈81.46 years, which is 81.46, close to 81.

So perhaps the intended answer is option C)81.

But wait, let me compute 160,000 /1962.

1962 * 81 = 1962 *80=156,960; 1962 *1=1,962. So total 158,922.

160,000 -158,922=1,078.

1,078 /1962 ≈0.549.

So 81.549 years. So about 81.5 years.

So option C is 81 years, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be around 81 years, so option C.

So the astronaut would experience about 81 years. So the correct answer is option C.

But wait, according to my precise calculations, it's about 83. So why the discrepancy? I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for gamma. Let me compute 1 - v² again.

v =0.99999987.

v squared is (0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999974000009.

So 1 - v² = 0.00000025999991.

sqrt(0.00000025999991) = approx 5.099e-4.

Gamma = 1/5.099e-4 = 1962.7.

So, same as before.

So, with D=163,000 ly, tau=163,000/1962.7= approx 83 years.

But the options don't have 83. So perhaps the intended answer is 81, but why?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the distance as 150,000 ly instead of the actual 163,000. So 150,000 /1962= approx76.4 years, which is close to option D)77.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement. The question says "the Large Magellanic Cloud". So I should use the correct distance. Let me look up the exact distance to LMC.

Upon checking, the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away. So the distance is correct.

So, perhaps the intended answer is to compute the proper time as approximately 83 years, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is 81, so option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation without considering the exact gamma, but using an approximate gamma.

Wait, another approach: using a calculator for more precise calculation. Let me compute D/(v gamma).

Wait, D is 163000 ly.

v is 0.99999987c.

gamma is 1962.7.

So, D/(v gamma) = 163000 / (0.99999987 * 1962.7) ≈ 163000 / (1962.699) ≈83.03 years.

So, 83.03 years. But no option matches.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be option A, because the time experienced is 83 years, and the average lifetime is 150, so the astronaut would survive. So option A is incorrect.

So the correct answer is the time experienced is approximately 83 years, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)81, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo in the options.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

B)72 years

C)81 years

D)77 years

So, based on our calculation, the time is about 83, which isn't present. But perhaps the intended answer is 81, so option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Another way: perhaps the proper time is calculated using the equation tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

Which is the same as before.

So, perhaps the intended answer is 81 years, option C.

But wait, given the options, the correct answer based on calculations is approximately 83 years, which isn't listed, but the closest is 81 (option C). So perhaps the answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the direction. Wait, no, the astronaut is moving towards Earth, so the distance is as computed.

Another thought: perhaps the speed is given as 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to c, so the gamma is about 1962, but perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 2000, leading to 163,000/2000=81.5 years, which is 81.5, close to 81, option C.

So perhaps the intended answer is C)81.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is approximately \( D \approx 163,000 \) light-years.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Time in Earth's Frame (\( t_{\text{earth}} \)):**
   The time measured from Earth's frame is:
   \[
   t_{\text{earth}} = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{163,000}{0.99999987} \approx 163,000 \, \text{years}.
   \]

2. **Relativistic Gamma Factor (\( \gamma \)):**
   The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.99999987c \), we find:
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-7}.
   \]
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \approx 5.099 \times 10^{-4}, \quad \gamma \approx \frac{1}{5.099 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1962.
   \]

3. **Proper Time Experienced by the Astronaut (\( \tau \)):**
   The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{t_{\text{earth}}}{\gamma} = \frac{163,000}{1962} \approx 83 \, \text{years}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** "The astronaut will die before reaching Earth."  
  The astronaut's average lifetime is 150 years, and the journey takes approximately 83 years. The astronaut would survive, so this option is incorrect.

- **Option B:** 72 years  
  This is significantly lower than the calculated proper time of 83 years. This option is incorrect.

- **Option C:** 81 years  
  This is very close to the calculated proper time of 83 years. Given the approximations and potential rounding in the problem, this is the most reasonable choice.

- **Option D:** 77 years  
  This is also lower than the calculated proper time and is less accurate than option C. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The astronaut's proper time for the journey is approximately 83 years, but since this value is not listed, the closest option is **81 years**.

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, so there's this advanced civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a spacecraft that can travel at a speed of 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The aliens have an average lifetime of about 150 solar years. They're aiming for Earth. The question is about how long the journey would take from the astronaut's perspective, specifically a 22-year-old astronaut. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember this has to do with special relativity, specifically time dilation. Because when you're moving at speeds close to the speed of light, time passes differently for you compared to someone back on Earth. So there's the concept of proper time and the time measured in the moving frame versus the stationary frame.

Wait, the astronaut is the one on the spacecraft, so their frame of reference is the moving one. The proper time (the time they experience) is shorter than the coordinate time (the time measured from Earth's frame). Because from Earth's perspective, the spacecraft is moving, so the distance to Earth would be contracted. Or wait, no, it's the other way around. Let me think.

Oh right, the distance between the starting point (Large Magellanic Cloud) and Earth would be large, but from the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted because of their high speed. So the time they experience would be less than what someone watching from Earth would think.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, let's clarify. Proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. So for the astronaut, the journey is happening in their frame, so the time they experience is the proper time. The Earth would observe a longer time because of time dilation.

Wait, no, no, wait. I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline the problem.

The distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud: I think the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. But I'm not exactly sure; maybe it's 170,000 or so. But the exact number might not be needed here because the question is about the astronaut's experienced time, which is their proper time.

So the key is to calculate the proper time for the journey, considering the effects of time dilation and length contraction.

Wait, when the spacecraft is moving at a high speed v relative to Earth, the distance as measured by the astronaut is length-contracted. So the distance they have to travel is less than what Earth measures. So the time they experience would be (contracted distance) / (their speed). But wait, from the astronaut's perspective, Earth is moving towards them at speed v, so the distance is contracted.

Alternatively, using the Lorentz factor gamma (γ) to account for time dilation. The proper time τ is related to the coordinate time t by τ = t / γ, where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but maybe it's better to compute the proper time using the formula for time experienced in the moving frame. Hmm.

Wait, the spacecraft is moving at v = 0.99999987c. Let me compute gamma (γ) first. Because gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v is 0.99999987c, so v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2, which is approximately (1 - 3e-7)^2. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-6, because 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013, which is 1.3e-7. Wait, no, wait: 0.99999987 is 1 - (1.3e-7), right? Wait, 1e-6 is 0.000001. 1.3e-7 is 0.00000013.

So v² is (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. Since (1.3e-7)^2 is negligible, we can approximate v² ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-7. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute that.

Wait, sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5. Wait, 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2. Hmm.

Wait, 2.6e-7 is 2.6 * 1e-7. The square root of 2.6 is about 1.612. So sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 1.612e-3.5. But 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4 (since 1e-3 is 0.001, 1e-4 is 0.0001, so 1e-3.5 is about 0.000316). So 1.612e-3.5 is approximately 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

So gamma = 1 / (5.09e-4) ≈ 1965. So gamma is approximately 1965.

Wait, that's a very high gamma. So the time experienced by the astronaut is much shorter than the Earth's frame.

But what's the proper time? The proper time τ is given by τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

But wait, let me think about the distance. From Earth's frame, the distance is D. So the time for the journey is t_earth = D / v. Because the spacecraft is moving at speed v. So t_earth = D/(0.99999987c).

But from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted. So the contracted distance is L = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D / gamma. So the time experienced by the astronaut is τ = L / v = (D / gamma) / v = D/(v gamma) = t_earth / gamma.

So either way, the astronaut's proper time is t_earth / gamma.

Alternatively, using the formula for proper time in special relativity.

Wait, the proper time τ is the time experienced by the astronaut. So the formula is τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

So I need to find t_earth first. But wait, I don't know the exact distance D between Earth and the LMC. Let me think. The LMC is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So D ≈ 163,000 ly.

So t_earth = D / v. Since v ≈ 0.99999987c, so t_earth ≈ (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ (163,000 / 0.99999987) years. Wait, because 1 ly at c takes 1 year. So t_earth ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1 / ~1) ≈ 163,000 years. Wait, that can't be right because 0.99999987 is very close to 1, so it's almost 163,000 years.

Wait, but no, wait. Let me compute 1 / 0.99999987.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-6. So 1 / (1 - x) ≈ 1 + x when x is small. So 1/(0.99999987) ≈ 1 + 1.3e-6 ≈ 1.0000013. So t_earth ≈ 163,000 * 1.0000013 ≈ 163,000 + (163,000 * 1.3e-6) ≈ 163,000 + 0.2119 ≈ 163,000.212 years.

So t_earth ≈ ~163,000 years.

So the proper time τ is t_earth / gamma. We had gamma ≈ 1965.

So τ ≈ 163,000 / 1965 ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 163,000 by 1965. Let's see: 1965 * 80 = 157,200. 163,000 - 157,200 = 5,800. 5,800 / 1965 ≈ 2.95. So total is about 82.95 years. So approximately 83 years.

Wait, but the options are 72, 77, 81, etc. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, let me recheck gamma.

v = 0.99999987c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 = approx 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ let's calculate this more accurately.

sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5.

sqrt(2.6) is approximately 1.612, and 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. So gamma is 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1968. So gamma is approximately 1968.

So with gamma about 1968, then τ = t_earth / 1968 ≈ 163,000 / 1968 ≈ let's compute this.

163,000 divided by 1968.

Let me compute 1968 * 80 = 157,440.

Subtracting from 163,000: 163,000 - 157,440 = 5,560.

Now, 5,560 / 1968 ≈ 2.828.

So τ ≈ 80 + 2.828 ≈ 82.828 years. So about 83 years.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C) 81 years, D) 77 years. Wait, 83 isn't an option. The options are B)72, C)81, D)77, A) astronaut dies.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the distance.

Wait, I assumed D is 163,000 light-years, but perhaps the actual distance is different. Let me double-check.

The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. The distance is about 160,000 to 170,000 light-years. Let me average at about 165,000 light-years.

So D = 165,000 ly.

t_earth = D / v = 165,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 165,000 * 1.0000013 ≈ 165,000 + (165,000 * 1.3e-6) ≈ 165,000 + 0.2145 ≈ 165,000.2145 years.

Then τ = t_earth / gamma = 165000.2145 / 1968 ≈ let's compute.

1968 * 83 = let's see: 80 *1968 = 157,440. 3 *1968=5,904. So 83 *1968=157,440 +5,904=163,344.

Wait, D is 165,000, so 163,344 is less than D. So 83 gives 163,344, which is under. The difference is 165,000 -163,344 =1,656.

So 1,656 /1968 ≈ 0.839.

So 83 + 0.839 ≈ 83.839 years. So approximately 83.8 years.

Wait, but the options don't have 83. Hmm. The closest option is C) 81, but that's 2.8 years off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me compute gamma precisely.

v = 0.99999987c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.999999740... So 1 - v² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

Then sqrt(1 - v²) = sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) = approx 5.099e-4.

So gamma = 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1962. So gamma is approximately 1962.

Then τ = 165000 / 1962 ≈ let's compute 165000 /1962.

1962 * 80 = 156,960.

165000-156960=8040.

8040 /1962 ≈ 4.086.

So τ ≈ 80 +4.086=84.086 years. So about 84 years.

Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are 72, 77, 81, die.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the distance to the LMC but the distance to Earth. Oh wait, the LMC is much farther, so if the spacecraft is traveling from the LMC to Earth, then D is about 160k ly.

But wait, the problem says "their destination in mind, they are determined to travel... to Earth." So Earth is the destination, so the distance is 163,000 ly.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old. So the question is, how old will he be when he arrives? So 84 years would make him 22 +84=106 years old. But the average lifetime is 150 years, so he would live to 106, which is possible. So he wouldn't die before reaching Earth.

But the options don't have 84. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different distance, like the distance to the Andromeda galaxy or something else, but no, the question says LMC, which is much closer than Andromeda.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 0.99999987c, which is an extremely high speed, so gamma is quite large, but perhaps I miscalculated gamma.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for proper time experienced by the astronaut, which is τ = (D / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or since from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted.

Wait, okay, from the perspective of the astronaut, the distance is D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So D' = D / gamma.

So the time they experience is τ = D' / v = (D / gamma) / v = D/(v gamma) = (D/v) * (1/gamma) = t_earth / gamma.

So same as before.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute this more accurately. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

v =0.99999987c.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999974.

1 - v²/c² = 0.00000026.

sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) = approx 5.099e-4.

gamma = 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1962.

So back to t_earth: D is 163,000 ly.

t_earth = 163,000 / (0.99999987) ≈ 163,000 * 1.0000013 ≈ 163,000.212 years.

tau = t_earth / gamma = 163,000.212 / 1962 ≈ let me compute that.

Compute 163,000 / 1962.

1962 times 80 is 156,960. Subtract from 163,000: 163,000 - 156,960 = 6,040.

6,040 /1962 ≈ approx 3.07 years.

So 80 + 3.07 = 83.07 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 83 years.

But options don't include that. Hmm. Wait, the closest option is C)81, but that's 2 years off.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the average lifetime is 150 years, but the astronaut is 22. So 22 +83=105, which is under 150, so he would survive. So the correct answer would be that it takes about 83 years, but no option is exactly that.

Wait, perhaps the distance is shorter. If the astronaut is from the LMC, which is about 160,000 ly away, but maybe the problem is using a different distance. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is expecting to use a different formula, like the time experienced is t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), not t_earth / gamma. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the proper time can be found using the formula τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

So t_earth is 163,000 / (0.99999987) ≈ 163,000 years.

So τ = 163000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) ≈ 163000 * 5.099e-4 ≈ 163000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 83.0 years.

Same as before.

So the proper time is about 83 years. So the astronaut would be 22 +83=105 years old upon arrival.

But none of the options have 83. So perhaps I made a mistake in the distance.

Wait, the LMC might be about 160,000 ly away, but perhaps the problem is assuming a different distance, like the distance to the center of the galaxy, which is about 25,000 ly. No, that's not right. The LMC is much further.

Wait, maybe the speed is 0.99999987c, which is 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Let me compute gamma for that speed.

Let me compute 1 - v^2 more accurately.

v = 0.99999987

v^2 = 0.99999974000009 (approx).

So 1 - v^2 = 1 - 0.99999974000009 = 0.00000025999991.

Taking the square root of that: sqrt(0.00000025999991) = sqrt(2.5999991e-7) ≈ approximately 5.099e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1962.

So, same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is assuming that the speed is so high that the distance is effectively zero, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another approach: maybe the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c, so the time experienced is D/(v * gamma). Wait, that's the same as before. So I'm back to the same place.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the time experienced as t_earth * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), which is again the same as proper time.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately. Let me compute gamma exactly.

v = 0.99999987.

Compute 1 - v²: 1 - (0.99999987)^2.

Let me compute v²:

0.99999987^2 = ?

Well, (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b².

Let a = 1, b = 1.3e-7.

So (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2.

= 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14.

So 1 - v² ≈ 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - v²) = sqrt(2.6e-7) = 5.099e-4.

Gamma = 1/5.099e-4 ≈ 1962.

So, same result.

Hmm, so why the answer isn't matching the options. The options don't have 83. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years

So 83 is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the distance is much smaller. Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the LMC but another location. The question says the civilization is in the LMC, so D is about 160,000 ly.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic velocity addition formula or something else. Or perhaps the distance is the distance to the Andromeda galaxy, but that's about 2.5 million ly, which would make the time even longer. No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem. The question says the astronaut is 22 years old, and we're to find the time from his perspective. So the proper time is about 83 years, so he would be 105 upon arrival. So option A says he will die before reaching Earth (since his average lifetime is 150, 105 is less than that, so he would live). So option A is incorrect.

The other options are 72,77,81 years. My calculation is about 83, which is closest to option C) 81, but it's a bit off. Perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the speed is given as 0.99999987 c, but the exact value leads to a lower gamma. Let me compute v again.

Wait, maybe I should compute 1 - v squared more accurately.

v = 0.99999987.

Compute v^2:

0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Let me compute this without approximation.

0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7.

So v^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2.6e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2.

(1.3e-7)^2 = 1.69e-14, which is negligible.

So v^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - v^2 = 2.6e-7.

sqrt(2.6e-7) = 5.099e-4.

Gamma is 1962.

So, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approximation. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Compute 2.6e-7 = 0.00000026.

sqrt(0.00000026) = 0.0005099 approximately.

So gamma is 1/0.0005099 = 1962.7.

So more precisely, gamma ≈ 1963.

Thus, tau = 163,000 / 1963 ≈ 163,000 /1963.

Let me compute: 1963 *83 = 163,  let's compute 1963 *80=157,040; 1963 *3=5,889. So 83 *1963 = 157,040 +5,889=162,929.

So 162,929 is less than 163,000 by 71. So 83 + (71 /1963) ≈83 +0.036≈83.036 years.

So about 83.04 years.

So none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is 83, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the time from Earth's frame, but that can't be. From the astronaut's perspective, the time is shorter.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the distance is just the distance to the LMC as 163,000 ly, but the speed is so high that time experienced is negligible. Hmm, no, 0.99999987c is very close to c, but not by a negligible amount.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for time as t = D/(v), but without considering relativity. So, from Earth's frame, the time is about 163,000 years, but the astronaut's time is t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²). So 163,000 * 5.099e-4 ≈83 years.

Same result.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 2000, but that would give 163,000 /2000=81.5 years, which is 81.5, close to option C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is 150,000 ly, which would give 150,000/1962≈76.4 years. Which is close to option D)77.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the distance as 150,000 ly. So let me compute that.

If D = 150,000 ly, t_earth=150,000 /0.99999987 ≈150,000 *1.0000013 ≈150,000.195 years.

tau =150,000.195 /1962≈ 76.4 years.

So that would be approximately 76 years, close to option D)77.

But why would the problem use 150,000 ly as the distance? The actual LMC is about 160,000 ly away.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Let me think about the time experienced from the astronaut's frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using length contraction but in a different way. From the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted by gamma. So L = D / gamma.

So time is L / v = (D / gamma) / v = D/(v gamma) = t_earth / gamma.

Same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the astronaut's speed is so high that the distance is effectively zero, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the time experienced as (D/(v)) * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), which is the same as tau.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the time dilation factor, not the distance contraction. But no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute v as a fraction of c and compute the exact gamma.

v =0.99999987c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999974000009.

So 1 - v² = 0.00000025999991.

sqrt(0.00000025999991) = approx 0.0005099.

Gamma = 1/0.0005099 ≈1962.

So, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the average lifetime as a hint. The astronaut has an average lifetime of 150 years, but he is 22 now. So with an experienced time of 83 years, he would be 105, which is under 150, so he'd live.

So, the correct answer would be that he doesn't die, so option A is incorrect, and the experienced time is 83 years, but none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)81, which is the closest to 83.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma, and the actual gamma is higher.

Wait, let's compute gamma more precisely.

Compute gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/sqrt(2.5999991e-7) = approx 1/5.099e-4 ≈ 1962.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, considering the relativistic velocity, but perhaps the calculation is meant to be approximate.

So, with gamma around 2000, and D = 163,000 ly, tau = 163,000 /2000 ≈81.5 years, which is 81.5, close to option C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes the distance is 160,000 ly, leading to 160,000/1962≈81.46 years, which is 81.46, close to 81.

So perhaps the intended answer is option C)81.

But wait, let me compute 160,000 /1962.

1962 * 81 = 1962 *80=156,960; 1962 *1=1,962. So total 158,922.

160,000 -158,922=1,078.

1,078 /1962 ≈0.549.

So 81.549 years. So about 81.5 years.

So option C is 81 years, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be around 81 years, so option C.

So the astronaut would experience about 81 years. So the correct answer is option C.

But wait, according to my precise calculations, it's about 83. So why the discrepancy? I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for gamma. Let me compute 1 - v² again.

v =0.99999987.

v squared is (0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999974000009.

So 1 - v² = 0.00000025999991.

sqrt(0.00000025999991) = approx 5.099e-4.

Gamma = 1/5.099e-4 = 1962.7.

So, same as before.

So, with D=163,000 ly, tau=163,000/1962.7= approx 83 years.

But the options don't have 83. So perhaps the intended answer is 81, but why?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the distance as 150,000 ly instead of the actual 163,000. So 150,000 /1962= approx76.4 years, which is close to option D)77.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement. The question says "the Large Magellanic Cloud". So I should use the correct distance. Let me look up the exact distance to LMC.

Upon checking, the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away. So the distance is correct.

So, perhaps the intended answer is to compute the proper time as approximately 83 years, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is 81, so option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation without considering the exact gamma, but using an approximate gamma.

Wait, another approach: using a calculator for more precise calculation. Let me compute D/(v gamma).

Wait, D is 163000 ly.

v is 0.99999987c.

gamma is 1962.7.

So, D/(v gamma) = 163000 / (0.99999987 * 1962.7) ≈ 163000 / (1962.699) ≈83.03 years.

So, 83.03 years. But no option matches.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be option A, because the time experienced is 83 years, and the average lifetime is 150, so the astronaut would survive. So option A is incorrect.

So the correct answer is the time experienced is approximately 83 years, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)81, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo in the options.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

B)72 years

C)81 years

D)77 years

So, based on our calculation, the time is about 83, which isn't present. But perhaps the intended answer is 81, so option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Another way: perhaps the proper time is calculated using the equation tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

Which is the same as before.

So, perhaps the intended answer is 81 years, option C.

But wait, given the options, the correct answer based on calculations is approximately 83 years, which isn't listed, but the closest is 81 (option C). So perhaps the answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the direction. Wait, no, the astronaut is moving towards Earth, so the distance is as computed.

Another thought: perhaps the speed is given as 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to c, so the gamma is about 1962, but perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 2000, leading to 163,000/2000=81.5 years, which is 81.5, close to 81, option C.

So perhaps the intended answer is C)81.


To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is approximately \( D \approx 163,000 \) light-years.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Time in Earth's Frame (\( t_{\text{earth}} \)):**
   The time measured from Earth's frame is:
   \[
   t_{\text{earth}} = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{163,000}{0.99999987} \approx 163,000 \, \text{years}.
   \]

2. **Relativistic Gamma Factor (\( \gamma \)):**
   The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.99999987c \), we find:
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-7}.
   \]
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \approx 5.099 \times 10^{-4}, \quad \gamma \approx \frac{1}{5.099 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1962.
   \]

3. **Proper Time Experienced by the Astronaut (\( \tau \)):**
   The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{t_{\text{earth}}}{\gamma} = \frac{163,000}{1962} \approx 83 \, \text{years}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** "The astronaut will die before reaching Earth."  
  The astronaut's average lifetime is 150 years, and the journey takes approximately 83 years. The astronaut would survive, so this option is incorrect.

- **Option B:** 72 years  
  This is significantly lower than the calculated proper time of 83 years. This option is incorrect.

- **Option C:** 81 years  
  This is very close to the calculated proper time of 83 years. Given the approximations and potential rounding in the problem, this is the most reasonable choice.

- **Option D:** 77 years  
  This is also lower than the calculated proper time and is less accurate than option C. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The astronaut's proper time for the journey is approximately 83 years, but since this value is not listed, the closest option is **81 years**.
