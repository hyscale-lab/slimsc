Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right?

The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. There are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights (Mw) are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, but I don't know if that affects anything here.

The problem requires me to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Oh wait, orthophosphate is the conjugate base, so I think this has to do with the phosphate buffer system. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3, Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8, and Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12. So each step is a deprotonation.

I remember that in buffer solutions, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, in this case, we have two different salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's think about what each of these dissociates into.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. The other salt is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is sodium hydrogen phosphate. I think it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So, HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion.

Wait a minute, so we're mixing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. These are adjacent species in the phosphate ion's dissociation series. That means the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are related by the second dissociation (Ka2). So, the relevant Ka here is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

So, the buffer components are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The ratio of their concentrations will determine the pH of the solution, but we're interested in the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3- (HPO4^2- is not orthophosphate; ortho is the fully deprotonated form). Hmm, so how does PO4^3- come into play here?

I think I might be getting confused. Let me think. The phosphate species in solution are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The given salts provide H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the problem is asking for orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-. So how much of that is present?

Wait, but in the solution, because we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the solution is buffered around pH where the second dissociation is relevant. So the PO4^3- concentration would be very low because the third dissociation is much weaker (Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is way smaller than Ka2), so the concentration of PO4^3- would be minimal.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So perhaps we need to consider the hydrolysis of HPO4^2- to form PO4^3-.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is that the orthophosphate comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2- in the presence of H2PO4^-.

Hmm, perhaps I should model this using the equilibrium expressions.

So, the primary species in the solution are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The presence of both implies a buffer solution with pH determined by the pKa2.

But wait, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH should be around pKa2. The pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) which is approximately 7.21.

Wait, but how does that help me find the concentration of PO4^3-?

Alternatively, maybe I should consider each salt's contribution to the solution and then find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but wait, the salts are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's calculate the moles of each.

First, calculate moles of KH2PO4:

Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 mol.

So, 0.00734 mol of H2PO4^-.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: molar mass is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 mol.

Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, H2PO4^-: 0.00734 mol.

HPO4^2-: 0.00561 mol.

But wait, when these are in solution, they can react with water. Let me think about the equilibria.

H2PO4^- can lose a proton to form HPO4^2-: H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+.

Similarly, HPO4^2- can lose another proton to form PO4^3-: HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

But since the solution is buffered at a pH near pKa2, the H+ concentration is determined by the buffer. So, the pH is around 7.21, which is higher than pKa3 (which is about 11.2?), wait, no, pKa3 is log(1.8e-12) which is about 11.74. So at pH 7.21, the third deprotonation is not favored; so PO4^3- concentration would be very low.

Wait, but then why are we getting any PO4^3- at all? Because some of the HPO4^2- might dissociate a bit.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the expression for the third dissociation.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The equilibrium constant for this is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So, in solution, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.00561 / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M.

Wait, but wait, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by the initial moles, but I think in reality, the solution will have some equilibrium between them, influenced by the buffer.

Wait, perhaps I should first find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, and then use that to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the buffer equation. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (Ka2) is:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

So, the pH here is determined by the concentrations of these two ions. Let's compute pKa2:

Ka2 = 6.2e-8 → pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) → Wait, no. pKa = -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

So, the pH is approximately 7.207 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But wait, the actual pH of the solution is determined by the buffer. So if the moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are 0.00734 and 0.00561 respectively, their concentrations are (0.00734 / 0.2) = 0.0367 M, and (0.00561 / 0.2)=0.02805 M.

So, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is (0.02805) / (0.0367) ≈ 0.764.

Therefore, pH = 7.207 + log(0.764) ≈ 7.207 + (-0.114) ≈ 7.093.

Wait, but this pH is lower than pKa2. But I'm not sure if I need the pH. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can just proceed with the initial concentrations and ignore activity coefficients, as it's a basic buffer problem.

Now, the next step is to find the concentration of PO4^3- in solution. Since PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-:

HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, the expression is:

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]

Wait, but in the solution, the concentration of H+ isn't given. However, from the buffer solution, I can estimate [H+] using the pH calculated earlier. Wait, pH was found to be ~7.093, so [H+] = 1e-7.093 ≈ 8.28e-8 M.

But wait, let me be more precise. The pH was calculated as 7.093, so [H+] = 10^-7.093 ≈ 8.28e-8 M.

So, plug into the Ka3 expression:

Ka3 = ( [PO4^3-] * [H+] ) / [HPO4^2-]

We can solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But wait, no, the denominator is [HPO4^2-], so:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Yes, because:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Wait, no, because rearranging:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Wait, that's correct.

So, plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M (from earlier, because moles = 0.00561 mol, volume 0.2 L → 0.02805 M )

[H+] is 8.28e-8 M

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.28e-8)

Let me compute that:

First, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ≈ 5.049e-14

Denominator: 8.28e-8

So, 5.049e-14 / 8.28e-8 = (5.049 / 8.28) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.609 * 1e-6 ≈ 6.09e-7 M.

Wait, that gives me around 6.09e-7 M. But looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is not just from the Na2HPO4·2H2O but also from the KH2PO4.

Wait, another thought: the HPO4^2- comes from Na2HPO4·2H2O, and H2PO4^- comes from KH2PO4. But in solution, these two might react. So, perhaps the actual concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- is different from the initial because some H2PO4^- will deprotonate to form more HPO4^2-, or HPO4^2- might protonate to form H2PO4^-.

Wait, but in the buffer equation, those are accounted for. So, the actual concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by the buffer equation and the initial moles.

Wait, but in the initial calculation, I used the initial moles to calculate their concentrations, but perhaps I should calculate their actual concentrations after considering the buffer.

Wait, no, because the buffer equation accounts for the ratio. Let me think again. The initial moles are 0.00734 mol H2PO4^- and 0.00561 mol HPO4^2-.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates their ratio to the pH. So, using that, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can be found.

Wait, but perhaps the initial calculation is correct, that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M and [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M.

But when I used the buffer equation, the pH was lower than pKa2, which would mean that [HPO4^2-] is less than [H2PO4^-], which is what I have.

So, perhaps the [PO4^3-] is as I calculated.

But according to my calculation, [PO4^3-] is about 6.09e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7). But why isn't it exactly matching?

Let me recalculate the numbers precisely.

Calculating [HPO4^2-]: 0.00561 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M.

[H+] = 10^(-7.093) → Let's compute 7.093 as pH.

7.093 is 7 + 0.093. So 10^0.093 is about 1.24. So [H+] = 1.24e-7 M.

Wait, wait, no. 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.83 => 8.3e-8 M.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

pH = 7.093 → [H+] = 10^(-7.093) = ?

Let me compute 7.093 as 7 + 0.093.

10^0.093: ln(10^0.093) = 0.093 * ln(10) ≈ 0.093 * 2.3026 ≈ 0.214. So e^0.214 ≈ 1.238.

So 10^0.093 ≈ 1.238 → 10^(-0.093) = 1 / 1.238 ≈ 0.807.

So [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.807 = 8.07e-8 M.

So, going back to the calculation:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.07e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Denominator: 8.07e-8.

So 5.049e-14 / 8.07e-8 = (5.049 / 8.07) * 1e-6.

5.049 /8.07 ≈ 0.6257.

So 0.6257e-6 = 6.257e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.26e-7 M, very close to option A which is 6.24e-7 M. So probably that's the answer.

Wait, but why is the concentration of PO4^3- so high? Because the third dissociation is very weak. Wait, but in this case, perhaps because the solution is at a pH lower than pKa3, the degree of dissociation is higher, leading to more PO4^3- than expected.

Wait, pKa3 is about 11.74. So at pH 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3, the HPO4^2- is mostly protonated as H2PO4^- or H3PO4. Hmm, but wait, in this case, the solution's pH is around 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3, so the extent of deprotonation to PO4^3- would be minimal.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the [PO4^3-] is about 6e-7 M. That's not negligible, but perhaps it's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I'm forgetting that the initial HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are in solution, and that the PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

But according to the calculation, that gives us about 6.25e-7 M, which would be option A.

But wait, the options given are:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

B) 5.48x10^-7 M 

C) 2.81x10^-7 M

D) 3.97x10^-7 M 

So my calculation gives 6.25e-7, which is very close to option A. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but maybe I made an error in the initial steps. Let's double-check the moles.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol = approx 0.00734 mol. Correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 mol. Correct.

So, their concentrations are 0.0367 M and 0.02805 M.

Then using the buffer equation, we found the pH to be ~7.093.

Then [H+] is 8.07e-8 M.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 8.07e-8 ≈ (5.049e-14) / (8.07e-8) ≈ 6.257e-7 M.

Which matches option A.

But wait, another angle: perhaps the solution isn't considering the actual buffer pH correctly.

Wait, perhaps the buffer is made of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and so the pH is determined by their ratio, which is 0.00561 / 0.00734 ≈ 0.764. So pH = pKa2 + log(0.764) ≈ 7.207 + (-0.114) = 7.093.

But when calculating [PO4^3-], which comes from HPO4^2- dissociating, perhaps I should use the actual concentration of HPO4^2- in the buffer, which may not be 0.02805 M but adjusted based on the buffer equation.

Wait, the buffer equation tells me that [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2) = 10^(7.093 -7.207) = 10^(-0.114) ≈ 0.764.

So, [HPO4^2-] = 0.764 * [H2PO4^-].

But the total concentration of phosphate species is [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.0367 + 0.02805 = 0.06475 M. Alternatively, perhaps that's not correct because some of the H2PO4^- could deprotonate, but I think in the buffer, the concentrations are determined by the initial amounts and the pH.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the initial moles and the buffer equation.

Let me denote:

n_H2PO4 = 0.00734 mol

n_HPO4 = 0.00561 mol

The buffer solution has:

n_total = n_H2PO4 + n_HPO4 = 0.01295 mol.

But the buffer equation gives the ratio:

n_HPO4 / n_H2PO4 = 10^(pH - pKa2) → 0.00561 / 0.00734 ≈ 0.764 = 10^(pH -7.207).

Which gives pH ≈7.093 as before.

So the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = (0.00734 / 0.2) = 0.0367 M

[HPO4^2-] = (0.00561 / 0.2) = 0.02805 M

So, when calculating [PO4^3-], I used [HPO4^2-] as 0.02805 M, which is correct.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.07e-8) ≈ 6.25e-7 M.

So, that would be option A.

Wait, but why isn't it lower? Because Ka3 is small, so even though the solution has some HPO4^2-, the PO4^3- concentration is small.

Wait, but according to the calculation, it's about 6e-7, which is more than 1e-7, but given that Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, so maybe my initial approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: perhaps the PO4^3- comes from both the dissociation of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Wait, but H2PO4^- can't directly form PO4^3- in one step. It has to go through HPO4^2- first.

So, the dissociation is H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2), and HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3).

So, the concentration of PO4^3- depends on both dissociations.

But in the presence of a buffer, the [H+] is determined by the pH, so the second dissociation (to PO4^3-) is what contributes to the orthophosphate concentration.

So, perhaps the approach is correct.

Another thought: perhaps I should use the exact pH in the calculation.

Wait, the pH is 7.093, so [H+] is 8.07e-8 M.

So, another way: the [PO4^3-] is given by Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+].

Wait, yes.

So, plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 =1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] =0.02805 M

[H+] =8.07e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.07e-8) → as before.

Which is 6.25e-7 M.

Thus, the correct answer would be option A: 6.24e-7 M.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation equilibria of the phosphate species. The solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, which dissociate into H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, respectively. The relevant equilibrium for the formation of PO₄³⁻ is the third dissociation of H₃PO₄:

\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{PO₄³⁻} + \text{H⁺}
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the pH of the buffer solution is calculated based on the ratio of the concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. The moles of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ are determined from the given masses and molecular weights:

\[
\text{Moles of H₂PO₄⁻} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol}
\]
\[
\text{Moles of HPO₄²⁻} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00561 \, \text{mol}
\]

The concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ in the 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L) solution are:

\[
[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.00734 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.0367 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.00561 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.02805 \, \text{M}
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (\( K_{a2} = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \)):

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_{a2} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) + \log \left( \frac{0.02805}{0.0367} \right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} \approx 7.207 + \log(0.764) \approx 7.207 - 0.114 \approx 7.093
\]

The hydrogen ion concentration is:

\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.07 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

Using the equilibrium expression for the third dissociation:

\[
K_{a3} = \frac{[\text{PO₄³⁻}][\text{H⁺}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_{a3} \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] \approx \frac{5.049 \times 10^{-14}}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

This value is closest to option A (\(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)).

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right?

The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. There are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights (Mw) are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, but I don't know if that affects anything here.

The problem requires me to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Oh wait, orthophosphate is the conjugate base, so I think this has to do with the phosphate buffer system. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3, Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8, and Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12. So each step is a deprotonation.

I remember that in buffer solutions, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, in this case, we have two different salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's think about what each of these dissociates into.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. The other salt is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is sodium hydrogen phosphate. I think it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So, HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion.

Wait a minute, so we're mixing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. These are adjacent species in the phosphate ion's dissociation series. That means the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are related by the second dissociation (Ka2). So, the relevant Ka here is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

So, the buffer components are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The ratio of their concentrations will determine the pH of the solution, but we're interested in the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3- (HPO4^2- is not orthophosphate; ortho is the fully deprotonated form). Hmm, so how does PO4^3- come into play here?

I think I might be getting confused. Let me think. The phosphate species in solution are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The given salts provide H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the problem is asking for orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-. So how much of that is present?

Wait, but in the solution, because we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the solution is buffered around pH where the second dissociation is relevant. So the PO4^3- concentration would be very low because the third dissociation is much weaker (Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is way smaller than Ka2), so the concentration of PO4^3- would be minimal.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So perhaps we need to consider the hydrolysis of HPO4^2- to form PO4^3-.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is that the orthophosphate comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2- in the presence of H2PO4^-.

Hmm, perhaps I should model this using the equilibrium expressions.

So, the primary species in the solution are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The presence of both implies a buffer solution with pH determined by the pKa2.

But wait, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH should be around pKa2. The pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) which is approximately 7.21.

Wait, but how does that help me find the concentration of PO4^3-?

Alternatively, maybe I should consider each salt's contribution to the solution and then find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but wait, the salts are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's calculate the moles of each.

First, calculate moles of KH2PO4:

Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 mol.

So, 0.00734 mol of H2PO4^-.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: molar mass is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 mol.

Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, H2PO4^-: 0.00734 mol.

HPO4^2-: 0.00561 mol.

But wait, when these are in solution, they can react with water. Let me think about the equilibria.

H2PO4^- can lose a proton to form HPO4^2-: H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+.

Similarly, HPO4^2- can lose another proton to form PO4^3-: HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

But since the solution is buffered at a pH near pKa2, the H+ concentration is determined by the buffer. So, the pH is around 7.21, which is higher than pKa3 (which is about 11.2?), wait, no, pKa3 is log(1.8e-12) which is about 11.74. So at pH 7.21, the third deprotonation is not favored; so PO4^3- concentration would be very low.

Wait, but then why are we getting any PO4^3- at all? Because some of the HPO4^2- might dissociate a bit.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the expression for the third dissociation.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The equilibrium constant for this is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So, in solution, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.00561 / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M.

Wait, but wait, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by the initial moles, but I think in reality, the solution will have some equilibrium between them, influenced by the buffer.

Wait, perhaps I should first find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, and then use that to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the buffer equation. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (Ka2) is:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

So, the pH here is determined by the concentrations of these two ions. Let's compute pKa2:

Ka2 = 6.2e-8 → pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) → Wait, no. pKa = -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

So, the pH is approximately 7.207 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But wait, the actual pH of the solution is determined by the buffer. So if the moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are 0.00734 and 0.00561 respectively, their concentrations are (0.00734 / 0.2) = 0.0367 M, and (0.00561 / 0.2)=0.02805 M.

So, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is (0.02805) / (0.0367) ≈ 0.764.

Therefore, pH = 7.207 + log(0.764) ≈ 7.207 + (-0.114) ≈ 7.093.

Wait, but this pH is lower than pKa2. But I'm not sure if I need the pH. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can just proceed with the initial concentrations and ignore activity coefficients, as it's a basic buffer problem.

Now, the next step is to find the concentration of PO4^3- in solution. Since PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-:

HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, the expression is:

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]

Wait, but in the solution, the concentration of H+ isn't given. However, from the buffer solution, I can estimate [H+] using the pH calculated earlier. Wait, pH was found to be ~7.093, so [H+] = 1e-7.093 ≈ 8.28e-8 M.

But wait, let me be more precise. The pH was calculated as 7.093, so [H+] = 10^-7.093 ≈ 8.28e-8 M.

So, plug into the Ka3 expression:

Ka3 = ( [PO4^3-] * [H+] ) / [HPO4^2-]

We can solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But wait, no, the denominator is [HPO4^2-], so:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Yes, because:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Wait, no, because rearranging:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Wait, that's correct.

So, plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M (from earlier, because moles = 0.00561 mol, volume 0.2 L → 0.02805 M )

[H+] is 8.28e-8 M

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.28e-8)

Let me compute that:

First, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ≈ 5.049e-14

Denominator: 8.28e-8

So, 5.049e-14 / 8.28e-8 = (5.049 / 8.28) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.609 * 1e-6 ≈ 6.09e-7 M.

Wait, that gives me around 6.09e-7 M. But looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is not just from the Na2HPO4·2H2O but also from the KH2PO4.

Wait, another thought: the HPO4^2- comes from Na2HPO4·2H2O, and H2PO4^- comes from KH2PO4. But in solution, these two might react. So, perhaps the actual concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- is different from the initial because some H2PO4^- will deprotonate to form more HPO4^2-, or HPO4^2- might protonate to form H2PO4^-.

Wait, but in the buffer equation, those are accounted for. So, the actual concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by the buffer equation and the initial moles.

Wait, but in the initial calculation, I used the initial moles to calculate their concentrations, but perhaps I should calculate their actual concentrations after considering the buffer.

Wait, no, because the buffer equation accounts for the ratio. Let me think again. The initial moles are 0.00734 mol H2PO4^- and 0.00561 mol HPO4^2-.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates their ratio to the pH. So, using that, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can be found.

Wait, but perhaps the initial calculation is correct, that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M and [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M.

But when I used the buffer equation, the pH was lower than pKa2, which would mean that [HPO4^2-] is less than [H2PO4^-], which is what I have.

So, perhaps the [PO4^3-] is as I calculated.

But according to my calculation, [PO4^3-] is about 6.09e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7). But why isn't it exactly matching?

Let me recalculate the numbers precisely.

Calculating [HPO4^2-]: 0.00561 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M.

[H+] = 10^(-7.093) → Let's compute 7.093 as pH.

7.093 is 7 + 0.093. So 10^0.093 is about 1.24. So [H+] = 1.24e-7 M.

Wait, wait, no. 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.83 => 8.3e-8 M.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

pH = 7.093 → [H+] = 10^(-7.093) = ?

Let me compute 7.093 as 7 + 0.093.

10^0.093: ln(10^0.093) = 0.093 * ln(10) ≈ 0.093 * 2.3026 ≈ 0.214. So e^0.214 ≈ 1.238.

So 10^0.093 ≈ 1.238 → 10^(-0.093) = 1 / 1.238 ≈ 0.807.

So [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.807 = 8.07e-8 M.

So, going back to the calculation:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.07e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Denominator: 8.07e-8.

So 5.049e-14 / 8.07e-8 = (5.049 / 8.07) * 1e-6.

5.049 /8.07 ≈ 0.6257.

So 0.6257e-6 = 6.257e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.26e-7 M, very close to option A which is 6.24e-7 M. So probably that's the answer.

Wait, but why is the concentration of PO4^3- so high? Because the third dissociation is very weak. Wait, but in this case, perhaps because the solution is at a pH lower than pKa3, the degree of dissociation is higher, leading to more PO4^3- than expected.

Wait, pKa3 is about 11.74. So at pH 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3, the HPO4^2- is mostly protonated as H2PO4^- or H3PO4. Hmm, but wait, in this case, the solution's pH is around 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3, so the extent of deprotonation to PO4^3- would be minimal.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the [PO4^3-] is about 6e-7 M. That's not negligible, but perhaps it's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I'm forgetting that the initial HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are in solution, and that the PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

But according to the calculation, that gives us about 6.25e-7 M, which would be option A.

But wait, the options given are:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

B) 5.48x10^-7 M 

C) 2.81x10^-7 M

D) 3.97x10^-7 M 

So my calculation gives 6.25e-7, which is very close to option A. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but maybe I made an error in the initial steps. Let's double-check the moles.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol = approx 0.00734 mol. Correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 mol. Correct.

So, their concentrations are 0.0367 M and 0.02805 M.

Then using the buffer equation, we found the pH to be ~7.093.

Then [H+] is 8.07e-8 M.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 8.07e-8 ≈ (5.049e-14) / (8.07e-8) ≈ 6.257e-7 M.

Which matches option A.

But wait, another angle: perhaps the solution isn't considering the actual buffer pH correctly.

Wait, perhaps the buffer is made of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and so the pH is determined by their ratio, which is 0.00561 / 0.00734 ≈ 0.764. So pH = pKa2 + log(0.764) ≈ 7.207 + (-0.114) = 7.093.

But when calculating [PO4^3-], which comes from HPO4^2- dissociating, perhaps I should use the actual concentration of HPO4^2- in the buffer, which may not be 0.02805 M but adjusted based on the buffer equation.

Wait, the buffer equation tells me that [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2) = 10^(7.093 -7.207) = 10^(-0.114) ≈ 0.764.

So, [HPO4^2-] = 0.764 * [H2PO4^-].

But the total concentration of phosphate species is [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.0367 + 0.02805 = 0.06475 M. Alternatively, perhaps that's not correct because some of the H2PO4^- could deprotonate, but I think in the buffer, the concentrations are determined by the initial amounts and the pH.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the initial moles and the buffer equation.

Let me denote:

n_H2PO4 = 0.00734 mol

n_HPO4 = 0.00561 mol

The buffer solution has:

n_total = n_H2PO4 + n_HPO4 = 0.01295 mol.

But the buffer equation gives the ratio:

n_HPO4 / n_H2PO4 = 10^(pH - pKa2) → 0.00561 / 0.00734 ≈ 0.764 = 10^(pH -7.207).

Which gives pH ≈7.093 as before.

So the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = (0.00734 / 0.2) = 0.0367 M

[HPO4^2-] = (0.00561 / 0.2) = 0.02805 M

So, when calculating [PO4^3-], I used [HPO4^2-] as 0.02805 M, which is correct.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.07e-8) ≈ 6.25e-7 M.

So, that would be option A.

Wait, but why isn't it lower? Because Ka3 is small, so even though the solution has some HPO4^2-, the PO4^3- concentration is small.

Wait, but according to the calculation, it's about 6e-7, which is more than 1e-7, but given that Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, so maybe my initial approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: perhaps the PO4^3- comes from both the dissociation of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Wait, but H2PO4^- can't directly form PO4^3- in one step. It has to go through HPO4^2- first.

So, the dissociation is H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2), and HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3).

So, the concentration of PO4^3- depends on both dissociations.

But in the presence of a buffer, the [H+] is determined by the pH, so the second dissociation (to PO4^3-) is what contributes to the orthophosphate concentration.

So, perhaps the approach is correct.

Another thought: perhaps I should use the exact pH in the calculation.

Wait, the pH is 7.093, so [H+] is 8.07e-8 M.

So, another way: the [PO4^3-] is given by Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+].

Wait, yes.

So, plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 =1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] =0.02805 M

[H+] =8.07e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.07e-8) → as before.

Which is 6.25e-7 M.

Thus, the correct answer would be option A: 6.24e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation equilibria of the phosphate species. The solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, which dissociate into H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, respectively. The relevant equilibrium for the formation of PO₄³⁻ is the third dissociation of H₃PO₄:

\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{PO₄³⁻} + \text{H⁺}
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the pH of the buffer solution is calculated based on the ratio of the concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. The moles of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ are determined from the given masses and molecular weights:

\[
\text{Moles of H₂PO₄⁻} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol}
\]
\[
\text{Moles of HPO₄²⁻} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00561 \, \text{mol}
\]

The concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ in the 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L) solution are:

\[
[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.00734 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.0367 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.00561 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.02805 \, \text{M}
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (\( K_{a2} = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \)):

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_{a2} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) + \log \left( \frac{0.02805}{0.0367} \right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} \approx 7.207 + \log(0.764) \approx 7.207 - 0.114 \approx 7.093
\]

The hydrogen ion concentration is:

\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.07 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

Using the equilibrium expression for the third dissociation:

\[
K_{a3} = \frac{[\text{PO₄³⁻}][\text{H⁺}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_{a3} \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] \approx \frac{5.049 \times 10^{-14}}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

This value is closest to option A (\(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)).

**Answer: A**
