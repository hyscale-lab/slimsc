Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. I need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait. So the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes. Does that change anything? Oh, right! Radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom's decay is independent of its past. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't affect the future probability. Or does it? Wait, maybe I should consider the decay constant.

Right, the decay process follows an exponential law. The probability of decay in a certain time is given by the formula P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time.

But wait, the problem gives me the probability for 100 minutes. So the 32% is P(100) = 0.32. Let me write that down. 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). I can solve for λ.

Calculating λ: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ) → e^(-100λ) = 0.68 → take natural log of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68)/(100). Let me compute that.

ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) which is about -0.4055. So λ ≈ 0.4055 / 100 ≈ 0.004055 per minute.

Now, the question is about the next 150 minutes. So the time from now is 150 minutes. So the probability would be P = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, but wait a moment. The initial 50 minutes have already passed without decay. So the total time from the start is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But because radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes and then decays in the next 150. Or wait, no, because the probability is about the next 150 minutes regardless of the past. So perhaps I can model it as starting afresh.

Alternatively, the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is P = 1 - e^(-λ t). So in this case, t is 150 minutes.

So calculate 1 - e^(-0.004055 *150). Let's compute that exponent: 0.004055 *150 ≈ 0.60825. So e^-0.60825 ≈ ? Let me think. e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. e^-0.608 is about 0.544. So 1 - 0.544 ≈ 0.456, which is about 45.6%. Hmm, looking at the options, that's close to 44% (A) or 48% (D). But wait, perhaps my approximations are off. Let me get more precise.

Wait, let me compute ln(0.68) more accurately. Since 0.68 is e^-0.4055? Let me check with calculator. Let me compute ln(0.68):

ln(0.68) ≈ -0.4005 (since e^-0.4 ≈ 0.6703, which is close to 0.68). Let me see: e^-0.4005 is approximately 0.68. So λ = 0.4005 / 100 = 0.004005 per minute.

Then λ *150 = 0.004005 *150 = 0.60075.

So e^-0.60075. Let me calculate that. e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. What about e^-0.60075?

Using a calculator, e^-0.60075 ≈ 0.5478. So 1 - 0.5478 ≈ 0.4522, which is 45.22%, approximately 45.2%. So looking at the options, the closest is D) 48% or A)44%. Wait, but wait, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the probability of decay within 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. Because the way the question is phrased, it's the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes have already passed. So perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes.

Wait, but the decay process is memoryless, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any subsequent 150 minutes interval. So it's the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes from now.

Wait, but perhaps the way to model it is as the conditional probability. So the probability that it decays within the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Hmm, so P(decay in next 150 | not decayed in first 50). Since the decay process is memoryless, this is equal to the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time zero, which is 1 - e^(-λ t'), where t' is 150.

Wait, no. Because the decay is memoryless, the conditional probability is simply the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes regardless of the past. So the answer should be the same as if it's the first time—just 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Wait, but wait another thought: The initial 50 minutes have passed, so the total time elapsed now is 50 minutes. The question is about the next 150, which would bring the total to 200 minutes. The probability of not decaying in 200 minutes is e^(-λ 200), but we know that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, so the probability is conditional.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The probability that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^(-λ *50). The probability that it hasn't decayed in 50 + t minutes is e^(-λ (50 + t)). So the probability that it decays between 50 and 50+t minutes is [e^(-λ 50) ] * [1 - e^(-λ t) ].

Wait, because the probability it hasn't decayed by time 50 is e^(-λ 50), and then the probability it decays in the next t minutes is [1 - e^(-λ t)].

But wait, no. Because the decay is memoryless, the probability it decays in the next t minutes is independent of how much time has already passed. So, the conditional probability is [1 - e^(-λ t)].

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the decay constant. The decay probability is always 1 - e^(-λ t), regardless of how long it has been around. So, if the next 150 minutes are considered, the probability of decay is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me clarify: the decay is a Poisson process. The probability that the atom has not decayed by time t is e^(-λ t). The probability that it decays in the next t minutes is 1 - e^(-λ t). So the 50 minutes that have already passed don't affect this, because the decay process is independent of the past. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

So, let me recalculate λ with more precision. We have P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). So e^(-100λ )= 0.68. Taking natural logs: -100λ = ln(0.68) → λ = (-ln(0.68))/100.

Let me compute ln(0.68) accurately. Using a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005. So λ = 0.4005 / 100 = 0.004005 per minute.

Then, for t=150 minutes: 1 - e^(-0.004005 *150) = 1 - e^(-0.60075).

Compute e^-0.60075. Let me see:

We know that e^−0.6 ≈ 0.5488.

But 0.60075 is 0.6 plus 0.00075. So perhaps we can approximate e^-0.60075 ≈ e^-0.6 * e^-0.00075 ≈ 0.5488 * (1 - 0.00075) ) ≈ 0.5488 * 0.99925 ≈ approximately 0.5488 * 0.99925.

Wait, 0.5488 *0.99925 is about 0.5488 - (0.5488 *0.00075). 0.5488 * 0.00075 is about 0.0004116. So subtracting gives 0.5483884. So e^-0.60075 ≈ 0.5484.

So 1 - 0.5484 = 0.4516, which is about 45.16%. So approximately 45% chance.

Looking at the options, A is 44%, D is 48%. Hmm, 45% is between them. But perhaps my approximation is a bit rough.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute λ exactly.

Given that P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-λ *100} → e^{-100λ} = 0.68 → ln(0.68) = -100λ → λ = (−ln(0.68))/100.

Using a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.400522. So λ ≈ 0.400522 / 100 ≈ 0.00400522 per minute.

Now, for t=150, λt = 0.00400522 *150 = 0.600783.

Compute e^-0.600783.

What's e^-0.600783?

We can use the Taylor series or a calculator function. Alternatively, using a calculator, e^-0.6 is about 0.548809. Let me find e^-0.600783.

The difference between 0.600783 and 0.6 is 0.000783. So, e^-0.600783 = e^-0.6 * e^-0.000783.

e^-0.000783 ≈ 1 - 0.000783 + (0.000783)^2/2 - ... ≈ approximately 0.999217 (since 0.000783 is small, higher terms are negligible).

So e^-0.600783 ≈ 0.548809 * 0.999217 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.548809 * 0.999217 ≈ 0.548809 * (1 - 0.000783) → 0.548809 - (0.548809 * 0.000783).

Compute 0.548809 * 0.000783:

0.548809 * 0.0007 ≈ 0.0003841663.

0.548809 * 0.000083 ≈ about 0.00004544. So total is approximately 0.0003841663 + 0.00004544 ≈ 0.0004296.

So subtracting from 0.548809 → 0.548809 - 0.0004296 ≈ 0.5483794.

So e^-0.600783 ≈ 0.5483794.

Thus, 1 - e^-0.600783 ≈ 1 - 0.5483794 ≈ 0.4516206 → ≈ 45.16%.

So approximately 45.16% chance. Looking at the options, the closest is 44% or 48%. Wait, but none of the options exactly match 45%. Hmm.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because the options don't have 45%.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating λ. Let me recompute that.

We have P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ} → e^{-100λ} = 0.68.

Taking ln both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68) → λ = - (ln 0.68)/100.

Compute ln(0.68): let me get exact value.

ln(0.68) → using a calculator, it's approximately -0.400522.

So λ = 0.00400522 per minute.

Then, λt for t=150 is 0.00400522 *150 = 0.600783.

Now, e^-0.600783 → I'll compute it more accurately.

I can use a calculator for e^-0.600783.

Alternatively, using a Taylor series:

e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ... for x negative, it's 1/(e^{|x|} ), but that might not help. Alternatively, let me compute using a calculator-like approach.

But perhaps another approach: the exact value of e^-0.600783 is approximately 0.5478.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that 0.600783 is 0.6 + 0.000783.

So e^-(0.6 + 0.000783) = e^-0.6 * e^-0.000783 ≈ 0.548809 * (1 - 0.000783 + 0.000783^2/2 - ... )

Compute e^-0.000783 ≈ 1 - 0.000783 + (0.000783)^2 / 2.

(0.000783)^2 ≈ 6.13e-7, divided by 2 is 3.065e-7.

So e^-0.000783 ≈ 0.999217 + 0.0000003065 ≈ approximately 0.9992173.

So e^-0.600783 ≈ 0.548809 * 0.9992173 ≈ 0.548809 * 0.9992173.

Let me compute 0.548809 * 0.9992173.

0.548809 * 0.9992173 = 0.548809 * (1 - 0.0007827) → 0.548809 - (0.548809 * 0.0007827).

Compute 0.548809 * 0.0007827 ≈ 0.548809 * 0.0007 = 0.0003841663, plus 0.548809 * 0.0000827 ≈ approx 0.0000453.

Adding gives ≈ 0.0004294. So subtracting from 0.548809 → 0.548809 - 0.0004294 ≈ 0.5483796.

So e^-0.600783 ≈ 0.5483796 → 1 - 0.5483796 = 0.4516204, which is 45.16204%, so approximately 45.16%.

Looking at the options again, the options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%. Hmm, 45.16% isn't exactly any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have passed without decay. So the total time considered is 200 minutes, but the question is about the next 150. So perhaps I should calculate the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes.

So, the probability that the atom decays at any time between t=50 and t=200 is P = e^(-λ*50) * (1 - e^(-λ *150)).

Wait, no. Because the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes is e^(-λ *50), and the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is e^(-λ *50) * (1 - e^(-λ *150)).

But wait, that's the same as 1 - e^(-λ *200), which would be the probability of decaying within 200 minutes. But the question is about the next 150 minutes from now, which is 50 to 200. So the probability is [1 - e^(-λ *50)] * [1 - e^(-λ *150)]? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

The probability that the atom decays between t=a and t=b is P = e^(-λ a) - e^(-λ b).

So in this case, a is 50, b is 200. So P = e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200).

Wait, no, that's the probability that it decays between a and b. Because the survival function is e^(-λ t), so the probability of decaying between a and b is e^(-λ a) - e^(-λ b).

So for a=50, b=200:

P = e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ).

So let me compute that.

First, calculate e^(-50λ) where λ is 0.00400522.

50λ = 50 * 0.00400522 ≈ 0.200261.

e^(-0.200261) ≈ approximately 0.8187 (since e^-0.2 ≈ 0.8187).

e^(-200λ) → 200λ = 200 *0.00400522 ≈ 0.801044.

e^-0.801044 ≈ approximately 0.4493 (since e^-0.8 ≈ 0.4493).

So P = 0.8187 - 0.4493 ≈ 0.3694, which is 36.94%. But that's not matching any of the given options either. Hmm, that can't be right because the initial probability is 32% in 100 minutes, and 50 minutes have passed, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes should be higher than 32%, perhaps around 45% as computed earlier. Wait, but this approach gives 36.94%, which isn't matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I confused the approach. Let me think again. The correct formula for the probability that the atom decays between t=a and t=b is e^(-λ a) - e^(-λ b).

In our case, a=50, b=200.

So P = e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ).

So, with λ = 0.00400522.

Compute 50λ = 0.200261 → e^-0.200261 ≈ 0.8187 (as before).

200λ = 0.801044 → e^-0.801044 ≈ 0.4493.

So P = 0.8187 - 0.4493 = 0.3694, which is 36.94%. But this is about 37%, which isn't an option. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, no, the question is about the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, which is from 50 to 200. So using this approach, it's 37%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, regardless of the past, which would be 45%, as calculated earlier.

Wait, but the options don't have 45%. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is assuming that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes, so the decay constant λ is such that P(100) = 0.32. Then, the question is about P(150) as the next 150 minutes, regardless of the past. So that would be 45%, as before.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the decay probability is given as 32% within 100 minutes, but the actual formula is λ = ln(2) / half-life, but no, the question doesn't provide half-life information. So the approach with the exponential law is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the probability to be calculated as (0.32) * (150/100) = 48%. Because 32% is for 100 minutes, so per minute it's 0.32/100=0.0032 per minute. So for 150 minutes, 0.0032 *150 = 0.48 → 48%, which is option D.

But wait, that's not correct because the decay probability isn't linear with time. The formula 1 - e^(-λ t) isn't linear. So that approach would be wrong, but perhaps the problem assumes a linear probability. But that's not correct because the decay follows an exponential law.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved that way, assuming a linear probability. So 32% for 100 minutes → 0.32 per 100 minutes → 0.32/100 = 0.0032 per minute. Then, 150 minutes → 0.0032 *150 = 0.48 → 48%, which is option D.

But this approach is incorrect because the decay probability isn't linear. For small probabilities, it might be approximately linear, but not for 32% over 100 minutes.

Wait, but given the options, perhaps the intended approach was to use the linear approximation, leading to option D (48%). But the correct approach is the exponential one, which gives about 45%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, let me check the calculation of λ again. Maybe I made a mistake there.

Given P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ} → e^{-100λ} = 0.68 → ln(0.68) = -100λ → λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100.

Wait, ln(1/0.68) is the same as -ln(0.68), so λ = (0.400522)/100 = 0.00400522 per minute.

So for t=150, λt=0.00400522 *150 = 0.600783.

e^-0.600783 ≈ 0.5478 → 1 - 0.5478 = 0.4522 → 45.22%, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 50 minutes passed without decay, so the probability for the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes. So the calculation is correct, but the answer isn't an option. That's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of λ. Let me compute 100λ again. Wait, 100λ = 0.400522, so λ = 0.00400522 per minute.

Wait, perhaps when I calculated e^-0.600783, I made a mistake. Let me use a calculator for a more precise calculation.

e^-0.600783: 

I can use the Taylor series around x=0.6.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using a calculator function.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator for e^-0.600783.

But since I don't have a calculator, perhaps I can use a better approximation.

We know that e^0.6 = 1.82211880039 (approx).

Wait, but wait, e^0.6 is about 1.8221, so e^-0.6 is 1/1.8221 ≈ 0.5488.

But 0.600783 is 0.6 + 0.000783.

So, e^-0.600783 = e^-(0.6 + 0.000783) = e^-0.6 * e^-0.000783.

Compute e^-0.000783:

Using the Taylor expansion, e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x^3/6 for small x.

x = -0.000783.

So, e^-0.000783 ≈ 1 - 0.000783 + (0.000783)^2 / 2 - (0.000783)^3 / 6.

0.000783^2 = approx 0.000000613, so divided by 2 is 0.0000003065.

0.000783^3 ≈ 0.00000000048, divided by 6 is ~ 0.00000000008.

So e^-0.000783 ≈ 1 - 0.000783 + 0.0000003065 - 0.00000000008 ≈ 0.9992173065.

So e^-0.600783 ≈ 0.548809 * 0.9992173065 ≈ 0.548809 * (1 - 0.0007826935) → 0.548809 - (0.548809 * 0.0007826935).

Compute 0.548809 * 0.0007826935: 0.5488 * 0.0007 is 0.00038416, and 0.5488 * 0.0000826935 is approximately 0.00004533.

Adding gives 0.00042949.

So subtracting from 0.548809 → 0.548809 - 0.00042949 ≈ 0.5483795.

So e^-0.600783 ≈ 0.5483795 → 1 - 0.5483795 ≈ 0.4516205 → 45.16%.

But again, this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the half-life approach. Let me compute the half-life.

The decay constant λ is 0.00400522 per minute. The half-life T_1/2 is ln(2)/λ ≈ 0.6931 / 0.00400522 ≈ 173 minutes.

So, the half-life is about 173 minutes. So in 100 minutes, the decay probability is 32%, which makes sense.

Now, the question is, after 50 minutes, what's the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, the half-life is 173 minutes, which suggests that about 50% of the atoms decay by 173 minutes.

But the question is about 150 minutes, which is a bit less than a half-life. So the probability would be about 48% (since 150 is 86.7% of the half-life). But that's a rough approximation.

Wait, but using the exponential formula, 1 - e^(-lambda * t) where t=150 gives 1 - e^(-0.600783) ≈ 45.16%, which is close to 45%, but that's not an option.

So perhaps the intended approach is to model it as a linear probability. Let me think: 32% in 100 minutes → 0.32 per 100 minutes. So per minute, 0.32/100 = 0.0032.

Then, for 150 minutes, 0.0032 *150 = 0.48 → 48%, option D. But this is incorrect because the decay isn't linear. However, given the options, perhaps this is the intended approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the decay formula, leading to 45% and the closest option is A)44% or D)48%. Since 45% is closer to 44% than 48%, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e^-0.600783. Let me try another approximation.

Using a calculator, e^−0.600783 ≈ 0.5478, so 1 - 0.5478 = 0.4522 → 45.22% which is approximately 45%, but again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem actually considers that the next 150 minutes are added to the initial 50, making 200 minutes. So the probability of decaying within 200 minutes is 1 - e^(-0.00400522 *200) = 1 - e^(-0.801044).

e^-0.801044 ≈ 0.4493 → 1 - 0.4493 = 0.5507, which is 55.07%. But the question is about the next 150 minutes, not 200. So that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem.

The probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200. So the formula is P = e^(-λ*50) * (1 - e^(-λ *150)).

Wait, so P = e^(-λ*50) * [1 - e^(-λ*150)].

Compute each term:

e^(-λ*50) = e^(-0.00400522 *50) = e^(-0.200261) ≈ 0.8187.

[1 - e^(-λ*150)] = 1 - e^(-0.600783) ≈ 1 - 0.5478 → 0.4522.

So P = 0.8187 * 0.4522 ≈ 0.370. So 37%, which isn't an option. Hmm, that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the 32% is the decay probability within 100 minutes, and the question is about the next 150 minutes, irrespective of the past. So the calculation is 1 - e^(-lambda *150) which is 45%, but again, no option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula P = (0.32) * (150/100) = 48%, option D. Because the decay probability scales linearly with time. But this approach is incorrect because the decay follows an exponential law, not a linear one. However, given that the options don't include 45%, perhaps this is the intended approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to use the same formula but with t=150, leading to 45%, which is not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check the problem statement again. It says, "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." So P(100) = 0.32.

We know that P(t) = 1 - e^(-λ t).

So λ = ( - ln(1 - P(t)) ) / t → λ = (-ln(0.68))/100 → 0.004005 per minute.

Then, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-0.004005 *150) → 1 - e^(-0.60075) ≈ 45.16%.

Since this isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing a key point. Wait, the question says, "the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes." So from the current time, 50 minutes have passed, and the next 150 minutes are from now. So the time is 150 minutes from now, regardless of the past.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is asking for the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes given that 50 minutes have passed without decay. So this is a conditional probability.

The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B).

In this case, A is the event that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (from now), and B is the event that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.

So P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B).

But since the decay is memoryless, P(B and A) is the same as P(A), because knowing that B has occurred doesn't change the probability of A. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the probability that it has not decayed in 50 minutes is P(B) = e^(-λ *50).

The probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is e^(-λ *50) * (1 - e^(-λ *150)).

But the conditional probability P(A|B) is [e^(-λ *50) * (1 - e^(-λ *150))] / e^(-λ *50) ) → which simplifies to (1 - e^(-λ *150)).

Ah! So P(A|B) = 1 - e^(-λ *150). Which brings us back to the initial calculation of 45.16%, which isn't an option.

So perhaps the intended answer is 48%, assuming a linear approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the same approach as the given P(100) = 32%, so P(150) = (32% * 150)/100 = 48% → option D.

But that's not correct. So perhaps the intended answer is D)48%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to calculate the probability as 1 - (0.68)^(150/100) → which would be 1 - 0.68^1.5.

Wait, 0.68^1.5 = sqrt(0.68^3) ≈ sqrt(0.314) ≈ 0.5605.

So 1 - 0.5605 ≈ 0.4395 → 43.95% → approx 44%, option A.

Wait, where does this formula come from? Because for the decay, the survival probability after time t is e^(-λ t). But if someone incorrectly models it as (1 - P_initial)^(t/T), that would be wrong. So perhaps the problem's intended approach is using the same proportion in time, leading to option A (44%).

Alternatively, someone might model the survival probability as (0.68)^(t/100), which would be incorrect but leads to 0.68^(1.5) = approx 0.5605, so 1 - 0.5605 = 0.4395 → 44% → option A.

So perhaps the intended answer is A)44%.

But wait, that approach is wrong because the survival probability isn't multiplicative in time. It's exponential, not polynomial.

So I'm stuck between the correct calculation leading to 45% and the options not having that. But perhaps the intended answer is 44% or 48% based on a different approach.

Given the options, I'm more inclined towards the correct approach being 45%, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D)48%, assuming a linear probability.

But I'm not confident. Another way to think about it: since 100 minutes gives 32%, the decay constant λ is 0.004005 per minute. For 150 minutes, the probability is 1 - e^(-0.600783) ≈ 45.16%, which rounds to 45%, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that after 50 minutes, the remaining probability is (1 - 0.32)^(50/100) = 0.68^0.5 ≈ 0.8246. Then, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - (0.68)^(150/100) → 1 - 0.68^1.5 ≈ 1 - 0.5605 → 43.95%, which is 44%, option A.

But this approach is incorrect because the decay process isn't multiplicative in that way. It's exponential, not a simple power law. So perhaps the intended answer is 44%, option A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 45%, but it's not an option, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of λ. Let me compute λ again.

P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ} → e^{-100λ} = 0.68 → taking natural logarithm: ln(0.68) = -100λ → λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100 → ln(1.479289) ≈ 0.3905 → λ ≈ 0.003905 per minute.

Wait, wait! I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me compute ln(1/0.68) accurately.

1/0.68 is approximately 1.470588. So ln(1.470588) ≈ 0.3905.

So λ = 0.3905 / 100 ≈ 0.003905 per minute.

Ah! Earlier, I thought ln(0.68) was -0.4005, which is correct. So λ = 0.4005 /100 = 0.004005 per minute.

Wait, earlier I computed ln(0.68) as approximately -0.4005, which is correct. So lambda is 0.004005 per minute.

So then, for 150 minutes, t=150.

λt=0.004005 *150 = 0.60075.

e^-0.60075 is approximately 0.5478 → 1 - 0.5478 = 0.4522 → 45.22%, which is 45%, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done as if the decay constant was the same as the initial 32% in 100 minutes, leading to a probability of 48% for 150 minutes. But that's not correct, but perhaps the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the same calculation as the initial 32% for 100 minutes, so for 150 minutes, it's 32% * (150/100) = 48%, option D.

But this is an incorrect approach.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. The correct calculation leads to 45%, but that's not an option. Perhaps the intended answer is option D)48% based on the linear approach, even though it's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of λ. Let me recompute.

We have P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ} → e^{-100λ}=0.68 → ln(0.68)= -100λ → λ= (ln(1/0.68))/100 → ln(1.479289) ≈ 0.3905 → λ≈0.003905 per minute.

Wait, but earlier I thought ln(0.68) is -0.4005, so λ=0.004005 per minute.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in using the natural logarithm. Let me double-check.

Yes, I'm correct. ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005. So λ ≈0.004005 per minute.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is 44% (option A), based on an incorrect model where the survival probability is (0.68)^(t/100), leading to 0.68^1.5 ≈0.5605, so 1-0.5605=0.4395→44%.

But that's not the correct approach. The correct approach is exponential decay.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is A)44%, based on the incorrect approach, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is 45%, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D)48%.

But I'm not confident. Given the options, I think the intended answer is D)48%, based on the incorrect linear approach.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the probability that a radioactive atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. The decay follows an exponential law, where the probability of decay in a time interval \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

### Step 1: Determine the decay constant \( \lambda \)
From the problem, the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, i.e., \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using the decay formula:

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.4005 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.4005}{100} \approx 0.004005 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substitute \( \lambda \approx 0.004005 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.004005 \cdot 150 \approx 0.60075
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.60075}
\]

Using approximations for \( e^{-0.60075} \):

\[
e^{-0.60075} \approx 0.5478
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.5478 \approx 0.4522 \, \text{or} \, 45.22\%.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
The calculated probability of 45.22% does not exactly match any of the given options. However, the closest options are:

- **A) 44%**: This could correspond to an approximation or a slightly different calculation method.
- **D) 48%**: This might result from an incorrect linear assumption, where the probability scales directly with time (e.g., \( 32\% \cdot \frac{150}{100} = 48\% \)).

Given the options, the most reasonable choice is **A) 44%**, as it is closer to the calculated value of 45.22% than 48%.

### Conclusion
The correct calculation yields approximately 45.22%, but since this is not an option, the closest match is:

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. I need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait. So the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes. Does that change anything? Oh, right! Radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom's decay is independent of its past. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't affect the future probability. Or does it? Wait, maybe I should consider the decay constant.

Right, the decay process follows an exponential law. The probability of decay in a certain time is given by the formula P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time.

But wait, the problem gives me the probability for 100 minutes. So the 32% is P(100) = 0.32. Let me write that down. 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). I can solve for λ.

Calculating λ: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ) → e^(-100λ) = 0.68 → take natural log of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68)/(100). Let me compute that.

ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) which is about -0.4055. So λ ≈ 0.4055 / 100 ≈ 0.004055 per minute.

Now, the question is about the next 150 minutes. So the time from now is 150 minutes. So the probability would be P = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, but wait a moment. The initial 50 minutes have already passed without decay. So the total time from the start is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But because radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes and then decays in the next 150. Or wait, no, because the probability is about the next 150 minutes regardless of the past. So perhaps I can model it as starting afresh.

Alternatively, the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is P = 1 - e^(-λ t). So in this case, t is 150 minutes.

So calculate 1 - e^(-0.004055 *150). Let's compute that exponent: 0.004055 *150 ≈ 0.60825. So e^-0.60825 ≈ ? Let me think. e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. e^-0.608 is about 0.544. So 1 - 0.544 ≈ 0.456, which is about 45.6%. Hmm, looking at the options, that's close to 44% (A) or 48% (D). But wait, perhaps my approximations are off. Let me get more precise.

Wait, let me compute ln(0.68) more accurately. Since 0.68 is e^-0.4055? Let me check with calculator. Let me compute ln(0.68):

ln(0.68) ≈ -0.4005 (since e^-0.4 ≈ 0.6703, which is close to 0.68). Let me see: e^-0.4005 is approximately 0.68. So λ = 0.4005 / 100 = 0.004005 per minute.

Then λ *150 = 0.004005 *150 = 0.60075.

So e^-0.60075. Let me calculate that. e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. What about e^-0.60075?

Using a calculator, e^-0.60075 ≈ 0.5478. So 1 - 0.5478 ≈ 0.4522, which is 45.22%, approximately 45.2%. So looking at the options, the closest is D) 48% or A)44%. Wait, but wait, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the probability of decay within 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. Because the way the question is phrased, it's the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes have already passed. So perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes.

Wait, but the decay process is memoryless, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any subsequent 150 minutes interval. So it's the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes from now.

Wait, but perhaps the way to model it is as the conditional probability. So the probability that it decays within the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Hmm, so P(decay in next 150 | not decayed in first 50). Since the decay process is memoryless, this is equal to the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time zero, which is 1 - e^(-λ t'), where t' is 150.

Wait, no. Because the decay is memoryless, the conditional probability is simply the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes regardless of the past. So the answer should be the same as if it's the first time—just 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Wait, but wait another thought: The initial 50 minutes have passed, so the total time elapsed now is 50 minutes. The question is about the next 150, which would bring the total to 200 minutes. The probability of not decaying in 200 minutes is e^(-λ 200), but we know that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, so the probability is conditional.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The probability that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^(-λ *50). The probability that it hasn't decayed in 50 + t minutes is e^(-λ (50 + t)). So the probability that it decays between 50 and 50+t minutes is [e^(-λ 50) ] * [1 - e^(-λ t) ].

Wait, because the probability it hasn't decayed by time 50 is e^(-λ 50), and then the probability it decays in the next t minutes is [1 - e^(-λ t)].

But wait, no. Because the decay is memoryless, the probability it decays in the next t minutes is independent of how much time has already passed. So, the conditional probability is [1 - e^(-λ t)].

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the decay constant. The decay probability is always 1 - e^(-λ t), regardless of how long it has been around. So, if the next 150 minutes are considered, the probability of decay is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me clarify: the decay is a Poisson process. The probability that the atom has not decayed by time t is e^(-λ t). The probability that it decays in the next t minutes is 1 - e^(-λ t). So the 50 minutes that have already passed don't affect this, because the decay process is independent of the past. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

So, let me recalculate λ with more precision. We have P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). So e^(-100λ )= 0.68. Taking natural logs: -100λ = ln(0.68) → λ = (-ln(0.68))/100.

Let me compute ln(0.68) accurately. Using a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005. So λ = 0.4005 / 100 = 0.004005 per minute.

Then, for t=150 minutes: 1 - e^(-0.004005 *150) = 1 - e^(-0.60075).

Compute e^-0.60075. Let me see:

We know that e^−0.6 ≈ 0.5488.

But 0.60075 is 0.6 plus 0.00075. So perhaps we can approximate e^-0.60075 ≈ e^-0.6 * e^-0.00075 ≈ 0.5488 * (1 - 0.00075) ) ≈ 0.5488 * 0.99925 ≈ approximately 0.5488 * 0.99925.

Wait, 0.5488 *0.99925 is about 0.5488 - (0.5488 *0.00075). 0.5488 * 0.00075 is about 0.0004116. So subtracting gives 0.5483884. So e^-0.60075 ≈ 0.5484.

So 1 - 0.5484 = 0.4516, which is about 45.16%. So approximately 45% chance.

Looking at the options, A is 44%, D is 48%. Hmm, 45% is between them. But perhaps my approximation is a bit rough.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute λ exactly.

Given that P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-λ *100} → e^{-100λ} = 0.68 → ln(0.68) = -100λ → λ = (−ln(0.68))/100.

Using a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.400522. So λ ≈ 0.400522 / 100 ≈ 0.00400522 per minute.

Now, for t=150, λt = 0.00400522 *150 = 0.600783.

Compute e^-0.600783.

What's e^-0.600783?

We can use the Taylor series or a calculator function. Alternatively, using a calculator, e^-0.6 is about 0.548809. Let me find e^-0.600783.

The difference between 0.600783 and 0.6 is 0.000783. So, e^-0.600783 = e^-0.6 * e^-0.000783.

e^-0.000783 ≈ 1 - 0.000783 + (0.000783)^2/2 - ... ≈ approximately 0.999217 (since 0.000783 is small, higher terms are negligible).

So e^-0.600783 ≈ 0.548809 * 0.999217 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.548809 * 0.999217 ≈ 0.548809 * (1 - 0.000783) → 0.548809 - (0.548809 * 0.000783).

Compute 0.548809 * 0.000783:

0.548809 * 0.0007 ≈ 0.0003841663.

0.548809 * 0.000083 ≈ about 0.00004544. So total is approximately 0.0003841663 + 0.00004544 ≈ 0.0004296.

So subtracting from 0.548809 → 0.548809 - 0.0004296 ≈ 0.5483794.

So e^-0.600783 ≈ 0.5483794.

Thus, 1 - e^-0.600783 ≈ 1 - 0.5483794 ≈ 0.4516206 → ≈ 45.16%.

So approximately 45.16% chance. Looking at the options, the closest is 44% or 48%. Wait, but none of the options exactly match 45%. Hmm.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because the options don't have 45%.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating λ. Let me recompute that.

We have P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ} → e^{-100λ} = 0.68.

Taking ln both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68) → λ = - (ln 0.68)/100.

Compute ln(0.68): let me get exact value.

ln(0.68) → using a calculator, it's approximately -0.400522.

So λ = 0.00400522 per minute.

Then, λt for t=150 is 0.00400522 *150 = 0.600783.

Now, e^-0.600783 → I'll compute it more accurately.

I can use a calculator for e^-0.600783.

Alternatively, using a Taylor series:

e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ... for x negative, it's 1/(e^{|x|} ), but that might not help. Alternatively, let me compute using a calculator-like approach.

But perhaps another approach: the exact value of e^-0.600783 is approximately 0.5478.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that 0.600783 is 0.6 + 0.000783.

So e^-(0.6 + 0.000783) = e^-0.6 * e^-0.000783 ≈ 0.548809 * (1 - 0.000783 + 0.000783^2/2 - ... )

Compute e^-0.000783 ≈ 1 - 0.000783 + (0.000783)^2 / 2.

(0.000783)^2 ≈ 6.13e-7, divided by 2 is 3.065e-7.

So e^-0.000783 ≈ 0.999217 + 0.0000003065 ≈ approximately 0.9992173.

So e^-0.600783 ≈ 0.548809 * 0.9992173 ≈ 0.548809 * 0.9992173.

Let me compute 0.548809 * 0.9992173.

0.548809 * 0.9992173 = 0.548809 * (1 - 0.0007827) → 0.548809 - (0.548809 * 0.0007827).

Compute 0.548809 * 0.0007827 ≈ 0.548809 * 0.0007 = 0.0003841663, plus 0.548809 * 0.0000827 ≈ approx 0.0000453.

Adding gives ≈ 0.0004294. So subtracting from 0.548809 → 0.548809 - 0.0004294 ≈ 0.5483796.

So e^-0.600783 ≈ 0.5483796 → 1 - 0.5483796 = 0.4516204, which is 45.16204%, so approximately 45.16%.

Looking at the options again, the options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%. Hmm, 45.16% isn't exactly any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have passed without decay. So the total time considered is 200 minutes, but the question is about the next 150. So perhaps I should calculate the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes.

So, the probability that the atom decays at any time between t=50 and t=200 is P = e^(-λ*50) * (1 - e^(-λ *150)).

Wait, no. Because the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes is e^(-λ *50), and the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is e^(-λ *50) * (1 - e^(-λ *150)).

But wait, that's the same as 1 - e^(-λ *200), which would be the probability of decaying within 200 minutes. But the question is about the next 150 minutes from now, which is 50 to 200. So the probability is [1 - e^(-λ *50)] * [1 - e^(-λ *150)]? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

The probability that the atom decays between t=a and t=b is P = e^(-λ a) - e^(-λ b).

So in this case, a is 50, b is 200. So P = e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200).

Wait, no, that's the probability that it decays between a and b. Because the survival function is e^(-λ t), so the probability of decaying between a and b is e^(-λ a) - e^(-λ b).

So for a=50, b=200:

P = e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ).

So let me compute that.

First, calculate e^(-50λ) where λ is 0.00400522.

50λ = 50 * 0.00400522 ≈ 0.200261.

e^(-0.200261) ≈ approximately 0.8187 (since e^-0.2 ≈ 0.8187).

e^(-200λ) → 200λ = 200 *0.00400522 ≈ 0.801044.

e^-0.801044 ≈ approximately 0.4493 (since e^-0.8 ≈ 0.4493).

So P = 0.8187 - 0.4493 ≈ 0.3694, which is 36.94%. But that's not matching any of the given options either. Hmm, that can't be right because the initial probability is 32% in 100 minutes, and 50 minutes have passed, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes should be higher than 32%, perhaps around 45% as computed earlier. Wait, but this approach gives 36.94%, which isn't matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I confused the approach. Let me think again. The correct formula for the probability that the atom decays between t=a and t=b is e^(-λ a) - e^(-λ b).

In our case, a=50, b=200.

So P = e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ).

So, with λ = 0.00400522.

Compute 50λ = 0.200261 → e^-0.200261 ≈ 0.8187 (as before).

200λ = 0.801044 → e^-0.801044 ≈ 0.4493.

So P = 0.8187 - 0.4493 = 0.3694, which is 36.94%. But this is about 37%, which isn't an option. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, no, the question is about the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, which is from 50 to 200. So using this approach, it's 37%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, regardless of the past, which would be 45%, as calculated earlier.

Wait, but the options don't have 45%. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is assuming that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes, so the decay constant λ is such that P(100) = 0.32. Then, the question is about P(150) as the next 150 minutes, regardless of the past. So that would be 45%, as before.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the decay probability is given as 32% within 100 minutes, but the actual formula is λ = ln(2) / half-life, but no, the question doesn't provide half-life information. So the approach with the exponential law is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the probability to be calculated as (0.32) * (150/100) = 48%. Because 32% is for 100 minutes, so per minute it's 0.32/100=0.0032 per minute. So for 150 minutes, 0.0032 *150 = 0.48 → 48%, which is option D.

But wait, that's not correct because the decay probability isn't linear with time. The formula 1 - e^(-λ t) isn't linear. So that approach would be wrong, but perhaps the problem assumes a linear probability. But that's not correct because the decay follows an exponential law.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved that way, assuming a linear probability. So 32% for 100 minutes → 0.32 per 100 minutes → 0.32/100 = 0.0032 per minute. Then, 150 minutes → 0.0032 *150 = 0.48 → 48%, which is option D.

But this approach is incorrect because the decay probability isn't linear. For small probabilities, it might be approximately linear, but not for 32% over 100 minutes.

Wait, but given the options, perhaps the intended approach was to use the linear approximation, leading to option D (48%). But the correct approach is the exponential one, which gives about 45%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, let me check the calculation of λ again. Maybe I made a mistake there.

Given P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ} → e^{-100λ} = 0.68 → ln(0.68) = -100λ → λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100.

Wait, ln(1/0.68) is the same as -ln(0.68), so λ = (0.400522)/100 = 0.00400522 per minute.

So for t=150, λt=0.00400522 *150 = 0.600783.

e^-0.600783 ≈ 0.5478 → 1 - 0.5478 = 0.4522 → 45.22%, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 50 minutes passed without decay, so the probability for the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes. So the calculation is correct, but the answer isn't an option. That's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of λ. Let me compute 100λ again. Wait, 100λ = 0.400522, so λ = 0.00400522 per minute.

Wait, perhaps when I calculated e^-0.600783, I made a mistake. Let me use a calculator for a more precise calculation.

e^-0.600783: 

I can use the Taylor series around x=0.6.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using a calculator function.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator for e^-0.600783.

But since I don't have a calculator, perhaps I can use a better approximation.

We know that e^0.6 = 1.82211880039 (approx).

Wait, but wait, e^0.6 is about 1.8221, so e^-0.6 is 1/1.8221 ≈ 0.5488.

But 0.600783 is 0.6 + 0.000783.

So, e^-0.600783 = e^-(0.6 + 0.000783) = e^-0.6 * e^-0.000783.

Compute e^-0.000783:

Using the Taylor expansion, e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x^3/6 for small x.

x = -0.000783.

So, e^-0.000783 ≈ 1 - 0.000783 + (0.000783)^2 / 2 - (0.000783)^3 / 6.

0.000783^2 = approx 0.000000613, so divided by 2 is 0.0000003065.

0.000783^3 ≈ 0.00000000048, divided by 6 is ~ 0.00000000008.

So e^-0.000783 ≈ 1 - 0.000783 + 0.0000003065 - 0.00000000008 ≈ 0.9992173065.

So e^-0.600783 ≈ 0.548809 * 0.9992173065 ≈ 0.548809 * (1 - 0.0007826935) → 0.548809 - (0.548809 * 0.0007826935).

Compute 0.548809 * 0.0007826935: 0.5488 * 0.0007 is 0.00038416, and 0.5488 * 0.0000826935 is approximately 0.00004533.

Adding gives 0.00042949.

So subtracting from 0.548809 → 0.548809 - 0.00042949 ≈ 0.5483795.

So e^-0.600783 ≈ 0.5483795 → 1 - 0.5483795 ≈ 0.4516205 → 45.16%.

But again, this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the half-life approach. Let me compute the half-life.

The decay constant λ is 0.00400522 per minute. The half-life T_1/2 is ln(2)/λ ≈ 0.6931 / 0.00400522 ≈ 173 minutes.

So, the half-life is about 173 minutes. So in 100 minutes, the decay probability is 32%, which makes sense.

Now, the question is, after 50 minutes, what's the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, the half-life is 173 minutes, which suggests that about 50% of the atoms decay by 173 minutes.

But the question is about 150 minutes, which is a bit less than a half-life. So the probability would be about 48% (since 150 is 86.7% of the half-life). But that's a rough approximation.

Wait, but using the exponential formula, 1 - e^(-lambda * t) where t=150 gives 1 - e^(-0.600783) ≈ 45.16%, which is close to 45%, but that's not an option.

So perhaps the intended approach is to model it as a linear probability. Let me think: 32% in 100 minutes → 0.32 per 100 minutes. So per minute, 0.32/100 = 0.0032.

Then, for 150 minutes, 0.0032 *150 = 0.48 → 48%, option D. But this is incorrect because the decay isn't linear. However, given the options, perhaps this is the intended approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the decay formula, leading to 45% and the closest option is A)44% or D)48%. Since 45% is closer to 44% than 48%, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e^-0.600783. Let me try another approximation.

Using a calculator, e^−0.600783 ≈ 0.5478, so 1 - 0.5478 = 0.4522 → 45.22% which is approximately 45%, but again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem actually considers that the next 150 minutes are added to the initial 50, making 200 minutes. So the probability of decaying within 200 minutes is 1 - e^(-0.00400522 *200) = 1 - e^(-0.801044).

e^-0.801044 ≈ 0.4493 → 1 - 0.4493 = 0.5507, which is 55.07%. But the question is about the next 150 minutes, not 200. So that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem.

The probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200. So the formula is P = e^(-λ*50) * (1 - e^(-λ *150)).

Wait, so P = e^(-λ*50) * [1 - e^(-λ*150)].

Compute each term:

e^(-λ*50) = e^(-0.00400522 *50) = e^(-0.200261) ≈ 0.8187.

[1 - e^(-λ*150)] = 1 - e^(-0.600783) ≈ 1 - 0.5478 → 0.4522.

So P = 0.8187 * 0.4522 ≈ 0.370. So 37%, which isn't an option. Hmm, that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the 32% is the decay probability within 100 minutes, and the question is about the next 150 minutes, irrespective of the past. So the calculation is 1 - e^(-lambda *150) which is 45%, but again, no option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula P = (0.32) * (150/100) = 48%, option D. Because the decay probability scales linearly with time. But this approach is incorrect because the decay follows an exponential law, not a linear one. However, given that the options don't include 45%, perhaps this is the intended approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to use the same formula but with t=150, leading to 45%, which is not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check the problem statement again. It says, "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." So P(100) = 0.32.

We know that P(t) = 1 - e^(-λ t).

So λ = ( - ln(1 - P(t)) ) / t → λ = (-ln(0.68))/100 → 0.004005 per minute.

Then, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-0.004005 *150) → 1 - e^(-0.60075) ≈ 45.16%.

Since this isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing a key point. Wait, the question says, "the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes." So from the current time, 50 minutes have passed, and the next 150 minutes are from now. So the time is 150 minutes from now, regardless of the past.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is asking for the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes given that 50 minutes have passed without decay. So this is a conditional probability.

The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B).

In this case, A is the event that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (from now), and B is the event that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.

So P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B).

But since the decay is memoryless, P(B and A) is the same as P(A), because knowing that B has occurred doesn't change the probability of A. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the probability that it has not decayed in 50 minutes is P(B) = e^(-λ *50).

The probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is e^(-λ *50) * (1 - e^(-λ *150)).

But the conditional probability P(A|B) is [e^(-λ *50) * (1 - e^(-λ *150))] / e^(-λ *50) ) → which simplifies to (1 - e^(-λ *150)).

Ah! So P(A|B) = 1 - e^(-λ *150). Which brings us back to the initial calculation of 45.16%, which isn't an option.

So perhaps the intended answer is 48%, assuming a linear approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the same approach as the given P(100) = 32%, so P(150) = (32% * 150)/100 = 48% → option D.

But that's not correct. So perhaps the intended answer is D)48%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to calculate the probability as 1 - (0.68)^(150/100) → which would be 1 - 0.68^1.5.

Wait, 0.68^1.5 = sqrt(0.68^3) ≈ sqrt(0.314) ≈ 0.5605.

So 1 - 0.5605 ≈ 0.4395 → 43.95% → approx 44%, option A.

Wait, where does this formula come from? Because for the decay, the survival probability after time t is e^(-λ t). But if someone incorrectly models it as (1 - P_initial)^(t/T), that would be wrong. So perhaps the problem's intended approach is using the same proportion in time, leading to option A (44%).

Alternatively, someone might model the survival probability as (0.68)^(t/100), which would be incorrect but leads to 0.68^(1.5) = approx 0.5605, so 1 - 0.5605 = 0.4395 → 44% → option A.

So perhaps the intended answer is A)44%.

But wait, that approach is wrong because the survival probability isn't multiplicative in time. It's exponential, not polynomial.

So I'm stuck between the correct calculation leading to 45% and the options not having that. But perhaps the intended answer is 44% or 48% based on a different approach.

Given the options, I'm more inclined towards the correct approach being 45%, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D)48%, assuming a linear probability.

But I'm not confident. Another way to think about it: since 100 minutes gives 32%, the decay constant λ is 0.004005 per minute. For 150 minutes, the probability is 1 - e^(-0.600783) ≈ 45.16%, which rounds to 45%, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that after 50 minutes, the remaining probability is (1 - 0.32)^(50/100) = 0.68^0.5 ≈ 0.8246. Then, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - (0.68)^(150/100) → 1 - 0.68^1.5 ≈ 1 - 0.5605 → 43.95%, which is 44%, option A.

But this approach is incorrect because the decay process isn't multiplicative in that way. It's exponential, not a simple power law. So perhaps the intended answer is 44%, option A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 45%, but it's not an option, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of λ. Let me compute λ again.

P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ} → e^{-100λ} = 0.68 → taking natural logarithm: ln(0.68) = -100λ → λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100 → ln(1.479289) ≈ 0.3905 → λ ≈ 0.003905 per minute.

Wait, wait! I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me compute ln(1/0.68) accurately.

1/0.68 is approximately 1.470588. So ln(1.470588) ≈ 0.3905.

So λ = 0.3905 / 100 ≈ 0.003905 per minute.

Ah! Earlier, I thought ln(0.68) was -0.4005, which is correct. So λ = 0.4005 /100 = 0.004005 per minute.

Wait, earlier I computed ln(0.68) as approximately -0.4005, which is correct. So lambda is 0.004005 per minute.

So then, for 150 minutes, t=150.

λt=0.004005 *150 = 0.60075.

e^-0.60075 is approximately 0.5478 → 1 - 0.5478 = 0.4522 → 45.22%, which is 45%, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done as if the decay constant was the same as the initial 32% in 100 minutes, leading to a probability of 48% for 150 minutes. But that's not correct, but perhaps the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the same calculation as the initial 32% for 100 minutes, so for 150 minutes, it's 32% * (150/100) = 48%, option D.

But this is an incorrect approach.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. The correct calculation leads to 45%, but that's not an option. Perhaps the intended answer is option D)48% based on the linear approach, even though it's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of λ. Let me recompute.

We have P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ} → e^{-100λ}=0.68 → ln(0.68)= -100λ → λ= (ln(1/0.68))/100 → ln(1.479289) ≈ 0.3905 → λ≈0.003905 per minute.

Wait, but earlier I thought ln(0.68) is -0.4005, so λ=0.004005 per minute.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in using the natural logarithm. Let me double-check.

Yes, I'm correct. ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005. So λ ≈0.004005 per minute.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is 44% (option A), based on an incorrect model where the survival probability is (0.68)^(t/100), leading to 0.68^1.5 ≈0.5605, so 1-0.5605=0.4395→44%.

But that's not the correct approach. The correct approach is exponential decay.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is A)44%, based on the incorrect approach, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is 45%, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D)48%.

But I'm not confident. Given the options, I think the intended answer is D)48%, based on the incorrect linear approach.


The problem involves calculating the probability that a radioactive atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. The decay follows an exponential law, where the probability of decay in a time interval \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

### Step 1: Determine the decay constant \( \lambda \)
From the problem, the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, i.e., \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using the decay formula:

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.4005 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.4005}{100} \approx 0.004005 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substitute \( \lambda \approx 0.004005 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.004005 \cdot 150 \approx 0.60075
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.60075}
\]

Using approximations for \( e^{-0.60075} \):

\[
e^{-0.60075} \approx 0.5478
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.5478 \approx 0.4522 \, \text{or} \, 45.22\%.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
The calculated probability of 45.22% does not exactly match any of the given options. However, the closest options are:

- **A) 44%**: This could correspond to an approximation or a slightly different calculation method.
- **D) 48%**: This might result from an incorrect linear assumption, where the probability scales directly with time (e.g., \( 32\% \cdot \frac{150}{100} = 48\% \)).

Given the options, the most reasonable choice is **A) 44%**, as it is closer to the calculated value of 45.22% than 48%.

### Conclusion
The correct calculation yields approximately 45.22%, but since this is not an option, the closest match is:

**Answer: A**
