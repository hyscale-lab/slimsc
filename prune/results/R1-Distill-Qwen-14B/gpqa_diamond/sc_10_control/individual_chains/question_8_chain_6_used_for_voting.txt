Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Let's break it down step by step. The question involves understanding gene interactions based on the results of various mutants.

So, the setup is that I have three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). Each mutant's resistance to anthracnose is given as a percentage of the wild-type control.

The control is 100% resistance, meaning that the wild-type plants are fully resistant. The other percentages are lower, so the lower the number, the more susceptible the plant is. 

The results are:
- g1: 75% → less resistant than wild-type, but not as bad as some others.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible, so the mutant can't resist the pathogen at all.
- g3: 50% → halfway in susceptibility.
- g1g3: 10% → very susceptible.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

Hmm. The problem states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So maybe one is a TF regulating the others, which in turn affect resistance.

I remember that in genetics, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the phenotype of B is only seen when A is functional. Alternatively, if a double mutant shows a more severe phenotype than either single, then perhaps the genes are in the same pathway, and their mutations add up.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2 is 0% → same as g2. So when both g1 and g2 are knocked out, it's as susceptible as g2 alone. Which suggests that g2 might be the one that's downstream, or perhaps g1 is upstream.

Wait, but in g2 alone, the resistance is 0%. So the presence of g2 mutation makes the plant completely susceptible. Similarly, the double mutants g1g3 and g2g3 are 10% and 0%, respectively.

Wait, in the double mutants, g1g3 is 10% and g2g3 is 0%. So g2g3 is as bad as g2 alone. Hmm.

Let me think about epistasis. Suppose that gene G2 is a transcription factor that's upstream of both G1 and G3. So if G2 is not working, then both G1 and G3 can't be expressed. So in g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 are active. Then, if G1 and G3 products are part of the same pathway, their double knockout might not be worse than g2 alone.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So the presence of g1 knockout doesn't change the fact that g2 is already at 0. So maybe G2 is upstream, and G1 is downstream, and they function in the same pathway?

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1. So in g2 mutant, G1 isn't expressed. When you have g1 knockout, you lose the gene product, but if G2 is a TF for G1, then g2 would have the same effect as g1. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, while g2 is 0%, which suggests that G2's knockout is worse. So G2 must be in a position where its function is more critical.

Wait, another angle: let's look at the double mutants.

The double mutant g1g2 is 0% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is same as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G1 is upstream of G2 or vice versa. Because in the presence of a downstream mutation, the upstream mutation doesn't add any effect beyond the downstream.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about epistatic relationships. Suppose that the pathway is G2 → G1 → something else. If G2 is upstream, then a mutation in G2 would prevent both G1 and any downstream genes from being active. So in that case, the double mutant g1g2 would not be more severe than the g2 mutant. So the resistance is same as g2, which is 0%. So that fits the data.

Similarly, looking at the double mutant g1g3. The resistance is 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%) but better than g2 and g2g3.

Wait, so what's the implication of the double mutant g1g3? The resistance is 10%, which is much worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So combining g1 and g3 makes things worse. That suggests that the two genes function in parallel pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, the double knockout wouldn't be worse than the more severe single mutant. But here, 10% is worse than either 75% or 50%. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. So knocking both out leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

Wait, but let me think again. If the double mutant is worse than either single, that suggests that the two genes function in separate pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, the phenotype of the double mutant would be the same as the more severe single mutant.

So, for example, if G1 is in one pathway and G3 is in another, both contributing to resistance. So knocking out G1 makes resistance 75%, G3 makes it 50%, but knocking out both makes it 10%. So they're additive. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways.

But wait, in the double mutants g2g3 and g1g2, the resistance is same as g2. So like, for g2g3, it's 0% same as g2. So maybe G3 is downstream of G2. Or perhaps G2 is upstream of G3, but in that case, if G2 is not working, G3 can't function either.

Wait, but in the case of g3, the mutant is 50% resistance. So if G2 is a TF for G3, then in g2 mutants, G3 can't be expressed, so resistance drops. But in the data, g2 is 0%, whereas g3 is 50%, which is higher. So that's the opposite of what I'd expect. Because if G2 is a TF for G3, then in g2 mutant, G3 wouldn't be expressed, so g2 should be as bad as or worse than g3. But according to data, g3 is 50% resistance, which is better than g2's 0%.

Hmm, that's confusing. So perhaps G2 is a TF for G1, not G3.

Wait, let's think about the epistatic relationships. Let's consider G2 as the transcription factor. So G2 activates G1 and maybe G3.

If G2 is a TF, then in g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 products are made. So in the single mutants, g2 would have no resistance (0%). But in the data, g2's resistance is 0%, which fits.

Wait, but in the data, g1's resistance is 75%, which is better than g2. So perhaps G1 is downstream of G2, so in g1 knockouts, G2 is still functional, so the plant can still produce other factors for resistance. But when G2 is knocked out, then G1 can't be made, leading to 0% resistance.

Wait, but no, because in g1, the resistance is 75%, which is better than 0%. So maybe G1 is part of a separate pathway that doesn't require G2. Or perhaps G2 is upstream of G1, but there are other pathways.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates G1. So in g2, G1 isn't expressed, leading to lower resistance. But the data says g2 has 0% resistance, which is much lower than g1's 75%. So perhaps G2 is a master regulator that controls multiple genes, including G1 and G3.

Wait, so if G2 is a TF, then in g2, G1 and G3 are not expressed. So g2's resistance should be as bad as the worst of G1 and G3 knockouts. Since G2 is 0%, that suggests that without G2, both G1 and G3 are not functional, leading to complete susceptibility.

But then, in the g1 knockout, the resistance is 75%, which is better than the wild-type. Wait, no, wait. No, the wild-type is 100% resistance. So g1 is 75%, which is worse than wild-type. Because the control is 100% resistance, any lower means more susceptible.

So, in the wild type, the plant is 100% resistant. When the plant has g1, it's 75%, which is still relatively resistant. So maybe G1's product isn't critical, but it contributes.

But G2's knockout is 0% which is completely susceptible. So perhaps G2 is a key gene, maybe the transcription factor.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

g1g2 → 0% (same as g2). So even when G1 is also knocked out, the resistance doesn't get any worse than g2. That suggests that G2 is upstream of G1. Because in the absence of G2, G1 can't function. So knocking out G1 in addition to G2 doesn't make it worse because G1 wasn't functional to begin with.

So G2 is upstream of G1. So G2's product is needed for G1's expression.

Similarly, looking at g2g3 → 0%, same as g2. So whether G3 is knocked out or not, in the presence of g2, the resistance is 0%. So perhaps G3 is downstream of G2, but even without G3, the absence of G2 is enough to make the plant fully susceptible.

Wait, but in g3's single mutant, the resistance is 50%. So G3 alone contributes 50% of the resistance. So if G3 is only expressed when G2 is present, then in g2, G3 isn't expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in the data, g3 is 50%, meaning that without G2, G3 is expressed? Or perhaps G3 is expressed through another pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is expressed by G2, but without G2, G3 can't be expressed. But in the data, g3's resistance is 50%, which is better than 0% which would be if G3 relies entirely on G2.

Hmm, so perhaps G3 is expressed by a different pathway. Or maybe G2 activates G3, but G3 can be expressed at a lower level without G2.

Wait, but let's think about the double mutant g1g3. Its resistance is 10%. So the single mutants are g1 (75%), g3 (50%). The double mutant is 10%, which is worse than either. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, the double mutant would be as bad as the worse single mutant (75% in g1, but the double is worse than that), so perhaps they are in parallel pathways.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to model the possible interactions.

Option A says G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic over G1.

Wait, pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. But in this case, I'm not sure if G2 and G3 are showing pleiotropy. Or perhaps it's that their mutations affect other traits, but maybe not relevant. 

Alternatively, gene redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking both out would lead to a worse phenotype than either single.

Which fits with the g1g3 double mutant being 10%, worse than both.

So let's think about redundancy. If G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning they can substitute for each other, then knocking out one (g1 or g3) reduces resistance, but knocking out both (g1g3) would reduce it further.

In the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50% → knocking out both would lead to 75 + 50 - 100 = 25%? Wait, that's additive. But the actual is 10%, which is worse than both, so perhaps they are in the same pathway.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So without either, the resistance is additive. So g1g3 would be additive, 75% + 50% minus 100% would be 25%, but the data says 10%, which is less than 25. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternate approach: let's look at the options.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 are pleiotropic, G2 epistatic towards G1.

If G1 is a TF, then in g1, G1's targets wouldn't be expressed. But according to the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which isn't zero. So maybe G1 is a TF for other genes. But the problem states that at least one gene is a TF. So G1 could be that TF.

But G2 is 0% → if G2 is epistatic over G1, that would mean that the presence of G2 mutation masks the effect of G1. So the phenotype of G2 knockout is seen regardless of G1's status. Which fits with the data: in the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is same as g2.

So G2 being epistatic to G1 would suggest that G2 is downstream of G1. Because epistatic genes are downstream. So if G2 is downstream, then a mutation in G2 would determine the phenotype, regardless of G1.

Wait, so if G2 is downstream of G1, then G1's product would regulate G2. But in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So that aligns with G2 being downstream, as the G2 mutation is masking G1's effect.

But then, in the single mutant g1, resistance is 75%, which is better than 0%. So G1's knockout only partially impairs resistance, but G2's knockout completely does. So perhaps G2 is a key gene that's necessary for resistance, and G1 is a supporting gene.

Alternatively, if G2 is a TF for G1, then in g2, G1 can't be expressed. But according to the data, g2 is 0%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So that would fit if G2 is a TF for something more critical than G1.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy between G1 and G3 would mean that knocking out both would lead to a worse phenotype than either alone. Which matches the g1g3 double mutant at 10%, worse than both 75 and 50.

If G2 is the TF, then in g2, both G1 and G3 can't be expressed. So g2 is 0%, which is the same as when both are knocked out (g1g3 is 10%). Wait, but no, g1g3 is 10% while g2 is 0%. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, but if G2 is the TF for both G1 and G3, then in g2, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. So the resistance would be as bad as the worst of the G1 and G3 mutants. But in reality, g2 is 0%, which is worse than both G1 (75%) and G3 (50%).

So maybe G2 is a TF for a completely different pathway. So without G2, the plant has no resistance (0%). Without G1, the resistance is 75%, which is better than 0%, so perhaps G1 is part of a different pathway that contributes to resistance. Similarly, G3 alone contributes 50%.

Now, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that both contribute to resistance, and G2 is part of a separate, more critical pathway.

But then, what about the double mutants involving G2?

g1g2 is 0% → same as g2. So the presence of G1 knockout doesn't make it worse than g2. So perhaps G1 is in a pathway that is not critical when G2 is absent. So G2 is the main pathway, and G1 and G3 are in secondary pathways.

But then, what about g2g3? The resistance is 0%, same as g2. So even when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is same as g2. So perhaps G3 is part of the same main pathway as G2, but if G2 is knocked out, G3's status doesn't matter.

But earlier I thought G3 is in a different pathway. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the TF for G3, but not for G1. So in g2, G3 can't be expressed, so the resistance is same as g3's 50%? But in the data, g2 is 0%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G2 is a TF for both G1 and G3. So in g2, neither are expressed. So the plant's resistance would be the same as if both G1 and G3 are knocked out. But in the data, g2 is 0%, whereas the double mutant g1g3 is 10%. That's a discrepancy. Because if G2 knockouts also knock out G1 and G3, then g2 should be same as g1g3, but it's not.

Hmm. So this suggests that perhaps G2 isn't a TF for G1 and G3, but is part of a different pathway.

Wait, the question says at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So perhaps G2 is the TF.

If G2 is a TF, then in g2, the target genes (maybe including G1 and/or G3) are not expressed. So in g2, the gene products of those targets can't be made, leading to lower resistance.

So in this case, g2's resistance is 0%, which is very low. So perhaps G2 is a TF for a gene that's necessary for all resistance.

But in the single mutants, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in a different pathway or have some function that contributes to resistance, but not as critical as the pathway controlled by G2.

Now, considering the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% same as g2. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, resistance is same as g2. That suggests that G2 being knocked out is the main issue, and the absence of G1 doesn't add anything. So G2 is downstream of G1? Or perhaps G1 is upstream of G2. Wait, no. Because if G2 is a TF, and G1 is downstream, then knocking out G2 would prevent G1 from being expressed. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is better than g2's 0%, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps G1 is in a different pathway from G2. So G2 is a TF for another gene (say, G4) which is necessary for resistance. So in g2, G4 isn't expressed, leading to 0% resistance. Meanwhile, G1 and G3 are in a different pathway that contributes to some resistance.

But then, why is g1g2 0%? Because without G2, the main pathway is gone, so even without G1, the plant can't resist. So that fits.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, which is same as g2. So without G2, no resistance, regardless of G3.

So, in this scenario, G2 is a TF for a main pathway, and G1 and G3 are in a different pathway. But their knockout in combination leads to worse resistance.

Wait, but the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and each contributes a portion.

Wait, maybe the resistance is controlled by two pathways: the main one (regulated by G2) and a secondary one (with G1 and G3). So the main pathway (G2) is necessary for full resistance. The secondary pathway contributes some resistance but isn't enough on its own.

So, in wild-type, both pathways are active, giving 100% resistance.

In g2, the main pathway is gone, so resistance is 0% (only the secondary pathway is active, but without G2, perhaps the secondary pathway can't function? Or maybe the main pathway is the only one that matters.)

Wait, but if the main pathway is gone, perhaps the secondary pathway can't compensate, leading to 0% resistance. So in g2, the secondary pathway isn't active, hence 0%.

In g1, the secondary pathway is partially active through G3, giving 75% resistance. Or perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, which contributes 75% in g1, 50% in g3, and 10% when both are gone.

So, if I model it like that:

- G2 is a TF that activates a main pathway, which is critical for resistance. Without G2, main pathway is off, and the plant is completely susceptible (0%).

- G1 and G3 are in a secondary pathway, each contributing some level of resistance. Their combined effect is additive, so the double mutant (g1g3) has the sum of their contributions. But if the main pathway is functional, then the secondary might not be needed, or the main might dominate.

But wait, the data includes double mutants with G2:

- g1g2: 0% (same as g2), because the main pathway is gone.

- g2g3: 0% (same as g2).

So in these cases, the main pathway's absence dominates, so the secondary pathway's status doesn't matter.

But looking at the single mutants:

- g1: 75% → perhaps the secondary pathway is active, giving 75% resistance.

- g3: 50% → perhaps the secondary pathway is active, but less so.

Wait, but that would fit with G1 and G3 being in the same secondary pathway. So G1 contributes 25% (since without G1, resistance is 75% → 100% - 25% = 75% remaining) and G3 contributes 50% (100% - 50% = 50% remaining). But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is 100% -90% → so they contribute 90% loss when both are gone. Wait, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that each contribute to the secondary resistance. So without G1, you lose 25% of resistance, without G3 you lose 50%, and without both, you lose 75% (leaving 25% resistance). But the data says 10% resistance in g1g3. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the secondary pathway's contribution is multiplicative. So G1 contributes a factor of 0.75 (75% of 100%) and G3 contributes 0.5. So combined, 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375, which is 37.5% resistance. But the data says 10%, which doesn't fit.

I must be missing something. Let's think about epistatic relationships again. The fact that g1g2 is 0% suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. So the position of G2 is downstream of G1. Because, in the double mutant, the phenotype is same as the more severe (g2). So if the pathway is G1 → G2 → something, then the absence of G2 would mask the effect of G1.

Wait, but then why would g1 have 75% resistance? Because without G1, but G2 is present, the pathway is partially functional. So perhaps G1 is upstream of G2. So G1 may be a TF for G2.

If G1 is a TF for G2, then in g1, G2 isn't expressed. So g1 would have the same resistance as g2, but according to data, g1 is 75% and g2 is 0%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the pathway is G2 → G1 → some other genes. So G2 is a TF for G1. So in g2, G1 isn't expressed, leading to 0% resistance (because without G1, the downstream genes can't function). But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which suggests that G1's product isn't absolutely required, but contributes. So this doesn't fit because if G2 is upstream of G1, then g1 would have G2 functional, but G1 not. But in that case, G2 could activate other genes, leading to some resistance.

Wait, perhaps the pathway is: G2 → G1 and G3. So G2 is a TF for both G1 and G3.

In that case, g2 would have neither G1 nor G3 expressed. So in g2, resistance is 0%. 

g1 would have G2 and G3 expressed. Since G3 alone gives 50% resistance, but maybe G1 is not needed, why is g1 75%? Hmm, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and each contributes, but when G1 is knocked out, G3 can't compensate fully. 

Wait, let me think again. If G2 is a TF for both G1 and G3, then in g2 mutant, neither are expressed. So the plant can't make G1 or G3 products, leading to 0% resistance.

In g1 mutant, G2 is functional, so G3 is expressed. So the resistance should be same as g3, which is 50%. But according to data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. So perhaps G2 is a TF for a different gene, say G4, which is a master regulator for all resistance genes. So without G2, G4 can't be made, resistance is 0% (g2). Without G4, G1 and G3 can't be made. So the presence of G4 is necessary for G1 and G3 expression.

But then, in g1, G4 is present (since G2 is functional), so G3 is expressed, giving 50% resistance. But data says g1 is 75%, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF for G3, but G1 is in a different pathway, not regulated by G2.

So in g2, G3 isn't expressed, so resistance is 0% (same as g3's 50%? No, that doesn't fit). But wait, in the data, g2 is 0%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So perhaps G3 contributes 50% when active, but without G2, G3 is not active, leading to 0% resistance.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. If G2 is a TF for G3, then in g2, G3 can't be expressed. So g2's resistance would be same as when G3 is not expressed. But in the data, g3 is 50% (so when G3 isn't expressed, resistance is 50%). But in g2, which also can't express G3, the resistance is 0%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So that's a contradiction.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me try to look for the options and see which one fits.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So gene redundancy would mean that knocking out both G1 and G3 leads to a worse phenotype than either alone. Which is what the data shows (g1g3 is 10%, worse than 75 and 50).

If G2 is the TF, then in g2 the resistance is 0%. So G2 is necessary for their expression.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then in the absence of G2, both can't be expressed. But in the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is same as g2, which is 0%. So even when only G1 or G3 is knocked out (along with G2), the resistance is same as g2. So redundancy may not be the main factor here.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both (g1g3) without G2 would lead to 10% resistance. Which is worse than g2 (0%)? No, because 10% is worse than 0% in this context (lower resistance is worse). Wait, no, 0% is worse than 10% because 0% means all plants are infected, whereas 10% means only 10% are infected. Wait, no, the question says 100% is the level of resistance in the control. So 0% resistance means all plants are infected (no resistance). 10% resistance means 10% of the control's resistance level, which is low but not complete susceptibility.

Wait, in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%) and g3 (50%), but better than g2 (0%).

Hmm. So if G2 is a TF, then in g2, G1 and G3 can't be expressed. So in the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is same as g2 (0%). So why is the double mutant g1g3 10%?

Ah, because in that case, G2 is functional (since only G1 and G3 are knocked out). So G2 can still make sure that other genes necessary for resistance are expressed. Thus, without G1 and G3, but with G2, the plant has 10% resistance. So G1 and G3 must be part of a secondary pathway that contributes to resistance, and G2 is part of the main pathway.

So, that suggests that the main pathway (regulated by G2) gives the majority of resistance, and the secondary pathway (G1 and G3) adds some more. So without G2, you have 0% resistance. With G2 but without G1 and G3, you have 10% resistance.

So, in this scenario, G1 and G3 are in a secondary pathway that's additive to the main pathway.

But then, looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2, because main pathway is gone.

g2g3: 0% → same as g2.

g1g3: 10% → which is the contribution of the secondary pathway (since G2 is functional).

So, the data suggests that G2 is a transcription factor that controls the main pathway. G1 and G3 are in a secondary pathway, perhaps additive.

So, which option aligns with this? Let's look again.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that knocking out both G1 and G3 leads to a worse phenotype than either alone. Which fits with g1g3 being 10%, worse than g1 (75%) or g3 (50%).

Epistasis: G1 is epistatic towards G3. That means that the phenotype of G1 mutation masks the effect of G3. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is determined by G1's mutation. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and each contributes a part, so their combined knockout leads to additive loss.

Wait, but having redundancy implies that each gene can compensate for the other. So if they are redundant, then the double mutant should have the same phenotype as either single mutant. But in the data, the double mutant is worse, so perhaps they are not redundant, but additive.

Alternatively, perhaps redundancy is when their functions are the same, so the double mutant phenotype is same as the single. But in our case, the double is worse, so not redundant.

So perhaps the options are incorrect, but I have to choose from the given options.

Looking again, Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But if they were redundant, then knocking both out would have the same effect as either single mutant. But in the data, g1g3 is worse than either. So perhaps this is not redundancy.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but they are not redundant. So their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype.

But I'm not seeing a perfect fit. Let's think about the options again.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 are pleiotropic, G2 epistatic towards G1.

If G2 is epistatic over G1, then in cases where G2 is mutated, the effect of G1's mutation doesn't matter. So the resistance in g1g2 is same as g2. Which fits.

But if G1 is the TF, then in g1, G1's targets (maybe G2 and/or G3) aren't expressed. But according to data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is better than g2's 0%. So if G1 is a TF for G2, then in g1, G2 isn't expressed. But that would mean that resistance would be same as g2 (0%). But data says g1 is 75%, which is higher. So that doesn't fit.

So Option A is probably incorrect.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would mean they are part of the same operon or co-regulated. So knocking out G1 might affect G3's expression, but in the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, so that doesn't fit.

Epistasis: G3 is epistatic towards G1. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is same as g3. But data says it's 10%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are pleiotropic, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy here would mean that G1 and G3 affect multiple traits, but perhaps in resistance, they are part of the same pathway. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is same as g1. But the data says 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%, so that doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic towards G3.

But as discussed earlier, redundancy would mean that double mutant is same as single. But data says 10%, which is worse. So maybe this is not the right option.

Wait, but perhaps gene redundancy refers to their function, not their expression. So if G1 and G3 perform the same function, knocking out both would not make the resistance worse than the worst single mutant. But in our case, the double is worse, so perhaps they are not redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'redundancy' in the option is not about their function but about their regulation. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the double mutant g1g3. The resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So, in the presence of G2, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in a pathway that contributes to resistance when G2 is present.

So, the main pathway is regulated by G2 (so without G2, resistance is 0%). The secondary pathway is regulated by G1 and G3, which, when active, contribute some resistance. So when G2 is present, the plant has the main pathway (100%) plus some from the secondary (adding up to more than 100? No, that can't be. So perhaps the main and secondary pathways are additive but not exceeding 100%).

So, when only G1 is knocked out, the secondary pathway contributes 50% (so 100% from main, 50% from secondary → but it's given as 75% for g1. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pathway contributes 100% when G2 is present, and the secondary pathway only contributes when G2 is absent. But that's not the case, because in g1, G2 is present, so main pathway is on (100%), but g1 has 75% resistance. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think of it as two pathways that both contribute to resistance. The main pathway is controlled by G2 (so without G2, resistance is 0%). The secondary pathway is controlled by G1 and G3. So when G2 is present (g1 and g3 are single knockouts), the secondary pathway contributes some resistance, but the main pathway is fully active.

But in the data, g1 is 75% resistance. If the main pathway is 100%, then how does the secondary contribute only 75%? That doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the main pathway is not 100% but a portion, and the secondary adds to it.

Wait, perhaps I've been modeling this incorrectly. Let's try another approach.

If G2 is the TF, then when G2 is present, G1 and G3 are expressed. 

In g2 knockout, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed → resistance is 0% (the data matches).

In g1 knockout, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed → resistance is 50% (since G3 alone gives 50% resistance). But the data says g1 is 75% → which doesn't fit. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G1 contributes more than G3.

Wait, but the data says g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So perhaps when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10% (so 75 + 50 → 125, but that's more than 100). Alternatively, the combined resistance is additive.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in redundant pathways. So, in g1, G3 is functional, contributing 50% resistance. In g3, G1 is functional, contributing 75% resistance. But the data doesn't match that.

Wait, the data is:

g1 → 75% resistance.

g3 →50% resistance.

g1g3→10% resistance.

So, without G1, the resistance is 75% (so G1 contributes 25% loss).

Without G3, resistance is 50% (so G3 contributes 50% loss).

Without both, resistance is 90% loss (10% remaining).

So, 25 +50 =75, but the double mutant is 90% loss, which is more than additive. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their combined loss is more severe than additive.

So, if the pathway requires both G1 and G3 products for full function, then the absence of both would lead to a more severe phenotype.

Wait, but if they're in the same pathway, and each contributes, then absence of both would only lead to additive, but here it's worse than additive.

Alternatively, perhaps the two genes are in a linear pathway. For example, G1 produces a product that activates G3. So, without G1, G3 can't be made, leading to 0% resistance. But the data says g1 has 75% resistance, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 activate the same downstream gene. So, if either is present, the downstream gene is active. So, in g1, G3 is functional → resistance is same as g3 (50%). But data says g1 is 75%, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

I think I've gone around enough. Let me try to match the options with what I think.

From the data, the most important conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor because its knockout leads to 0% resistance, which is the most severe phenotype. Also, the double mutants involving G2 (g1g2, g2g3) both have 0% resistance, same as g2. That suggests that G2 is downstream of the other genes. Or, more accurately, that G2's function is necessary for all other genes.

But wait, no. If G2 is a TF, then without G2, G1 and G3 can't be expressed. So in g2, G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. So the 0% in g2 is because without G2, the other genes aren't expressed, and the plant can't resist the pathogen.

But in the single mutants g1 and g3, the resistance is higher, which suggests that those genes are expressed when G2 is present, and contribute to resistance.

So, the data seems to suggest that G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3. So G2's function is necessary for G1 and G3 to be expressed.

Now, looking at the double mutant g1g3, which has 10% resistance. Since G2 is present in this case (because only G1 and G3 are knocked out), G2 is expressed and can activate other genes. So the 10% resistance is due to some other mechanism that doesn't involve G1 or G3.

Wait, but that doesn't explain why g1g3 is 10% when G2 is functional. Because if G2 is functional, the main pathway (regulated by G2) should be active, giving 100% resistance. But the data says it's 10%, which is lower. So perhaps the main pathway is not all that's contributing, and the secondary pathway (G1 and G3) adds to it.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway as G2, but their combined knockout leads to some residual function.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let's think about the options and which one fits best.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined knockout would have the same effect as either single. But the data says 10%, which is worse. So redundancy isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so their combined knockout leads to additive effects. So their double mutant is worse than either single.

But the option says 'gene redundancy', which I thought implies that they are not additive but can compensate for each other.

Hmm.

Another angle: the fact that in the double mutants with G2 (g1g2 and g2g3), the resistance is same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So the options that have G2 as epistatic would fit.

Looking at the options, option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1. Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, the statement is about which gene is epistatic to another. For example, if G2 is epistatic to G1, then in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is same as g2.

In the data, g1g2 is same as g2, so G2 is epistatic to G1. So whichever option says G2 is epistatic to G1 would be correct.

Looking through options:

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1 → correct.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3 → but in double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So G1 is not epistatic towards G3.

So perhaps option A is better.

But earlier I thought that G2 is a TF, and in option A, G1 is a TF. So which is it?

The question states that at least one gene is a TF. So in option A, G1 is the TF, but the data suggests that G2 is more critical (0% resistance), which would make more sense if G2 is the TF.

So perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me summarize what each option states.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in g1g3, the resistance is same as g1. But the data says g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%). So option D's epistatic claim doesn't fit.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 are pleiotropic, G2 is epistatic to G1.

But if G1 is TF, then in g1, G1's targets (including G2 and G3) can't be expressed. So g1 should have same resistance as g2g3. But data says g1 is 75%, which is better than g2's 0% and g3's 50%. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the data:

- G2 is the only gene whose knockout leads to 0% resistance, which suggests it's the most critical. So G2 is likely the transcription factor.

In the double mutants:

- g1g2 and g2g3 are 0%, which is same as g2. So G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3.

Which means that G2 is downstream of G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out, the pathway is blocked, regardless of G1 or G3.

So the pathway is G1 → G2 → something, and G3 → G2 → something.

If G2 is the TF, then in g2, G1 and G3 are not expressed. So in g1, G2 is functional, so G3 is expressed. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is better than g3's 50%. So perhaps G1's expression contributes more to resistance than G3's.

So, in the presence of G2, the expression of G1 and G3 is possible. G1 contributes more to resistance than G3. So, when G1 is knocked out, only G3 is expressed, giving 50% resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than 50%. So perhaps in addition to G3, G1 also contributes to another part of the resistance pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. So the total resistance is the sum of both. So without G1, the resistance is 50% (only G3), but the data says 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are both part of the same pathway as G2, but when G2 is present, both are expressed, and their combined effect gives full resistance. Without one (g1 or g3), the other is still expressed, but gives less resistance.

So, in g1, G3 is expressed. But G3 alone only gives 50% resistance. But data says g1 is 75% → which is higher than 50%. So perhaps G1 is expressed in a different pathway that also contributes.

This is getting complicated. I think I need to make a decision based on the options.

The correct answer is likely option D: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but earlier I thought redundancy would mean that the double mutant would have same as single. But the data says it's worse.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: look for which option correctly describes the epistatic relationships.

From the data:

- g1g2 is same as g2 → G2 is epistatic to G1.

- g2g3 same as g2 → G2 is epistatic to G3.

So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

So, looking at the options, which have G2 as epistatic towards G1 and G3.

Looking at option A: G2 is epistatic over G1. But what about G3? The option doesn't mention G3. So perhaps the correct option would have G2 as epistatic to both.

But looking again:

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1 → yes.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3 → no.

So perhaps the correct option is A. But earlier, the option A says G1 is a TF, which may not fit.

Wait, but the question says at least one is a TF. So if G2 is the TF, then:

Which option has G2 as TF and G2 epistatic to both G1 and G3?

Looking at the options:

Option D says G2 is TF. So option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But in the data, when G1 and G3 are both knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their combined knockout makes the pathway more defective. So perhaps they are in the same pathway, not redundant.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is option D.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps it's time to look for the answer based on the data.

In the data, the only double mutant with a worse phenotype than either single is g1g3. Others (g1g2 and g2g3) are same as g2.

So, the only case where the double mutant is worse than either single is when both G1 and G3 are knocked out. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. So their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype.

But the options don't seem to directly address this.

Wait, thinking about epistasis, when two genes are in the same pathway, their double mutant is same as the more severe single mutant. But when they're in different pathways, the double mutant is worse than either.

So, in our case, g1g3 is worse than either, so G1 and G3 are in separate pathways.

But the question states that at least one is a TF, which is probably G2.

So, if G2 is a TF, then in g2, G1 and G3 are not expressed. So in the presence of G2 (g1 and g3 single mutants), G1 and G3 are expressed.

So, when G2 is present, G1 and G3 are expressed, but when they're knocked out, their absence reduces resistance.

Thus, the main conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that contribute to resistance. Their combined knockout (g1g3) leads to a more severe phenotype.

Looking at the options, option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm. If G1 and G3 are redundant, their double mutant would be same as single. But data says worse, so that's not right.

Option D must not be correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is determined by G1's mutation, which is 75% (if only G1 is knocked out). But the data says it's 10%, which is worse than both. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I'll go with option D because in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is more severe than either, suggesting that G1 and G3 have independent contributions. So perhaps they are in separate pathways, and G2 is the TF. But none of the options perfectly fit.

Wait, looking again, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But in our case, the double mutant is worse than either, which is opposite of redundancy. So perhaps the correct option is none of them, but among the options, D might be the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. But I'm not sure.

I think I'll go with option D, but I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing the interaction of three candidate genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine to determine their roles in resistance to anthracnose. The data provided includes resistance levels of single mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3), with resistance measured as a percentage of the wild-type control. The goal is to deduce the genetic relationships and interactions among these genes.

### Key Observations:
1. **Resistance Levels**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (worse than wild-type but better than g2 and g2g3).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible, the most severe phenotype).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (moderate susceptibility).
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either g1 or g3 individually).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).

2. **Epistasis**:
   - The double mutants **g1g2** and **g2g3** have the same resistance as **g2**, indicating that **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**. This suggests that G2 is downstream or critical for the function of G1 and G3.
   - The double mutant **g1g3** has a resistance of 10%, which is worse than either **g1 (75%)** or **g3 (50%)**. This indicates that **G1 and G3 are in separate pathways contributing to resistance**, and their combined knockout leads to additive or synergistic effects.

3. **Transcription Factor Role**:
   - The data suggests that **G2 is likely the transcription factor** because its knockout (g2) results in the most severe phenotype (0% resistance), indicating that G2 is essential for activating downstream genes, including G1 and G3.

4. **Redundancy and Pleiotropy**:
   - **Gene redundancy** would imply that knocking out both G1 and G3 would not result in a worse phenotype than the single mutants. However, the double mutant **g1g3** (10%) is worse than either single mutant, ruling out redundancy.
   - **Pleiotropy** refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits. While the question mentions pleiotropy as a possibility, the data does not strongly support this for G2 or G3.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.
  - This is inconsistent with the data because G2, not G1, appears to be the transcription factor (as g2 has the most severe phenotype). Additionally, pleiotropy is not strongly supported by the resistance data.

- **Option B**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.
  - While G2 is likely the transcription factor, there is no evidence that G1 and G3 share the same promoter. Furthermore, the data does not support G3 being epistatic to G1, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

- **Option C**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.
  - This is partially correct in identifying G2 as the transcription factor, but pleiotropy is not strongly supported. Additionally, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

- **Option D**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.
  - This is partially correct in identifying G2 as the transcription factor. However, redundancy is not supported because the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant. Additionally, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly suggests that **G2 is the transcription factor**, and **G1 and G3 are in separate pathways contributing to resistance**. Their combined knockout (g1g3) results in a more severe phenotype than either single mutant, indicating additive or synergistic effects. While none of the options perfectly fit the data, **Option D** is the closest, as it correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and acknowledges the interaction between G1 and G3, even though the term "redundancy" is not fully accurate.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Let's break it down step by step. The question involves understanding gene interactions based on the results of various mutants.

So, the setup is that I have three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). Each mutant's resistance to anthracnose is given as a percentage of the wild-type control.

The control is 100% resistance, meaning that the wild-type plants are fully resistant. The other percentages are lower, so the lower the number, the more susceptible the plant is. 

The results are:
- g1: 75% → less resistant than wild-type, but not as bad as some others.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible, so the mutant can't resist the pathogen at all.
- g3: 50% → halfway in susceptibility.
- g1g3: 10% → very susceptible.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

Hmm. The problem states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So maybe one is a TF regulating the others, which in turn affect resistance.

I remember that in genetics, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the phenotype of B is only seen when A is functional. Alternatively, if a double mutant shows a more severe phenotype than either single, then perhaps the genes are in the same pathway, and their mutations add up.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2 is 0% → same as g2. So when both g1 and g2 are knocked out, it's as susceptible as g2 alone. Which suggests that g2 might be the one that's downstream, or perhaps g1 is upstream.

Wait, but in g2 alone, the resistance is 0%. So the presence of g2 mutation makes the plant completely susceptible. Similarly, the double mutants g1g3 and g2g3 are 10% and 0%, respectively.

Wait, in the double mutants, g1g3 is 10% and g2g3 is 0%. So g2g3 is as bad as g2 alone. Hmm.

Let me think about epistasis. Suppose that gene G2 is a transcription factor that's upstream of both G1 and G3. So if G2 is not working, then both G1 and G3 can't be expressed. So in g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 are active. Then, if G1 and G3 products are part of the same pathway, their double knockout might not be worse than g2 alone.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So the presence of g1 knockout doesn't change the fact that g2 is already at 0. So maybe G2 is upstream, and G1 is downstream, and they function in the same pathway?

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1. So in g2 mutant, G1 isn't expressed. When you have g1 knockout, you lose the gene product, but if G2 is a TF for G1, then g2 would have the same effect as g1. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, while g2 is 0%, which suggests that G2's knockout is worse. So G2 must be in a position where its function is more critical.

Wait, another angle: let's look at the double mutants.

The double mutant g1g2 is 0% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is same as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G1 is upstream of G2 or vice versa. Because in the presence of a downstream mutation, the upstream mutation doesn't add any effect beyond the downstream.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about epistatic relationships. Suppose that the pathway is G2 → G1 → something else. If G2 is upstream, then a mutation in G2 would prevent both G1 and any downstream genes from being active. So in that case, the double mutant g1g2 would not be more severe than the g2 mutant. So the resistance is same as g2, which is 0%. So that fits the data.

Similarly, looking at the double mutant g1g3. The resistance is 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%) but better than g2 and g2g3.

Wait, so what's the implication of the double mutant g1g3? The resistance is 10%, which is much worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So combining g1 and g3 makes things worse. That suggests that the two genes function in parallel pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, the double knockout wouldn't be worse than the more severe single mutant. But here, 10% is worse than either 75% or 50%. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. So knocking both out leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

Wait, but let me think again. If the double mutant is worse than either single, that suggests that the two genes function in separate pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, the phenotype of the double mutant would be the same as the more severe single mutant.

So, for example, if G1 is in one pathway and G3 is in another, both contributing to resistance. So knocking out G1 makes resistance 75%, G3 makes it 50%, but knocking out both makes it 10%. So they're additive. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways.

But wait, in the double mutants g2g3 and g1g2, the resistance is same as g2. So like, for g2g3, it's 0% same as g2. So maybe G3 is downstream of G2. Or perhaps G2 is upstream of G3, but in that case, if G2 is not working, G3 can't function either.

Wait, but in the case of g3, the mutant is 50% resistance. So if G2 is a TF for G3, then in g2 mutants, G3 can't be expressed, so resistance drops. But in the data, g2 is 0%, whereas g3 is 50%, which is higher. So that's the opposite of what I'd expect. Because if G2 is a TF for G3, then in g2 mutant, G3 wouldn't be expressed, so g2 should be as bad as or worse than g3. But according to data, g3 is 50% resistance, which is better than g2's 0%.

Hmm, that's confusing. So perhaps G2 is a TF for G1, not G3.

Wait, let's think about the epistatic relationships. Let's consider G2 as the transcription factor. So G2 activates G1 and maybe G3.

If G2 is a TF, then in g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 products are made. So in the single mutants, g2 would have no resistance (0%). But in the data, g2's resistance is 0%, which fits.

Wait, but in the data, g1's resistance is 75%, which is better than g2. So perhaps G1 is downstream of G2, so in g1 knockouts, G2 is still functional, so the plant can still produce other factors for resistance. But when G2 is knocked out, then G1 can't be made, leading to 0% resistance.

Wait, but no, because in g1, the resistance is 75%, which is better than 0%. So maybe G1 is part of a separate pathway that doesn't require G2. Or perhaps G2 is upstream of G1, but there are other pathways.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates G1. So in g2, G1 isn't expressed, leading to lower resistance. But the data says g2 has 0% resistance, which is much lower than g1's 75%. So perhaps G2 is a master regulator that controls multiple genes, including G1 and G3.

Wait, so if G2 is a TF, then in g2, G1 and G3 are not expressed. So g2's resistance should be as bad as the worst of G1 and G3 knockouts. Since G2 is 0%, that suggests that without G2, both G1 and G3 are not functional, leading to complete susceptibility.

But then, in the g1 knockout, the resistance is 75%, which is better than the wild-type. Wait, no, wait. No, the wild-type is 100% resistance. So g1 is 75%, which is worse than wild-type. Because the control is 100% resistance, any lower means more susceptible.

So, in the wild type, the plant is 100% resistant. When the plant has g1, it's 75%, which is still relatively resistant. So maybe G1's product isn't critical, but it contributes.

But G2's knockout is 0% which is completely susceptible. So perhaps G2 is a key gene, maybe the transcription factor.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

g1g2 → 0% (same as g2). So even when G1 is also knocked out, the resistance doesn't get any worse than g2. That suggests that G2 is upstream of G1. Because in the absence of G2, G1 can't function. So knocking out G1 in addition to G2 doesn't make it worse because G1 wasn't functional to begin with.

So G2 is upstream of G1. So G2's product is needed for G1's expression.

Similarly, looking at g2g3 → 0%, same as g2. So whether G3 is knocked out or not, in the presence of g2, the resistance is 0%. So perhaps G3 is downstream of G2, but even without G3, the absence of G2 is enough to make the plant fully susceptible.

Wait, but in g3's single mutant, the resistance is 50%. So G3 alone contributes 50% of the resistance. So if G3 is only expressed when G2 is present, then in g2, G3 isn't expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in the data, g3 is 50%, meaning that without G2, G3 is expressed? Or perhaps G3 is expressed through another pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is expressed by G2, but without G2, G3 can't be expressed. But in the data, g3's resistance is 50%, which is better than 0% which would be if G3 relies entirely on G2.

Hmm, so perhaps G3 is expressed by a different pathway. Or maybe G2 activates G3, but G3 can be expressed at a lower level without G2.

Wait, but let's think about the double mutant g1g3. Its resistance is 10%. So the single mutants are g1 (75%), g3 (50%). The double mutant is 10%, which is worse than either. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, the double mutant would be as bad as the worse single mutant (75% in g1, but the double is worse than that), so perhaps they are in parallel pathways.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to model the possible interactions.

Option A says G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic over G1.

Wait, pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. But in this case, I'm not sure if G2 and G3 are showing pleiotropy. Or perhaps it's that their mutations affect other traits, but maybe not relevant. 

Alternatively, gene redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking both out would lead to a worse phenotype than either single.

Which fits with the g1g3 double mutant being 10%, worse than both.

So let's think about redundancy. If G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning they can substitute for each other, then knocking out one (g1 or g3) reduces resistance, but knocking out both (g1g3) would reduce it further.

In the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50% → knocking out both would lead to 75 + 50 - 100 = 25%? Wait, that's additive. But the actual is 10%, which is worse than both, so perhaps they are in the same pathway.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So without either, the resistance is additive. So g1g3 would be additive, 75% + 50% minus 100% would be 25%, but the data says 10%, which is less than 25. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternate approach: let's look at the options.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 are pleiotropic, G2 epistatic towards G1.

If G1 is a TF, then in g1, G1's targets wouldn't be expressed. But according to the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which isn't zero. So maybe G1 is a TF for other genes. But the problem states that at least one gene is a TF. So G1 could be that TF.

But G2 is 0% → if G2 is epistatic over G1, that would mean that the presence of G2 mutation masks the effect of G1. So the phenotype of G2 knockout is seen regardless of G1's status. Which fits with the data: in the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is same as g2.

So G2 being epistatic to G1 would suggest that G2 is downstream of G1. Because epistatic genes are downstream. So if G2 is downstream, then a mutation in G2 would determine the phenotype, regardless of G1.

Wait, so if G2 is downstream of G1, then G1's product would regulate G2. But in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So that aligns with G2 being downstream, as the G2 mutation is masking G1's effect.

But then, in the single mutant g1, resistance is 75%, which is better than 0%. So G1's knockout only partially impairs resistance, but G2's knockout completely does. So perhaps G2 is a key gene that's necessary for resistance, and G1 is a supporting gene.

Alternatively, if G2 is a TF for G1, then in g2, G1 can't be expressed. But according to the data, g2 is 0%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So that would fit if G2 is a TF for something more critical than G1.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy between G1 and G3 would mean that knocking out both would lead to a worse phenotype than either alone. Which matches the g1g3 double mutant at 10%, worse than both 75 and 50.

If G2 is the TF, then in g2, both G1 and G3 can't be expressed. So g2 is 0%, which is the same as when both are knocked out (g1g3 is 10%). Wait, but no, g1g3 is 10% while g2 is 0%. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, but if G2 is the TF for both G1 and G3, then in g2, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. So the resistance would be as bad as the worst of the G1 and G3 mutants. But in reality, g2 is 0%, which is worse than both G1 (75%) and G3 (50%).

So maybe G2 is a TF for a completely different pathway. So without G2, the plant has no resistance (0%). Without G1, the resistance is 75%, which is better than 0%, so perhaps G1 is part of a different pathway that contributes to resistance. Similarly, G3 alone contributes 50%.

Now, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that both contribute to resistance, and G2 is part of a separate, more critical pathway.

But then, what about the double mutants involving G2?

g1g2 is 0% → same as g2. So the presence of G1 knockout doesn't make it worse than g2. So perhaps G1 is in a pathway that is not critical when G2 is absent. So G2 is the main pathway, and G1 and G3 are in secondary pathways.

But then, what about g2g3? The resistance is 0%, same as g2. So even when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is same as g2. So perhaps G3 is part of the same main pathway as G2, but if G2 is knocked out, G3's status doesn't matter.

But earlier I thought G3 is in a different pathway. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the TF for G3, but not for G1. So in g2, G3 can't be expressed, so the resistance is same as g3's 50%? But in the data, g2 is 0%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G2 is a TF for both G1 and G3. So in g2, neither are expressed. So the plant's resistance would be the same as if both G1 and G3 are knocked out. But in the data, g2 is 0%, whereas the double mutant g1g3 is 10%. That's a discrepancy. Because if G2 knockouts also knock out G1 and G3, then g2 should be same as g1g3, but it's not.

Hmm. So this suggests that perhaps G2 isn't a TF for G1 and G3, but is part of a different pathway.

Wait, the question says at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So perhaps G2 is the TF.

If G2 is a TF, then in g2, the target genes (maybe including G1 and/or G3) are not expressed. So in g2, the gene products of those targets can't be made, leading to lower resistance.

So in this case, g2's resistance is 0%, which is very low. So perhaps G2 is a TF for a gene that's necessary for all resistance.

But in the single mutants, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in a different pathway or have some function that contributes to resistance, but not as critical as the pathway controlled by G2.

Now, considering the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% same as g2. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, resistance is same as g2. That suggests that G2 being knocked out is the main issue, and the absence of G1 doesn't add anything. So G2 is downstream of G1? Or perhaps G1 is upstream of G2. Wait, no. Because if G2 is a TF, and G1 is downstream, then knocking out G2 would prevent G1 from being expressed. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is better than g2's 0%, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps G1 is in a different pathway from G2. So G2 is a TF for another gene (say, G4) which is necessary for resistance. So in g2, G4 isn't expressed, leading to 0% resistance. Meanwhile, G1 and G3 are in a different pathway that contributes to some resistance.

But then, why is g1g2 0%? Because without G2, the main pathway is gone, so even without G1, the plant can't resist. So that fits.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, which is same as g2. So without G2, no resistance, regardless of G3.

So, in this scenario, G2 is a TF for a main pathway, and G1 and G3 are in a different pathway. But their knockout in combination leads to worse resistance.

Wait, but the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and each contributes a portion.

Wait, maybe the resistance is controlled by two pathways: the main one (regulated by G2) and a secondary one (with G1 and G3). So the main pathway (G2) is necessary for full resistance. The secondary pathway contributes some resistance but isn't enough on its own.

So, in wild-type, both pathways are active, giving 100% resistance.

In g2, the main pathway is gone, so resistance is 0% (only the secondary pathway is active, but without G2, perhaps the secondary pathway can't function? Or maybe the main pathway is the only one that matters.)

Wait, but if the main pathway is gone, perhaps the secondary pathway can't compensate, leading to 0% resistance. So in g2, the secondary pathway isn't active, hence 0%.

In g1, the secondary pathway is partially active through G3, giving 75% resistance. Or perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, which contributes 75% in g1, 50% in g3, and 10% when both are gone.

So, if I model it like that:

- G2 is a TF that activates a main pathway, which is critical for resistance. Without G2, main pathway is off, and the plant is completely susceptible (0%).

- G1 and G3 are in a secondary pathway, each contributing some level of resistance. Their combined effect is additive, so the double mutant (g1g3) has the sum of their contributions. But if the main pathway is functional, then the secondary might not be needed, or the main might dominate.

But wait, the data includes double mutants with G2:

- g1g2: 0% (same as g2), because the main pathway is gone.

- g2g3: 0% (same as g2).

So in these cases, the main pathway's absence dominates, so the secondary pathway's status doesn't matter.

But looking at the single mutants:

- g1: 75% → perhaps the secondary pathway is active, giving 75% resistance.

- g3: 50% → perhaps the secondary pathway is active, but less so.

Wait, but that would fit with G1 and G3 being in the same secondary pathway. So G1 contributes 25% (since without G1, resistance is 75% → 100% - 25% = 75% remaining) and G3 contributes 50% (100% - 50% = 50% remaining). But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is 100% -90% → so they contribute 90% loss when both are gone. Wait, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that each contribute to the secondary resistance. So without G1, you lose 25% of resistance, without G3 you lose 50%, and without both, you lose 75% (leaving 25% resistance). But the data says 10% resistance in g1g3. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the secondary pathway's contribution is multiplicative. So G1 contributes a factor of 0.75 (75% of 100%) and G3 contributes 0.5. So combined, 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375, which is 37.5% resistance. But the data says 10%, which doesn't fit.

I must be missing something. Let's think about epistatic relationships again. The fact that g1g2 is 0% suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. So the position of G2 is downstream of G1. Because, in the double mutant, the phenotype is same as the more severe (g2). So if the pathway is G1 → G2 → something, then the absence of G2 would mask the effect of G1.

Wait, but then why would g1 have 75% resistance? Because without G1, but G2 is present, the pathway is partially functional. So perhaps G1 is upstream of G2. So G1 may be a TF for G2.

If G1 is a TF for G2, then in g1, G2 isn't expressed. So g1 would have the same resistance as g2, but according to data, g1 is 75% and g2 is 0%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the pathway is G2 → G1 → some other genes. So G2 is a TF for G1. So in g2, G1 isn't expressed, leading to 0% resistance (because without G1, the downstream genes can't function). But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which suggests that G1's product isn't absolutely required, but contributes. So this doesn't fit because if G2 is upstream of G1, then g1 would have G2 functional, but G1 not. But in that case, G2 could activate other genes, leading to some resistance.

Wait, perhaps the pathway is: G2 → G1 and G3. So G2 is a TF for both G1 and G3.

In that case, g2 would have neither G1 nor G3 expressed. So in g2, resistance is 0%. 

g1 would have G2 and G3 expressed. Since G3 alone gives 50% resistance, but maybe G1 is not needed, why is g1 75%? Hmm, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and each contributes, but when G1 is knocked out, G3 can't compensate fully. 

Wait, let me think again. If G2 is a TF for both G1 and G3, then in g2 mutant, neither are expressed. So the plant can't make G1 or G3 products, leading to 0% resistance.

In g1 mutant, G2 is functional, so G3 is expressed. So the resistance should be same as g3, which is 50%. But according to data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. So perhaps G2 is a TF for a different gene, say G4, which is a master regulator for all resistance genes. So without G2, G4 can't be made, resistance is 0% (g2). Without G4, G1 and G3 can't be made. So the presence of G4 is necessary for G1 and G3 expression.

But then, in g1, G4 is present (since G2 is functional), so G3 is expressed, giving 50% resistance. But data says g1 is 75%, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF for G3, but G1 is in a different pathway, not regulated by G2.

So in g2, G3 isn't expressed, so resistance is 0% (same as g3's 50%? No, that doesn't fit). But wait, in the data, g2 is 0%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So perhaps G3 contributes 50% when active, but without G2, G3 is not active, leading to 0% resistance.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. If G2 is a TF for G3, then in g2, G3 can't be expressed. So g2's resistance would be same as when G3 is not expressed. But in the data, g3 is 50% (so when G3 isn't expressed, resistance is 50%). But in g2, which also can't express G3, the resistance is 0%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So that's a contradiction.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me try to look for the options and see which one fits.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So gene redundancy would mean that knocking out both G1 and G3 leads to a worse phenotype than either alone. Which is what the data shows (g1g3 is 10%, worse than 75 and 50).

If G2 is the TF, then in g2 the resistance is 0%. So G2 is necessary for their expression.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then in the absence of G2, both can't be expressed. But in the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is same as g2, which is 0%. So even when only G1 or G3 is knocked out (along with G2), the resistance is same as g2. So redundancy may not be the main factor here.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both (g1g3) without G2 would lead to 10% resistance. Which is worse than g2 (0%)? No, because 10% is worse than 0% in this context (lower resistance is worse). Wait, no, 0% is worse than 10% because 0% means all plants are infected, whereas 10% means only 10% are infected. Wait, no, the question says 100% is the level of resistance in the control. So 0% resistance means all plants are infected (no resistance). 10% resistance means 10% of the control's resistance level, which is low but not complete susceptibility.

Wait, in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%) and g3 (50%), but better than g2 (0%).

Hmm. So if G2 is a TF, then in g2, G1 and G3 can't be expressed. So in the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is same as g2 (0%). So why is the double mutant g1g3 10%?

Ah, because in that case, G2 is functional (since only G1 and G3 are knocked out). So G2 can still make sure that other genes necessary for resistance are expressed. Thus, without G1 and G3, but with G2, the plant has 10% resistance. So G1 and G3 must be part of a secondary pathway that contributes to resistance, and G2 is part of the main pathway.

So, that suggests that the main pathway (regulated by G2) gives the majority of resistance, and the secondary pathway (G1 and G3) adds some more. So without G2, you have 0% resistance. With G2 but without G1 and G3, you have 10% resistance.

So, in this scenario, G1 and G3 are in a secondary pathway that's additive to the main pathway.

But then, looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2, because main pathway is gone.

g2g3: 0% → same as g2.

g1g3: 10% → which is the contribution of the secondary pathway (since G2 is functional).

So, the data suggests that G2 is a transcription factor that controls the main pathway. G1 and G3 are in a secondary pathway, perhaps additive.

So, which option aligns with this? Let's look again.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that knocking out both G1 and G3 leads to a worse phenotype than either alone. Which fits with g1g3 being 10%, worse than g1 (75%) or g3 (50%).

Epistasis: G1 is epistatic towards G3. That means that the phenotype of G1 mutation masks the effect of G3. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is determined by G1's mutation. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and each contributes a part, so their combined knockout leads to additive loss.

Wait, but having redundancy implies that each gene can compensate for the other. So if they are redundant, then the double mutant should have the same phenotype as either single mutant. But in the data, the double mutant is worse, so perhaps they are not redundant, but additive.

Alternatively, perhaps redundancy is when their functions are the same, so the double mutant phenotype is same as the single. But in our case, the double is worse, so not redundant.

So perhaps the options are incorrect, but I have to choose from the given options.

Looking again, Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But if they were redundant, then knocking both out would have the same effect as either single mutant. But in the data, g1g3 is worse than either. So perhaps this is not redundancy.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but they are not redundant. So their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype.

But I'm not seeing a perfect fit. Let's think about the options again.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 are pleiotropic, G2 epistatic towards G1.

If G2 is epistatic over G1, then in cases where G2 is mutated, the effect of G1's mutation doesn't matter. So the resistance in g1g2 is same as g2. Which fits.

But if G1 is the TF, then in g1, G1's targets (maybe G2 and/or G3) aren't expressed. But according to data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is better than g2's 0%. So if G1 is a TF for G2, then in g1, G2 isn't expressed. But that would mean that resistance would be same as g2 (0%). But data says g1 is 75%, which is higher. So that doesn't fit.

So Option A is probably incorrect.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would mean they are part of the same operon or co-regulated. So knocking out G1 might affect G3's expression, but in the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, so that doesn't fit.

Epistasis: G3 is epistatic towards G1. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is same as g3. But data says it's 10%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are pleiotropic, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy here would mean that G1 and G3 affect multiple traits, but perhaps in resistance, they are part of the same pathway. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is same as g1. But the data says 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%, so that doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic towards G3.

But as discussed earlier, redundancy would mean that double mutant is same as single. But data says 10%, which is worse. So maybe this is not the right option.

Wait, but perhaps gene redundancy refers to their function, not their expression. So if G1 and G3 perform the same function, knocking out both would not make the resistance worse than the worst single mutant. But in our case, the double is worse, so perhaps they are not redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'redundancy' in the option is not about their function but about their regulation. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the double mutant g1g3. The resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So, in the presence of G2, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in a pathway that contributes to resistance when G2 is present.

So, the main pathway is regulated by G2 (so without G2, resistance is 0%). The secondary pathway is regulated by G1 and G3, which, when active, contribute some resistance. So when G2 is present, the plant has the main pathway (100%) plus some from the secondary (adding up to more than 100? No, that can't be. So perhaps the main and secondary pathways are additive but not exceeding 100%).

So, when only G1 is knocked out, the secondary pathway contributes 50% (so 100% from main, 50% from secondary → but it's given as 75% for g1. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pathway contributes 100% when G2 is present, and the secondary pathway only contributes when G2 is absent. But that's not the case, because in g1, G2 is present, so main pathway is on (100%), but g1 has 75% resistance. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think of it as two pathways that both contribute to resistance. The main pathway is controlled by G2 (so without G2, resistance is 0%). The secondary pathway is controlled by G1 and G3. So when G2 is present (g1 and g3 are single knockouts), the secondary pathway contributes some resistance, but the main pathway is fully active.

But in the data, g1 is 75% resistance. If the main pathway is 100%, then how does the secondary contribute only 75%? That doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the main pathway is not 100% but a portion, and the secondary adds to it.

Wait, perhaps I've been modeling this incorrectly. Let's try another approach.

If G2 is the TF, then when G2 is present, G1 and G3 are expressed. 

In g2 knockout, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed → resistance is 0% (the data matches).

In g1 knockout, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed → resistance is 50% (since G3 alone gives 50% resistance). But the data says g1 is 75% → which doesn't fit. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G1 contributes more than G3.

Wait, but the data says g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So perhaps when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10% (so 75 + 50 → 125, but that's more than 100). Alternatively, the combined resistance is additive.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in redundant pathways. So, in g1, G3 is functional, contributing 50% resistance. In g3, G1 is functional, contributing 75% resistance. But the data doesn't match that.

Wait, the data is:

g1 → 75% resistance.

g3 →50% resistance.

g1g3→10% resistance.

So, without G1, the resistance is 75% (so G1 contributes 25% loss).

Without G3, resistance is 50% (so G3 contributes 50% loss).

Without both, resistance is 90% loss (10% remaining).

So, 25 +50 =75, but the double mutant is 90% loss, which is more than additive. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their combined loss is more severe than additive.

So, if the pathway requires both G1 and G3 products for full function, then the absence of both would lead to a more severe phenotype.

Wait, but if they're in the same pathway, and each contributes, then absence of both would only lead to additive, but here it's worse than additive.

Alternatively, perhaps the two genes are in a linear pathway. For example, G1 produces a product that activates G3. So, without G1, G3 can't be made, leading to 0% resistance. But the data says g1 has 75% resistance, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 activate the same downstream gene. So, if either is present, the downstream gene is active. So, in g1, G3 is functional → resistance is same as g3 (50%). But data says g1 is 75%, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

I think I've gone around enough. Let me try to match the options with what I think.

From the data, the most important conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor because its knockout leads to 0% resistance, which is the most severe phenotype. Also, the double mutants involving G2 (g1g2, g2g3) both have 0% resistance, same as g2. That suggests that G2 is downstream of the other genes. Or, more accurately, that G2's function is necessary for all other genes.

But wait, no. If G2 is a TF, then without G2, G1 and G3 can't be expressed. So in g2, G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. So the 0% in g2 is because without G2, the other genes aren't expressed, and the plant can't resist the pathogen.

But in the single mutants g1 and g3, the resistance is higher, which suggests that those genes are expressed when G2 is present, and contribute to resistance.

So, the data seems to suggest that G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3. So G2's function is necessary for G1 and G3 to be expressed.

Now, looking at the double mutant g1g3, which has 10% resistance. Since G2 is present in this case (because only G1 and G3 are knocked out), G2 is expressed and can activate other genes. So the 10% resistance is due to some other mechanism that doesn't involve G1 or G3.

Wait, but that doesn't explain why g1g3 is 10% when G2 is functional. Because if G2 is functional, the main pathway (regulated by G2) should be active, giving 100% resistance. But the data says it's 10%, which is lower. So perhaps the main pathway is not all that's contributing, and the secondary pathway (G1 and G3) adds to it.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway as G2, but their combined knockout leads to some residual function.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let's think about the options and which one fits best.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined knockout would have the same effect as either single. But the data says 10%, which is worse. So redundancy isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so their combined knockout leads to additive effects. So their double mutant is worse than either single.

But the option says 'gene redundancy', which I thought implies that they are not additive but can compensate for each other.

Hmm.

Another angle: the fact that in the double mutants with G2 (g1g2 and g2g3), the resistance is same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So the options that have G2 as epistatic would fit.

Looking at the options, option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1. Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, the statement is about which gene is epistatic to another. For example, if G2 is epistatic to G1, then in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is same as g2.

In the data, g1g2 is same as g2, so G2 is epistatic to G1. So whichever option says G2 is epistatic to G1 would be correct.

Looking through options:

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1 → correct.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3 → but in double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So G1 is not epistatic towards G3.

So perhaps option A is better.

But earlier I thought that G2 is a TF, and in option A, G1 is a TF. So which is it?

The question states that at least one gene is a TF. So in option A, G1 is the TF, but the data suggests that G2 is more critical (0% resistance), which would make more sense if G2 is the TF.

So perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me summarize what each option states.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in g1g3, the resistance is same as g1. But the data says g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%). So option D's epistatic claim doesn't fit.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 are pleiotropic, G2 is epistatic to G1.

But if G1 is TF, then in g1, G1's targets (including G2 and G3) can't be expressed. So g1 should have same resistance as g2g3. But data says g1 is 75%, which is better than g2's 0% and g3's 50%. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the data:

- G2 is the only gene whose knockout leads to 0% resistance, which suggests it's the most critical. So G2 is likely the transcription factor.

In the double mutants:

- g1g2 and g2g3 are 0%, which is same as g2. So G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3.

Which means that G2 is downstream of G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out, the pathway is blocked, regardless of G1 or G3.

So the pathway is G1 → G2 → something, and G3 → G2 → something.

If G2 is the TF, then in g2, G1 and G3 are not expressed. So in g1, G2 is functional, so G3 is expressed. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is better than g3's 50%. So perhaps G1's expression contributes more to resistance than G3's.

So, in the presence of G2, the expression of G1 and G3 is possible. G1 contributes more to resistance than G3. So, when G1 is knocked out, only G3 is expressed, giving 50% resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than 50%. So perhaps in addition to G3, G1 also contributes to another part of the resistance pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. So the total resistance is the sum of both. So without G1, the resistance is 50% (only G3), but the data says 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are both part of the same pathway as G2, but when G2 is present, both are expressed, and their combined effect gives full resistance. Without one (g1 or g3), the other is still expressed, but gives less resistance.

So, in g1, G3 is expressed. But G3 alone only gives 50% resistance. But data says g1 is 75% → which is higher than 50%. So perhaps G1 is expressed in a different pathway that also contributes.

This is getting complicated. I think I need to make a decision based on the options.

The correct answer is likely option D: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but earlier I thought redundancy would mean that the double mutant would have same as single. But the data says it's worse.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: look for which option correctly describes the epistatic relationships.

From the data:

- g1g2 is same as g2 → G2 is epistatic to G1.

- g2g3 same as g2 → G2 is epistatic to G3.

So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

So, looking at the options, which have G2 as epistatic towards G1 and G3.

Looking at option A: G2 is epistatic over G1. But what about G3? The option doesn't mention G3. So perhaps the correct option would have G2 as epistatic to both.

But looking again:

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1 → yes.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3 → no.

So perhaps the correct option is A. But earlier, the option A says G1 is a TF, which may not fit.

Wait, but the question says at least one is a TF. So if G2 is the TF, then:

Which option has G2 as TF and G2 epistatic to both G1 and G3?

Looking at the options:

Option D says G2 is TF. So option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But in the data, when G1 and G3 are both knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their combined knockout makes the pathway more defective. So perhaps they are in the same pathway, not redundant.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is option D.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps it's time to look for the answer based on the data.

In the data, the only double mutant with a worse phenotype than either single is g1g3. Others (g1g2 and g2g3) are same as g2.

So, the only case where the double mutant is worse than either single is when both G1 and G3 are knocked out. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. So their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype.

But the options don't seem to directly address this.

Wait, thinking about epistasis, when two genes are in the same pathway, their double mutant is same as the more severe single mutant. But when they're in different pathways, the double mutant is worse than either.

So, in our case, g1g3 is worse than either, so G1 and G3 are in separate pathways.

But the question states that at least one is a TF, which is probably G2.

So, if G2 is a TF, then in g2, G1 and G3 are not expressed. So in the presence of G2 (g1 and g3 single mutants), G1 and G3 are expressed.

So, when G2 is present, G1 and G3 are expressed, but when they're knocked out, their absence reduces resistance.

Thus, the main conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that contribute to resistance. Their combined knockout (g1g3) leads to a more severe phenotype.

Looking at the options, option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm. If G1 and G3 are redundant, their double mutant would be same as single. But data says worse, so that's not right.

Option D must not be correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is determined by G1's mutation, which is 75% (if only G1 is knocked out). But the data says it's 10%, which is worse than both. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I'll go with option D because in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is more severe than either, suggesting that G1 and G3 have independent contributions. So perhaps they are in separate pathways, and G2 is the TF. But none of the options perfectly fit.

Wait, looking again, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But in our case, the double mutant is worse than either, which is opposite of redundancy. So perhaps the correct option is none of them, but among the options, D might be the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. But I'm not sure.

I think I'll go with option D, but I'm not entirely confident.


The question involves analyzing the interaction of three candidate genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine to determine their roles in resistance to anthracnose. The data provided includes resistance levels of single mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3), with resistance measured as a percentage of the wild-type control. The goal is to deduce the genetic relationships and interactions among these genes.

### Key Observations:
1. **Resistance Levels**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (worse than wild-type but better than g2 and g2g3).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible, the most severe phenotype).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (moderate susceptibility).
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either g1 or g3 individually).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).

2. **Epistasis**:
   - The double mutants **g1g2** and **g2g3** have the same resistance as **g2**, indicating that **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**. This suggests that G2 is downstream or critical for the function of G1 and G3.
   - The double mutant **g1g3** has a resistance of 10%, which is worse than either **g1 (75%)** or **g3 (50%)**. This indicates that **G1 and G3 are in separate pathways contributing to resistance**, and their combined knockout leads to additive or synergistic effects.

3. **Transcription Factor Role**:
   - The data suggests that **G2 is likely the transcription factor** because its knockout (g2) results in the most severe phenotype (0% resistance), indicating that G2 is essential for activating downstream genes, including G1 and G3.

4. **Redundancy and Pleiotropy**:
   - **Gene redundancy** would imply that knocking out both G1 and G3 would not result in a worse phenotype than the single mutants. However, the double mutant **g1g3** (10%) is worse than either single mutant, ruling out redundancy.
   - **Pleiotropy** refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits. While the question mentions pleiotropy as a possibility, the data does not strongly support this for G2 or G3.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.
  - This is inconsistent with the data because G2, not G1, appears to be the transcription factor (as g2 has the most severe phenotype). Additionally, pleiotropy is not strongly supported by the resistance data.

- **Option B**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.
  - While G2 is likely the transcription factor, there is no evidence that G1 and G3 share the same promoter. Furthermore, the data does not support G3 being epistatic to G1, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

- **Option C**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.
  - This is partially correct in identifying G2 as the transcription factor, but pleiotropy is not strongly supported. Additionally, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

- **Option D**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.
  - This is partially correct in identifying G2 as the transcription factor. However, redundancy is not supported because the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant. Additionally, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly suggests that **G2 is the transcription factor**, and **G1 and G3 are in separate pathways contributing to resistance**. Their combined knockout (g1g3) results in a more severe phenotype than either single mutant, indicating additive or synergistic effects. While none of the options perfectly fit the data, **Option D** is the closest, as it correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and acknowledges the interaction between G1 and G3, even though the term "redundancy" is not fully accurate.

**Answer: D**
