Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some motion. Hmm, I need to figure out the distance the ejecta travels from the galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Let me try to break this down.

Wait, the problem says the ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. So, that means we can apply special relativity principles here, right? Because in inertial frames, the laws of physics are the same, and we can use Lorentz transformations or something like that.

The question states that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s. But wait, when considering relative velocities in different frames, I remember that velocities don't just add linearly. Oh right, because if the ejecta is moving at velocity u in the Galaxy's frame, then from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy would appear to move at velocity -u (since velocities are relative). But wait, the problem gives me the velocity from the ejecta's perspective, which is 60,000 km/s. So that's the speed we're dealing with.

Wait, but I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm. So, the time given is the proper time in the ejecta's frame, and I need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of time dilation or length contraction.

Let me think about the relationship between time in different frames. The time experienced in one frame is related to the other by the Lorentz factor gamma. Oh wait, but which frame is which here.

In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed is v = 60,000 km/s. So, the time experienced by the ejecta (its proper time) would be less than the time in the Galaxy's frame. Wait, but the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame?

Oh, right! So, the proper time is the time measured in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), and the Galaxy's frame would see a longer time because of time dilation. The formula for time dilation is t = gamma * t', where t' is the proper time (ejecta's frame) and t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate that. First, the speed v is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second because the speed of light c is usually in m/s. 60,000 km/s is 60,000,000 m/s. The speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s, so 300,000,000 m/s. So v = 6e7 m/s.

Wait, wait, 60,000 km is 60,000,000 meters, right? So 60,000 km/s is 6e7 m/s. Then, v/c = (6e7) / (3e8) )= 0.2. So v = 0.2c.

So, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0204. Hmm, but let me calculate that more accurately. Let's see, 0.96 under the square root: sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798. So gamma ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I might have gotten the frames mixed up. Let me think again. The time given is t' = 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So, in the Galaxy's frame, which is the rest frame, the time elapsed is longer. So, using the time dilation formula, t = gamma * t' is correct.

So, t ≈ 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Now, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is speed * time. The speed in the Galaxy's frame is v = 60,000 km/s, and the time is approximately 51.03 seconds.

So distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = let's calculate that.

Wait, I can compute this as 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 km = 60,000 * 51.03 = let me compute that.

51.03 * 60,000: 50 *60,000 = 3,000,000, and 1.03 *60,000= 61,800. So total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, that's 3,061,800 km. But let me check the options. The options are A) 2,940,000, B)3,000,000, C)2,880,000, D)3,060,000.

Wait, 3,061,800 is close to option D, which is 3,060,000. But wait, maybe my gamma calculation was a bit off. Let me recheck gamma.

Let me compute gamma more accurately. v = 0.2c, so v² = 0.04 c². 1 - v²/c² = 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 = approximately 1.0206.

So t = 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 s. So, 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, but option D is 3,060,000. That's 3,060,000, which is 3 million 60 thousand. That's 3,060,000. But my calculation is 3,061,800, which is 1,800 km more. Hmm, perhaps I should carry more precise decimals in the gamma calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about it differently. Maybe I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, let's compute gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v = 6e7 m/s, c=3e8 m/s.

So, v²/c² = (6e7)^2 / (3e8)^2 = (36e14) / (9e16) )= 36e14 /9e16 = (4e-2)=0.04.

So 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96)= let's compute it more accurately.

We can compute sqrt(0.96) as follows:

We know that 0.98^2 = 0.9604. Oh, wait, 0.98^2= (98/100)^2 = 9604/10000 = 0.9604. So, sqrt(0.96) is a bit less than 0.98. Let's see, 0.9798 squared is 0.9798^2.

Compute 0.9798 * 0.9798:

= (0.98 - 0.0002)^2 = 0.98² - 2*0.98*0.0002 + (0.0002)^2 = 0.9604 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004 ≈ 0.960008. Oh wait, but that's for 0.9798^2.

Wait, 0.9798^2= (0.98 - 0.0002)^2 = ?

0.98² = 0.9604.

Then, 2 * 0.98 * 0.0002 = 0.000392.

And 0.0002^2 is 0.00000004.

So, subtracting these: 0.9604 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004.

Which is 0.9604 - 0.000392 = 0.959908 + 0.00000004 = approximately 0.95990804.

Wait, but our value is 0.96. So, 0.9798² is 0.959908, which is less than 0.96. So, the square root of 0.96 is a bit higher than 0.9798, like 0.9798 + delta.

Let me compute delta.

We want (0.9798 + delta)^2 = 0.96.

We have 0.9798^2 = 0.959908.

So, (0.9798 + delta)^2 = 0.959908 + 2*(0.9798)*delta + delta^2 ≈ 0.959908 + 1.9596 * delta = 0.96.

So, 0.959908 + 1.9596 delta = 0.96.

Subtracting, 1.9596 delta = 0.96 - 0.959908 = 0.000092.

So, delta = 0.000092 / 1.9596 ≈ 4.69e-5.

So, sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798 + 0.0000469 ≈ approximately 0.979847.

So, gamma=1/0.979847 ≈ 1.02051.

So, gamma is approximately 1.02051.

So, t = 50 * 1.02051 ≈ 51.0255 seconds.

Then, distance in Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s * 51.0255 s.

Wait, 60,000 km/s * 51.0255 s = 60,000 *51.0255 = let's compute that.

50 *60,000 = 3,000,000.

1.0255 *60,000 = 61,530.

So, total is 3,000,000 +61,530 = 3,061,530 km.

Hmm, that's about 3,061,530 km. The options don't have that exact number, but option D is 3,060,000 km. So, perhaps the intended answer is D, considering that maybe the approximation for gamma was intended to be taken as 1.02, leading to 50 * 1.02= 51 s.

Wait, let me compute the distance with t=51 s.

60,000 km/s *51 s = 3,060,000 km, which is option D.

So, perhaps when the problem says 'approximate', they expect using gamma as 1.02, leading to t=51 s and distance 3,060,000 km.

So, the correct answer should be option D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c \) is the speed of light). The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference when \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) pass in the ejecta's frame.

### Step 1: Time Dilation
In special relativity, time dilation relates the proper time \( t' \) (measured in the ejecta's frame) to the time \( t \) (measured in the Galaxy's frame) using the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):
\[
t = \gamma t'
\]
The Lorentz factor is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]
Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
\]
Thus, the time in the Galaxy's frame is:
\[
t = \gamma t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \, \text{s} \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Distance in the Galaxy's Frame
The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given by:
\[
\text{Distance} = v \cdot t
\]
Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t \approx 51.03 \, \text{s} \):
\[
\text{Distance} = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \times 51.03 \, \text{s} = 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
\]

### Step 3: Comparing with the Options
The calculated distance is approximately \( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \), which is very close to option D (\( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \)). The slight discrepancy arises from rounding \( \gamma \) to \( 1.02 \) instead of using a more precise value, which simplifies the calculation and aligns with the expected answer.

### Final Answer
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).

Oh right, because if the ejecta is moving at velocity u in the Galaxy's frame, then from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy would appear to move at velocity -u (since velocities are relative). But wait, the problem gives me the velocity from the ejecta's perspective, which is 60,000 km/s. So that's the speed we're dealing with.

Wait, but I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm. So, the time given is the proper time in the ejecta's frame, and I need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame.

Oh, right! So, the proper time is the time measured in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), and the Galaxy's frame would see a longer time because of time dilation. The formula for time dilation is t = gamma * t', where t' is the proper time (ejecta's frame) and t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate that. First, the speed v is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second because the speed of light c is usually in m/s. 60,000 km/s is 60,000,000 m/s. The speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s, so 300,000,000 m/s. So v = 6e7 m/s.

Wait, wait, 60,000 km is 60,000,000 meters, right? So 60,000 km/s is 6e7 m/s. Then, v/c = (6e7) / (3e8) )= 0.2. So v = 0.2c.

So, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0204. Hmm, but let me calculate that more accurately. Let's see, 0.96 under the square root: sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798. So gamma ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I might have gotten the frames mixed up. Let me think again. The time given is t' = 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So, in the Galaxy's frame, which is the rest frame, the time elapsed is longer. So, using the time dilation formula, t = gamma * t' is correct.

So, t ≈ 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Now, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is speed * time. The speed in the Galaxy's frame is v = 60,000 km/s, and the time is approximately 51.03 seconds.

So distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = let's calculate that.

Wait, I can compute this as 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 km = 60,000 * 51.03 = let me compute that.

51.03 * 60,000: 50 *60,000 = 3,000,000, and 1.03 *60,000= 61,800. So total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, that's 3,061,800 km. But let me check the options. The options are A) 2,940,000, B)3,000,000, C)2,880,000, D)3,060,000.

Wait, 3,061,800 is close to option D, which is 3,060,000. But wait, maybe my gamma calculation was a bit off. Let me recheck gamma.

Let me compute gamma more accurately. v = 0.2c, so v² = 0.04 c². 1 - v²/c² = 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 = approximately 1.0206.

So t = 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 s. So, 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, but option D is 3,060,000. That's 3,060,000, which is 3 million 60 thousand. That's 3,060,000. But my calculation is 3,061,800, which is 1,800 km more. Hmm, perhaps I should carry more precise decimals in the gamma calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about it differently. Maybe I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, let's compute gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v = 6e7 m/s, c=3e8 m/s.

So, v²/c² = (6e7)^2 / (3e8)^2 = (36e14) / (9e16) )= 36e14 /9e16 = (4e-2)=0.04.

So 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96)= let's compute it more accurately.

We can compute sqrt(0.96) as follows:

We know that 0.98^2 = 0.9604. Oh, wait, 0.98^2= (98/100)^2 = 9604/10000 = 0.9604. So, sqrt(0.96) is a bit less than 0.98. Let's see, 0.9798 squared is 0.9798^2.

Compute 0.9798 * 0.9798:

= (0.98 - 0.0002)^2 = 0.98² - 2*0.98*0.0002 + (0.0002)^2 = 0.9604 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004 ≈ 0.960008. Oh wait, but that's for 0.9798^2.

Wait, 0.9798^2= (0.98 - 0.0002)^2 = ?

0.98² = 0.9604.

Then, 2 * 0.98 * 0.0002 = 0.000392.

And 0.0002^2 is 0.00000004.

So, subtracting these: 0.9604 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004.

Which is 0.9604 - 0.000392 = 0.959908 + 0.00000004 = approximately 0.95990804.

Wait, but our value is 0.96. So, 0.9798² is 0.959908, which is less than 0.96. So, the square root of 0.96 is a bit higher than 0.9798, like 0.9798 + delta.

Let me compute delta.

We want (0.9798 + delta)^2 = 0.96.

We have 0.9798^2 = 0.959908.

So, (0.9798 + delta)^2 = 0.959908 + 2*(0.9798)*delta + delta^2 ≈ 0.959908 + 1.9596 * delta = 0.96.

So, 0.959908 + 1.9596 delta = 0.96.

Subtracting, 1.9596 delta = 0.96 - 0.959908 = 0.000092.

So, delta = 0.000092 / 1.9596 ≈ 4.69e-5.

So, sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798 + 0.0000469 ≈ approximately 0.979847.

So, gamma=1/0.979847 ≈ 1.02051.

So, gamma is approximately 1.02051.

So, t = 50 * 1.02051 ≈ 51.0255 seconds.

Then, distance in Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s * 51.0255 s.

Wait, 60,000 km/s * 51.0255 s = 60,000 *51.0255 = let's compute that.

50 *60,000 = 3,000,000.

1.0255 *60,000 = 61,530.

So, total is 3,000,000 +61,530 = 3,061,530 km.

Hmm, that's about 3,061,530 km. The options don't have that exact number, but option D is 3,060,000 km. So, perhaps the intended answer is D, considering that maybe the approximation for gamma was intended to be taken as 1.02, leading to 50 * 1.02= 51 s.

Wait, let me compute the distance with t=51 s.

60,000 km/s *51 s = 3,060,000 km, which is option D.

So, perhaps when the problem says 'approximate', they expect using gamma as 1.02, leading to t=51 s and distance 3,060,000 km.

So, the correct answer should be option D.

Thus, the time in the Galaxy's frame is:
\[
t = \gamma t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \, \text{s} \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Distance in the Galaxy's Frame
