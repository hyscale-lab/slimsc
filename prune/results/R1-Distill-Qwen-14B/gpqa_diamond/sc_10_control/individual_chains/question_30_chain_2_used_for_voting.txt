Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I need to figure out what color it absorbs. Let me think about what I remember from chemistry class.

The question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. Wait, I remember that when a substance absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. Or is it the other way around? Oh right, electrons get excited when they absorb energy. So the energy of the absorbed light must be higher than the emitted one.

Wait, no. Because when electrons drop from a higher energy state to a lower one, they emit photons. The energy of the emitted photon depends on the energy difference. The energy absorbed would be higher if it's the energy that promoted the electron to a higher state in the first place.

So, in this case, the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. That would mean that when the electron drops from a higher to lower energy level, it emits this energy. So the energy that was absorbed should be higher than that, right? Because absorption usually involves electrons moving to higher energy states. So the absorbed light has higher energy than the emitted.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the energy of the absorbed photon is the energy difference between the two states. So if the electron is excited by absorbing a photon, and then when it drops, it emits another photon. The energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state. But when it emits, that energy is released as a photon. So the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy difference, which is the same as the absorbed photon. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Because that would imply that the absorbed and emitted energies are the same, which isn't the case here.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Another approach: the color we see is the color that's transmitted or reflected, not absorbed. So if a substance emits light, it might be because it's actually absorbing and then re-emitting. But in the context of this question, perhaps it's talking about the compound absorbing certain wavelengths, which are then emitted. Or wait, maybe the question is about the compound's emission spectrum, which tells us the color it emits, but we need to find the absorbed color.

Wait, no. The question states that the compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the emission corresponds to the energy difference between an excited state and a lower state. But the absorbed energy would be higher, because absorption is when the electron jumps to a higher state. So, the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted energy.

Wait, that's not right. Because the energy of the photon emitted is equal to the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So when the electron is in the excited state, it had to absorb a photon with that same energy. So perhaps they're the same? But that can't be. Then why are they talking about emission and absorption?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's think in terms of the electromagnetic spectrum. The energy of the photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

So, higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths. The visible spectrum goes from violet (shorter wavelength, higher energy) to red (longer wavelength, lower energy). So, if the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, what's the corresponding wavelength?

Let me calculate that. I know that 1 eV corresponds to about 1240 eV·nm. So E (in eV) = 1240 / λ (nm). So λ = 1240 / E.

So λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let me compute that. 2.3393 is approximately 2.34. 1240 divided by 2.34. Let's see. 2.34 times 500 is about 1170. So 1240 is about 529.9 nm? Wait, wait, wait, 2.34 * 529.9 ≈ 1240. So λ is approximately 529.9 nm. Hmm, 530 nm is in the green region. Because red is around 650-700 nm, orange around 590, yellow around 570, green around 530, blue around 470, and violet around 400.

So if the emitted light is green (around 530 nm), then what color is absorbed? Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed by the compound. Wait, the compound emits green. So it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, meaning a shorter wavelength. Because when a substance emits a certain color, it's because it absorbed a higher energy photon (the complementary color?), but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound's absorption and emission are related. Wait, in fluorescence, when a substance absorbs higher energy light, it emits lower energy light. So, for example, a fluorescent dye might absorb UV light (high energy, say, 3.5 eV) and then emit visible light, say green at 2.3393 eV.

So the absorbed energy is higher than emitted. So the absorbed photon energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed wavelength would be shorter than 530 nm.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So what color is absorbed? Since the dye emits green, it must have absorbed higher energy (shorter wavelength) light. The complementary color to green is magenta, but I'm not sure how that works here.

Wait, perhaps the absorbed color is the one that corresponds to the energy difference between the ground and excited state. So the energy of the absorbed photon is equal to the energy of the emitted photon? That can't be right, because then the wavelength would be the same. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the energy levels. When an electron absorbs a photon, it jumps from ground state (lower energy) to an excited state (higher energy). The energy of that photon (E_absorb) equals the difference between the two states.

Then, when the electron drops back to the ground state, it emits a photon. The energy of that emitted photon (E_emit) is the same as E_absorb because it's the same energy difference. But that seems to contradict the problem because the question says the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, and the options don't have that as the absorbed color.

Wait, but that can't be right because then if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon would have the same energy, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, wait. The question says the compound emits light, but in reality, the compound would have absorbed light of a certain wavelength and then emitted a different wavelength. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted one. Because the emission is when the electron drops to a lower energy state than the initial ground state. Oh wait, no. Let me think again.

Suppose the dye absorbs a photon of higher energy (E_absorb) and gets excited. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon of lower energy (E_emit). So E_absorb > E_emit.

So, in our case, E_emit is 2.3393 eV. So E_absorb must be higher than that.

So, let's calculate the wavelength of E_emit. 2.3393 eV. As before, λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm, which is green.

So the emitted light is green. Therefore, the absorbed light must have a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green. So what color is that? Violet is around 400-450 nm, which is higher energy than green.

So if the compound emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, like violet or blue.

Wait, but wait, another thought. The substance's absorption spectrum shows which wavelengths it absorbs. The color we see is the complementary color of what's absorbed. So if a compound absorbs blue, it would appear orange. But in this case, the dye emits light. So perhaps the question is about the color it absorbs, which is the same as the color it emits? No, because that doesn't make sense.

Wait, the question states that the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the color that the dye emits is green. The question is, what color does it absorb? No, wait, the question is, what color is absorbed by the compound? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the absorbed color. So the dye emits green, which means that the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be equal to that, right? Because when the electron transitions from ground to excited state, it requires a photon of that energy.

Wait, but that would mean E_absorb = E_emit. So the wavelength would be the same, 530 nm. But 530 nm is green. So the dye would absorb green and emit green? That doesn't make much sense because absorbing green and emitting green would imply a very high quantum yield, but that's not impossible. But the options don't have green. The options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the question is about the compound's absorption, and since it emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, which would be violet or blue.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the compound's emission, and the absorbed energy is the same as the emitted energy, which would make the absorbed wavelength green as well. But the options don't include green, so perhaps I'm missomething.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as: the compound emits light of energy 2.3393 eV. What color is absorbed by the compound?

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the energy of the emitted light is the energy difference between the excited and ground state, which is the same as the absorbed energy. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed is green. But that's not an option.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me reevaluate. Maybe the question is about the complementary color. For example, if the dye emits green, it must absorb the complementary color, which is magenta. But magenta isn't an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing emission and absorption. Let me think: the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So during the emission process, the compound is giving off green light. The question is asking what color it absorbs. But how are these related?

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about the energy of the absorbed photon. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it excites an electron. The energy of that photon must be equal to the energy difference between the ground and excited states. So if E_emit is 2.3393 eV, then E_absorbed is also 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon has the same energy as the emitted, meaning green light. But that's not one of the options.

So the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the wavelength.

E = 2.3393 eV.

λ = 1240 / E = 1240 / 2.3393.

Calculating that: 2.3393 ≈ 2.34.

1240 / 2.34 ≈ Let's compute 1240 / 2.34.

2.34 * 500 = 1170.

1240 - 1170 = 70.

70 / 2.34 ≈ 30. (2.34 *30 =70.2) So 530 nm. So green.

So the emitted light is green. Now, what color does the compound absorb?

Wait, the question says the compound emits green, but the question is asking what color it absorbs. So if the compound emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, which would have a shorter wavelength than green. So the absorbed wavelength is shorter (higher energy) than 530 nm. The shorter wavelengths in visible light are violet, then blue. So the absorbed color would be violet or blue.

But which one? Let's think about the energy. E_absorbed = hc/(λ_absorbed). And since E_emit = 2.3393 eV, that's the energy difference between the excited and ground states. So E_absorbed is the same as E_emit. So λ_absorbed = λ_emitted = 530 nm. But that can't be right because the options don't have green.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Let me think about the energy levels again. The electron is excited from the ground state (lower energy) to an excited state (higher energy) upon absorbing a photon. When it drops back to the lower energy state, it emits a photon with energy E = E2 - E1, where E2 is the higher state and E1 is the lower.

So the energy of the absorbed photon is E2 - E1, same as E_emit. So the λ_absorbed is same as λ_emitted. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed must also be green. But none of the options are green. So I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the compound's color being the complement of the emitted. So if it emits green, the color it absorbs is the complement, which is magenta. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the compound's color, which is the color it reflects or transmits, which is the complementary color of what it absorbs. So if the compound absorbs a certain color, it transmits the complement. But I'm getting confused because the question is about what it absorbs.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is based on the concept that the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted photon. So, the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than 2.3393 eV, which would mean a shorter wavelength (blue or violet).

So, let's think about 2.3393 eV. Previously, that's 530 nm (green). So the absorbed photon must have a higher energy, which is a shorter wavelength than 530 nm. So the absorbed color would be blue or violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet and C is blue. Which one is it?

Wait, the energy of 2.3393 eV is less than the energy corresponding to blue. Because blue is around 470 nm. Let's compute that. 1240 / 470 ≈ 2.638 eV. So blue light is higher energy than green. So if the emitted is green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed must be a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green. That would be blue or violet.

So which is it? The options are violet (B) and blue (C).

Wait, perhaps the question is about the absorption edge. If the compound emits green, then it probably absorbed in the blue or violet region.

Alternatively, another approach: the energy of the absorbed photon must be greater than the energy of the emitted photon. So E_absorbed > E_emitted.

So E_absorbed = E_emitted + some energy (like thermal energy). But for simplicity, in this context, perhaps E_absorbed is approximately equal to E_emitted. But that leads to the same problem as before.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the color of the light absorbed being the same as the color of the emitted light. But that's not possible because you can't have a substance that emits and absorbs the same color; it's usually the opposite.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit of a trick. The emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the compound must have absorbed a higher energy photon, which would be violet or blue.

So which one is it? Let's compute.

E=2.3393 eV. Let's think about the possible options.

Option B is violet. Let's compute E_violet. Violet is about 400 nm.

E = 1240 / 400 = 3.1 eV.

So the absorbed photon would be 3.1 eV, which is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the compound absorbs violet (3.1 eV) and emits green (2.3393 eV). That makes sense.

Similarly, blue is about 470 nm. E_blue = 1240 / 470 ≈ 2.638 eV.

Which is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So the absorbed energy is either violet (3.1 eV) or blue (2.638 eV).

But the question is, which color is the compound absorbing? So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

The question is phrased as: a compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. What color is absorbed?

So if the emitted is green, the absorbed is a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green. So the possible options are violet or blue.

Looking back at the options, the choices are B) Violet and C) Blue.

So which is it?

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking about the compound's absorption, and the compound's emission is green. So what does the absorption look like?

In fluorescence, the compound absorbs higher energy (shorter wavelength) and emits lower energy (longer wavelength). So if it emits green, the absorbed must be blue or violet.

But which color is more likely? Well, it's possible for dyes to absorb in the UV or visible range and emit in the visible. For example, many fluorescent dyes absorb in the UV and emit in the visible (like green). But in this case, the question states the compound emits 2.3393 eV (green), so the absorbed must be higher, say 3 eV (ultraviolet) or blue (2.638 eV).

But the options don't include ultraviolet. The options are violet, which is visible. So violet is about 400 nm, which is 3.1 eV. So if the compound emits green (2.3393 eV), it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, like violet.

So the correct answer would be B) Violet.

Wait, but another thought: the compound's absorption is in the blue region. For example, if the compound is yellow, it would absorb blue and transmit yellow. But in our case, the question is about the compound emitting green. So maybe the absorbed color is blue, not violet.

Wait, but the question isn't about the compound's color, it's about the color of the light it absorbs.

So the compound emits green, which is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon must have higher energy. So the absorbed photon is violet (3.1 eV). Therefore, the answer is B) Violet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light. The compound emits light with an energy of **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength calculated using the equation:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1240}{E}
\]

Substituting \( E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{1240}{2.3393} \approx 530 \, \text{nm}
\]

A wavelength of approximately **530 nm** falls in the green region of the visible spectrum. Therefore, the compound emits green light.

Next, we consider the relationship between absorption and emission. When a compound emits light, it does so because an electron transitions from a higher energy state (excited state) to a lower energy state (ground state), releasing energy as a photon. The energy of the emitted photon is equal to the energy difference between these two states:

\[
E_{\text{emit}} = E_{\text{excited}} - E_{\text{ground}}
\]

For the compound to emit green light (\( E_{\text{emit}} = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \)), it must first absorb a photon with energy equal to or higher than \( 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \). This is because the absorbed photon provides the energy needed to excite the electron to the higher energy state. The absorbed photon must have a shorter wavelength (and thus higher energy) than the emitted photon.

The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to a wavelength shorter than **530 nm**, which places it in the violet or blue regions of the visible spectrum. To distinguish between these options, we calculate the energy of violet and blue light:

- **Violet light**: Wavelength \( \approx 400 \, \text{nm} \)
  \[
  E_{\text{violet}} = \frac{1240}{400} \approx 3.1 \, \text{eV}
  \]

- **Blue light**: Wavelength \( \approx 470 \, \text{nm} \)
  \[
  E_{\text{blue}} = \frac{1240}{470} \approx 2.64 \, \text{eV}
  \]

Since \( E_{\text{absorb}} > E_{\text{emit}} \), the absorbed photon must have higher energy than \( 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \). Between violet (\( 3.1 \, \text{eV} \)) and blue (\( 2.64 \, \text{eV} \)), violet has the higher energy and is therefore the more likely candidate for the absorbed light.

Thus, the compound absorbs **violet light** and emits **green light**.

Wait, that's not right. Because the energy of the photon emitted is equal to the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So when the electron is in the excited state, it had to absorb a photon with that same energy. So perhaps they're the same? But that can't be. Then why are they talking about emission and absorption?

So, higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths. The visible spectrum goes from violet (shorter wavelength, higher energy) to red (longer wavelength, lower energy). So, if the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, what's the corresponding wavelength?

Let me calculate that. I know that 1 eV corresponds to about 1240 eV·nm. So E (in eV) = 1240 / λ (nm). So λ = 1240 / E.

So λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let me compute that. 2.3393 is approximately 2.34. 1240 divided by 2.34. Let's see. 2.34 times 500 is about 1170. So 1240 is about 529.9 nm? Wait, wait, wait, 2.34 * 529.9 ≈ 1240. So λ is approximately 529.9 nm. Hmm, 530 nm is in the green region. Because red is around 650-700 nm, orange around 590, yellow around 570, green around 530, blue around 470, and violet around 400.

So if the emitted light is green (around 530 nm), then what color is absorbed? Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed by the compound. Wait, the compound emits green. So it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, meaning a shorter wavelength. Because when a substance emits a certain color, it's because it absorbed a higher energy photon (the complementary color?), but I'm a bit confused.

So, in our case, E_emit is 2.3393 eV. So E_absorb must be higher than that.

So, let's calculate the wavelength of E_emit. 2.3393 eV. As before, λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm, which is green.

So the emitted light is green. Therefore, the absorbed light must have a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green. So what color is that? Violet is around 400-450 nm, which is higher energy than green.

So if the compound emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, like violet or blue.

Wait, but wait, another thought. The substance's absorption spectrum shows which wavelengths it absorbs. The color we see is the complementary color of what's absorbed. So if a compound absorbs blue, it would appear orange. But in this case, the dye emits light. So perhaps the question is about the color it absorbs, which is the same as the color it emits? No, because that doesn't make sense.

Wait, the question states that the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the color that the dye emits is green. The question is, what color does it absorb? No, wait, the question is, what color is absorbed by the compound? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the absorbed color. So the dye emits green, which means that the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be equal to that, right? Because when the electron transitions from ground to excited state, it requires a photon of that energy.

Wait, but that would mean E_absorb = E_emit. So the wavelength would be the same, 530 nm. But 530 nm is green. So the dye would absorb green and emit green? That doesn't make much sense because absorbing green and emitting green would imply a very high quantum yield, but that's not impossible. But the options don't have green. The options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the question is about the compound's absorption, and since it emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, which would be violet or blue.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the compound's emission, and the absorbed energy is the same as the emitted energy, which would make the absorbed wavelength green as well. But the options don't include green, so perhaps I'm missomething.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the energy of the emitted light is the energy difference between the excited and ground state, which is the same as the absorbed energy. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed is green. But that's not an option.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me reevaluate. Maybe the question is about the complementary color. For example, if the dye emits green, it must absorb the complementary color, which is magenta. But magenta isn't an option either.

The energy of that photon must be equal to the energy difference between the ground and excited states. So if E_emit is 2.3393 eV, then E_absorbed is also 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon has the same energy as the emitted, meaning green light. But that's not one of the options.

So the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the wavelength.

E = 2.3393 eV.

λ = 1240 / E = 1240 / 2.3393.

Calculating that: 2.3393 ≈ 2.34.

1240 / 2.34 ≈ Let's compute 1240 / 2.34.

2.34 * 500 = 1170.

1240 - 1170 = 70.

70 / 2.34 ≈ 30. (2.34 *30 =70.2) So 530 nm. So green.

So the emitted light is green. Now, what color does the compound absorb?

Wait, the question says the compound emits green, but the question is asking what color it absorbs. So if the compound emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, which would have a shorter wavelength than green. So the absorbed wavelength is shorter (higher energy) than 530 nm. The shorter wavelengths in visible light are violet, then blue. So the absorbed color would be violet or blue.

But which one? Let's think about the energy. E_absorbed = hc/(λ_absorbed). And since E_emit = 2.3393 eV, that's the energy difference between the excited and ground states. So E_absorbed is the same as E_emit. So λ_absorbed = λ_emitted = 530 nm. But that can't be right because the options don't have green.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Let me think about the energy levels again. The electron is excited from the ground state (lower energy) to an excited state (higher energy) upon absorbing a photon. When it drops back to the lower energy state, it emits a photon with energy E = E2 - E1, where E2 is the higher state and E1 is the lower.

So the energy of the absorbed photon is E2 - E1, same as E_emit. So the λ_absorbed is same as λ_emitted. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed must also be green. But none of the options are green. So I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the compound's color being the complement of the emitted. So if it emits green, the color it absorbs is the complement, which is magenta. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the compound's color, which is the color it reflects or transmits, which is the complementary color of what it absorbs. So if the compound absorbs a certain color, it transmits the complement. But I'm getting confused because the question is about what it absorbs.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is based on the concept that the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted photon. So, the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than 2.3393 eV, which would mean a shorter wavelength (blue or violet).

So, let's think about 2.3393 eV. Previously, that's 530 nm (green). So the absorbed photon must have a higher energy, which is a shorter wavelength than 530 nm. So the absorbed color would be blue or violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet and C is blue. Which one is it?

Wait, the energy of 2.3393 eV is less than the energy corresponding to blue. Because blue is around 470 nm. Let's compute that. 1240 / 470 ≈ 2.638 eV. So blue light is higher energy than green. So if the emitted is green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed must be a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green. That would be blue or violet.

So which is it? The options are violet (B) and blue (C).

Wait, perhaps the question is about the absorption edge. If the compound emits green, then it probably absorbed in the blue or violet region.

Alternatively, another approach: the energy of the absorbed photon must be greater than the energy of the emitted photon. So E_absorbed > E_emitted.

So E_absorbed = E_emitted + some energy (like thermal energy). But for simplicity, in this context, perhaps E_absorbed is approximately equal to E_emitted. But that leads to the same problem as before.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the color of the light absorbed being the same as the color of the emitted light. But that's not possible because you can't have a substance that emits and absorbs the same color; it's usually the opposite.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit of a trick. The emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the compound must have absorbed a higher energy photon, which would be violet or blue.

So which one is it? Let's compute.

E=2.3393 eV. Let's think about the possible options.

Option B is violet. Let's compute E_violet. Violet is about 400 nm.

E = 1240 / 400 = 3.1 eV.

So the absorbed photon would be 3.1 eV, which is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the compound absorbs violet (3.1 eV) and emits green (2.3393 eV). That makes sense.

Similarly, blue is about 470 nm. E_blue = 1240 / 470 ≈ 2.638 eV.

Which is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So the absorbed energy is either violet (3.1 eV) or blue (2.638 eV).

But the question is, which color is the compound absorbing? So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

The question is phrased as: a compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. What color is absorbed?

So if the emitted is green, the absorbed is a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green. So the possible options are violet or blue.

Looking back at the options, the choices are B) Violet and C) Blue.

So which is it?

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking about the compound's absorption, and the compound's emission is green. So what does the absorption look like?

In fluorescence, the compound absorbs higher energy (shorter wavelength) and emits lower energy (longer wavelength). So if it emits green, the absorbed must be blue or violet.

But which color is more likely? Well, it's possible for dyes to absorb in the UV or visible range and emit in the visible. For example, many fluorescent dyes absorb in the UV and emit in the visible (like green). But in this case, the question states the compound emits 2.3393 eV (green), so the absorbed must be higher, say 3 eV (ultraviolet) or blue (2.638 eV).

But the options don't include ultraviolet. The options are violet, which is visible. So violet is about 400 nm, which is 3.1 eV. So if the compound emits green (2.3393 eV), it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, like violet.

So the correct answer would be B) Violet.

Wait, but another thought: the compound's absorption is in the blue region. For example, if the compound is yellow, it would absorb blue and transmit yellow. But in our case, the question is about the compound emitting green. So maybe the absorbed color is blue, not violet.

Wait, but the question isn't about the compound's color, it's about the color of the light it absorbs.

So the compound emits green, which is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon must have higher energy. So the absorbed photon is violet (3.1 eV). Therefore, the answer is B) Violet.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light. The compound emits light with an energy of **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength calculated using the equation:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1240}{E}
\]

Substituting \( E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{1240}{2.3393} \approx 530 \, \text{nm}
\]

A wavelength of approximately **530 nm** falls in the green region of the visible spectrum. Therefore, the compound emits green light.

Next, we consider the relationship between absorption and emission. When a compound emits light, it does so because an electron transitions from a higher energy state (excited state) to a lower energy state (ground state), releasing energy as a photon. The energy of the emitted photon is equal to the energy difference between these two states:

\[
E_{\text{emit}} = E_{\text{excited}} - E_{\text{ground}}
\]

For the compound to emit green light (\( E_{\text{emit}} = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \)), it must first absorb a photon with energy equal to or higher than \( 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \). This is because the absorbed photon provides the energy needed to excite the electron to the higher energy state. The absorbed photon must have a shorter wavelength (and thus higher energy) than the emitted photon.

The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to a wavelength shorter than **530 nm**, which places it in the violet or blue regions of the visible spectrum. To distinguish between these options, we calculate the energy of violet and blue light:

- **Violet light**: Wavelength \( \approx 400 \, \text{nm} \)
  \[
  E_{\text{violet}} = \frac{1240}{400} \approx 3.1 \, \text{eV}
  \]

- **Blue light**: Wavelength \( \approx 470 \, \text{nm} \)
  \[
  E_{\text{blue}} = \frac{1240}{470} \approx 2.64 \, \text{eV}
  \]

Since \( E_{\text{absorb}} > E_{\text{emit}} \), the absorbed photon must have higher energy than \( 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \). Between violet (\( 3.1 \, \text{eV} \)) and blue (\( 2.64 \, \text{eV} \)), violet has the higher energy and is therefore the more likely candidate for the absorbed light.

Thus, the compound absorbs **violet light** and emits **green light**.
