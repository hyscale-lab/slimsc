Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution. Let me try to think through this step by step. I remember that when dealing with pH problems, especially with acids and bases, I have to consider neutralization reactions and figure out if there's excess acid or base left after they react.

The problem states that we have three solutions mixed together: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid, a weak acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base because it's a group 2 hydroxide). My goal is to find the pH of the final mixture.

First, I should calculate the moles of each acid and base in their respective solutions. Moles are calculated by multiplying molarity (M) by volume in liters (L).

Starting with CH3COOH: 500 mL is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 mol/L * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol of acetic acid.

Next, HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 mol of HCl.

Then, Ba(OH)2: 300 mL is 0.3 L. The formula for Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. But each mole gives 2 OH-, so total OH- moles are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, no, actually, the moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. But since each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions, the total OH- is 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 mol.

Now, I need to find the total moles of H+ and OH- from the acids and base.

HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, giving 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't fully dissociate. But since I'm dealing with neutralization, maybe I can consider it as providing H+ but in a reaction with OH-.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is to first calculate the total H+ from the strong acid and the weak acid, then subtract the OH- from the base, and see what's left.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When you mix acids and bases, the H+ ions react with OH- ions to form water. So the total H+ from both the strong and weak acids will react with the OH- from the base.

So the strong acid (HCl) gives 0.08 mol H+. The weak acid (CH3COOH) is a source of H+, but since it's weak, I can't just add its moles directly. Hmm, maybe I should handle this in two steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should first calculate all the H+ and OH- contributions, then see if they neutralize each other.

But wait, maybe I should first compute the total H+ and OH- from each solution.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, calculate the moles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol of H+.

From CH3COOH, it's a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. Let's denote the moles of H+ from it as 'a'. But without knowing the degree of dissociation, maybe it's easier to consider that the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will neutralize some of the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of neutralization: the OH- from the base will react with the H+ from the acids.

So total H+ available is from HCl and CH3COOH. But HCl is strong, so all 0.08 mol H+ is available. CH3COOH is weak; but in solution, it's only partially ionized. However, since we're mixing it with a strong base, the OH- will react with any available H+.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider all H+ and OH- as available for neutralization.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes 0.08 mol H+. CH3COOH is a weak acid, but in solution, it can donate H+ as well. However, when you mix it with a strong base, the OH- will react with H+ from both sources.

So let's first compute the moles of H+ and OH-.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Moles of H+ from CH3COOH: since it's a weak acid, in pure solution it would have a certain [H+], but when mixed with a strong base, the OH- will react with it. So perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH will be negligible compared to the strong acid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that all the H+ from CH3COOH will react with OH-.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Wait, total H+ available is 0.08 (from HCl) plus the H+ from CH3COOH. Let me denote the H+ from CH3COOH as 'x'. But since it's a weak acid, it's not straightforward to find x. However, perhaps the presence of a strong base would cause the CH3COOH to dissociate more.

But maybe a better approach is to calculate the total H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ from all acids and the total moles of OH- from the base.

So, H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. HCl is 0.08 mol. CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, but it's a weak acid. So the H+ from CH3COOH is less than 0.05 mol. But when it's mixed with a strong base, perhaps it will donate some H+.

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the moles of H+ and OH-:

H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

H+ from CH3COOH: let's say it's 'a' mol.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

So the reaction between H+ and OH- is: H+ + OH- → H2O.

Total H+ available is 0.08 + a.

Total OH- is 0.18.

So if (0.08 + a) > 0.18, then there's excess H+, pH is acidic.

If (0.08 + a) < 0.18, then excess OH-, pH is basic.

If equal, pH is neutral.

But what is 'a'? The H+ from CH3COOH. Since CH3COOH is a weak acid, in pure solution, it only partially dissociates, but in the presence of a strong base, the OH- will react with it.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that CH3COOH will donate H+ to neutralize the OH- from Ba(OH)2. So the OH- can react with both HCl and CH3COOH.

So perhaps the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, and then any remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH.

So let's proceed step by step.

Total OH-: 0.18 mol.

Total H+ available: 0.08 (from HCl) + a (from CH3COOH).

But wait, the OH- will react with H+ in the following way: OH- will first react with HCl's H+ because it's a strong acid (so H+ is fully available), and any remaining OH- will react with CH3COOH's H+.

So let's compute how much OH- is needed to neutralize the HCl.

HCl provides 0.08 mol H+. The OH- is 0.18 mol. So after neutralizing HCl, the OH- remaining is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Now, this remaining 0.10 mol OH- will react with the CH3COOH's H+.

CH3COOH has 0.05 mol (since it's 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol). But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it can donate H+ when OH- is present.

So the OH- will react with the CH3COOH as follows: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Each mole of OH- reacts with one mole of CH3COOH to produce one mole of acetate ion.

So the OH- is 0.10 mol, and CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. So all of the CH3COOH will react with the OH-.

Wait, but 0.10 mol OH- is more than 0.05 mol CH3COOH. So all the CH3COOH will react, and there will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH- left.

So after all reactions:

- HCl's H+ is completely neutralized by 0.08 mol OH-.

- CH3COOH's 0.05 mol reacts with 0.05 mol OH-, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So total OH- remaining is 0.05 mol.

Wait, but wait. Because Ba(OH)2 provides 0.18 mol OH-.

So the sequence is:

1. OH- neutralizes H+ from HCl: 0.08 H+ → 0.08 OH- consumed.

Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

2. Then, the remaining OH- (0.10) reacts with CH3COOH.

CH3COOH can donate 0.05 mol H+ (since it's 0.05 mol), so 0.05 OH- will react, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH-.

So now, after all reactions, the solution has 0.05 mol of OH- left in the total solution volume.

Wait, but what about the concentrations? The total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = approximately 0.04167 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but that would give a pH of 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, am I missing something here? Because when the OH- reacts with CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, it's possible that not all of the OH- is consumed, but I think the calculation is correct.

But let me double-check the steps.

Total moles of OH-: 0.18.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08.

So OH- neutralizes HCl's H+, using 0.08 mol OH-.

Remaining OH-: 0.10.

CH3COOH has 0.05 mol, which can donate 0.05 H+ (but since OH- is a strong base, it will react with the weak acid, consuming the H+ from the acid).

So the 0.05 OH- reacts with 0.05 CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

Wait, but OH- is in excess here. So the solution is basic, and pH is 12.62, option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the reaction between OH- and CH3COOH. Let me think again: when OH- is added to a solution of CH3COOH, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

This reaction goes to completion because OH- is a strong base. So all the available OH- will react with CH3COOH until one is exhausted.

In this case, after using 0.08 mol OH- to neutralize HCl, 0.10 mol OH- is left. Then, it reacts with CH3COOH, which has 0.05 mol.

So the OH- will consume all 0.05 mol CH3COOH, producing 0.05 mol CH3COO^- and using up 0.05 mol OH-.

So remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Thus, the total solution has 0.05 mol OH- in 1.2 L.

So [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

That matches option A.

Wait, but another thought: when mixing the solutions, the concentrations change, but I think the approach is correct because I used moles and total volume.

So the answer should be option A) 12.62.

To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids (CH3COOH and HCl) and the base (Ba(OH)2). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of each substance:**
   - **CH3COOH (weak acid):**  
     Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L, Molarity = 0.1 M → Moles = \( 0.1 \times 0.5 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L, Molarity = 0.2 M → Moles = \( 0.2 \times 0.4 = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**  
     Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L, Molarity = 0.3 M → Moles = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of OH⁻, so total OH⁻ moles = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Reaction sequence:**
   - The OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2 reacts with H⁺ from HCl (strong acid) first, as H⁺ from HCl is fully available.  
     Moles of H⁺ from HCl = 0.08 mol.  
     Moles of OH⁻ neutralized by HCl = 0.08 mol.  
     Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \).
   - The remaining OH⁻ reacts with CH3COOH (weak acid). Each mole of CH3COOH donates 1 mole of H⁺.  
     Moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol.  
     Moles of OH⁻ neutralized by CH3COOH = 0.05 mol.  
     Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Calculate OH⁻ concentration:**
   - Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
   - [OH⁻] = \( \frac{\text{Moles of OH⁻}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

4. **Calculate pH:**
   - pOH = \( -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).  
   - pH = \( 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Next, HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 mol of HCl.

Then, Ba(OH)2: 300 mL is 0.3 L. The formula for Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. But each mole gives 2 OH-, so total OH- moles are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, no, actually, the moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. But since each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions, the total OH- is 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 mol.

So, H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. HCl is 0.08 mol. CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, but it's a weak acid. So the H+ from CH3COOH is less than 0.05 mol. But when it's mixed with a strong base, perhaps it will donate some H+.

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the moles of H+ and OH-:

H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

H+ from CH3COOH: let's say it's 'a' mol.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

So the reaction between H+ and OH- is: H+ + OH- → H2O.

Total H+ available is 0.08 + a.

Total OH- is 0.18.

So if (0.08 + a) > 0.18, then there's excess H+, pH is acidic.

If (0.08 + a) < 0.18, then excess OH-, pH is basic.

If equal, pH is neutral.

But what is 'a'? The H+ from CH3COOH. Since CH3COOH is a weak acid, in pure solution, it only partially dissociates, but in the presence of a strong base, the OH- will react with it.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that CH3COOH will donate H+ to neutralize the OH- from Ba(OH)2. So the OH- can react with both HCl and CH3COOH.

So perhaps the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, and then any remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH.

So let's proceed step by step.

Total OH-: 0.18 mol.

Total H+ available: 0.08 (from HCl) + a (from CH3COOH).

But wait, the OH- will react with H+ in the following way: OH- will first react with HCl's H+ because it's a strong acid (so H+ is fully available), and any remaining OH- will react with CH3COOH's H+.

So let's compute how much OH- is needed to neutralize the HCl.

HCl provides 0.08 mol H+. The OH- is 0.18 mol. So after neutralizing HCl, the OH- remaining is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Now, this remaining 0.10 mol OH- will react with the CH3COOH's H+.

CH3COOH has 0.05 mol (since it's 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol). But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it can donate H+ when OH- is present.

So the OH- will react with the CH3COOH as follows: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Each mole of OH- reacts with one mole of CH3COOH to produce one mole of acetate ion.

So the OH- is 0.10 mol, and CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. So all of the CH3COOH will react with the OH-.

Wait, but 0.10 mol OH- is more than 0.05 mol CH3COOH. So all the CH3COOH will react, and there will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH- left.

So after all reactions:

- HCl's H+ is completely neutralized by 0.08 mol OH-.

- CH3COOH's 0.05 mol reacts with 0.05 mol OH-, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So total OH- remaining is 0.05 mol.

Wait, but wait. Because Ba(OH)2 provides 0.18 mol OH-.

So the sequence is:

1. OH- neutralizes H+ from HCl: 0.08 H+ → 0.08 OH- consumed.

Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

2. Then, the remaining OH- (0.10) reacts with CH3COOH.

CH3COOH can donate 0.05 mol H+ (since it's 0.05 mol), so 0.05 OH- will react, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH-.

So now, after all reactions, the solution has 0.05 mol of OH- left in the total solution volume.

Wait, but what about the concentrations? The total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = approximately 0.04167 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but that would give a pH of 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, am I missing something here? Because when the OH- reacts with CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, it's possible that not all of the OH- is consumed, but I think the calculation is correct.

But let me double-check the steps.

Total moles of OH-: 0.18.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08.

So OH- neutralizes HCl's H+, using 0.08 mol OH-.

Remaining OH-: 0.10.

CH3COOH has 0.05 mol, which can donate 0.05 H+ (but since OH- is a strong base, it will react with the weak acid, consuming the H+ from the acid).

So the 0.05 OH- reacts with 0.05 CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

Wait, but OH- is in excess here. So the solution is basic, and pH is 12.62, option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the reaction between OH- and CH3COOH. Let me think again: when OH- is added to a solution of CH3COOH, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

This reaction goes to completion because OH- is a strong base. So all the available OH- will react with CH3COOH until one is exhausted.

In this case, after using 0.08 mol OH- to neutralize HCl, 0.10 mol OH- is left. Then, it reacts with CH3COOH, which has 0.05 mol.

So the OH- will consume all 0.05 mol CH3COOH, producing 0.05 mol CH3COO^- and using up 0.05 mol OH-.

So remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Thus, the total solution has 0.05 mol OH- in 1.2 L.

So [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

That matches option A.

Wait, but another thought: when mixing the solutions, the concentrations change, but I think the approach is correct because I used moles and total volume.

So the answer should be option A) 12.62.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids (CH3COOH and HCl) and the base (Ba(OH)2). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of each substance:**
   - **CH3COOH (weak acid):**  
     Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L, Molarity = 0.1 M → Moles = \( 0.1 \times 0.5 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L, Molarity = 0.2 M → Moles = \( 0.2 \times 0.4 = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**  
     Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L, Molarity = 0.3 M → Moles = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of OH⁻, so total OH⁻ moles = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Reaction sequence:**
   - The OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2 reacts with H⁺ from HCl (strong acid) first, as H⁺ from HCl is fully available.  
     Moles of H⁺ from HCl = 0.08 mol.  
     Moles of OH⁻ neutralized by HCl = 0.08 mol.  
     Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \).
   - The remaining OH⁻ reacts with CH3COOH (weak acid). Each mole of CH3COOH donates 1 mole of H⁺.  
     Moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol.  
     Moles of OH⁻ neutralized by CH3COOH = 0.05 mol.  
     Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Calculate OH⁻ concentration:**
   - Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
   - [OH⁻] = \( \frac{\text{Moles of OH⁻}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

4. **Calculate pH:**
   - pOH = \( -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).  
   - pH = \( 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.

Answer: A
