Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Hmm, let me read it carefully. So the setup is that someone did a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. Then they made knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3).

The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So that means one of them is regulating the expression of the others. Transcription factors usually bind to DNA and help turn on or off other genes, right?

Then they tested the mutants for their resistance to the pathogen. The resistance levels are given as percentages of the control (wild-type). So 100% is the same as wild type, which I assume is fully resistant. The lower the percentage, the more susceptible the plant is because it's less resistant.

Looking at the results:

- g1: 75% → less resistant than wild type but not as bad as others.
- g2: 0% → super susceptible, so this plant can't resist the fungus at all. Like, no resistance. So knocking out G2 really messes things up.
- g3: 50% → half the resistance of wild type.
- g1g3: 10% → really bad, almost all plants get infected. Only 10% of wild-type resistance.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2, no resistance.
- g1g2: 0% → same here, no resistance.

Wait, so when any mutant includes g2, the resistance drops to 0%. The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0%, same as g2 alone. But for g1g3, it's 10%. Hmm, that's interesting.

The question is about the interaction between these genes. The options are about which is a transcription factor and how the genes interact.

I remember that in genetics, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So if gene A is epistatic over gene B, the phenotype of B is only seen when A is functional. Alternatively, if you have double mutants, the phenotype might be more severe than either single mutant.

Also, pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.

Redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function. So if you knock out both, the effect is worse than either alone.

So first, let's think about each single mutant.

g2 has 0% resistance. So G2 is really important. The fact that the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 also have 0% suggests that in those cases, the lack of G2 is causing the problem. So maybe G2 is upstream of the others. Because even if you have a problem with G1 or G3, the knockout of G2 is worse.

Wait, but when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0. So G2 must be a critical gene. Since it's a transcription factor, perhaps it's activating other genes that are important for resistance.

Looking at the double mutants: when you have g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway. Because when both are knocked out, the effect is additive or synergistic. So maybe they function in parallel pathways, or they both contribute to the same process.

But when you have g2 knocked out, regardless of the other gene, the resistance is 0. So regardless of G1 or G3, if G2 is not present, the resistance is gone. Which suggests that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it activates both G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can function. But wait, in the single mutants, G1 and G3 are still expressed because only their own genes are knocked out.

Wait, no. The knockouts are for the individual genes. So g1 means the G1 gene is non-functional, but G2 and G3 are still active. Similarly, in g2, G2 is non-functional. So, if G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed, because their transcription depends on G2. But wait, the single mutants g1 and g3 only have their own gene knocked out. So, in g1, G1 is not functional, but G2 and G3 are. So, in that case, G2 is functional, so perhaps G3 is being expressed. But then why does the g1 mutant have 75% resistance?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think in terms of what the data is showing.

In the single mutants:
- g1: 75% → less resistance but not as bad as g2 or g1g3.
- g2: 0% → no resistance, which is the worst.
- g3: 50% → halfway resistance. So G3 is contributing, but not as critical as G2.

In the double mutants:
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2.
- g1g3: 10% → worse than either single, but not as bad as g2.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2.

Hmm, so the presence of g2 in any double mutant leads to 0% resistance. So perhaps G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the other genes' effects don't matter. So G2 is upstream, and its absence masks the effects of G1 and G3.

So, in the double mutant g1g3, which doesn't include g2, the resistance is 10%. That suggests that G1 and G3 are both contributing to resistance but their combined loss is worse than either alone. So perhaps they function in parallel pathways or are additive in their effects.

So, what do these observations mean for the gene interactions?

If G2 is a transcription factor, then G2 likely activates the expression of both G1 and G3. Because, in the single mutant g2, both G1 and G3 are not expressed (since their expression depends on G2). But wait, in the single mutants g1 and g3, their respective genes are knocked out but G2 is functional. So in g1, G2 is active, so G3 can be expressed, and vice versa. 

Wait, but in the single mutant g1, what is the resistance level? 75%. Wild type is 100%, so when G1 is knocked out, resistance is 75%. So G1 contributes 25% to the resistance. Similarly, g3 is 50% → G3 contributes 50% on its own. But when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is much lower than the sum of 75% and 50% (but that's not exactly additive, since 75+50 would be 125, but in reality, it's 10, which suggests some kind of interaction where the two genes function in the same pathway or are redundant.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Maybe each of G1 and G3 contributes some resistance. If G1 is responsible for 25% (since without it, 75% remains), and G3 is responsible for 50% (since without it, 50% remains), then together they would account for (25 + 50) = 75% of the resistance. But in the double mutant, the resistance is only 10%. That suggests they are not additive but perhaps synergistic in their effects. Alternatively, perhaps they function in the same pathway, so without both, the pathway is completely blocked. But the double mutant's resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way to model it. Another approach: if G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream targets. Then, the presence of G2 is necessary for G1 and G3 to be expressed. So in the g2 mutant, G1 and G3 are not expressed. But the single mutants g1 and g3 still have G2 active, so the other gene is expressed.

Wait, but that doesn't fit with the data. For example, in g1: G1 is knocked out, but G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. G3's expression would provide 50% resistance. But the observed resistance is 75% for g1. Hmm, that's higher than G3's 50% contribution. So that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are not directly downstream of G2. Maybe G2 regulates another gene that's involved in resistance. Or perhaps G2 is part of a larger regulatory network.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the concept of epistasis. If G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, that would explain why the double mutants involving G2 have the same resistance as G2 alone. Because the presence of a mutation in G2 masks the effect of the other mutations.

So, for example, in the g1g2 mutant, since G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g2 (0%). So, in this case, the double mutant is as bad as the g2 single mutant. Similarly, g2g3 is as bad as g2.

But what about g1g3? Their double mutant is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So if neither gene is epistatic over the other, the effect is additive or perhaps synergistic.

So, if G2 is a transcription factor, perhaps it's acting upstream of both G1 and G3. So, without G2, you can't get the function of G1 or G3. But in the double mutant g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, so the plant is even more susceptible than either alone. But wait, no, the double mutant has 10% resistance, but the single g2 mutant is 0%, which is worse than 10%.

Hmm, maybe G2 is the most critical gene, and G1 and G3 provide some redundancy or additive functions. So, without G2, the plant can't resist at all, but without G1 and G3 together, it's still a bit resistant.

So, putting this together, G2 is the transcription factor, and it's necessary for the function of either G1 or G3. Or perhaps both. So when G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute, leading to 0% resistance. In the single mutants, when only one of G1 or G3 is knocked out, the other can still contribute, but not as effectively. 

But in the case of g1g3, both are knocked out, so there's no function from either, hence 10% resistance. So what's providing that 10%? Maybe another pathway or some residual resistance.

So, now looking at the options:

Option A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but according to the data, G2 is the one with 0% resistance, which suggests it's the most important, so maybe it's the transcription factor. So option A says G1 is TF. That might not fit.

Option B) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1. Hmm, same promoter? That could mean they are co-regulated, but I don't know about that. Also, in the g1g3 mutant, the resistance is worse, which suggests that each contributes something, so perhaps they are in parallel. If G3 were epistatic to G1, then in the double mutant, the resistance would be the same as G3. But in the data, the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than either G1 (75%) or G3 (50%). So that doesn't fit.

Option C) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure that's relevant here. Also, if G1 were epistatic over G3, then in the g1g3 mutant, the resistance would be the same as G1's single mutant (75%), but it's 10%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit.

Option D) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Gene redundancy would mean that they perform the same function. If they are redundant, then knocking both out would have a worse effect than either alone. Which fits with the g1g3 mutant being worse. Now, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant, the phenotype would be that of G1. But in this case, the g1g3 mutant has 10% resistance, which is worse than either. So that doesn't fit the definition of epistasis. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up epistasis. Let me think. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of gene B is only seen when gene A is present. So if you have a mutation in both, the phenotype is that of the upstream gene. So if G2 is upstream, then in the absence of G2, the other mutations don't matter. So that fits, but what about the other interactions.

Wait, the question states that at least one is a transcription factor, so that's G2 in options B, C, D. So probably G2 is the transcription factor.

Looking back, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%. So G2 is the key gene. G1 and G3 are contributing, but their individual knockouts don't completely disable resistance.

In the double mutants, without G2, resistance is 0%. So G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the other mutations don't matter.

So, in terms of the options, which ones say G2 is the TF and is epistatic?

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because G2's knockout is worse.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter. So that would mean they are co-regulated by the same promoter, perhaps. But I'm not sure how that ties into the results.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I'm not sure about pleiotropy here. Also, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the double mutant, it's worse than either.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That would mean that each can perform the same function. So knocking both out would have a worse effect. Which is the case with g1g3 (10%). Also, redundancy doesn't directly explain the epistatic relationship.

Wait, but the options are about how they interact. So, in the case where G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant or in parallel pathways.

So, going back to the question: which conclusion can we draw? We have to see which option fits.

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking both out would have a worse effect than either single. Which fits the 10% resistance. So that's consistent.

But then, the part about epistasis: if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in a double mutant, the resistance should be the same as the single mutant for G1 or G3, whichever is epistatic. But in this case, the double mutant has 10%, which is worse than either. So that doesn't fit with G1 being epistatic to G3.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because in the double mutants with g2, the resistance is 0%, the same as g2 alone. So the presence of G2's knockout masks the effect of the other mutations.

So, which option says G2 is epistatic towards G1 and G3?

Option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Option B says G3 epistatic towards G1.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Option D says nothing directly about G2's epistasis.

Wait, looking at the options, only option A and B mention G2 being epistatic.

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. So in the g1g2 double mutant, the resistance would be 0%, which matches the data. But for the g2g3 and g1g3, what happens?

Wait, option D's third part is G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the g1g3 mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So if G1 is epistatic, the double mutant should have the same resistance as the G1 mutant (75%). But in reality, it's 10%, so that doesn't fit.

So, looking back at the options, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1, but not towards G3. But in the data, g2g3 also has 0% resistance. So if G2 is epistatic to both, then any double mutant involving G2 would have 0%, which is what the data shows.

So, which option says G2 is a TF and is epistatic over G1 and G3?

Looking at the options:

A) G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

No, because G2's epistasis doesn't account for G3.

B) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, not sure.

C) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either.

D) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm, but the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either. So that doesn't fit with epistasis.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is not any of the above, but let me reevaluate.

Looking again, the only option where G2 is a TF and G2 is epistatic is option A. But option A says G1 is a TF, which can't be right because G2's knockout is way more severe.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me reevaluate the options.

Option D says G2 is a TF; G1 and G3 are redundant. So, when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either. That fits with the g1g3 resistance being 10%. So that part is correct.

But what about the epistasis? Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, if G1 is epistatic, in the double mutant, the resistance should match the more severe of G1 or G3. Since G1 is 75%, G3 is 50%, the double mutant should be 75% if G1 is epistatic. But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse than either. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the option that fits is option A, but no, because G1 is supposed to be a TF, which isn't the case.

Wait, let me think about the hierarchy. G2's knockout is the most severe. So G2 is likely the transcription factor that activates other genes. So in the absence of G2, those downstream genes (G1, G3, etc.) can't be expressed, leading to no resistance.

So, in the single mutants, the g1 plant has 75% resistance, which suggests that G1 is important but not critical. Similarly, g3 has 50% resistance.

If G2 is a TF, then in the g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

In the double mutant g1g3, even though G2 is functional, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. So, their individual contributions add up, leading to 10% resistance.

Wait, but I originally thought that in the double mutant, the combined effect is worse than either single. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing some resistance, and together they contribute more. So, when both are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is their combined effect.

In this case, the presence of G2 is necessary for the expression of G1 and G3. So, G2 is upstream.

So, the hierarchy is G2 → G1 and G3 → resistance.

So, the interaction is that G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, possibly in parallel pathways.

So, looking at the options, which one fits this scenario?

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, gene redundancy would mean that knocking both out is worse than either. Which is the case here. But redundancy would imply that each gene can compensate for the other, so without both, the effect is additive.

In the double mutant, resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So that's consistent with redundancy.

So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then without both, the resistance is lower than without either. So, this fits.

Now, about epistasis: option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the g1g3 mutant, the resistance is worse than either, which suggests that the effects are additive, not epistatic. So, perhaps the epistasis part is not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 have a redundant function. So option D would fit that part.

But the last part of option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. I'm not sure if that holds true.

Wait, perhaps the gene redundancy and epistasis are related. For example, if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway (redundant), then knocking both out would have a worse effect than either. So perhaps they are not epistatic but additive.

But the options require us to choose the best conclusion based on the data.

Looking again, the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So G2 is the likely TF.

In the data, any mutant that includes G2 (g2, g1g2, g2g3) has 0% resistance. So, G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3. So any mutation in G2 masks the effects of mutations in G1 and G3.

So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, which option says G2 is a TF and is epistatic to others.

Looking:

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1. But what about G3? The data shows that in the g2g3 double mutant, the resistance is 0%, same as G2. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

Option B: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 same promoter. G3 epistatic to G1.

Hmm, not sure.

Option C: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 pleiotropic. G1 epistatic to G3.

No, because the double mutant is worse.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3.

No, because the double mutant isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but I have to choose the best one.

The options are:

A) G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1.

B) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

C) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3.

D) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

The conclusion from the data is that G2 is a transcription factor and is epistatic to G1 and G3. Additionally, G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other because their double mutant is worse than either single. So, their functions are additive or redundant.

Looking at the options, which one includes G2 as a TF and G2 being epistatic to others.

Only option A and option B have G2 as TF and G2 epistatic towards others.

Wait, option B says G3 is epistatic towards G1. But in the data, when both are knocked out (g1g3), resistance is 10% which is worse than either. So that doesn't fit with epistasis.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Additionally, G1 and G3 are redundant or additive in their functions.

Looking at the options:

Only option A and option B have G2 as a TF. Option A says G2 is epistatic to G1 but doesn't mention G3. Option B says G3 is epistatic to G1, which doesn't fit the data.

Wait, perhaps the correct option isn't present, but I have to choose the best fit.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

But the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either, which suggests they are not epistatic but additive.

So, perhaps the best fit is option D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another angle: the single mutants are 75%, 0%, and 50%. The double mutants with G2 are 0%, and without G2, the double mutant is 10%.

So, the hierarchy of importance is G2 > G1 > G3.

So, the most critical is G2, then G1, then G3.

In the absence of G2 (g2 and any double with g2), resistance is 0%.

In the absence of G1 or G3, you have partial resistance.

In the absence of both G1 and G3, resistance is 10%, which suggests that G2 is working but not enough, but wait, in the absence of G2, you have 0%. So in the absence of both G1 and G3, but G2 is present, you have 10% resistance.

Wait, but without G2, you can't have any expression of G1 or G3. So in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is present, so G1 and G3 can be expressed if they have their own promoters. But in the data, the g1g3 mutant has 10% resistance. So perhaps G1 and G3 are not regulated by G2, which contradicts the initial assumption that at least one (G2) is a transcription factor acting upstream of others.

Wait, so if G2 is a transcription factor, and you knock out G2, then G1 and G3 can't be expressed. But in the single mutants, G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present. So if G1 and G3 are downstream of G2, then in the single mutants, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 would be expressed. But their single mutants have lower resistance than the wild type, which suggests that they contribute to resistance but aren't the only factors.

Wait, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates a resistance pathway that includes G1 and G3. So, without G2, the pathway is not activated. But without G1 or G3, the pathway is partially active.

So in the g1 mutant, G2 is present and active, so G3 is expressed, providing 50% resistance. But wait, the data shows g1 is 75% resistance. So if G3's contribution is 50%, then why is g1 75%?

Ah, perhaps G1 and G3 are both part of the same pathway, and each contributes some level of resistance. When G1 is knocked out, the pathway is only partially functional, leading to 75% resistance. When G3 is knocked out, the pathway is 50% functional. When both are knocked out, the pathway is only 10% functional.

So, G2 is the transcription factor that activates this pathway. So, in the absence of G2, the pathway isn't activated at all, leading to 0% resistance. Without G1 or G3, the pathway is partially active.

So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 because without G2, the downstream genes can't contribute.

So, looking at the options, which one fits this scenario.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3.

Hmm, but redundancy would imply that knocking both out doesn't change the phenotype beyond knocking one out. But in the data, knocking both gives a worse phenotype, so that's not redundancy.

So perhaps the correct answer is that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 contribute additively, and G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking at the options, none have G2 being epistatic to both, except perhaps option A if considering that G2 is epistatic to G1 and perhaps G3.

Wait, looking at option A: G1 is a transcription factor. But the data shows that G2's knockout is worse, so G2 is more likely the TF.

So, perhaps the correct option is option A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the best fit is option D.

Wait, another approach: when you have a double mutant, the resistance is worse than either single, it suggests that the two genes function in the same pathway and their functions are additive. So, perhaps their functions are additive or synergistic.

So, in this case, G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their combined loss leads to a worse phenotype than either alone.

Thus, G2 is a transcription factor, and it's epistatic to both G1 and G3.

So, looking for an option where G2 is the TF and is epistatic. The only options where G2 is TF are B, C, D.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, worse than either. So if G3 is epistatic to G1, then the resistance should be that of G3 (50%) but it's worse. So that doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 and G3 affect other traits, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3.

If they are redundant, then the double mutant should have the same resistance as the more severe single mutant, which would be 75% from G1. But the data is 10%, which is worse. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm, none of the options perfectly fit, but perhaps the closest is option A, but A says G1 is a TF.

Wait, the initial statement is that at least one is a TF, which is G2 in all the options except A.

So, the correct answer must be among B, C, or D.

Another approach: the only option where G2 is a TF and in the double mutants, the presence of G2 knockout makes the resistance 0% is option B? No, option B says G3 is epistatic to G1. But in the data, when G2 is present, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. So perhaps that's a clue.

Wait, perhaps in the double mutant g1g3, G2 is present. But since G2 is a TF, in this case, if G1 and G3 are co-regulated, perhaps the promoter is the same, and knocking both out would have an additive effect.

Option B states that G1 and G3 have the same promoter, meaning they're co-regulated. So, perhaps G2 activates their promoter. So in the absence of G2, neither is expressed. But in the single mutants, when G2 is present, the other gene is expressed.

Wait, the data shows that in g1, G1 is knocked out, but G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. But the resistance is 75%, higher than when G3 is knocked out (g3 is 50%). So this doesn't fit because if G3 is expressed in g1, the resistance should be similar to G3's contribution.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of how the options relate.

The correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and it is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Additionally, G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not epistatic to each other. Their combined knockout results in a worse phenotype than either alone, suggesting they are in parallel pathways or redundant.

Looking back at the options, none directly state this. But let's reevaluate option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So their combined knockout is worse. But the epistasis part says G1 is epistatic towards G3, which doesn't fit the data. So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Another angle: the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single. So G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other. So their effects are additive or redundant.

In genetics, when two genes are in the same pathway, their double mutant may have a more severe phenotype than either single. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, each contributing some function.

But if G2 is a TF, then G2's knockout would prevent the entire pathway from working, leading to 0% resistance in g2 mutants.

So, the hierarchy is G2 → G1 and G3 → resistance.

Therefore, G2 is the upstream gene and is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So, among the options, which ones have G2 as TF and G2 being epistatic to others.

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1, but what about G3? The data shows that in g2g3 double mutant, resistance is 0%, same as G2. So, G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

Thus, option A's third point doesn't cover G3.

Option B: G3 is epistatic to G1. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, worse than either. So, that's not epistatic.

Option C: G1 is epistatic to G3. Again, the data doesn't fit.

Option D: G1 is epistatic to G3. Doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are pleiotropic, G1 is epistatic to G3.

But I don't see the link between pleiotropy and the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Because gene redundancy would explain that the double mutant is worse.

But the epistasis part in D is not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I've made a mistake earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way to proceed is to think about what each option implies.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 are pleiotropic, G2 is epistatic to G1.

But if G1 is TF, why is g2 more severe? Because G2 is epistatic to G1.

But I think the correct answer is option A isn't correct because G2's effect is more severe.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck and need to make a decision.

Given the data, G2's knockout is the most severe, so G2 is the TF. Any double mutant involving G2 has 0% resistance, showing G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. G1 and G3's double mutant has worse resistance than either, implying they're additive.

Looking at the options, the correct one would be that G2 is a TF, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 are additive.

But none of the options explicitly state this. The closest is option D.

Wait, wait. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the double mutant g1g3.

In the g1g3 mutant, G2 is present. So, if G2 is a TF, then G1 and G3 are downstream. But in the g1g3 mutant, G1 and G3 are knocked out. So, their contribution is gone. So, what's the 10% resistance from? Maybe another gene. So, perhaps G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway, and without both, the pathway is severely compromised, leading to 10% resistance. But since G2 is present, it's expressed.

Wait, but without G2, the pathway is completely off. So, in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is present but G1 and G3 are not. So, the remaining resistance is from other factors not involving G2, G1, or G3.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about each option:

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

But in the double mutant, the resistance is worse than either, so redundancy doesn't fit.

So, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but I have to choose the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another angle: the fact that g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is additive (75% +50% = 125%, but we have 10%, which doesn't add up). So perhaps they function in the same pathway, and their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.

So, perhaps they are in the same pathway, and G2 is upstream.

In that case, G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway.

So, looking at the options, which one says that.

Option C says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

But pleiotropy isn't about the same pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options are correct, but I have to choose the best fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

But the data doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

In this case, G3 is epistatic to G1, so in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be the same as G3's single mutant (50%), but the data says 10%, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the best approach is to conclude that G2 is the transcription factor and is epistatic to G1 and G3, which is covered in option A's G2 epistatic to G1, but not G3. But the data shows that G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A.

No, because option A says G1 is the TF. So I'm back to square one.

Wait, another thought: the double mutants involving G2 all have 0% resistance. So, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So, any mutation in G2 masks the effect of other mutations. So, the order is G2 → G1 and G3 → resistance.

So, in the absence of G2, G1 and G3 can't contribute. So, in the double mutant g1g3, G2 is present, so they can contribute, but only 10%. So perhaps G1 and G3 contribute additively even when G2 is present.

In that case, G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, contributing additively. So, the double mutant without G2 would have 0%, but with G2, the double mutant of G1 and G3 would have additive effect.

Looking for an option where G2 is a TF and G2 is epistatic to both.

Only option A and B have G2 as TF, but their epistasis parts don't fit.

After this long thought process, I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps considering that the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single, it suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, not redundant. So, their functions are additive, and their combined loss leads to a worse phenotype.

So, putting it all together, the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Additionally, G1 and G3 function in the same pathway, contributing additively to resistance.

But among the options, the only one that aligns is option A, but it says G1 is TF, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think that G2 is the TF, and the correct option is option A, but no.

Wait, the correct option must be option A.

No, I'm getting myself confused. I think the correct answer is option A: G1 is a transcription factor, but that can't be right because G2's knockout is worse.

I think I'm stuck and have to make a choice.

The experiment investigates the roles of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The results show varying resistance levels in single and double mutants, and the question asks about the interaction between these genes. Key observations include:

1. **Single mutants**:  
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (down from 100%).  
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (complete susceptibility).  
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (halved resistance).  

2. **Double mutants**:  
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).  
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).  
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).  

### Analysis of the Data:
- **G2 is critical**: The g2 mutant shows 0% resistance, and any double mutant involving g2 also has 0% resistance (e.g., g1g2, g2g3). This indicates that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning its absence masks the effects of the other genes. G2 is likely the transcription factor acting upstream of the resistance pathway.
- **G1 and G3 contribute additively**: The g1 mutant retains 75% resistance, and the g3 mutant retains 50%, suggesting both genes contribute to resistance. The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, indicating that their contributions are additive rather than epistatic.
- **No evidence for redundancy**: If G1 and G3 were redundant, the double mutant g1g3 would have the same resistance as the more severe single mutant (e.g., g2). However, the 10% resistance in g1g3 suggests they are not redundant but rather function in parallel or additive pathways.

### Evaluation of Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - States that G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1.  
   - This is inconsistent because G2 is the most critical gene (0% resistance in g2), making it more likely to be the transcription factor, not G1.

2. **Option B**:  
   - States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 share the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic to G1.  
   - While G2 is likely the transcription factor, the claim that G3 is epistatic to G1 is unsupported. The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, contradicting the idea of epistasis.

3. **Option C**:  
   - States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.  
   - Pleiotropy is not supported by the data, as the resistance levels do not indicate that G1 and G3 affect multiple traits. Additionally, the 10% resistance in g1g3 contradicts the idea that G1 is epistatic to G3.

4. **Option D**:  
   - States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.  
   - Redundancy is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant but rather additive in their contributions. Additionally, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is unsupported.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly support that G2 is the transcription factor and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance, but none of the options perfectly describe this interaction. Among the given options, **Option D** is the closest, as it correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor, even though the redundancy and epistasis claims are not fully supported by the data.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Hmm, let me read it carefully. So the setup is that someone did a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. Then they made knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3).

The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So that means one of them is regulating the expression of the others. Transcription factors usually bind to DNA and help turn on or off other genes, right?

Then they tested the mutants for their resistance to the pathogen. The resistance levels are given as percentages of the control (wild-type). So 100% is the same as wild type, which I assume is fully resistant. The lower the percentage, the more susceptible the plant is because it's less resistant.

Looking at the results:

- g1: 75% → less resistant than wild type but not as bad as others.
- g2: 0% → super susceptible, so this plant can't resist the fungus at all. Like, no resistance. So knocking out G2 really messes things up.
- g3: 50% → half the resistance of wild type.
- g1g3: 10% → really bad, almost all plants get infected. Only 10% of wild-type resistance.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2, no resistance.
- g1g2: 0% → same here, no resistance.

Wait, so when any mutant includes g2, the resistance drops to 0%. The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0%, same as g2 alone. But for g1g3, it's 10%. Hmm, that's interesting.

The question is about the interaction between these genes. The options are about which is a transcription factor and how the genes interact.

I remember that in genetics, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So if gene A is epistatic over gene B, the phenotype of B is only seen when A is functional. Alternatively, if you have double mutants, the phenotype might be more severe than either single mutant.

Also, pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.

Redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function. So if you knock out both, the effect is worse than either alone.

So first, let's think about each single mutant.

g2 has 0% resistance. So G2 is really important. The fact that the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 also have 0% suggests that in those cases, the lack of G2 is causing the problem. So maybe G2 is upstream of the others. Because even if you have a problem with G1 or G3, the knockout of G2 is worse.

Wait, but when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0. So G2 must be a critical gene. Since it's a transcription factor, perhaps it's activating other genes that are important for resistance.

Looking at the double mutants: when you have g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway. Because when both are knocked out, the effect is additive or synergistic. So maybe they function in parallel pathways, or they both contribute to the same process.

But when you have g2 knocked out, regardless of the other gene, the resistance is 0. So regardless of G1 or G3, if G2 is not present, the resistance is gone. Which suggests that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it activates both G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can function. But wait, in the single mutants, G1 and G3 are still expressed because only their own genes are knocked out.

Wait, no. The knockouts are for the individual genes. So g1 means the G1 gene is non-functional, but G2 and G3 are still active. Similarly, in g2, G2 is non-functional. So, if G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed, because their transcription depends on G2. But wait, the single mutants g1 and g3 only have their own gene knocked out. So, in g1, G1 is not functional, but G2 and G3 are. So, in that case, G2 is functional, so perhaps G3 is being expressed. But then why does the g1 mutant have 75% resistance?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think in terms of what the data is showing.

In the single mutants:
- g1: 75% → less resistance but not as bad as g2 or g1g3.
- g2: 0% → no resistance, which is the worst.
- g3: 50% → halfway resistance. So G3 is contributing, but not as critical as G2.

In the double mutants:
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2.
- g1g3: 10% → worse than either single, but not as bad as g2.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2.

Hmm, so the presence of g2 in any double mutant leads to 0% resistance. So perhaps G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the other genes' effects don't matter. So G2 is upstream, and its absence masks the effects of G1 and G3.

So, in the double mutant g1g3, which doesn't include g2, the resistance is 10%. That suggests that G1 and G3 are both contributing to resistance but their combined loss is worse than either alone. So perhaps they function in parallel pathways or are additive in their effects.

So, what do these observations mean for the gene interactions?

If G2 is a transcription factor, then G2 likely activates the expression of both G1 and G3. Because, in the single mutant g2, both G1 and G3 are not expressed (since their expression depends on G2). But wait, in the single mutants g1 and g3, their respective genes are knocked out but G2 is functional. So in g1, G2 is active, so G3 can be expressed, and vice versa. 

Wait, but in the single mutant g1, what is the resistance level? 75%. Wild type is 100%, so when G1 is knocked out, resistance is 75%. So G1 contributes 25% to the resistance. Similarly, g3 is 50% → G3 contributes 50% on its own. But when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is much lower than the sum of 75% and 50% (but that's not exactly additive, since 75+50 would be 125, but in reality, it's 10, which suggests some kind of interaction where the two genes function in the same pathway or are redundant.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Maybe each of G1 and G3 contributes some resistance. If G1 is responsible for 25% (since without it, 75% remains), and G3 is responsible for 50% (since without it, 50% remains), then together they would account for (25 + 50) = 75% of the resistance. But in the double mutant, the resistance is only 10%. That suggests they are not additive but perhaps synergistic in their effects. Alternatively, perhaps they function in the same pathway, so without both, the pathway is completely blocked. But the double mutant's resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way to model it. Another approach: if G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream targets. Then, the presence of G2 is necessary for G1 and G3 to be expressed. So in the g2 mutant, G1 and G3 are not expressed. But the single mutants g1 and g3 still have G2 active, so the other gene is expressed.

Wait, but that doesn't fit with the data. For example, in g1: G1 is knocked out, but G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. G3's expression would provide 50% resistance. But the observed resistance is 75% for g1. Hmm, that's higher than G3's 50% contribution. So that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are not directly downstream of G2. Maybe G2 regulates another gene that's involved in resistance. Or perhaps G2 is part of a larger regulatory network.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the concept of epistasis. If G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, that would explain why the double mutants involving G2 have the same resistance as G2 alone. Because the presence of a mutation in G2 masks the effect of the other mutations.

So, for example, in the g1g2 mutant, since G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g2 (0%). So, in this case, the double mutant is as bad as the g2 single mutant. Similarly, g2g3 is as bad as g2.

But what about g1g3? Their double mutant is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So if neither gene is epistatic over the other, the effect is additive or perhaps synergistic.

So, if G2 is a transcription factor, perhaps it's acting upstream of both G1 and G3. So, without G2, you can't get the function of G1 or G3. But in the double mutant g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, so the plant is even more susceptible than either alone. But wait, no, the double mutant has 10% resistance, but the single g2 mutant is 0%, which is worse than 10%.

Hmm, maybe G2 is the most critical gene, and G1 and G3 provide some redundancy or additive functions. So, without G2, the plant can't resist at all, but without G1 and G3 together, it's still a bit resistant.

So, putting this together, G2 is the transcription factor, and it's necessary for the function of either G1 or G3. Or perhaps both. So when G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute, leading to 0% resistance. In the single mutants, when only one of G1 or G3 is knocked out, the other can still contribute, but not as effectively. 

But in the case of g1g3, both are knocked out, so there's no function from either, hence 10% resistance. So what's providing that 10%? Maybe another pathway or some residual resistance.

So, now looking at the options:

Option A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but according to the data, G2 is the one with 0% resistance, which suggests it's the most important, so maybe it's the transcription factor. So option A says G1 is TF. That might not fit.

Option B) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1. Hmm, same promoter? That could mean they are co-regulated, but I don't know about that. Also, in the g1g3 mutant, the resistance is worse, which suggests that each contributes something, so perhaps they are in parallel. If G3 were epistatic to G1, then in the double mutant, the resistance would be the same as G3. But in the data, the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than either G1 (75%) or G3 (50%). So that doesn't fit.

Option C) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure that's relevant here. Also, if G1 were epistatic over G3, then in the g1g3 mutant, the resistance would be the same as G1's single mutant (75%), but it's 10%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit.

Option D) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Gene redundancy would mean that they perform the same function. If they are redundant, then knocking both out would have a worse effect than either alone. Which fits with the g1g3 mutant being worse. Now, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant, the phenotype would be that of G1. But in this case, the g1g3 mutant has 10% resistance, which is worse than either. So that doesn't fit the definition of epistasis. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up epistasis. Let me think. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of gene B is only seen when gene A is present. So if you have a mutation in both, the phenotype is that of the upstream gene. So if G2 is upstream, then in the absence of G2, the other mutations don't matter. So that fits, but what about the other interactions.

Wait, the question states that at least one is a transcription factor, so that's G2 in options B, C, D. So probably G2 is the transcription factor.

Looking back, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%. So G2 is the key gene. G1 and G3 are contributing, but their individual knockouts don't completely disable resistance.

In the double mutants, without G2, resistance is 0%. So G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the other mutations don't matter.

So, in terms of the options, which ones say G2 is the TF and is epistatic?

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because G2's knockout is worse.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter. So that would mean they are co-regulated by the same promoter, perhaps. But I'm not sure how that ties into the results.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I'm not sure about pleiotropy here. Also, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the double mutant, it's worse than either.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That would mean that each can perform the same function. So knocking both out would have a worse effect. Which is the case with g1g3 (10%). Also, redundancy doesn't directly explain the epistatic relationship.

Wait, but the options are about how they interact. So, in the case where G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant or in parallel pathways.

So, going back to the question: which conclusion can we draw? We have to see which option fits.

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking both out would have a worse effect than either single. Which fits the 10% resistance. So that's consistent.

But then, the part about epistasis: if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in a double mutant, the resistance should be the same as the single mutant for G1 or G3, whichever is epistatic. But in this case, the double mutant has 10%, which is worse than either. So that doesn't fit with G1 being epistatic to G3.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because in the double mutants with g2, the resistance is 0%, the same as g2 alone. So the presence of G2's knockout masks the effect of the other mutations.

So, which option says G2 is epistatic towards G1 and G3?

Option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Option B says G3 epistatic towards G1.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Option D says nothing directly about G2's epistasis.

Wait, looking at the options, only option A and B mention G2 being epistatic.

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. So in the g1g2 double mutant, the resistance would be 0%, which matches the data. But for the g2g3 and g1g3, what happens?

Wait, option D's third part is G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the g1g3 mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So if G1 is epistatic, the double mutant should have the same resistance as the G1 mutant (75%). But in reality, it's 10%, so that doesn't fit.

So, looking back at the options, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1, but not towards G3. But in the data, g2g3 also has 0% resistance. So if G2 is epistatic to both, then any double mutant involving G2 would have 0%, which is what the data shows.

So, which option says G2 is a TF and is epistatic over G1 and G3?

Looking at the options:

A) G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

No, because G2's epistasis doesn't account for G3.

B) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, not sure.

C) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either.

D) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm, but the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either. So that doesn't fit with epistasis.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is not any of the above, but let me reevaluate.

Looking again, the only option where G2 is a TF and G2 is epistatic is option A. But option A says G1 is a TF, which can't be right because G2's knockout is way more severe.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me reevaluate the options.

Option D says G2 is a TF; G1 and G3 are redundant. So, when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either. That fits with the g1g3 resistance being 10%. So that part is correct.

But what about the epistasis? Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, if G1 is epistatic, in the double mutant, the resistance should match the more severe of G1 or G3. Since G1 is 75%, G3 is 50%, the double mutant should be 75% if G1 is epistatic. But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse than either. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the option that fits is option A, but no, because G1 is supposed to be a TF, which isn't the case.

Wait, let me think about the hierarchy. G2's knockout is the most severe. So G2 is likely the transcription factor that activates other genes. So in the absence of G2, those downstream genes (G1, G3, etc.) can't be expressed, leading to no resistance.

So, in the single mutants, the g1 plant has 75% resistance, which suggests that G1 is important but not critical. Similarly, g3 has 50% resistance.

If G2 is a TF, then in the g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

In the double mutant g1g3, even though G2 is functional, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. So, their individual contributions add up, leading to 10% resistance.

Wait, but I originally thought that in the double mutant, the combined effect is worse than either single. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing some resistance, and together they contribute more. So, when both are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is their combined effect.

In this case, the presence of G2 is necessary for the expression of G1 and G3. So, G2 is upstream.

So, the hierarchy is G2 → G1 and G3 → resistance.

So, the interaction is that G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, possibly in parallel pathways.

So, looking at the options, which one fits this scenario?

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, gene redundancy would mean that knocking both out is worse than either. Which is the case here. But redundancy would imply that each gene can compensate for the other, so without both, the effect is additive.

In the double mutant, resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So that's consistent with redundancy.

So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then without both, the resistance is lower than without either. So, this fits.

Now, about epistasis: option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the g1g3 mutant, the resistance is worse than either, which suggests that the effects are additive, not epistatic. So, perhaps the epistasis part is not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 have a redundant function. So option D would fit that part.

But the last part of option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. I'm not sure if that holds true.

Wait, perhaps the gene redundancy and epistasis are related. For example, if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway (redundant), then knocking both out would have a worse effect than either. So perhaps they are not epistatic but additive.

But the options require us to choose the best conclusion based on the data.

Looking again, the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So G2 is the likely TF.

In the data, any mutant that includes G2 (g2, g1g2, g2g3) has 0% resistance. So, G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3. So any mutation in G2 masks the effects of mutations in G1 and G3.

So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, which option says G2 is a TF and is epistatic to others.

Looking:

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1. But what about G3? The data shows that in the g2g3 double mutant, the resistance is 0%, same as G2. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

Option B: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 same promoter. G3 epistatic to G1.

Hmm, not sure.

Option C: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 pleiotropic. G1 epistatic to G3.

No, because the double mutant is worse.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3.

No, because the double mutant isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but I have to choose the best one.

The options are:

A) G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1.

B) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

C) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3.

D) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

The conclusion from the data is that G2 is a transcription factor and is epistatic to G1 and G3. Additionally, G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other because their double mutant is worse than either single. So, their functions are additive or redundant.

Looking at the options, which one includes G2 as a TF and G2 being epistatic to others.

Only option A and option B have G2 as TF and G2 epistatic towards others.

Wait, option B says G3 is epistatic towards G1. But in the data, when both are knocked out (g1g3), resistance is 10% which is worse than either. So that doesn't fit with epistasis.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Additionally, G1 and G3 are redundant or additive in their functions.

Looking at the options:

Only option A and option B have G2 as a TF. Option A says G2 is epistatic to G1 but doesn't mention G3. Option B says G3 is epistatic to G1, which doesn't fit the data.

Wait, perhaps the correct option isn't present, but I have to choose the best fit.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

But the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either, which suggests they are not epistatic but additive.

So, perhaps the best fit is option D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another angle: the single mutants are 75%, 0%, and 50%. The double mutants with G2 are 0%, and without G2, the double mutant is 10%.

So, the hierarchy of importance is G2 > G1 > G3.

So, the most critical is G2, then G1, then G3.

In the absence of G2 (g2 and any double with g2), resistance is 0%.

In the absence of G1 or G3, you have partial resistance.

In the absence of both G1 and G3, resistance is 10%, which suggests that G2 is working but not enough, but wait, in the absence of G2, you have 0%. So in the absence of both G1 and G3, but G2 is present, you have 10% resistance.

Wait, but without G2, you can't have any expression of G1 or G3. So in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is present, so G1 and G3 can be expressed if they have their own promoters. But in the data, the g1g3 mutant has 10% resistance. So perhaps G1 and G3 are not regulated by G2, which contradicts the initial assumption that at least one (G2) is a transcription factor acting upstream of others.

Wait, so if G2 is a transcription factor, and you knock out G2, then G1 and G3 can't be expressed. But in the single mutants, G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present. So if G1 and G3 are downstream of G2, then in the single mutants, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 would be expressed. But their single mutants have lower resistance than the wild type, which suggests that they contribute to resistance but aren't the only factors.

Wait, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates a resistance pathway that includes G1 and G3. So, without G2, the pathway is not activated. But without G1 or G3, the pathway is partially active.

So in the g1 mutant, G2 is present and active, so G3 is expressed, providing 50% resistance. But wait, the data shows g1 is 75% resistance. So if G3's contribution is 50%, then why is g1 75%?

Ah, perhaps G1 and G3 are both part of the same pathway, and each contributes some level of resistance. When G1 is knocked out, the pathway is only partially functional, leading to 75% resistance. When G3 is knocked out, the pathway is 50% functional. When both are knocked out, the pathway is only 10% functional.

So, G2 is the transcription factor that activates this pathway. So, in the absence of G2, the pathway isn't activated at all, leading to 0% resistance. Without G1 or G3, the pathway is partially active.

So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 because without G2, the downstream genes can't contribute.

So, looking at the options, which one fits this scenario.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3.

Hmm, but redundancy would imply that knocking both out doesn't change the phenotype beyond knocking one out. But in the data, knocking both gives a worse phenotype, so that's not redundancy.

So perhaps the correct answer is that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 contribute additively, and G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking at the options, none have G2 being epistatic to both, except perhaps option A if considering that G2 is epistatic to G1 and perhaps G3.

Wait, looking at option A: G1 is a transcription factor. But the data shows that G2's knockout is worse, so G2 is more likely the TF.

So, perhaps the correct option is option A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the best fit is option D.

Wait, another approach: when you have a double mutant, the resistance is worse than either single, it suggests that the two genes function in the same pathway and their functions are additive. So, perhaps their functions are additive or synergistic.

So, in this case, G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their combined loss leads to a worse phenotype than either alone.

Thus, G2 is a transcription factor, and it's epistatic to both G1 and G3.

So, looking for an option where G2 is the TF and is epistatic. The only options where G2 is TF are B, C, D.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, worse than either. So if G3 is epistatic to G1, then the resistance should be that of G3 (50%) but it's worse. So that doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 and G3 affect other traits, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3.

If they are redundant, then the double mutant should have the same resistance as the more severe single mutant, which would be 75% from G1. But the data is 10%, which is worse. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm, none of the options perfectly fit, but perhaps the closest is option A, but A says G1 is a TF.

Wait, the initial statement is that at least one is a TF, which is G2 in all the options except A.

So, the correct answer must be among B, C, or D.

Another approach: the only option where G2 is a TF and in the double mutants, the presence of G2 knockout makes the resistance 0% is option B? No, option B says G3 is epistatic to G1. But in the data, when G2 is present, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. So perhaps that's a clue.

Wait, perhaps in the double mutant g1g3, G2 is present. But since G2 is a TF, in this case, if G1 and G3 are co-regulated, perhaps the promoter is the same, and knocking both out would have an additive effect.

Option B states that G1 and G3 have the same promoter, meaning they're co-regulated. So, perhaps G2 activates their promoter. So in the absence of G2, neither is expressed. But in the single mutants, when G2 is present, the other gene is expressed.

Wait, the data shows that in g1, G1 is knocked out, but G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. But the resistance is 75%, higher than when G3 is knocked out (g3 is 50%). So this doesn't fit because if G3 is expressed in g1, the resistance should be similar to G3's contribution.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of how the options relate.

The correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and it is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Additionally, G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not epistatic to each other. Their combined knockout results in a worse phenotype than either alone, suggesting they are in parallel pathways or redundant.

Looking back at the options, none directly state this. But let's reevaluate option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So their combined knockout is worse. But the epistasis part says G1 is epistatic towards G3, which doesn't fit the data. So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Another angle: the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single. So G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other. So their effects are additive or redundant.

In genetics, when two genes are in the same pathway, their double mutant may have a more severe phenotype than either single. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, each contributing some function.

But if G2 is a TF, then G2's knockout would prevent the entire pathway from working, leading to 0% resistance in g2 mutants.

So, the hierarchy is G2 → G1 and G3 → resistance.

Therefore, G2 is the upstream gene and is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So, among the options, which ones have G2 as TF and G2 being epistatic to others.

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1, but what about G3? The data shows that in g2g3 double mutant, resistance is 0%, same as G2. So, G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

Thus, option A's third point doesn't cover G3.

Option B: G3 is epistatic to G1. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, worse than either. So, that's not epistatic.

Option C: G1 is epistatic to G3. Again, the data doesn't fit.

Option D: G1 is epistatic to G3. Doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are pleiotropic, G1 is epistatic to G3.

But I don't see the link between pleiotropy and the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Because gene redundancy would explain that the double mutant is worse.

But the epistasis part in D is not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I've made a mistake earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way to proceed is to think about what each option implies.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 are pleiotropic, G2 is epistatic to G1.

But if G1 is TF, why is g2 more severe? Because G2 is epistatic to G1.

But I think the correct answer is option A isn't correct because G2's effect is more severe.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck and need to make a decision.

Given the data, G2's knockout is the most severe, so G2 is the TF. Any double mutant involving G2 has 0% resistance, showing G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. G1 and G3's double mutant has worse resistance than either, implying they're additive.

Looking at the options, the correct one would be that G2 is a TF, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 are additive.

But none of the options explicitly state this. The closest is option D.

Wait, wait. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the double mutant g1g3.

In the g1g3 mutant, G2 is present. So, if G2 is a TF, then G1 and G3 are downstream. But in the g1g3 mutant, G1 and G3 are knocked out. So, their contribution is gone. So, what's the 10% resistance from? Maybe another gene. So, perhaps G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway, and without both, the pathway is severely compromised, leading to 10% resistance. But since G2 is present, it's expressed.

Wait, but without G2, the pathway is completely off. So, in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is present but G1 and G3 are not. So, the remaining resistance is from other factors not involving G2, G1, or G3.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about each option:

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

But in the double mutant, the resistance is worse than either, so redundancy doesn't fit.

So, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but I have to choose the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another angle: the fact that g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is additive (75% +50% = 125%, but we have 10%, which doesn't add up). So perhaps they function in the same pathway, and their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.

So, perhaps they are in the same pathway, and G2 is upstream.

In that case, G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway.

So, looking at the options, which one says that.

Option C says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

But pleiotropy isn't about the same pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options are correct, but I have to choose the best fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

But the data doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

In this case, G3 is epistatic to G1, so in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be the same as G3's single mutant (50%), but the data says 10%, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the best approach is to conclude that G2 is the transcription factor and is epistatic to G1 and G3, which is covered in option A's G2 epistatic to G1, but not G3. But the data shows that G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A.

No, because option A says G1 is the TF. So I'm back to square one.

Wait, another thought: the double mutants involving G2 all have 0% resistance. So, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So, any mutation in G2 masks the effect of other mutations. So, the order is G2 → G1 and G3 → resistance.

So, in the absence of G2, G1 and G3 can't contribute. So, in the double mutant g1g3, G2 is present, so they can contribute, but only 10%. So perhaps G1 and G3 contribute additively even when G2 is present.

In that case, G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, contributing additively. So, the double mutant without G2 would have 0%, but with G2, the double mutant of G1 and G3 would have additive effect.

Looking for an option where G2 is a TF and G2 is epistatic to both.

Only option A and B have G2 as TF, but their epistasis parts don't fit.

After this long thought process, I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps considering that the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single, it suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, not redundant. So, their functions are additive, and their combined loss leads to a worse phenotype.

So, putting it all together, the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Additionally, G1 and G3 function in the same pathway, contributing additively to resistance.

But among the options, the only one that aligns is option A, but it says G1 is TF, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think that G2 is the TF, and the correct option is option A, but no.

Wait, the correct option must be option A.

No, I'm getting myself confused. I think the correct answer is option A: G1 is a transcription factor, but that can't be right because G2's knockout is worse.

I think I'm stuck and have to make a choice.


The experiment investigates the roles of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The results show varying resistance levels in single and double mutants, and the question asks about the interaction between these genes. Key observations include:

1. **Single mutants**:  
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (down from 100%).  
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (complete susceptibility).  
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (halved resistance).  

2. **Double mutants**:  
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).  
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).  
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).  

### Analysis of the Data:
- **G2 is critical**: The g2 mutant shows 0% resistance, and any double mutant involving g2 also has 0% resistance (e.g., g1g2, g2g3). This indicates that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning its absence masks the effects of the other genes. G2 is likely the transcription factor acting upstream of the resistance pathway.
- **G1 and G3 contribute additively**: The g1 mutant retains 75% resistance, and the g3 mutant retains 50%, suggesting both genes contribute to resistance. The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, indicating that their contributions are additive rather than epistatic.
- **No evidence for redundancy**: If G1 and G3 were redundant, the double mutant g1g3 would have the same resistance as the more severe single mutant (e.g., g2). However, the 10% resistance in g1g3 suggests they are not redundant but rather function in parallel or additive pathways.

### Evaluation of Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - States that G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1.  
   - This is inconsistent because G2 is the most critical gene (0% resistance in g2), making it more likely to be the transcription factor, not G1.

2. **Option B**:  
   - States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 share the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic to G1.  
   - While G2 is likely the transcription factor, the claim that G3 is epistatic to G1 is unsupported. The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, contradicting the idea of epistasis.

3. **Option C**:  
   - States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.  
   - Pleiotropy is not supported by the data, as the resistance levels do not indicate that G1 and G3 affect multiple traits. Additionally, the 10% resistance in g1g3 contradicts the idea that G1 is epistatic to G3.

4. **Option D**:  
   - States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.  
   - Redundancy is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant but rather additive in their contributions. Additionally, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is unsupported.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly support that G2 is the transcription factor and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance, but none of the options perfectly describe this interaction. Among the given options, **Option D** is the closest, as it correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor, even though the redundancy and epistasis claims are not fully supported by the data.

Answer: D
