Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So that means it's an aromatic ring with two substituents attached. The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group, which makes sense because esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), and I know that IR peaks around 1700 cm^-1 typically indicate an ester. 

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum data: there are six signals. Two of these are aromatic-H signals, two are vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two are –CH3 groups. There are no –CH2 signals. So, I need to deduce what the structure looks like based on this information.

Let me break down the NMR information. 

First, the aromatic region has two signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents could be in a para or ortho positions. Wait, but if it's para, the aromatic protons would be two sets each, perhaps. Or maybe not, depending on the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents cause symmetry leading to fewer signals. Hmm. But the question says two signals, so maybe the substituents are such that the ring isn't too symmetric. Or perhaps it's a mono-substituted ring? Wait, no, it's di-substituted. So the substituents are in positions that don't cause the ring to have more than two distinct proton environments. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, but that would give two sets each of two protons. Wait, wait, no. If it's para, each substituent is opposite, so the ring would have two sets of aromatic protons each with two equivalent protons. So that would be two signals each integrating for 2H each, maybe. But wait, the problem says two signals for aromatic-H. Hmm. So perhaps the substituents are in positions that cause the ring to have only two types of aromatic protons. Another possibility is that the substituents are such that the ring is not symmetric enough to cause more signals. Not sure yet, but let's move on.

Next, the vinyl-H signals are two. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those in a double bond. So, maybe we have two different types of vinyl groups. For example, one might be part of an ester group (like in an acetate ester where the vinyl is attached to the oxygen), and another might be part of a substituted benzene with a vinyl substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the compound has a conjugated diene system, but that's less likely given the ester group.

Wait, the presence of an ester suggests that perhaps one of the substituents is an ester group, like OCOOR. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester group attached via oxygen. So, let's think about that.

Also, the NMR shows two –CH3 groups. Each –CH3 would give a singlet if they're attached to something electronegative, but could be split otherwise. Since it's two signals, perhaps the two methyl groups are in different environments. For example, one could be attached to an oxygen (like in an ester), and another could be part of a vinyl group or another substituent.

Wait, but in an ester group, the structure would be R-O-CO-R'. So, if one substituent is an ester, maybe the other substituent is something else, like a methyl group or another functional group.

Let me try to visualize the structure. The benzene ring has two substituents. Let's say one is an ester group (O-CO-O-R, but wait, ester is actually RCOOR', so perhaps the substituent is an acyloxy group, like O-CO-R). Alternatively, it could be a benzoyloxy group, but that might complicate the structure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ester.

Wait, the vinyl protons could be part of an ester group. For example, in an ethyl ester, the vinyl (CH2CH3) group would have protons that are split in a certain way. Alternatively, if the ester is something like RCO-OCH2CH2- attached to the ring, but that might complicate the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester group and a methyl group. Let me think. Let's say one substituent is O-CO-O-R (no, that's not right. Ester is RCOOR'). So, if the substituent is O-CO-R, that would be an ester. For example, if R is a methyl group, then the substituent would be O-CO-CH3, which is an acetyl ester group. But wait, that's an acetyloxy group, right? So OAc.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester. Hmm, not sure.

Another approach: let's think about the number of protons each substituent brings. The NMR has two aromatic signals, which suggests perhaps the substituents are in para positions, but that might lead to more signals. Wait, maybe the substituents are meta, but that could cause more splits. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are para but with symmetry, leading to two equivalent H's each. So, two substituents in para positions, each substituent is something that makes the ring have two distinct H environments.

Wait, but benzene with two substituents in para positions: each substituent is attached to opposite positions. So, for example, two substituents in para would give two sets of H. For example, if substituents are in positions 1 and 3, but that's meta. Wait, no, para is 1 and 4. So, substituents at para would make the ring have two equivalent H sets. Let's say substituents are at positions 1 and 3, which is meta, but that complicates symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the ring's H's split into two groups, each with equal number of H's.

But perhaps I should consider the other parts of the NMR. The vinyl-H signals: two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That could indicate coupling with adjacent protons. For example, in a vinyl group, each proton is coupled to another. So, a doublet would be a simple coupling, like in CH2=CH-. But in that case, each proton is a doublet. Wait, but if one is a doublet and another is a doublet of quartets, perhaps they are in different environments. Maybe one is part of an ester group (like, say, the CH3 group attached to an oxygen in an ester, but that doesn’t have vinyl H. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the structure of an ester. The ester group is RCOOR'. So, the R group is attached to the carbonyl, and the R' is the alkyl group attached to oxygen. So, if the substituent is an ester group, perhaps the R' is a vinyl group. For example, RCOOCH2CH2-. No, that's an ethyl ester. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like RCO-OCH2CH2-. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the substituent could be a methoxycarbonyl group, like O-CO-OCH3. No, that's a carbonate.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the substituents is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group. For example, the compound could have a substituent that's an ester (like O-CO-CH2CH3) and another substituent that is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH2 attached). But wait, how would that fit into the aromatic ring?

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group attached to the ring. Let me think about that.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this differently.

The ester group contributes to the formula. So, the formula will include the ester: RCOOR'. Let's assume R is an aromatic ring (since it's the main structure), and R' is an alkyl group. So the substituent on the benzene would be O-CO-R'.

Wait, no. The benzene ring is the di-substituted part. So, the two substituents are attached to the benzene.

Let me think about the possible substituents. One of them is an ester group, which would be O-CO-R, another substituent could be something else, like a vinyl group or a methyl group.

Wait, the NMR also shows two –CH3 groups. So, perhaps one –CH3 is part of the ester (like R' is CH3 in an ethyl ester, making the substituent O-CO-OCH2CH3? Wait, no, that's an ethyl ester substituent, so the substituent would be O-CO-CH2CH3 attached to the ring. Then, the other substituent could be a methyl group attached directly to the ring, perhaps as a substituent. But wait, the substituent on the ring would be O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, I think I'm getting this wrong. Ester substituent would be O-CO-R, where R is attached to the oxygen. So, for example, if R is a methyl group, the substituent would be O-CO-CH2CH3? Wait, no, R is the alkoxy part. So, the ester substituent would be O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. So, for example, if R is ethyl, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, wait. Ester is RCOOR', so the substituent attached to the benzene would be the R' group, which is connected via the oxygen. So, if the substituent is an ester, perhaps it's OCOOR', where R' is an alkyl chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methoxy carbonyl group, like O-CO-OCH3. No, that's a methoxycarbonyl group. But then, that would be an ester where R is a methyl group. So the substituent on the benzene would be O-CO-OCH3. But wait, that would have the structure O-CO-OCH3, which is an ester group attached to the ring as O-CO-OCH3. Wait, but that's more like a carbonate, perhaps. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. Let me think: the substituent could be an ester group where the R' is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, which would have a vinyl group attached to the ester oxygen. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-R), and the other substituent is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH- attached to the ring as a substituent). But how would that look?

Wait, perhaps considering the NMR signals. The vinyl-H's are two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Let me think about what that implies.

A vinyl proton typically has coupling with adjacent protons. So, for a CH2=CH group, each proton is split into a doublet. But in the case where one proton is adjacent to another, perhaps in a more complex structure, the splitting could be more.

Wait, perhaps one of the vinyl groups is part of an ester. For example, if the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached, like O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that's not right.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring, and the other substituent is an ester group. So, the benzene ring has two substituents: one is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-) and the other is an ester group (like O-CO-R). Let's say the ester substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester). Then, the vinyl group would have two protons, perhaps as a doublet if it's adjacent to another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and the ester is part of a side chain.

Wait, the NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So, two methyl groups in different environments. If one methyl is part of an ester (like RCOOCH2CH3), then that would have a –CH3 group. The other –CH3 could be part of a substituent on the ring, like a methyl group attached to the ring. But wait, a methyl group attached directly to the ring would usually be a singlet in the NMR because the three equivalent protons are all the same, but if they are adjacent to an electronegative atom, perhaps the splitting is different.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for –CH3. So, perhaps one is a singlet and another is a quartet or something else. Alternatively, both are split into multiplets due to coupling with adjacent protons.

But I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about the degrees of unsaturation and the molecular formula.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2
B) C12H14O2
C) C12H12O2
D) C11H12O2

Each option has a different number of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygen.

The given compound is a di-substituted benzene (so six carbons in the ring). Let's calculate the number of carbons in the substituents.

Ester group: The general formula for an ester is RCOOR', so it contributes (n + m + 2) carbons, where R is n carbons and R' is m carbons. But in our case, the substituent is attached to the benzene. Let's say one substituent is an ester group, which would have RCOO- attached to the ring. Let me think: If the substituent is O-CO-R', then R' is an alkyl group. Let's say R' is ethyl, so substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (but wait, that's not correct. Ester is RCOOR', so substituent is O-CO-R' where R' is attached to the ring. So, if R' is ethyl, the substituent would be O-CO-CH2CH3.)

Wait, no. The substituent attached to the benzene would be OCOOR', where R' is an alkyl group. So for example, if R' is methyl, the substituent is OCOOCH3, but that's more like a carbonate. Wait, no, the ester is RCOOR', so substituent would be OCOOR', but that's not correct because R is part of the benzene. Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzoyloxy group, like O-CO-C6H5, but that would be a ketone ester, which might complicate things. Alternatively, the substituent could be an acetyl group attached via oxygen, like O-CO-CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methoxy group attached to a carbonyl, but that's more like a ketone.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should approach this by considering the molecular formula.

The compound is di-substituted benzene (C6H4) plus two substituents. Let's say substituent 1 is group A and substituent 2 is group B.

Each substituent contributes certain carbons and hydrogens. The ester group would contribute at least two carbons (the carbonyl and the oxygen-connected group). Let's assume substituent A is an ester group, which could be something like O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. So substituent A would contribute (n+2) carbons and (2n+1) hydrogens, perhaps? Or maybe not exactly, but let me think. Alternatively, substituent A is O-CO-O-R, but that's not an ester.

Wait, no. Ester is RCOOR', so substituent A could be O-CO-R', where R' is an alkyl group. For example, if R' is ethyl (CH2CH3), substituent A is O-CO-CH2CH3. That would add two carbons and four hydrogens (since ethyl is CH2CH3: 2 carbons, 7 hydrogens? Wait, no. The substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3, which is three oxygen? No, the ester group is O-CO-O-R'. Wait, no, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, the ester group is RCOOR'. So substituent A is RCOO- attached to the benzene. So R could be a phenyl group, but that would make a more complex structure. Alternatively, R could be an alkyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is a phenyl ester, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, substituent A is an acetyl group (O-CO-CH3). So substituent A is O-CO-CH3, which is an acetyloxy group.

Then substituent B is another group. The NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So substituent A, being O-CO-CH3, would contribute one –CH3 group. Then, substituent B must have another –CH3 group.

So substituent B could be a methyl group attached directly to the ring. So substituent B is CH3.

Wait, let's count the carbons. Benzene (6 carbons) + substituent A (O-CO-CH3: 2 carbons) + substituent B (CH3: 1 carbon) → total 6 + 2 +1 = 9 carbons. But the options have 11 or 12 carbons. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps substituent A is a longer chain. Let's say substituent A is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl ester). Then substituent A would contribute 3 carbons (the ester group is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 → that's 3 carbons from the ester). Substituent B is a CH3 group. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) +3 (ester) +1 (methyl) =10. Still not matching the options. The options start at 11.

Alternatively, substituent A is O-CO-(something with more carbons). Let's think: perhaps substituent A is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R? No, that's a carbonate.

Wait, maybe substituent A is a propionyl group (RCOO- where R is CH2CH2). So substituent A would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (3 carbons). Substituent B is a CH2CH2CH3 group? No, but that would add more carbons.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is a benzoyl group, but that's more than just an ester.

Alternatively, substituent A could be a methyl ester (O-CO-CH3), substituent B a vinyl group attached to the ring (CH2=CH2). Wait, but that would require the vinyl group to be attached, which would bring two more carbons. So, substituent B is CH2=CH-. But that's a substituent with two carbons. So the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (ester) + 2 (vinyl) =10. Still not reaching 11 or 12.

Hmm, this approach isn't working. Maybe I should think about the degree of unsaturation.

The molecular formula options are:

A) C11H14O2 → Degrees of unsaturation: (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5. → 5 degrees: which could be a benzene ring (3), the ester carbonyl (1), and another double bond (1). Or another ring or something.

B) C12H14O2 → Degrees: (2*12 +2 -14)/2= (26-14)/2=6. → three rings, or three double bonds plus rings.

C) C12H12O2 → (2*12 +2 -12)/2= (26-12)/2=7 → more rings or double bonds.

D) C11H12O2 → (2*11 +2 -12)/2= (24-12)/2=6 → 6 degrees: benzene (3), ester carbonyl (1), and two more double bonds or rings.

But the given compound is a di-substituted benzene, so that's three degrees of unsaturation (the ring). The ester contributes another (the carbonyl). So that's four. If the other substituent has a vinyl group (double bond), that adds another degree, making it five. So the total would be five. Looking at the options, option A has 5 degrees. Option C has 7, which would require more rings or double bonds.

Wait, but the NMR says two vinyl-H signals. So perhaps two double bonds? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group and another is a vinyl group with a substituent that brings more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, which would bring additional double bonds. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the number of NMR signals.

The aromatic signals: 2 signals. So, the substituents on the ring must cause the ring to have only two distinct proton environments. That suggests that the substituents are in positions that make the ring's protons equivalent in two sets. For example, if substituents are in para positions, perhaps with identical groups, leading to two sets of equivalent H's, each integrating for 2H (since benzene has six H; 2 signals would each account for 2H each, but wait, that's 4H. Wait, but benzene has six H. So perhaps each substituent is in a position where each substituent causes two H's to be equivalent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are such that the ring has symmetry leading to two signals. For example, if the substituents are identical and para, then the ring would have two sets of H's: two H's adjacent to each substituent and two H's opposite. Wait, no, para substituents would cause each substituent's adjacent H's to be equivalent. So, benzene with two para substituents would have two sets of H's: two H's adjacent to each substituent (which are equivalent), and two H's opposite, which are also equivalent. So that's two signals, each integrating for 2H. But wait, that's four H's. There are six H's in total, so that leaves two more. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ring's H's are split into two groups of 2 and 4 H's. But that would require three substituents, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a strong deshielding group that causes two H's to be downfield, and the other substituent causes the remaining four H's to be split into another signal. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is in a position that makes the adjacent H's appear as one signal, and the other substituent is in a position that makes two H's appear as another signal. But I'm not entirely clear on this.

Another thought: the vinyl protons. Let's say one vinyl group is part of an ester substituent, and the other is part of a separate substituent. For example, substituent A is an ester with a vinyl group, and substituent B is another vinyl group.

But the NMR shows two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. So perhaps one vinyl group is adjacent to another group, causing more splitting.

Wait, a doublet of quartets suggests that each proton is coupling with two sets of neighboring protons. For example, in a propenyl group, the middle proton is split into a quartet, and the end protons are doublets. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps one vinyl group is part of a substituent that's adjacent to an oxygen, causing the vinyl protons to split into a doublet, and another vinyl group is part of a larger substituent, leading to a quartet splitting.

But without knowing the substituent structure, it's hard to say.

Let me try to think of possible structures that fit the NMR data.

The presence of an ester group suggests that the formula includes COO. The two methyl groups in the NMR might come from the ester (like the R' in RCOOR') and another methyl group elsewhere.

For example, let's say the substituents on the benzene are:

1. O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (but that's a carbonate, not an ester. Alternatively, O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (an ester substituent)).

Wait, no. The ester substituent would be RCOOR'. So if the ring has substituent RCOOR', where R is a phenyl group, but that's more complex. Alternatively, R could be a methyl group, so the substituent is CH3COOR'. Hmm, but that's getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCOOR', but that's getting complicated. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula.

The options are C11H14O2 (option A), C12H14O2 (B), C12H12O2 (C), C11H12O2 (D).

The di-substituted benzene has 6 carbons. Let's calculate how many carbons the substituents contribute.

For option A: C11H14O2.

6 (benzene) + substituent carbons =11 → substituent carbons =5.

So substituent 1 and 2 would need to contribute 5 carbons in total.

Assuming substituent 1 is an ester group (RCOOR'), which would have (n + m + 2) carbons. Wait, no, RCOOR' is (n + m + 2?), no, R is m carbons, R' is n carbons. So RCOOR' is (m + n +2) carbons? Wait, no: RCOOR' is (m + 1 + n) carbons because R is m, COO is 2, R' is n.

Wait, substituent 1 is RCOO-. So if R is a methyl group (1 carbon), then substituent 1 would contribute 2 (COO) + 1 (R) =3 carbons. But substituent 1 is O-CO-R, which is RCOO- attached to the ring. So substituent 1 is RCOO- (which is (n+2) carbons, where n is the number of carbons in R). Wait, RCOO- is (n + 2) carbons because R is n, COO adds 2.

Wait, no, RCOO- is R (n) + COO (2) → total n+2.

So substituent 1 (ester) could have n+2 carbons, and substituent 2 (another group) could have m carbons.

So substituent 1 + substituent 2 = (n+2) + m =5 → n + m =3.

Possible combinations: n=1, m=2.

So substituent 1 is RCOO- where R is methyl (n=1), so substituent 1 contributes 3 carbons. Substituent 2 is a group with 2 carbons, like ethyl or a vinyl group.

But substituent 2 can't be ethyl because the NMR doesn't show CH2 groups. Wait, the problem states there are no –CH2 signals. So substituent 2 can't have a CH2 group. So substituent 2 must have either 0 or 2 CH2 groups? Wait, no, the absence of CH2 signals suggests that the molecule doesn't have any CH2 groups.

Wait, but substituent 2 could be a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), which has CH2 in the double bond. But the NMR doesn't show CH2 signals. Hmm, maybe that's a problem.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a methyl group (-CH3). So substituent 2 is -CH3 (1 carbon). Then substituent 1 is RCOO- with n=2, so substituent 1 contributes 4 carbons (n=2 → 2+2=4). So substituent 1 is, say, ethyl ester (RCOO- where R is ethyl). So substituent 1 is CH2CH2COO-? Wait, no, R is ethyl, so substituent 1 is CH2CH2COO- attached to the ring?

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is CH2CH2COO- attached via the oxygen. No, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, RCOO- where R is ethyl (CH2CH3) → substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2- attached to the ring. So substituent 1 contributes 3 carbons (COO plus ethyl: COO is 2, ethyl is 2 → wait, no. R is ethyl (2 carbons), so substituent 1 (RCOO-) would be 2 (ethyl) + 2 (COO) → 4 carbons.

Substituent 2 is methyl (-CH3 → 1 carbon). So substituent 1 (4 carbons) + substituent 2 (1 carbon) =5, which fits for option A (6 +5=11).

So the formula would be C6H4(COOCH2CH3)(CH3). Let's calculate the formula:

Each substituent contributes:

COOCH2CH3: 3 carbons (COO) plus 2 (CH2CH3) → wait, no. COO is part of the ester. So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3, which is 3 carbons in the substituent (O-CO- is part of the substituent, but the benzene is connected to the O). Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2- but that's getting confusing.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-R where R is ethyl. So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 → that's 3 carbons (COO plus ethyl). Wait, no: O-CO-CH2CH3 is 3 carbons in the substituent (COO is two from the carbonyl and oxygen, and CH2CH3 is two more? No, wait, O-CO-CH2CH3 is 3 carbons (COO is two, CH2CH3 is two, but the O is part of the substituent). Wait, perhaps I should count all the atoms.

Wait, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 → that's 3 carbons (the COO is part of the substituent). So substituent 1 contributes 3 carbons, substituent 2 is CH3, contributing 1 carbon. So substituent carbons: 3 +1=4. But earlier, for option A, substituent carbons should be 5.

Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which would be 4 carbons (COO is two, ethyl is two). Substituent 2 is methyl, 1 carbon. So substituent carbons:4+1=5, which matches for option A (6+5=11).

So the formula would be C6H4(O-CO-CH2CH2CH3)(CH3). Let's count the hydrogens.

The benzene ring has 4 H's (since it's di-substituted and each substituent takes one H each, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the ring might have two substituents, each taking a position, leaving four H's in two pairs. The substituents would contribute their own H's.

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 → the ethyl group has 5 H's (CH2CH2CH3 → CH2 has 2 H, CH2 has 2 H, CH3 has 3 H → total 7 H. Wait, no, wait. The substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, which is an ester. The R' in RCOOR' is CH2CH2CH3 (if R is H, which can't be. Wait, no. The substituent is O-CO-R, where R is ethyl (CH2CH3). So substituent 1 has O-CO-CH2CH3. The ethyl group contributes 5 H's (CH2 has 2, CH3 has 3 → total 5). The COO doesn't contribute any H's.

Substituent 2: CH3 → 3 H.

So total H's from substituents: 5 +3=8.

Benzene has 4 H's (di-substituted: two substituents cause four H's, perhaps two pairs of equivalent H's). So total H's:4 (ring) +8 (substituents) =12. But the formula for option A is C11H14O2. So total H should be 14. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some H's. Let me recount.

The benzene ring: di-substituted. The substituents are in such a way that there are four H's, perhaps in two pairs (each pair has two H's). So that's 4 H's.

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH3 → the ethyl group has 2 H's in the CH2 and 3 H's in CH3. Wait, but the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3 → the structure is O-CO-CH2CH3 attached to the ring. So the ethyl group is CH2CH3. So the CH2 group has two H's, and the CH3 has three H's. So substituent 1 contributes 5 H's.

Substituent 2: CH3 → three H's.

So substituents contribute 5 +3 =8 H's.

Plus the ring's four H's, total 12 H's. But option A is C11H14O2, which would have 14 H's. So where are the other two H's?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the substituent calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3. That's a total of 3 carbons (O-CO-CH2CH3), but how many H's? The ethyl group contributes 5 H's (CH2 has 2, CH3 has 3 → yes, that's correct). So substituent 1:5 H's.

Substituent 2:CH3 →3 H's.

Ring:4 H's.

So total H's:5 +3 +4=12. But option A is C11H14O2 → 14 H's. We have 12, so this doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe substituent 1 is a longer chain. Let's try substituent 1 as O-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3 (n-butyl ester). Then substituent 1 has 5 carbons (COO is 2, butyl is 4 → wait, COO is 2, butyl is 4, so substituent 1 has 2+4=6 carbons. Substituent 2 is CH3 (1 carbon). So substituent carbons:6 +1=7 → benzene (6) +7=13 → but option A has 11. So that's not matching.

Wait, maybe substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2 (ethyl), but that leaves CH2 attached to the ring. But that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2OCH3. No, that's more complex.

Wait, maybe substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2O- something else, but that complicates the structure.

Another approach: perhaps the substituent is a methoxy group attached to a carbonyl, but that's an ether, not an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzoyl group, but that would bring more carbons.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. For example, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-O-R. No, that's not right.

Wait, maybe substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is a propenoate ester, which would have a double bond. But that would require more H's.

Hmm, maybe I should look at the options again.

Option D: C11H12O2 → Degrees of unsaturation: (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So 6 degrees: benzene (3), ester carbonyl (1), and two more (maybe a double bond and another ring or another carbonyl).

But the NMR doesn't show any signals indicating rings beyond the benzene. So perhaps that's not possible.

Option B: C12H14O2 → degrees: (2*12 +2 -14)/2 = (26-14)/2=6 → 6 degrees: benzene (3), ester (1), and two more.

Option C: C12H12O2 → degrees: (2*12 +2 -12)/2= (26-12)/2=7 → 7 degrees: benzene (3), ester (1), and three more.

The NMR shows two –CH3 groups and no –CH2 groups. So the substituents must not have any CH2 groups. Therefore, substituents should have only CH3 and possibly CH groups.

If substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 (acetyl group), which contributes 2 carbons (COO and CH3). Substituent 2 is a vinyl group, which would have CH2=CH-. But that would introduce a CH2, which the NMR doesn't show. So that's a problem.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any –CH2 groups, which suggests that the substituents don't have any CH2 groups. So substituent 2 can't be ethyl because that would have CH2.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is another –CH3 group attached to the ring. So substituent 2 is CH3. Then substituent 1 is O-CO-R, where R is a group without any CH2.

If R is –CH2CH3, that would have CH2, which is not allowed. So R must be a methyl group. So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3. Then substituent 1 contributes 2 carbons (COO and CH3), substituent 2 is CH3 → 1 carbon.

So substituent carbons:2+1=3. Benzene (6) → total 9. But the options have higher carbons. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl ester). That's 3 carbons (COO is 2, ethyl is 2 → but that's 4 carbons in substituent 1). Substituent 2 is CH3 →1 carbon. So substituent carbons:4+1=5. Benzene (6) → total 11 → matches option A (C11H14O2).

Now, let's calculate the H's.

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH3 → ethyl group contributes 5 H's (CH2 has 2, CH3 has 3).

Substituent 2: CH3 → 3 H.

Ring: di-substituted, so let's say two substituents are in para positions. The ring would have four H's, split into two signals (each integrating for 2 H's).

So H's from ring:4.

H's from substituents:5+3=8.

Total H's:4+8=12.

But option A is C11H14O2 → which requires 14 H's. So I'm missing 2 H's.

Wait, perhaps the substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (n-propyl ester), which would have 5 H's (CH2CH2CH3 → each CH2 has 2 H's, and CH3 has 3 → total 2+2+3=7 H's).

Substituent 2: CH3 →3 H's.

So substituent H's:7+3=10.

Ring H's:4.

Total H's:4+10=14 → which matches option A (C11H14O2).

So the formula would be C11H14O2, which is option A.

But wait, earlier substitution with substituent 1 as O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 would add substituent carbons: COO (2) + CH2CH2CH3 (3) → 5 substituent carbons.

Benzene (6) → total 11 carbons:6+5=11 → which matches option A (C11H14O2).

So that seems to fit.

Now, let's think about the NMR.

Aromatic-H: two signals. So the substituents are para, causing two sets of H's, each integrating for 2H. So that's four H's in total.

Vinyl-H: the substituent 1 (O-CO-CH2CH2CH3) has a vinyl group? Wait, no. O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 is an ethyl ester, which doesn't have a vinyl group. So where does the vinyl-H come from?

Ah, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group. Wait, substituent 2 is CH3, so that can't be. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming substituent 2 is CH3. Maybe substituent 2 is a vinyl group. But that would bring CH2, which isn't allowed as per the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is a vinyl ester.

Wait, substituent 1 could be O-CO-CH2CH2OCH3. No, that's not right.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that's getting too complex.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, which has a double bond. For example, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH2- something. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH=CH2 (vinyl group attached to the ester). So substituent 1 would be a vinyl ester. Then substituent 1 would have a vinyl group, contributing H's that are split into a doublet and a doublet of quartets.

Wait, the vinyl group in substituent 1 (CH2=CHCOO-) would have protons that resonate as a doublet of quartets and a doublet. So the NMR would show two vinyl signals, which matches the data.

So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH=CH2. That's a vinyl ester. So substituent 1 is a vinyl group attached to the ester.

Substituent 2 would then be another group without any CH2. Let's say substituent 2 is CH3.

So substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH=CH2 → which is 4 carbons (COO is 2, CH2CH=CH2 is 3 → 2 +3=5 carbons in substituent 1).

Substituent 2: CH3 →1 carbon.

Total substituents:5+1=6. Benzene (6) → total 6+6=12 carbons → which matches option B (C12H14O2).

Now, calculating H's:

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH=CH2. The vinyl group has two H's (CH2=CH-). The CH2 in the vinyl group has two H's, each as a doublet. The CH in the vinyl would have H's that are a doublet of quartets.

Wait, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

So the structure would be O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Let me draw it:

O
||
O-C-O-R (where R is CH2-CH=CH2)

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps it's O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

So the structure would be O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

So the substituent 1 would have a vinyl group (CH2-CH=CH2) attached via an ester.

The vinyl group has two types of H's: the CH2 (if any) and the CH=CH2.

Wait, in this substituent, the structure is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

The H's on the CH2 adjacent to the ester would be split due to coupling with the vinyl protons.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH=CH2, which would have a CH2 group adjacent to the ester, which would have CH2 protons. But the NMR says there are no –CH2 signals. So that's a problem because the CH2 here would show up as a –CH2 signal.

Hmm, but the problem states there are no –CH2 signals. So substituent 1 can't have a CH2 group. Therefore, substituent 1 must not have any CH2 groups.

So substituent 1 must not have any methylene groups. That suggests that substituent 1 is a methyl ester (O-CO-CH3), because that doesn't have any CH2 groups.

But earlier, that only gives substituent carbons of 2 (COO and CH3), which would require substituent 2 to contribute 3 carbons (for option A: 11 carbons total, 6 from benzene, 5 from substituents). But substituent 2 can't have any CH2 groups, so substituent 2 must be a methyl group (CH3), which is 1 carbon. So substituent 1 would need to contribute 4 carbons, which isn't possible with a methyl ester.

Wait, maybe substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl ester) which has a CH2 group, but the NMR says no –CH2 signals. So that can't be.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH(CH3)2 (isopropyl ester), which doesn't have any CH2 groups. Substituent 1 would contribute 4 carbons (COO is 2, isopropyl is 2). Substituent 2 would be CH3 →1 carbon. Total substituent carbons:4+1=5 → benzene (6) → total 11 → option A.

Now, H's:

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH(CH3)2 → the isopropyl group has 6 H's (the two CH3 groups have 3 each, and the central CH has no H's, but wait, the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)2 → structure is O-CO-C(CH3)2. So the substituent has two CH3 groups. Each CH3 contributes 3 H's. So substituent 1 contributes 6 H's.

Substituent 2: CH3 →3 H's.

Ring:4 H's.

Total H's:6+3+4=13. But option A has 14 H's. So still missing one H.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH(CH2CH3)2 → but that would have CH2 groups, which aren't allowed.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look at the correct answer and see which option fits.

The correct answer is likely option D: C11H12O2.

Wait, but earlier calculations didn't match. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that would have CH2 groups, which are not allowed according to the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane or another group without CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached via oxygen, like OCH3.

Wait, substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 (acetyl group) → substituent 1 contributes 2 carbons (COO and CH3). Substituent 2: OCH3 (methoxy group) → contributes 1 carbon.

Total substituent carbons:3 → benzene (6) → total 9 → doesn't match any option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let's think about the NMR again.

The aromatic-H: two signals. So the substituents are such that the ring's H's are split into two sets.

The vinyl-H: two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. So perhaps the substituent has a vinyl group adjacent to another proton, causing the splitting.

The two –CH3 groups: one from the ester (O-CO-CH3) and another from a substituent (CH3). But then, substituent 2 is CH3, and substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3. So substituents contribute 2 +1=3 carbons → benzene (6) → total 9 → doesn't match options.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-R where R is a group without CH2 and has a –CH3.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester), but that brings CH2, which isn't allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH(CH3)2 → isopropyl ester, which has no CH2. So substituent 1 contributes 4 carbons (COO is 2, isopropyl is 2). Substituent 2: CH3 →1 carbon. So substituent carbons:5 → benzene (6) → total 11 → option A.

H's: substituent 1 (O-CO-CH(CH3)2) has two CH3 groups → 3 *2 =6 H's. Substituent 2: CH3 →3 H's. Ring:4 H's. Total H:6+3+4=13 → option A has 14 H's → still missing 1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recount.

O-CO-CH(CH3)2 → the structure is O-CO-C(CH3)2.

So, the substituent has:

- O-CO-C(CH3)2 → the carbonyl is O=C-O- attached to C(CH3)2.

The C(CH3)2 group has two CH3 groups. Each CH3 has 3 H's → total 6 H's.

Substituent 2 is CH3 →3 H's.

Ring:4 H's.

Total H's:6+3+4=13. Option A has 14 H's. So missing one.

Wait, perhaps the ester group has more H's. Let's see:

O-CO-C(CH3)2 → the carbonyl doesn't contribute any H's. The substituent is O-CO-C(CH3)2, which has two CH3 groups →6 H's.

But perhaps the benzene ring has more H's. If substituents are such that the ring has two substituents in positions that give two signals with 2 H each, that's four H's.

So 6 +5 substituent carbons (from substituent 1:4, substituent 2:1) → total 11 carbons.

H's: substituent 1:6, substituent 2:3, ring:4 → total 13. But option A has 14 H's.

I'm still missing one H. Maybe I'm miscalculating the substituent 1's H's.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 (acetyl group) → substituent 1 contributes 2 carbons (COO and CH3). Substituent 2 is CH2CH2CH3 → but that has CH2, which isn't allowed.

I'm stuck. Maybe I'll go with the initial assumption that option A is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR data. The compound contains an ester group (indicated by the IR spectrum), and the NMR data provides the following insights:

1. **Aromatic-H signals**: Two signals, suggesting the benzene ring has two distinct proton environments, likely due to the substituents being in positions that create symmetry.
2. **Vinyl-H signals**: Two signals, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets, indicating the presence of a vinyl group with specific coupling patterns.
3. **–CH3 signals**: Two signals, suggesting two methyl groups in different environments.
4. **No –CH2 signals**: Indicating the absence of methylene groups in the structure.

### Key Analysis:
- The compound is a di-substituted benzene, contributing 6 carbons. The substituents must account for the remaining carbons in the molecular formula.
- The ester group contributes to the molecular formula as RCOOR'. The substituents must include an ester group and another group that does not contain –CH2.
- The NMR data suggests the presence of a vinyl group (from the vinyl-H signals) and two methyl groups (from the –CH3 signals). These must be incorporated into the substituents.

### Testing the Options:
#### **Option A: C11H14O2**
- Degrees of unsaturation: \( \frac{(2 \times 11 + 2 - 14)}{2} = 5 \), consistent with a benzene ring (3), an ester carbonyl (1), and one additional double bond (1).
- Substituents: 
  - One substituent is an ester group (e.g., O-CO-CH2CH3), contributing 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens.
  - The other substituent is a methyl group (CH3), contributing 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens.
- Total carbons: \( 6 \, (\text{benzene}) + 3 \, (\text{ester}) + 1 \, (\text{methyl}) = 10 \), which does not match the 11 carbons required for this option.
- This option is inconsistent with the data.

#### **Option B: C12H14O2**
- Degrees of unsaturation: \( \frac{(2 \times 12 + 2 - 14)}{2} = 6 \), consistent with a benzene ring (3), an ester carbonyl (1), and two additional double bonds or rings (2).
- Substituents:
  - One substituent is a longer ester group (e.g., O-CO-CH2CH2CH3), contributing 4 carbons and 7 hydrogens.
  - The other substituent is a methyl group (CH3), contributing 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens.
- Total carbons: \( 6 \, (\text{benzene}) + 4 \, (\text{ester}) + 1 \, (\text{methyl}) = 11 \), which does not match the 12 carbons required for this option.
- This option is inconsistent with the data.

#### **Option C: C12H12O2**
- Degrees of unsaturation: \( \frac{(2 \times 12 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 7 \), consistent with a benzene ring (3), an ester carbonyl (1), and three additional double bonds or rings (3).
- Substituents:
  - One substituent is an ester group (e.g., O-CO-CH3), contributing 2 carbons and 3 hydrogens.
  - The other substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), contributing 2 carbons and 4 hydrogens.
- Total carbons: \( 6 \, (\text{benzene}) + 2 \, (\text{ester}) + 2 \, (\text{vinyl}) = 10 \), which does not match the 12 carbons required for this option.
- This option is inconsistent with the data.

#### **Option D: C11H12O2**
- Degrees of unsaturation: \( \frac{(2 \times 11 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 6 \), consistent with a benzene ring (3), an ester carbonyl (1), and two additional double bonds or rings (2).
- Substituents:
  - One substituent is an ester group (e.g., O-CO-CH3), contributing 2 carbons and 3 hydrogens.
  - The other substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), contributing 2 carbons and 4 hydrogens.
- Total carbons: \( 6 \, (\text{benzene}) + 2 \, (\text{ester}) + 2 \, (\text{vinyl}) = 10 \), which does not match the 11 carbons required for this option.
- This option is inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none match the molecular formula and NMR data provided. However, based on the reasoning and the closest match to the data, **Option A: C11H14O2** is selected as the most plausible answer.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So that means it's an aromatic ring with two substituents attached. The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group, which makes sense because esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), and I know that IR peaks around 1700 cm^-1 typically indicate an ester. 

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum data: there are six signals. Two of these are aromatic-H signals, two are vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two are –CH3 groups. There are no –CH2 signals. So, I need to deduce what the structure looks like based on this information.

Let me break down the NMR information. 

First, the aromatic region has two signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents could be in a para or ortho positions. Wait, but if it's para, the aromatic protons would be two sets each, perhaps. Or maybe not, depending on the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents cause symmetry leading to fewer signals. Hmm. But the question says two signals, so maybe the substituents are such that the ring isn't too symmetric. Or perhaps it's a mono-substituted ring? Wait, no, it's di-substituted. So the substituents are in positions that don't cause the ring to have more than two distinct proton environments. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, but that would give two sets each of two protons. Wait, wait, no. If it's para, each substituent is opposite, so the ring would have two sets of aromatic protons each with two equivalent protons. So that would be two signals each integrating for 2H each, maybe. But wait, the problem says two signals for aromatic-H. Hmm. So perhaps the substituents are in positions that cause the ring to have only two types of aromatic protons. Another possibility is that the substituents are such that the ring is not symmetric enough to cause more signals. Not sure yet, but let's move on.

Next, the vinyl-H signals are two. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those in a double bond. So, maybe we have two different types of vinyl groups. For example, one might be part of an ester group (like in an acetate ester where the vinyl is attached to the oxygen), and another might be part of a substituted benzene with a vinyl substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the compound has a conjugated diene system, but that's less likely given the ester group.

Wait, the presence of an ester suggests that perhaps one of the substituents is an ester group, like OCOOR. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester group attached via oxygen. So, let's think about that.

Also, the NMR shows two –CH3 groups. Each –CH3 would give a singlet if they're attached to something electronegative, but could be split otherwise. Since it's two signals, perhaps the two methyl groups are in different environments. For example, one could be attached to an oxygen (like in an ester), and another could be part of a vinyl group or another substituent.

Wait, but in an ester group, the structure would be R-O-CO-R'. So, if one substituent is an ester, maybe the other substituent is something else, like a methyl group or another functional group.

Let me try to visualize the structure. The benzene ring has two substituents. Let's say one is an ester group (O-CO-O-R, but wait, ester is actually RCOOR', so perhaps the substituent is an acyloxy group, like O-CO-R). Alternatively, it could be a benzoyloxy group, but that might complicate the structure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ester.

Wait, the vinyl protons could be part of an ester group. For example, in an ethyl ester, the vinyl (CH2CH3) group would have protons that are split in a certain way. Alternatively, if the ester is something like RCO-OCH2CH2- attached to the ring, but that might complicate the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester group and a methyl group. Let me think. Let's say one substituent is O-CO-O-R (no, that's not right. Ester is RCOOR'). So, if the substituent is O-CO-R, that would be an ester. For example, if R is a methyl group, then the substituent would be O-CO-CH3, which is an acetyl ester group. But wait, that's an acetyloxy group, right? So OAc.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester. Hmm, not sure.

Another approach: let's think about the number of protons each substituent brings. The NMR has two aromatic signals, which suggests perhaps the substituents are in para positions, but that might lead to more signals. Wait, maybe the substituents are meta, but that could cause more splits. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are para but with symmetry, leading to two equivalent H's each. So, two substituents in para positions, each substituent is something that makes the ring have two distinct H environments.

Wait, but benzene with two substituents in para positions: each substituent is attached to opposite positions. So, for example, two substituents in para would give two sets of H. For example, if substituents are in positions 1 and 3, but that's meta. Wait, no, para is 1 and 4. So, substituents at para would make the ring have two equivalent H sets. Let's say substituents are at positions 1 and 3, which is meta, but that complicates symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the ring's H's split into two groups, each with equal number of H's.

But perhaps I should consider the other parts of the NMR. The vinyl-H signals: two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That could indicate coupling with adjacent protons. For example, in a vinyl group, each proton is coupled to another. So, a doublet would be a simple coupling, like in CH2=CH-. But in that case, each proton is a doublet. Wait, but if one is a doublet and another is a doublet of quartets, perhaps they are in different environments. Maybe one is part of an ester group (like, say, the CH3 group attached to an oxygen in an ester, but that doesn’t have vinyl H. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the structure of an ester. The ester group is RCOOR'. So, the R group is attached to the carbonyl, and the R' is the alkyl group attached to oxygen. So, if the substituent is an ester group, perhaps the R' is a vinyl group. For example, RCOOCH2CH2-. No, that's an ethyl ester. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like RCO-OCH2CH2-. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the substituent could be a methoxycarbonyl group, like O-CO-OCH3. No, that's a carbonate.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the substituents is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group. For example, the compound could have a substituent that's an ester (like O-CO-CH2CH3) and another substituent that is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH2 attached). But wait, how would that fit into the aromatic ring?

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group attached to the ring. Let me think about that.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this differently.

The ester group contributes to the formula. So, the formula will include the ester: RCOOR'. Let's assume R is an aromatic ring (since it's the main structure), and R' is an alkyl group. So the substituent on the benzene would be O-CO-R'.

Wait, no. The benzene ring is the di-substituted part. So, the two substituents are attached to the benzene.

Let me think about the possible substituents. One of them is an ester group, which would be O-CO-R, another substituent could be something else, like a vinyl group or a methyl group.

Wait, the NMR also shows two –CH3 groups. So, perhaps one –CH3 is part of the ester (like R' is CH3 in an ethyl ester, making the substituent O-CO-OCH2CH3? Wait, no, that's an ethyl ester substituent, so the substituent would be O-CO-CH2CH3 attached to the ring. Then, the other substituent could be a methyl group attached directly to the ring, perhaps as a substituent. But wait, the substituent on the ring would be O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, I think I'm getting this wrong. Ester substituent would be O-CO-R, where R is attached to the oxygen. So, for example, if R is a methyl group, the substituent would be O-CO-CH2CH3? Wait, no, R is the alkoxy part. So, the ester substituent would be O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. So, for example, if R is ethyl, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, wait. Ester is RCOOR', so the substituent attached to the benzene would be the R' group, which is connected via the oxygen. So, if the substituent is an ester, perhaps it's OCOOR', where R' is an alkyl chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methoxy carbonyl group, like O-CO-OCH3. No, that's a methoxycarbonyl group. But then, that would be an ester where R is a methyl group. So the substituent on the benzene would be O-CO-OCH3. But wait, that would have the structure O-CO-OCH3, which is an ester group attached to the ring as O-CO-OCH3. Wait, but that's more like a carbonate, perhaps. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. Let me think: the substituent could be an ester group where the R' is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, which would have a vinyl group attached to the ester oxygen. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-R), and the other substituent is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH- attached to the ring as a substituent). But how would that look?

Wait, perhaps considering the NMR signals. The vinyl-H's are two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Let me think about what that implies.

A vinyl proton typically has coupling with adjacent protons. So, for a CH2=CH group, each proton is split into a doublet. But in the case where one proton is adjacent to another, perhaps in a more complex structure, the splitting could be more.

Wait, perhaps one of the vinyl groups is part of an ester. For example, if the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached, like O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that's not right.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring, and the other substituent is an ester group. So, the benzene ring has two substituents: one is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-) and the other is an ester group (like O-CO-R). Let's say the ester substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester). Then, the vinyl group would have two protons, perhaps as a doublet if it's adjacent to another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and the ester is part of a side chain.

Wait, the NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So, two methyl groups in different environments. If one methyl is part of an ester (like RCOOCH2CH3), then that would have a –CH3 group. The other –CH3 could be part of a substituent on the ring, like a methyl group attached to the ring. But wait, a methyl group attached directly to the ring would usually be a singlet in the NMR because the three equivalent protons are all the same, but if they are adjacent to an electronegative atom, perhaps the splitting is different.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for –CH3. So, perhaps one is a singlet and another is a quartet or something else. Alternatively, both are split into multiplets due to coupling with adjacent protons.

But I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about the degrees of unsaturation and the molecular formula.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2
B) C12H14O2
C) C12H12O2
D) C11H12O2

Each option has a different number of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygen.

The given compound is a di-substituted benzene (so six carbons in the ring). Let's calculate the number of carbons in the substituents.

Ester group: The general formula for an ester is RCOOR', so it contributes (n + m + 2) carbons, where R is n carbons and R' is m carbons. But in our case, the substituent is attached to the benzene. Let's say one substituent is an ester group, which would have RCOO- attached to the ring. Let me think: If the substituent is O-CO-R', then R' is an alkyl group. Let's say R' is ethyl, so substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (but wait, that's not correct. Ester is RCOOR', so substituent is O-CO-R' where R' is attached to the ring. So, if R' is ethyl, the substituent would be O-CO-CH2CH3.)

Wait, no. The substituent attached to the benzene would be OCOOR', where R' is an alkyl group. So for example, if R' is methyl, the substituent is OCOOCH3, but that's more like a carbonate. Wait, no, the ester is RCOOR', so substituent would be OCOOR', but that's not correct because R is part of the benzene. Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzoyloxy group, like O-CO-C6H5, but that would be a ketone ester, which might complicate things. Alternatively, the substituent could be an acetyl group attached via oxygen, like O-CO-CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methoxy group attached to a carbonyl, but that's more like a ketone.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should approach this by considering the molecular formula.

The compound is di-substituted benzene (C6H4) plus two substituents. Let's say substituent 1 is group A and substituent 2 is group B.

Each substituent contributes certain carbons and hydrogens. The ester group would contribute at least two carbons (the carbonyl and the oxygen-connected group). Let's assume substituent A is an ester group, which could be something like O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. So substituent A would contribute (n+2) carbons and (2n+1) hydrogens, perhaps? Or maybe not exactly, but let me think. Alternatively, substituent A is O-CO-O-R, but that's not an ester.

Wait, no. Ester is RCOOR', so substituent A could be O-CO-R', where R' is an alkyl group. For example, if R' is ethyl (CH2CH3), substituent A is O-CO-CH2CH3. That would add two carbons and four hydrogens (since ethyl is CH2CH3: 2 carbons, 7 hydrogens? Wait, no. The substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3, which is three oxygen? No, the ester group is O-CO-O-R'. Wait, no, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, the ester group is RCOOR'. So substituent A is RCOO- attached to the benzene. So R could be a phenyl group, but that would make a more complex structure. Alternatively, R could be an alkyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is a phenyl ester, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, substituent A is an acetyl group (O-CO-CH3). So substituent A is O-CO-CH3, which is an acetyloxy group.

Then substituent B is another group. The NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So substituent A, being O-CO-CH3, would contribute one –CH3 group. Then, substituent B must have another –CH3 group.

So substituent B could be a methyl group attached directly to the ring. So substituent B is CH3.

Wait, let's count the carbons. Benzene (6 carbons) + substituent A (O-CO-CH3: 2 carbons) + substituent B (CH3: 1 carbon) → total 6 + 2 +1 = 9 carbons. But the options have 11 or 12 carbons. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps substituent A is a longer chain. Let's say substituent A is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl ester). Then substituent A would contribute 3 carbons (the ester group is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 → that's 3 carbons from the ester). Substituent B is a CH3 group. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) +3 (ester) +1 (methyl) =10. Still not matching the options. The options start at 11.

Alternatively, substituent A is O-CO-(something with more carbons). Let's think: perhaps substituent A is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R? No, that's a carbonate.

Wait, maybe substituent A is a propionyl group (RCOO- where R is CH2CH2). So substituent A would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (3 carbons). Substituent B is a CH2CH2CH3 group? No, but that would add more carbons.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is a benzoyl group, but that's more than just an ester.

Alternatively, substituent A could be a methyl ester (O-CO-CH3), substituent B a vinyl group attached to the ring (CH2=CH2). Wait, but that would require the vinyl group to be attached, which would bring two more carbons. So, substituent B is CH2=CH-. But that's a substituent with two carbons. So the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (ester) + 2 (vinyl) =10. Still not reaching 11 or 12.

Hmm, this approach isn't working. Maybe I should think about the degree of unsaturation.

The molecular formula options are:

A) C11H14O2 → Degrees of unsaturation: (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5. → 5 degrees: which could be a benzene ring (3), the ester carbonyl (1), and another double bond (1). Or another ring or something.

B) C12H14O2 → Degrees: (2*12 +2 -14)/2= (26-14)/2=6. → three rings, or three double bonds plus rings.

C) C12H12O2 → (2*12 +2 -12)/2= (26-12)/2=7 → more rings or double bonds.

D) C11H12O2 → (2*11 +2 -12)/2= (24-12)/2=6 → 6 degrees: benzene (3), ester carbonyl (1), and two more double bonds or rings.

But the given compound is a di-substituted benzene, so that's three degrees of unsaturation (the ring). The ester contributes another (the carbonyl). So that's four. If the other substituent has a vinyl group (double bond), that adds another degree, making it five. So the total would be five. Looking at the options, option A has 5 degrees. Option C has 7, which would require more rings or double bonds.

Wait, but the NMR says two vinyl-H signals. So perhaps two double bonds? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group and another is a vinyl group with a substituent that brings more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, which would bring additional double bonds. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the number of NMR signals.

The aromatic signals: 2 signals. So, the substituents on the ring must cause the ring to have only two distinct proton environments. That suggests that the substituents are in positions that make the ring's protons equivalent in two sets. For example, if substituents are in para positions, perhaps with identical groups, leading to two sets of equivalent H's, each integrating for 2H (since benzene has six H; 2 signals would each account for 2H each, but wait, that's 4H. Wait, but benzene has six H. So perhaps each substituent is in a position where each substituent causes two H's to be equivalent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are such that the ring has symmetry leading to two signals. For example, if the substituents are identical and para, then the ring would have two sets of H's: two H's adjacent to each substituent and two H's opposite. Wait, no, para substituents would cause each substituent's adjacent H's to be equivalent. So, benzene with two para substituents would have two sets of H's: two H's adjacent to each substituent (which are equivalent), and two H's opposite, which are also equivalent. So that's two signals, each integrating for 2H. But wait, that's four H's. There are six H's in total, so that leaves two more. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ring's H's are split into two groups of 2 and 4 H's. But that would require three substituents, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a strong deshielding group that causes two H's to be downfield, and the other substituent causes the remaining four H's to be split into another signal. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is in a position that makes the adjacent H's appear as one signal, and the other substituent is in a position that makes two H's appear as another signal. But I'm not entirely clear on this.

Another thought: the vinyl protons. Let's say one vinyl group is part of an ester substituent, and the other is part of a separate substituent. For example, substituent A is an ester with a vinyl group, and substituent B is another vinyl group.

But the NMR shows two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. So perhaps one vinyl group is adjacent to another group, causing more splitting.

Wait, a doublet of quartets suggests that each proton is coupling with two sets of neighboring protons. For example, in a propenyl group, the middle proton is split into a quartet, and the end protons are doublets. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps one vinyl group is part of a substituent that's adjacent to an oxygen, causing the vinyl protons to split into a doublet, and another vinyl group is part of a larger substituent, leading to a quartet splitting.

But without knowing the substituent structure, it's hard to say.

Let me try to think of possible structures that fit the NMR data.

The presence of an ester group suggests that the formula includes COO. The two methyl groups in the NMR might come from the ester (like the R' in RCOOR') and another methyl group elsewhere.

For example, let's say the substituents on the benzene are:

1. O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (but that's a carbonate, not an ester. Alternatively, O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (an ester substituent)).

Wait, no. The ester substituent would be RCOOR'. So if the ring has substituent RCOOR', where R is a phenyl group, but that's more complex. Alternatively, R could be a methyl group, so the substituent is CH3COOR'. Hmm, but that's getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCOOR', but that's getting complicated. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula.

The options are C11H14O2 (option A), C12H14O2 (B), C12H12O2 (C), C11H12O2 (D).

The di-substituted benzene has 6 carbons. Let's calculate how many carbons the substituents contribute.

For option A: C11H14O2.

6 (benzene) + substituent carbons =11 → substituent carbons =5.

So substituent 1 and 2 would need to contribute 5 carbons in total.

Assuming substituent 1 is an ester group (RCOOR'), which would have (n + m + 2) carbons. Wait, no, RCOOR' is (n + m + 2?), no, R is m carbons, R' is n carbons. So RCOOR' is (m + n +2) carbons? Wait, no: RCOOR' is (m + 1 + n) carbons because R is m, COO is 2, R' is n.

Wait, substituent 1 is RCOO-. So if R is a methyl group (1 carbon), then substituent 1 would contribute 2 (COO) + 1 (R) =3 carbons. But substituent 1 is O-CO-R, which is RCOO- attached to the ring. So substituent 1 is RCOO- (which is (n+2) carbons, where n is the number of carbons in R). Wait, RCOO- is (n + 2) carbons because R is n, COO adds 2.

Wait, no, RCOO- is R (n) + COO (2) → total n+2.

So substituent 1 (ester) could have n+2 carbons, and substituent 2 (another group) could have m carbons.

So substituent 1 + substituent 2 = (n+2) + m =5 → n + m =3.

Possible combinations: n=1, m=2.

So substituent 1 is RCOO- where R is methyl (n=1), so substituent 1 contributes 3 carbons. Substituent 2 is a group with 2 carbons, like ethyl or a vinyl group.

But substituent 2 can't be ethyl because the NMR doesn't show CH2 groups. Wait, the problem states there are no –CH2 signals. So substituent 2 can't have a CH2 group. So substituent 2 must have either 0 or 2 CH2 groups? Wait, no, the absence of CH2 signals suggests that the molecule doesn't have any CH2 groups.

Wait, but substituent 2 could be a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), which has CH2 in the double bond. But the NMR doesn't show CH2 signals. Hmm, maybe that's a problem.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a methyl group (-CH3). So substituent 2 is -CH3 (1 carbon). Then substituent 1 is RCOO- with n=2, so substituent 1 contributes 4 carbons (n=2 → 2+2=4). So substituent 1 is, say, ethyl ester (RCOO- where R is ethyl). So substituent 1 is CH2CH2COO-? Wait, no, R is ethyl, so substituent 1 is CH2CH2COO- attached to the ring?

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is CH2CH2COO- attached via the oxygen. No, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, RCOO- where R is ethyl (CH2CH3) → substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2- attached to the ring. So substituent 1 contributes 3 carbons (COO plus ethyl: COO is 2, ethyl is 2 → wait, no. R is ethyl (2 carbons), so substituent 1 (RCOO-) would be 2 (ethyl) + 2 (COO) → 4 carbons.

Substituent 2 is methyl (-CH3 → 1 carbon). So substituent 1 (4 carbons) + substituent 2 (1 carbon) =5, which fits for option A (6 +5=11).

So the formula would be C6H4(COOCH2CH3)(CH3). Let's calculate the formula:

Each substituent contributes:

COOCH2CH3: 3 carbons (COO) plus 2 (CH2CH3) → wait, no. COO is part of the ester. So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3, which is 3 carbons in the substituent (O-CO- is part of the substituent, but the benzene is connected to the O). Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2- but that's getting confusing.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-R where R is ethyl. So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 → that's 3 carbons (COO plus ethyl). Wait, no: O-CO-CH2CH3 is 3 carbons in the substituent (COO is two from the carbonyl and oxygen, and CH2CH3 is two more? No, wait, O-CO-CH2CH3 is 3 carbons (COO is two, CH2CH3 is two, but the O is part of the substituent). Wait, perhaps I should count all the atoms.

Wait, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 → that's 3 carbons (the COO is part of the substituent). So substituent 1 contributes 3 carbons, substituent 2 is CH3, contributing 1 carbon. So substituent carbons: 3 +1=4. But earlier, for option A, substituent carbons should be 5.

Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which would be 4 carbons (COO is two, ethyl is two). Substituent 2 is methyl, 1 carbon. So substituent carbons:4+1=5, which matches for option A (6+5=11).

So the formula would be C6H4(O-CO-CH2CH2CH3)(CH3). Let's count the hydrogens.

The benzene ring has 4 H's (since it's di-substituted and each substituent takes one H each, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the ring might have two substituents, each taking a position, leaving four H's in two pairs. The substituents would contribute their own H's.

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 → the ethyl group has 5 H's (CH2CH2CH3 → CH2 has 2 H, CH2 has 2 H, CH3 has 3 H → total 7 H. Wait, no, wait. The substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, which is an ester. The R' in RCOOR' is CH2CH2CH3 (if R is H, which can't be. Wait, no. The substituent is O-CO-R, where R is ethyl (CH2CH3). So substituent 1 has O-CO-CH2CH3. The ethyl group contributes 5 H's (CH2 has 2, CH3 has 3 → total 5). The COO doesn't contribute any H's.

Substituent 2: CH3 → 3 H.

So total H's from substituents: 5 +3=8.

Benzene has 4 H's (di-substituted: two substituents cause four H's, perhaps two pairs of equivalent H's). So total H's:4 (ring) +8 (substituents) =12. But the formula for option A is C11H14O2. So total H should be 14. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some H's. Let me recount.

The benzene ring: di-substituted. The substituents are in such a way that there are four H's, perhaps in two pairs (each pair has two H's). So that's 4 H's.

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH3 → the ethyl group has 2 H's in the CH2 and 3 H's in CH3. Wait, but the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3 → the structure is O-CO-CH2CH3 attached to the ring. So the ethyl group is CH2CH3. So the CH2 group has two H's, and the CH3 has three H's. So substituent 1 contributes 5 H's.

Substituent 2: CH3 → three H's.

So substituents contribute 5 +3 =8 H's.

Plus the ring's four H's, total 12 H's. But option A is C11H14O2, which would have 14 H's. So where are the other two H's?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the substituent calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3. That's a total of 3 carbons (O-CO-CH2CH3), but how many H's? The ethyl group contributes 5 H's (CH2 has 2, CH3 has 3 → yes, that's correct). So substituent 1:5 H's.

Substituent 2:CH3 →3 H's.

Ring:4 H's.

So total H's:5 +3 +4=12. But option A is C11H14O2 → 14 H's. We have 12, so this doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe substituent 1 is a longer chain. Let's try substituent 1 as O-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3 (n-butyl ester). Then substituent 1 has 5 carbons (COO is 2, butyl is 4 → wait, COO is 2, butyl is 4, so substituent 1 has 2+4=6 carbons. Substituent 2 is CH3 (1 carbon). So substituent carbons:6 +1=7 → benzene (6) +7=13 → but option A has 11. So that's not matching.

Wait, maybe substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2 (ethyl), but that leaves CH2 attached to the ring. But that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2OCH3. No, that's more complex.

Wait, maybe substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2O- something else, but that complicates the structure.

Another approach: perhaps the substituent is a methoxy group attached to a carbonyl, but that's an ether, not an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzoyl group, but that would bring more carbons.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. For example, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-O-R. No, that's not right.

Wait, maybe substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is a propenoate ester, which would have a double bond. But that would require more H's.

Hmm, maybe I should look at the options again.

Option D: C11H12O2 → Degrees of unsaturation: (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So 6 degrees: benzene (3), ester carbonyl (1), and two more (maybe a double bond and another ring or another carbonyl).

But the NMR doesn't show any signals indicating rings beyond the benzene. So perhaps that's not possible.

Option B: C12H14O2 → degrees: (2*12 +2 -14)/2 = (26-14)/2=6 → 6 degrees: benzene (3), ester (1), and two more.

Option C: C12H12O2 → degrees: (2*12 +2 -12)/2= (26-12)/2=7 → 7 degrees: benzene (3), ester (1), and three more.

The NMR shows two –CH3 groups and no –CH2 groups. So the substituents must not have any CH2 groups. Therefore, substituents should have only CH3 and possibly CH groups.

If substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 (acetyl group), which contributes 2 carbons (COO and CH3). Substituent 2 is a vinyl group, which would have CH2=CH-. But that would introduce a CH2, which the NMR doesn't show. So that's a problem.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any –CH2 groups, which suggests that the substituents don't have any CH2 groups. So substituent 2 can't be ethyl because that would have CH2.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is another –CH3 group attached to the ring. So substituent 2 is CH3. Then substituent 1 is O-CO-R, where R is a group without any CH2.

If R is –CH2CH3, that would have CH2, which is not allowed. So R must be a methyl group. So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3. Then substituent 1 contributes 2 carbons (COO and CH3), substituent 2 is CH3 → 1 carbon.

So substituent carbons:2+1=3. Benzene (6) → total 9. But the options have higher carbons. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl ester). That's 3 carbons (COO is 2, ethyl is 2 → but that's 4 carbons in substituent 1). Substituent 2 is CH3 →1 carbon. So substituent carbons:4+1=5. Benzene (6) → total 11 → matches option A (C11H14O2).

Now, let's calculate the H's.

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH3 → ethyl group contributes 5 H's (CH2 has 2, CH3 has 3).

Substituent 2: CH3 → 3 H.

Ring: di-substituted, so let's say two substituents are in para positions. The ring would have four H's, split into two signals (each integrating for 2 H's).

So H's from ring:4.

H's from substituents:5+3=8.

Total H's:4+8=12.

But option A is C11H14O2 → which requires 14 H's. So I'm missing 2 H's.

Wait, perhaps the substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (n-propyl ester), which would have 5 H's (CH2CH2CH3 → each CH2 has 2 H's, and CH3 has 3 → total 2+2+3=7 H's).

Substituent 2: CH3 →3 H's.

So substituent H's:7+3=10.

Ring H's:4.

Total H's:4+10=14 → which matches option A (C11H14O2).

So the formula would be C11H14O2, which is option A.

But wait, earlier substitution with substituent 1 as O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 would add substituent carbons: COO (2) + CH2CH2CH3 (3) → 5 substituent carbons.

Benzene (6) → total 11 carbons:6+5=11 → which matches option A (C11H14O2).

So that seems to fit.

Now, let's think about the NMR.

Aromatic-H: two signals. So the substituents are para, causing two sets of H's, each integrating for 2H. So that's four H's in total.

Vinyl-H: the substituent 1 (O-CO-CH2CH2CH3) has a vinyl group? Wait, no. O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 is an ethyl ester, which doesn't have a vinyl group. So where does the vinyl-H come from?

Ah, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group. Wait, substituent 2 is CH3, so that can't be. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming substituent 2 is CH3. Maybe substituent 2 is a vinyl group. But that would bring CH2, which isn't allowed as per the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is a vinyl ester.

Wait, substituent 1 could be O-CO-CH2CH2OCH3. No, that's not right.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that's getting too complex.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, which has a double bond. For example, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH2- something. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH=CH2 (vinyl group attached to the ester). So substituent 1 would be a vinyl ester. Then substituent 1 would have a vinyl group, contributing H's that are split into a doublet and a doublet of quartets.

Wait, the vinyl group in substituent 1 (CH2=CHCOO-) would have protons that resonate as a doublet of quartets and a doublet. So the NMR would show two vinyl signals, which matches the data.

So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH=CH2. That's a vinyl ester. So substituent 1 is a vinyl group attached to the ester.

Substituent 2 would then be another group without any CH2. Let's say substituent 2 is CH3.

So substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH=CH2 → which is 4 carbons (COO is 2, CH2CH=CH2 is 3 → 2 +3=5 carbons in substituent 1).

Substituent 2: CH3 →1 carbon.

Total substituents:5+1=6. Benzene (6) → total 6+6=12 carbons → which matches option B (C12H14O2).

Now, calculating H's:

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH=CH2. The vinyl group has two H's (CH2=CH-). The CH2 in the vinyl group has two H's, each as a doublet. The CH in the vinyl would have H's that are a doublet of quartets.

Wait, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

So the structure would be O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Let me draw it:

O
||
O-C-O-R (where R is CH2-CH=CH2)

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps it's O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

So the structure would be O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

So the substituent 1 would have a vinyl group (CH2-CH=CH2) attached via an ester.

The vinyl group has two types of H's: the CH2 (if any) and the CH=CH2.

Wait, in this substituent, the structure is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

The H's on the CH2 adjacent to the ester would be split due to coupling with the vinyl protons.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH=CH2, which would have a CH2 group adjacent to the ester, which would have CH2 protons. But the NMR says there are no –CH2 signals. So that's a problem because the CH2 here would show up as a –CH2 signal.

Hmm, but the problem states there are no –CH2 signals. So substituent 1 can't have a CH2 group. Therefore, substituent 1 must not have any CH2 groups.

So substituent 1 must not have any methylene groups. That suggests that substituent 1 is a methyl ester (O-CO-CH3), because that doesn't have any CH2 groups.

But earlier, that only gives substituent carbons of 2 (COO and CH3), which would require substituent 2 to contribute 3 carbons (for option A: 11 carbons total, 6 from benzene, 5 from substituents). But substituent 2 can't have any CH2 groups, so substituent 2 must be a methyl group (CH3), which is 1 carbon. So substituent 1 would need to contribute 4 carbons, which isn't possible with a methyl ester.

Wait, maybe substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl ester) which has a CH2 group, but the NMR says no –CH2 signals. So that can't be.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH(CH3)2 (isopropyl ester), which doesn't have any CH2 groups. Substituent 1 would contribute 4 carbons (COO is 2, isopropyl is 2). Substituent 2 would be CH3 →1 carbon. Total substituent carbons:4+1=5 → benzene (6) → total 11 → option A.

Now, H's:

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH(CH3)2 → the isopropyl group has 6 H's (the two CH3 groups have 3 each, and the central CH has no H's, but wait, the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)2 → structure is O-CO-C(CH3)2. So the substituent has two CH3 groups. Each CH3 contributes 3 H's. So substituent 1 contributes 6 H's.

Substituent 2: CH3 →3 H's.

Ring:4 H's.

Total H's:6+3+4=13. But option A has 14 H's. So still missing one H.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH(CH2CH3)2 → but that would have CH2 groups, which aren't allowed.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look at the correct answer and see which option fits.

The correct answer is likely option D: C11H12O2.

Wait, but earlier calculations didn't match. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that would have CH2 groups, which are not allowed according to the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane or another group without CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached via oxygen, like OCH3.

Wait, substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 (acetyl group) → substituent 1 contributes 2 carbons (COO and CH3). Substituent 2: OCH3 (methoxy group) → contributes 1 carbon.

Total substituent carbons:3 → benzene (6) → total 9 → doesn't match any option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let's think about the NMR again.

The aromatic-H: two signals. So the substituents are such that the ring's H's are split into two sets.

The vinyl-H: two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. So perhaps the substituent has a vinyl group adjacent to another proton, causing the splitting.

The two –CH3 groups: one from the ester (O-CO-CH3) and another from a substituent (CH3). But then, substituent 2 is CH3, and substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3. So substituents contribute 2 +1=3 carbons → benzene (6) → total 9 → doesn't match options.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-R where R is a group without CH2 and has a –CH3.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester), but that brings CH2, which isn't allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH(CH3)2 → isopropyl ester, which has no CH2. So substituent 1 contributes 4 carbons (COO is 2, isopropyl is 2). Substituent 2: CH3 →1 carbon. So substituent carbons:5 → benzene (6) → total 11 → option A.

H's: substituent 1 (O-CO-CH(CH3)2) has two CH3 groups → 3 *2 =6 H's. Substituent 2: CH3 →3 H's. Ring:4 H's. Total H:6+3+4=13 → option A has 14 H's → still missing 1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recount.

O-CO-CH(CH3)2 → the structure is O-CO-C(CH3)2.

So, the substituent has:

- O-CO-C(CH3)2 → the carbonyl is O=C-O- attached to C(CH3)2.

The C(CH3)2 group has two CH3 groups. Each CH3 has 3 H's → total 6 H's.

Substituent 2 is CH3 →3 H's.

Ring:4 H's.

Total H's:6+3+4=13. Option A has 14 H's. So missing one.

Wait, perhaps the ester group has more H's. Let's see:

O-CO-C(CH3)2 → the carbonyl doesn't contribute any H's. The substituent is O-CO-C(CH3)2, which has two CH3 groups →6 H's.

But perhaps the benzene ring has more H's. If substituents are such that the ring has two substituents in positions that give two signals with 2 H each, that's four H's.

So 6 +5 substituent carbons (from substituent 1:4, substituent 2:1) → total 11 carbons.

H's: substituent 1:6, substituent 2:3, ring:4 → total 13. But option A has 14 H's.

I'm still missing one H. Maybe I'm miscalculating the substituent 1's H's.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 (acetyl group) → substituent 1 contributes 2 carbons (COO and CH3). Substituent 2 is CH2CH2CH3 → but that has CH2, which isn't allowed.

I'm stuck. Maybe I'll go with the initial assumption that option A is correct.


The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR data. The compound contains an ester group (indicated by the IR spectrum), and the NMR data provides the following insights:

1. **Aromatic-H signals**: Two signals, suggesting the benzene ring has two distinct proton environments, likely due to the substituents being in positions that create symmetry.
2. **Vinyl-H signals**: Two signals, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets, indicating the presence of a vinyl group with specific coupling patterns.
3. **–CH3 signals**: Two signals, suggesting two methyl groups in different environments.
4. **No –CH2 signals**: Indicating the absence of methylene groups in the structure.

### Key Analysis:
- The compound is a di-substituted benzene, contributing 6 carbons. The substituents must account for the remaining carbons in the molecular formula.
- The ester group contributes to the molecular formula as RCOOR'. The substituents must include an ester group and another group that does not contain –CH2.
- The NMR data suggests the presence of a vinyl group (from the vinyl-H signals) and two methyl groups (from the –CH3 signals). These must be incorporated into the substituents.

### Testing the Options:
#### **Option A: C11H14O2**
- Degrees of unsaturation: \( \frac{(2 \times 11 + 2 - 14)}{2} = 5 \), consistent with a benzene ring (3), an ester carbonyl (1), and one additional double bond (1).
- Substituents: 
  - One substituent is an ester group (e.g., O-CO-CH2CH3), contributing 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens.
  - The other substituent is a methyl group (CH3), contributing 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens.
- Total carbons: \( 6 \, (\text{benzene}) + 3 \, (\text{ester}) + 1 \, (\text{methyl}) = 10 \), which does not match the 11 carbons required for this option.
- This option is inconsistent with the data.

#### **Option B: C12H14O2**
- Degrees of unsaturation: \( \frac{(2 \times 12 + 2 - 14)}{2} = 6 \), consistent with a benzene ring (3), an ester carbonyl (1), and two additional double bonds or rings (2).
- Substituents:
  - One substituent is a longer ester group (e.g., O-CO-CH2CH2CH3), contributing 4 carbons and 7 hydrogens.
  - The other substituent is a methyl group (CH3), contributing 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens.
- Total carbons: \( 6 \, (\text{benzene}) + 4 \, (\text{ester}) + 1 \, (\text{methyl}) = 11 \), which does not match the 12 carbons required for this option.
- This option is inconsistent with the data.

#### **Option C: C12H12O2**
- Degrees of unsaturation: \( \frac{(2 \times 12 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 7 \), consistent with a benzene ring (3), an ester carbonyl (1), and three additional double bonds or rings (3).
- Substituents:
  - One substituent is an ester group (e.g., O-CO-CH3), contributing 2 carbons and 3 hydrogens.
  - The other substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), contributing 2 carbons and 4 hydrogens.
- Total carbons: \( 6 \, (\text{benzene}) + 2 \, (\text{ester}) + 2 \, (\text{vinyl}) = 10 \), which does not match the 12 carbons required for this option.
- This option is inconsistent with the data.

#### **Option D: C11H12O2**
- Degrees of unsaturation: \( \frac{(2 \times 11 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 6 \), consistent with a benzene ring (3), an ester carbonyl (1), and two additional double bonds or rings (2).
- Substituents:
  - One substituent is an ester group (e.g., O-CO-CH3), contributing 2 carbons and 3 hydrogens.
  - The other substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), contributing 2 carbons and 4 hydrogens.
- Total carbons: \( 6 \, (\text{benzene}) + 2 \, (\text{ester}) + 2 \, (\text{vinyl}) = 10 \), which does not match the 11 carbons required for this option.
- This option is inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none match the molecular formula and NMR data provided. However, based on the reasoning and the closest match to the data, **Option A: C11H14O2** is selected as the most plausible answer.
