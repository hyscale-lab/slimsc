Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of an operator. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. So the operator we're looking at is 10σz + 5σx. We need to find the expectation value of that.

Right, expectation values. The general formula is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I think we can break this into two parts because the operator is a sum. Let me see, expectation of 10σz plus expectation of 5σx. Oh yeah, because expectation values are linear, so we can separate it like that.

First, let's find the expectation of σz. Since the states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

The state is a combination: 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. So when we compute ⟨σz⟩, it's the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. Let me write this:

⟨σz⟩ = |0.5|^2 * (1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1).

Calculating each term: |0.5|^2 is 0.25, and |sqrt(3)/2|^2 is (3/4)=0.75. So,

⟨σz⟩ = 0.25 * 1 + 0.75 * (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then, the expectation of 10σz is 10 times this, so 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, the second part is the expectation of 5σx. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. The expectation of σx is a bit trickier because it's not diagonal in the σz basis. So I think we need to compute it using the given state.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

So let's compute that. The state ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩.

So:

⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = [0.5*⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)*⟨↓| ] σx [0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩ ].

Breaking it down, σx applied to |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, and applied to |↓⟩ is |↑⟩.

So when we expand this, it's:

0.5 * 0.5 * ⟨↑| σx |↑⟩ + 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) * ⟨↑| σx |↓⟩
+
(sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 * ⟨↓| σx |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * ⟨↓| σx |↓⟩.

But wait, σx |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, so ⟨↑| σx |↑⟩ would be ⟨↑| ↓ ⟩ which is zero. Similarly, σx |↓⟩ is |↑⟩, so ⟨↓| σx |↓⟩ is zero. The cross terms are the non-zero parts.

So the terms that survive are the ones where ⟨↑| σx |↓⟩ and ⟨↓| σx |↑⟩. Let me see:

⟨↑| σx |↓⟩ = ⟨↑| (which is 1 for |↑⟩) times σx |↓⟩, which is |↑⟩. So ⟨↑| σx |↓⟩ = 1 * 1 = 1.

Similarly, ⟨↓| σx |↑⟩ is the same as ⟨↑| σx |↓⟩, which is 1. Because σx is Hermitian, so these terms are complex conjugates, but since they're real here, they are equal.

Wait, but the cross terms are:

First cross term: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) * ⟨↑| σx |↓⟩ = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2)*1.

Second cross term: (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 * ⟨↓| σx |↑⟩ = (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 *1.

So each cross term is (sqrt(3)/4) and (sqrt(3)/4), so adding them gives sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, that's about 0.866.

So the expectation value of 5σx is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Oh, I think I may have made a mistake in the expansion. Let me write it out more carefully.

Let me denote a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

So ψ = a|↑> + b|↓>.

⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = a* a' ⟨↑| σx |↑> + a* b' ⟨↑| σx |↓> 
+ b* a' ⟨↓| σx |↑> + b* b' ⟨↓| σx |↓>.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write it as:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = |a|^2 ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + a b^* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + a^* b ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ + |b|^2 ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩.

But σx |↑> = |↓>, so ⟨↑|σx|↑> = 0.

Similarly, σx |↓> = |↑>, so ⟨↓|σx|↓> = 0.

Only the cross terms are non-zero.

So:

⟨σx⟩ = a b^* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + a^* b ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩.

But σx is Hermitian, so ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = (⟨↓|σx|↑⟩)^*.

Since σx is real and symmetric, these inner products are real. Therefore,

⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ = 1.

So,

⟨σx⟩ = a b + a b = 2 a b.

Because a is 0.5 and b is sqrt(3)/2,

a b = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.433.

Multiply by 2, we get sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So yeah, that's correct.

So the expectation of 5σx is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 * 0.8660 ≈4.3301.

Wait, wait—no, wait. Because the expectation of σx is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, so 5 times that is about 4.33.

So putting it all together, the total expectation value is:

⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

10*(-0.5) is -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) is approx 5*(0.866) =4.33.

So total expectation value ≈-5 +4.33= -0.67.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me compute more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(3) precisely.

sqrt(3) ≈1.73205.

So sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866025.

5*sqrt(3)/2 ≈4.330125.

Then, 10*σz was -5.

So sum is -5 +4.330125= -0.669875.

Hmm, that's approximately -0.67. But the options are given to one decimal place.

Wait, looking at the options:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So our calculation is approximately -0.67, which is about -0.7 when rounded to one decimal. So the correct answer would be option C) -0.7.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations. Did I make a mistake anywhere?

Wait, the state is ψ = 0.5 |↑> + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓>.

The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2, which squares to 0.25 and 0.75, respectively. So for σz, the expectation is 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75= -0.5. Correct.

Then, 10σz gives 10*(-0.5)= -5.

For σx, as calculated, the expectation is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866, so 5σx gives 5*0.866≈4.33.

Adding these: -5 +4.33= -0.67.

So that's approximately -0.7, so option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the σx expectation.

Wait, let me recalculate the σx part.

The state ψ is |ψ> = a |↑> + b |↓>, with a=0.5, b=sqrt(3)/2.

The expectation value is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

σx in matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So |↑> is [1;0], |↓> is [0;1].

So |ψ> is [a; b] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

σx |ψ> is [[0 1],[1 0]] [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Then, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5] = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Which is (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2. So yes, that's correct.

So the expectation value is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866.

So 5 times that is about 4.33.

Thus, the total expectation is -5 + 4.33 = -0.67 ≈ -0.7.

So the correct answer is option C) -0.7.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given quantum state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) for \( \sigma_z \), respectively. The state \( \psi \) is a linear combination of these eigenstates, so the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 \cdot (+1) + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-1).
\]

Calculating the probabilities:
\[
|0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

The contribution from \( 10\sigma_z \) is:
\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix is:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state \( \psi \) is represented as:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]

Using matrix multiplication:
\[
\sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now compute:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Expanding:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

The contribution from \( 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot 0.866 \approx 4.33.
\]

### Step 3: Total expectation value
The total expectation value is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle \approx -0.7.
\]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately **-0.7**.

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of an operator. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. So the operator we're looking at is 10σz + 5σx. We need to find the expectation value of that.

Right, expectation values. The general formula is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I think we can break this into two parts because the operator is a sum. Let me see, expectation of 10σz plus expectation of 5σx. Oh yeah, because expectation values are linear, so we can separate it like that.

First, let's find the expectation of σz. Since the states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

The state is a combination: 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. So when we compute ⟨σz⟩, it's the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. Let me write this:

⟨σz⟩ = |0.5|^2 * (1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1).

Calculating each term: |0.5|^2 is 0.25, and |sqrt(3)/2|^2 is (3/4)=0.75. So,

⟨σz⟩ = 0.25 * 1 + 0.75 * (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then, the expectation of 10σz is 10 times this, so 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, the second part is the expectation of 5σx. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. The expectation of σx is a bit trickier because it's not diagonal in the σz basis. So I think we need to compute it using the given state.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

So let's compute that. The state ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩.

So:

⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = [0.5*⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)*⟨↓| ] σx [0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩ ].

Breaking it down, σx applied to |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, and applied to |↓⟩ is |↑⟩.

So when we expand this, it's:

0.5 * 0.5 * ⟨↑| σx |↑⟩ + 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) * ⟨↑| σx |↓⟩
+
(sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 * ⟨↓| σx |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * ⟨↓| σx |↓⟩.

But wait, σx |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, so ⟨↑| σx |↑⟩ would be ⟨↑| ↓ ⟩ which is zero. Similarly, σx |↓⟩ is |↑⟩, so ⟨↓| σx |↓⟩ is zero. The cross terms are the non-zero parts.

So the terms that survive are the ones where ⟨↑| σx |↓⟩ and ⟨↓| σx |↑⟩. Let me see:

⟨↑| σx |↓⟩ = ⟨↑| (which is 1 for |↑⟩) times σx |↓⟩, which is |↑⟩. So ⟨↑| σx |↓⟩ = 1 * 1 = 1.

Similarly, ⟨↓| σx |↑⟩ is the same as ⟨↑| σx |↓⟩, which is 1. Because σx is Hermitian, so these terms are complex conjugates, but since they're real here, they are equal.

Wait, but the cross terms are:

First cross term: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) * ⟨↑| σx |↓⟩ = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2)*1.

Second cross term: (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 * ⟨↓| σx |↑⟩ = (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 *1.

So each cross term is (sqrt(3)/4) and (sqrt(3)/4), so adding them gives sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, that's about 0.866.

So the expectation value of 5σx is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Oh, I think I may have made a mistake in the expansion. Let me write it out more carefully.

Let me denote a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

So ψ = a|↑> + b|↓>.

⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = a* a' ⟨↑| σx |↑> + a* b' ⟨↑| σx |↓> 
+ b* a' ⟨↓| σx |↑> + b* b' ⟨↓| σx |↓>.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write it as:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = |a|^2 ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + a b^* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + a^* b ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ + |b|^2 ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩.

But σx |↑> = |↓>, so ⟨↑|σx|↑> = 0.

Similarly, σx |↓> = |↑>, so ⟨↓|σx|↓> = 0.

Only the cross terms are non-zero.

So:

⟨σx⟩ = a b^* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + a^* b ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩.

But σx is Hermitian, so ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = (⟨↓|σx|↑⟩)^*.

Since σx is real and symmetric, these inner products are real. Therefore,

⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ = 1.

So,

⟨σx⟩ = a b + a b = 2 a b.

Because a is 0.5 and b is sqrt(3)/2,

a b = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.433.

Multiply by 2, we get sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So yeah, that's correct.

So the expectation of 5σx is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 * 0.8660 ≈4.3301.

Wait, wait—no, wait. Because the expectation of σx is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, so 5 times that is about 4.33.

So putting it all together, the total expectation value is:

⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

10*(-0.5) is -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) is approx 5*(0.866) =4.33.

So total expectation value ≈-5 +4.33= -0.67.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me compute more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(3) precisely.

sqrt(3) ≈1.73205.

So sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866025.

5*sqrt(3)/2 ≈4.330125.

Then, 10*σz was -5.

So sum is -5 +4.330125= -0.669875.

Hmm, that's approximately -0.67. But the options are given to one decimal place.

Wait, looking at the options:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So our calculation is approximately -0.67, which is about -0.7 when rounded to one decimal. So the correct answer would be option C) -0.7.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations. Did I make a mistake anywhere?

Wait, the state is ψ = 0.5 |↑> + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓>.

The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2, which squares to 0.25 and 0.75, respectively. So for σz, the expectation is 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75= -0.5. Correct.

Then, 10σz gives 10*(-0.5)= -5.

For σx, as calculated, the expectation is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866, so 5σx gives 5*0.866≈4.33.

Adding these: -5 +4.33= -0.67.

So that's approximately -0.7, so option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the σx expectation.

Wait, let me recalculate the σx part.

The state ψ is |ψ> = a |↑> + b |↓>, with a=0.5, b=sqrt(3)/2.

The expectation value is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

σx in matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So |↑> is [1;0], |↓> is [0;1].

So |ψ> is [a; b] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

σx |ψ> is [[0 1],[1 0]] [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Then, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5] = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Which is (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2. So yes, that's correct.

So the expectation value is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866.

So 5 times that is about 4.33.

Thus, the total expectation is -5 + 4.33 = -0.67 ≈ -0.7.

So the correct answer is option C) -0.7.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given quantum state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) for \( \sigma_z \), respectively. The state \( \psi \) is a linear combination of these eigenstates, so the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 \cdot (+1) + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-1).
\]

Calculating the probabilities:
\[
|0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

The contribution from \( 10\sigma_z \) is:
\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix is:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state \( \psi \) is represented as:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]

Using matrix multiplication:
\[
\sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now compute:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Expanding:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

The contribution from \( 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot 0.866 \approx 4.33.
\]

### Step 3: Total expectation value
The total expectation value is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle \approx -0.7.
\]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately **-0.7**.

Answer: C
