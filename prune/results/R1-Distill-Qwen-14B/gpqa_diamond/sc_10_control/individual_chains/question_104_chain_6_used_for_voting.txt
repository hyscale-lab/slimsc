Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the scenario is that astronomers are looking for exoplanets around two stars that have exactly the same masses as each other. Both stars are similar to our Sun. They found one planet around each using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The orbits are circular.

The key data points given are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. For Planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. The options are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance. 

Wait, the formula I think I need is the one that relates the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period and other factors. The formula is K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / (4π²) )^(1/3) * ( (1) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) ) * ( sin i ) / (P^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the planets have circular orbits, e is zero, so the denominator doesn't have that term. Also, the problem states that both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses (like Neptune), so M_p is much less than M_star. So 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1, so we can ignore that term. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance. Also, I think the relation involves the cube root of the period. Let me try to find the exact relation.

Wait, another approach: The RV method detects the reflex motion of the star. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( ( G * P ) / (2π c³ ) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

But maybe I can use the simplified version when M_p << M_star. So K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / (P^(1/3) ) ) * ( sin i ) / (2π c )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps another way: the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (2 * c³) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so this simplifies to K ≈ ( (27 pi G )/(2 c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But for the purposes of comparing two planets, maybe the constants will cancel out. Let's think about the ratio of K for Planet #2 to Planet #1.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of the periods, which would be P2/P1. So perhaps I can set up a ratio of K2 to K1 and find the relationship.

Given that both stars have the same mass (M), and the planets have masses similar to Neptune, but the problem states that both have same masses, so M_p1 = M_p2. Wait, wait. Wait, no. The question states that both planets have masses similar to that of Neptune. But does that mean their masses are the same? The problem says "masses similar to that of Neptune" but doesn't specify they are identical. However, for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the mass ratio M_p2/M_p1 is 1, since both are similar to Neptune. So M_p = same for both.

So, K2/K1 = ( (M_p sin i2) / (M sin i1) ) * (P1 / P2)^(1/3) )

Wait, but if the inclination angles i are the same, which I think they are not necessarily, but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we can assume sin i is the same for both? Or perhaps it doesn't matter because it's a ratio.

Wait, the problem says that the shift in spectral lines is given for each. So K2 is 7 milliangstroms and K1 is 5. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

So,

K2/K1 = ( (M_p2 sin i2) / (M_p1 sin i1) ) * (P1/P2)^(1/3) ) * ( M^{2/3} )^{-1} because in the denominator for both, but since M is same for both stars, it cancels out.

Wait, no. Let me write it again correctly.

In the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M^(2/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ) * (sin i).

So, K ∝ (M_p) * (1/(M^(2/3))) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) * sin i.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to take the ratio:

K2/K1 = [ (M_p2) / (M_p1) ) * ( sin i2 / sin i1 ) ) ] * [ (P1 / P2)^(1/3) ) ] * [ ( M1^{2/3} ) / ( M2^{2/3} ) ) ]

But since M1 = M2, the M terms cancel. So,

K2/K1 = ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) * ( sin i2 / sin i1 ) * ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Assuming that the inclination angles are the same, sin i2 / sin i1 = 1. Also, the problem states both have masses similar to Neptune. So perhaps M_p2 ≈ M_p1, so their ratio is 1.

So, K2/K1 ≈ (P1 / P2 )^(1/3)

So, rearranging,

( P1 / P2 )^(1/3) = K2/K1

Wait, wait. Wait, (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3) ?

Wait, let me re-examine the formula. From K = ( (G * M_p )/(4 pi² M_star) )^(1/3) * ( 1/(P^(1/3)) ) )

Wait, K is proportional to ( M_p / M_star^(2/3) ) * ( 1 / P^(1/3) )

So, K = constant * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

So, for two planets,

K1 = k * (M_p1) / (M^(2/3)) * (1/P1^(1/3) )

K2 = k * (M_p2) / (M^(2/3)) * (1/P2^(1/3) )

Taking the ratio K2/K1,

= (M_p2 / M_p1) * (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

But since M_p2 ≈ M_p1 (same mass), that term is 1.

So,

K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

We have K2 =7, K1=5. So,

7/5 = (P1/P2 )^(1/3 )

Wait, no. Wait, K2 is 7 and K1 is5. So K2/K1 =7/5=1.4.

So,

1.4 = ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

To find P2/P1, let's take both sides to the power of 3.

(1.4)^3 = P1 / P2

So,

P1/P2 = (1.4)^3

Compute (1.4)^3: 1.4 *1.4=1.96, 1.96*1.4=2.744

So,

P1/P2 = 2.744

So,

P2/P1 = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3645

So, the period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is Planet #2's period than Planet #1's. So if P2 is about 0.36 * P1, that means Planet #2's period is shorter. Wait, so the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 < P1, then the ratio is less than 1. So if the period of P2 is 0.36 times P1, then the period of P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So P2/P1 is 0.36. So the answer is 0.36 times as long, meaning it's shorter.

Wait, but the question asks "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is shorter, it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer is 0.36 times. So option A is ~0.36, which is the correct answer.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, another approach: the formula linking K and P is K = ( (v) ) = ( (2 pi G ) / (c³ ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i)/( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

Again, since M_p << M_star, we can approximate (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ≈ M_star^(2/3). So,

K ≈ ( (2 pi G ) / c³ )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / M_star^(2/3) ) * 1/(P^(1/3) )

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So, since M_p for both planets are the same (same mass as Neptune), and M_star is same for both stars, the ratio K2/K1 is inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of P2 to P1.

Wait, let me write the ratio again:

K2/K1 = ( ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) * ( M_star1 / M_star2 )^(2/3) ) * ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3) )

But since M_p2 = M_p1 and M_star1 = M_star2, this simplifies to:

K2/K1 = ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

So,

7/5 = ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Which gives P1/P2 = (7/5)^3 = 343/125 = approx 2.744. 

So P2 is 1/2.744 times P1, which is approximately 0.364 times. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. 

The question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So the answer is approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{M_{\text{star}}^{2/3}} \cdot \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

where \( M_p \) is the planet's mass, \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the star's mass, and \( P \) is the orbital period. Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have masses similar to Neptune, the ratio of \( K \) for the two planets depends only on the cube root of the inverse of their orbital periods:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
\]

Substituting into the equation:

\[
1.4 = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Raising both sides to the power of 3:

\[
\left(1.4\right)^3 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = 2.744
\]

To find how many times longer \( P_2 \) is than \( P_1 \), we take the reciprocal:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{1}{2.744} \approx 0.36
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of Planet #1. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~0.36**

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance. 

Wait, the formula I think I need is the one that relates the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period and other factors. The formula is K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / (4π²) )^(1/3) * ( (1) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) ) * ( sin i ) / (P^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the planets have circular orbits, e is zero, so the denominator doesn't have that term. Also, the problem states that both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses (like Neptune), so M_p is much less than M_star. So 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1, so we can ignore that term.

But maybe I can use the simplified version when M_p << M_star. So K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / (P^(1/3) ) ) * ( sin i ) / (2π c )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps another way: the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (2 * c³) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so this simplifies to K ≈ ( (27 pi G )/(2 c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But for the purposes of comparing two planets, maybe the constants will cancel out. Let's think about the ratio of K for Planet #2 to Planet #1.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of the periods, which would be P2/P1. So perhaps I can set up a ratio of K2 to K1 and find the relationship.

Given that both stars have the same mass (M), and the planets have masses similar to Neptune, but the problem states that both have same masses, so M_p1 = M_p2. Wait, wait. Wait, no. The question states that both planets have masses similar to that of Neptune. But does that mean their masses are the same? The problem says "masses similar to that of Neptune" but doesn't specify they are identical. However, for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the mass ratio M_p2/M_p1 is 1, since both are similar to Neptune. So M_p = same for both.

So, K2/K1 = ( (M_p sin i2) / (M sin i1) ) * (P1 / P2)^(1/3) )

Wait, but if the inclination angles i are the same, which I think they are not necessarily, but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we can assume sin i is the same for both? Or perhaps it doesn't matter because it's a ratio.

Wait, the problem says that the shift in spectral lines is given for each. So K2 is 7 milliangstroms and K1 is 5. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

So,

K2/K1 = ( (M_p2 sin i2) / (M_p1 sin i1) ) * (P1/P2)^(1/3) ) * ( M^{2/3} )^{-1} because in the denominator for both, but since M is same for both stars, it cancels out.

Wait, no. Let me write it again correctly.

In the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M^(2/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ) * (sin i).

So, K ∝ (M_p) * (1/(M^(2/3))) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) * sin i.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to take the ratio:

K2/K1 = [ (M_p2) / (M_p1) ) * ( sin i2 / sin i1 ) ) ] * [ (P1 / P2)^(1/3) ) ] * [ ( M1^{2/3} ) / ( M2^{2/3} ) ) ]

But since M1 = M2, the M terms cancel. So,

K2/K1 = ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) * ( sin i2 / sin i1 ) * ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Assuming that the inclination angles are the same, sin i2 / sin i1 = 1. Also, the problem states both have masses similar to Neptune. So perhaps M_p2 ≈ M_p1, so their ratio is 1.

So, K2/K1 ≈ (P1 / P2 )^(1/3)

So, rearranging,

( P1 / P2 )^(1/3) = K2/K1

Wait, wait. Wait, (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3) ?

Wait, let me re-examine the formula. From K = ( (G * M_p )/(4 pi² M_star) )^(1/3) * ( 1/(P^(1/3)) ) )

Wait, K is proportional to ( M_p / M_star^(2/3) ) * ( 1 / P^(1/3) )

So, K = constant * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

So, for two planets,

K1 = k * (M_p1) / (M^(2/3)) * (1/P1^(1/3) )

K2 = k * (M_p2) / (M^(2/3)) * (1/P2^(1/3) )

Taking the ratio K2/K1,

= (M_p2 / M_p1) * (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

But since M_p2 ≈ M_p1 (same mass), that term is 1.

So,

K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

We have K2 =7, K1=5. So,

7/5 = (P1/P2 )^(1/3 )

Wait, no. Wait, K2 is 7 and K1 is5. So K2/K1 =7/5=1.4.

So,

1.4 = ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

To find P2/P1, let's take both sides to the power of 3.

(1.4)^3 = P1 / P2

So,

P1/P2 = (1.4)^3

Compute (1.4)^3: 1.4 *1.4=1.96, 1.96*1.4=2.744

So,

P1/P2 = 2.744

So,

P2/P1 = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3645

So, the period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is Planet #2's period than Planet #1's. So if P2 is about 0.36 * P1, that means Planet #2's period is shorter. Wait, so the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 < P1, then the ratio is less than 1. So if the period of P2 is 0.36 times P1, then the period of P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So P2/P1 is 0.36. So the answer is 0.36 times as long, meaning it's shorter.

Wait, but the question asks "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is shorter, it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer is 0.36 times. So option A is ~0.36, which is the correct answer.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, another approach: the formula linking K and P is K = ( (v) ) = ( (2 pi G ) / (c³ ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i)/( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

Again, since M_p << M_star, we can approximate (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ≈ M_star^(2/3). So,

K ≈ ( (2 pi G ) / c³ )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / M_star^(2/3) ) * 1/(P^(1/3) )

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So, since M_p for both planets are the same (same mass as Neptune), and M_star is same for both stars, the ratio K2/K1 is inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of P2 to P1.

Wait, let me write the ratio again:

K2/K1 = ( ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) * ( M_star1 / M_star2 )^(2/3) ) * ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3) )

But since M_p2 = M_p1 and M_star1 = M_star2, this simplifies to:

K2/K1 = ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

So,

7/5 = ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Which gives P1/P2 = (7/5)^3 = 343/125 = approx 2.744. 

So P2 is 1/2.744 times P1, which is approximately 0.364 times. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. 

The question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So the answer is approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{M_{\text{star}}^{2/3}} \cdot \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

where \( M_p \) is the planet's mass, \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the star's mass, and \( P \) is the orbital period. Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have masses similar to Neptune, the ratio of \( K \) for the two planets depends only on the cube root of the inverse of their orbital periods:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
\]

Substituting into the equation:

\[
1.4 = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Raising both sides to the power of 3:

\[
\left(1.4\right)^3 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = 2.744
\]

To find how many times longer \( P_2 \) is than \( P_1 \), we take the reciprocal:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{1}{2.744} \approx 0.36
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of Planet #1. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~0.36**

Answer: A
