Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But the probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says that Planet_1 and Planet_2 have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right? Because a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit, closer in.

Both stars have the same radius, but their masses differ. The host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. Oh wait, but same radius. Interesting.

The probability of a transit depends on the alignment, but for a given planet and star, the main factor is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Wait, no, wait. The transit probability is actually higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But the probability isn't just based on that alignment; it also relates to the size of the star.

Wait, I think the formula for the transit probability is (R_planet + R_star) / a_planet, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's more about the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbit. Let me think. Oh right, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_orbital)^2, but wait, no, maybe it's (R_star / a_orbital). Because the transit occurs when the planet's path crosses our line of sight, and the area it can block is a function of the star's size relative to the planet's orbit.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up the transit probability formula. Oh right, the probability P that a planet transits its star is approximately P = (R_star / a_orbital) * (1 + sin(i)), where i is the inclination. But wait, no, that's more about the chance alignment. No, wait, more accurately, the probability is the ratio of the area where the planet's path would cross our line of sight (which is like a chord of the star's disk) to the entire possible path. So the probability is (R_star / a_orbital)^2, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, I remember that the geometric probability of a transit is given by (R*/a)^2, where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis. But wait, that's the formula for the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits. So the higher (R*/a), the higher the probability. Because if a is small, meaning the planet is close to the star, then R*/a is larger, so higher probability.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if a planet is closer, the area it can block is a larger proportion of the star's disk, so more likely that the alignment is right for a transit.

So the transit probability P is proportional to (R* / a)^2. But wait, does that sound right? Another thought: the transit probability is (R* / a)^2 multiplied by something else, like the eccentricity or other factors. But in this case, both planets have circular orbits, so eccentricity is zero. So it's just (R* / a)^2.

Wait, but wait. Let's think. The probability of a transit is the ratio between the star's disk area and the area of the planet's path. No, that's not quite right. Alternatively, the transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital radius, squared. Hmm.

Wait, I think the correct formula is that the probability is (R*/a) * (something). Or maybe it's (R*/a) multiplied by 1/(1 - e^2)^0.5, but since e is zero, that part doesn't matter.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (R*/a) * (1 + sin(i)), but that can't be right because i is the inclination. Oh no, wait, the probability is actually given by (R* / a) / (1 + (a / R* sin θ)), but maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me simplify.

Alternatively, the geometric transit probability is (R*/a)^2. Because the area blocked is π R_p^2, but the area of the star is π R_*^2. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: The probability P that a planet transits is given by (R* sin i) / a, but for a randomly oriented orbit, the average is the integral over all possible i. Wait, no, maybe. Alternatively, the probability is (R* / a) * (1 + (b)), where b is the impact parameter. But the average impact parameter for random inclinations would be something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, for a circular orbit, the probability that a transit occurs is approximately (R* / a). Because the planet must pass within the star's disk. The area where this can happen is a circle, and the area that causes a transit is when the planet's path comes within R* of our line of sight. The total area is π a^2, and the favorable area is π (a - R*)^2? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The transit probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. Because if the planet is moving in a circular orbit, the chance that its path intersects our line of sight is proportional to (2 R*) / (2 a) )^2?

Wait, maybe it's simpler. The transit probability is roughly (R* / a)^2, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is (R* / a) multiplied by (1 + (R* / a))^-1. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can find a different approach. Let's think about the orbital distance. For a given star, a planet with a shorter orbital period (closer in) has a higher probability of transiting because R* / a is larger. So higher (R* / a) would mean higher probability.

So in this problem, both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has three times shorter orbital period than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star.

But the stars have the same radius. Wait, same R*, but different masses. Planet_1's star is more massive (twice as massive) as Planet_2's star, but same radius. So R* same for both stars.

So let's compute the ratio of (R* / a) for each planet. Because a is the planet's orbital radius.

Wait, the orbital period is given by Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4π²/G(M*)) a^3, where M* is the mass of the host star.

Wait, Kepler's third law in astronomical units: P^2 = a^3 / (M* + M_p), but since M_p is much smaller, we can approximate P^2 ≈ a^3 / M*.

So for each planet, P1 is three times shorter than P2. So P1 = P2 /3.

So, (P1)^2 = (P2/3)^2 = (P2^2)/9.

But according to Kepler's law, P^2 ∝ a^3 / M*.

So for Planet_1: P1^2 = a1^3 / M1.

For Planet_2: P2^2 = a2^3 / M2.

Given that M1 = 2 M2.

So substituting, (P1^2) = (a1^3) / (2 M2)

And (P2^2) = (a2^3) / (M2)

Divide the first equation by the second:

(P1^2) / (P2^2) = [ (a1^3)/(2 M2) ] / [ (a2^3)/(M2) ) ]

Which simplifies to (P1^2)/(P2^2) = (a1^3)/(2 a2^3)

But since P1 = P2 /3, P1^2 = (P2^2)/9.

So (1/9) = (a1^3)/(2 a2^3)

Multiply both sides by 2 a2^3:

2 a2^3 / 9 = a1^3

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3

Take cube roots: a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * (0.222)^(0.333) ≈ a2 * 0.6.

Wait, 2/9 is approximately 0.222, and the cube root is about 0.6. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period.

Now, for the transit probability, which is proportional to (R* / a)^2. Since R* is same for both stars (given), the probability is proportional to (1/a)^2.

So P1 ∝ (1/a1)^2, and P2 ∝ (1/a2)^2.

So the ratio of probabilities P1/P2 = (a2^2)/(a1^2).

Because (1/a1)^2 = (1/(0.6 a2))^2 = (1/(a2))^2 * (1/0.36) ≈ (1/a2^2) * 2.777.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute P1 and P2.

P1 = (R*/a1)^2.

P2 = (R*/a2)^2.

So P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2.

From earlier, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

So a2/a1 = 1 / (2/9)^(1/3) ) = (9/2)^(1/3).

What's (9/2)^(1/3)? 9 is 3^2, 2 is 2^1. So 9/2 = 4.5. The cube root of 4.5 is about 1.65, because 1.6^3 is 4.096, 1.65^3 is approximately 4.49, which is close to 4.5.

So a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

So P1/P2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

Wait no, that would be if P1 is larger. Wait, no, wait. Because a1 is smaller than a2, so 1/a1 is larger than 1/a2, so (R*/a1)^2 is larger than (R*/a2)^2. So P1 is larger than P2.

Wait, but let me double-check. Since a1 is smaller, 1/a1 is bigger, so (R*/a1)^2 is bigger, making P1 bigger than P2.

Wait, but according to the ratio above, P1 is about 2.7 times P2. So the probability for Planet_1 is about 2.7 times higher than Planet_2. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking back at the options:

Option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

So the answer would be D.

Wait, but wait. Wait, let me think again. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake with the ratio.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

So a2/a1 = [ (9/2) ]^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So the ratio P1/P2 is (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1 is about 2.7 times P2.

Therefore, Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting, so researchers should choose Planet_1.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the transit probability is (R*/a) * (something else?), like considering the orbital plane. But in this case, given that the masses are same and both have circular orbits, I think the initial approach is correct.

So the correct answer is D, researchers chose Planet_1 because it has a ~2.7 times higher probability.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given parameters. The transit probability is proportional to \((R_*/a)^2\), where \(R_*\) is the radius of the host star and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius (\(R_*\)), the probability depends on the ratio \(1/a^2\). A smaller \(a\) (closer orbit) results in a higher transit probability.

### Step 1: Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's third law, \(P^2 \propto a^3 / M_*\), where \(P\) is the orbital period and \(M_*\) is the mass of the host star, we relate the orbital periods and semi-major axes of the two planets:
- Planet_1 has an orbital period \(P_1 = P_2 / 3\), meaning its orbit is three times shorter than Planet_2's.
- The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as that of Planet_2 (\(M_1 = 2M_2\)).

From Kepler's law:
\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_1}{a_2^3 / M_2}
\]
Substituting \(P_1 = P_2 / 3\) and \(M_1 = 2M_2\):
\[
\frac{(P_2 / 3)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / (2M_2)}{a_2^3 / M_2}
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}
\]
\[
a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9}a_2^3
\]
Taking the cube root:
\[
a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx a_2 \cdot 0.6
\]
Thus, \(a_1\) is approximately 0.6 times \(a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \((R_*/a)^2\). Since \(R_*\) is the same for both stars, the ratio of probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]
Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.6a_2\):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{0.6a_2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.6}\right)^2 \approx 1.65^2 \approx 2.72
\]
Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a significantly higher transit probability, the researchers prefer to observe Planet_1.

So in this problem, both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has three times shorter orbital period than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star.

But the stars have the same radius. Wait, same R*, but different masses. Planet_1's star is more massive (twice as massive) as Planet_2's star, but same radius. So R* same for both stars.

So let's compute the ratio of (R* / a) for each planet. Because a is the planet's orbital radius.

Wait, the orbital period is given by Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4π²/G(M*)) a^3, where M* is the mass of the host star.

Wait, Kepler's third law in astronomical units: P^2 = a^3 / (M* + M_p), but since M_p is much smaller, we can approximate P^2 ≈ a^3 / M*.

So for each planet, P1 is three times shorter than P2. So P1 = P2 /3.

So, (P1)^2 = (P2/3)^2 = (P2^2)/9.

But according to Kepler's law, P^2 ∝ a^3 / M*.

So for Planet_1: P1^2 = a1^3 / M1.

For Planet_2: P2^2 = a2^3 / M2.

Given that M1 = 2 M2.

So substituting, (P1^2) = (a1^3) / (2 M2)

And (P2^2) = (a2^3) / (M2)

Divide the first equation by the second:

(P1^2) / (P2^2) = [ (a1^3)/(2 M2) ] / [ (a2^3)/(M2) ) ]

Which simplifies to (P1^2)/(P2^2) = (a1^3)/(2 a2^3)

But since P1 = P2 /3, P1^2 = (P2^2)/9.

So (1/9) = (a1^3)/(2 a2^3)

Multiply both sides by 2 a2^3:

2 a2^3 / 9 = a1^3

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3

Take cube roots: a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * (0.222)^(0.333) ≈ a2 * 0.6.

Wait, 2/9 is approximately 0.222, and the cube root is about 0.6. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period.

Now, for the transit probability, which is proportional to (R* / a)^2. Since R* is same for both stars (given), the probability is proportional to (1/a)^2.

So P1 ∝ (1/a1)^2, and P2 ∝ (1/a2)^2.

So the ratio of probabilities P1/P2 = (a2^2)/(a1^2).

Because (1/a1)^2 = (1/(0.6 a2))^2 = (1/(a2))^2 * (1/0.36) ≈ (1/a2^2) * 2.777.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute P1 and P2.

P1 = (R*/a1)^2.

P2 = (R*/a2)^2.

So P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2.

From earlier, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

So a2/a1 = 1 / (2/9)^(1/3) ) = (9/2)^(1/3).

What's (9/2)^(1/3)? 9 is 3^2, 2 is 2^1. So 9/2 = 4.5. The cube root of 4.5 is about 1.65, because 1.6^3 is 4.096, 1.65^3 is approximately 4.49, which is close to 4.5.

So a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

So P1/P2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

Wait no, that would be if P1 is larger. Wait, no, wait. Because a1 is smaller than a2, so 1/a1 is larger than 1/a2, so (R*/a1)^2 is larger than (R*/a2)^2. So P1 is larger than P2.

Wait, but let me double-check. Since a1 is smaller, 1/a1 is bigger, so (R*/a1)^2 is bigger, making P1 bigger than P2.

Wait, but according to the ratio above, P1 is about 2.7 times P2. So the probability for Planet_1 is about 2.7 times higher than Planet_2. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking back at the options:

Option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

So the answer would be D.

Wait, but wait. Wait, let me think again. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake with the ratio.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

So a2/a1 = [ (9/2) ]^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So the ratio P1/P2 is (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1 is about 2.7 times P2.

Therefore, Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting, so researchers should choose Planet_1.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the transit probability is (R*/a) * (something else?), like considering the orbital plane. But in this case, given that the masses are same and both have circular orbits, I think the initial approach is correct.

So the correct answer is D, researchers chose Planet_1 because it has a ~2.7 times higher probability.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given parameters. The transit probability is proportional to \((R_*/a)^2\), where \(R_*\) is the radius of the host star and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius (\(R_*\)), the probability depends on the ratio \(1/a^2\). A smaller \(a\) (closer orbit) results in a higher transit probability.

### Step 1: Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's third law, \(P^2 \propto a^3 / M_*\), where \(P\) is the orbital period and \(M_*\) is the mass of the host star, we relate the orbital periods and semi-major axes of the two planets:
- Planet_1 has an orbital period \(P_1 = P_2 / 3\), meaning its orbit is three times shorter than Planet_2's.
- The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as that of Planet_2 (\(M_1 = 2M_2\)).

From Kepler's law:
\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_1}{a_2^3 / M_2}
\]
Substituting \(P_1 = P_2 / 3\) and \(M_1 = 2M_2\):
\[
\frac{(P_2 / 3)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / (2M_2)}{a_2^3 / M_2}
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}
\]
\[
a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9}a_2^3
\]
Taking the cube root:
\[
a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx a_2 \cdot 0.6
\]
Thus, \(a_1\) is approximately 0.6 times \(a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \((R_*/a)^2\). Since \(R_*\) is the same for both stars, the ratio of probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]
Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.6a_2\):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{0.6a_2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.6}\right)^2 \approx 1.65^2 \approx 2.72
\]
Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a significantly higher transit probability, the researchers prefer to observe Planet_1.

Answer: D
