Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question gives me a meson X with production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different values in meters. 

Wait, what do I remember about meson decay? I think mesons are subatomic particles, and their decay distance is related to their lifetime. Oh right, the mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So the formula probably involves the lifetime multiplied by the speed of the particle.

The formula I remember is decay length L = γ * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime. But wait, in particle physics, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. Oh right, Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime τ is connected via the uncertainty principle. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, units—Gamma is in MeV, and ħ is in J·s or something like that. So I need to handle the units carefully.

First, let me get the proper lifetime τ. Since Γ is the decay width, τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. But wait, there’s a factor here. I think Γ is the total decay rate, which has units of energy. So Γ in GeV would be the same as GeV/ (must convert to appropriate units).

But wait, another approach: the mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the decay width Γ. So τ = ħ / (Γ c^2) ? Or perhaps it's τ = ħ/(Γ). Let me think. The natural units are used in particle physics, so Γ is in GeV, ħ is in GeV·s. So τ has units of seconds.

So let's compute τ first. The width Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ. 

Wait, what's ħ in GeV·s? I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Let me confirm that. Yes, because 1 GeV is about 1.602e-10 J, and ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So converting ħ to GeV·s: 1.0545718e-34 J·s / 1.602e-10 J/GeV = approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Right.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. So that's the proper lifetime, τ.

Next, I need to find the particle's velocity. The production energy is E_X = 8 GeV, and the mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the energy is much higher than the rest mass. Let me find the Lorentz factor γ. 

The relativistic energy formula is E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). But since E and m are both in GeV, and c is 1 in natural units (GeV, seconds), so γ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So γ is about 6.6667. But wait, I might need to be more precise. 8 divided by 1.2 is 20/3, which is about 6.6667.

The velocity β can be found from γ. The relation between γ and β is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So solving for β:

γ² = 1/(1 - β²) → β² = 1 - 1/γ².

So β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (20/3)^2 ))) → let's compute that.

(20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/ γ² is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887. Therefore, the velocity v is approximately 0.9887c.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, another formula for velocity in terms of gamma: β = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)} ). Since E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2. Then, p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2) ) / c. But in natural units where c=1, p = sqrt( E² - m² ), so beta is p c / E, which is beta = sqrt( E² - m^2 ) / E. So beta = sqrt( (8^2 - 1.2^2 ) ) /8. Let me compute that.

8^2 is 64, 1.2^2 is 1.44. 64 -1.44=62.56. sqrt(62.56)=7.91. So beta=7.91/8=0.98875. So same as before, 0.98875. So v≈0.98875c.

Now, the mean decay length L is γ c τ. Because L = v τ γ ? Wait, no. Wait, decay length is (v * τ) multiplied by gamma? Wait, I think the formula is L = gamma * c * tau. Because gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is time dilation, so the lifetime as seen in the lab is gamma * tau. Then, since c is the speed, L = v * t_lab, and t_lab = gamma tau. So L = v gamma tau. But since v is beta c, L= beta c gamma tau. Wait, but gamma can be expressed in terms of beta. Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1-beta^2). So putting it all together: L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

Wait, but wait, tau is the proper time, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So decay length L = v * (gamma tau) = beta c * gamma tau. Or, L = gamma beta c tau.

Alternatively, since gamma beta c tau can be written as gamma * c tau * beta. Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute as gamma * c tau * beta.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The mean decay length is the product of the speed of the particle, its lifetime (as observed in the lab frame), and the number of particles, but for a single particle, it's just speed multiplied by lifetime.

So L = v * t, where t is the lifetime in the lab frame. Since t = gamma tau, L = v gamma tau.

Wait, but v is beta c, so L = beta c gamma tau. Alternatively, gamma beta c tau.

But wait, in natural units, c=1, so it's easier. But since I'm working in SI units, let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute gamma beta as (gamma) * beta = gamma * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) ) = sqrt( gamma² -1 ). But wait, let's see. From gamma² = 1/(1 - beta²), so 1 - beta² = 1/gamma² → beta²=1-1/gamma² → beta= sqrt(1-1/gamma²).

So gamma beta = gamma * sqrt(1-1/gamma^2) = sqrt( gamma² (1 - 1/gamma^2) ) = sqrt( gamma² - 1 ). So yes, gamma beta = sqrt( gamma² -1 ).

But for our purposes, maybe it's easier to compute beta c gamma tau. Let's proceed step by step.

So, compute gamma beta first. Gamma is 6.6667, beta is ~0.98875. So gamma beta is 6.6667 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.6111. 

Alternatively, using the formula gamma beta = sqrt( gamma² -1 ), so gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444. Subtract 1, 43.444. sqrt(43.444) is about 6.587. Hmm, that's a bit different. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me compute gamma beta correctly. Let me compute beta again. We had E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV. So E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - m² c^4. So p = sqrt(E² - m²) / c. Since we're in natural units, c=1, so p = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c. Then, beta = (p c)/E → (7.91 GeV/c * c) / 8 GeV → 7.91/8 ≈ 0.98875. So beta is correct.

So gamma is 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma * beta is 6.6667 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.611.

So now, L = beta c gamma tau. Wait, but I think the correct formula is L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Because tau is the proper lifetime, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the particle moves at speed v = beta c for a time gamma tau, so L = v * gamma tau = beta c gamma tau.

Alternatively, L = gamma beta c tau.

So let's compute the numbers step by step.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Let's compute gamma beta c tau.

Gamma beta is approximately 6.611. c is 3e8 m/s. So putting it all together:

L = 6.611 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute this.

First, multiply 6.611 * 3e8 = 1.9833e9.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24:

1.9833e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.9833 * 2.056875 * 1e-15.

Compute 1.9833 * 2.056875.

Let me approximate this. 2 * 2.056 is approx 4.112, but more precisely:

1.9833 * 2.056875.

Let me compute 2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375. Then subtract 0.0167 * 2.056875 ≈ 0.0343. So 4.11375 - 0.0343 ≈ 4.07945. So approximately 4.07945.

So L ≈ 4.07945e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option C is 5.0223e-15. Hmm, my approximated value is 4.079e-15, which is close to option B, but perhaps I approximated gamma beta as 6.611, but let's be more precise.

Wait, perhaps I should compute without approximations. Let's recompute gamma beta.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44/64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.988714.

So gamma beta is (20/3) * 0.988714 ≈6.6666667 * 0.988714.

Let me compute 6.6666667 * 0.988714.

6 * 0.988714 = 5.932284.

0.6666667 * 0.988714 ≈ 0.6666667 * 0.988714 ≈ 0.660476.

Adding together: 5.932284 + 0.660476 ≈6.59276.

So gamma beta is approximately 6.59276.

So L = 6.59276 * c * tau.

Wait no, L = gamma beta * c * tau.

Wait, tau was 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, wait, let me recompute tau.

Tau = ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.

So tau=20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, compute L = gamma beta * c * tau.

So 6.59276 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiplying 6.59276 * 3e8 = 1.97783e9.

Then, 1.97783e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.97783 * 2.056875 * 1e-15.

Compute 1.97783 *2.056875.

Let me compute 2 * 2.056875 =4.11375.

But 1.97783 is 2 - 0.02217.

So 1.97783 *2.056875 = (2 *2.056875) - (0.02217 * 2.056875).

2*2.056875 is 4.11375.

0.02217 *2.056875 ≈0.0456.

So 4.11375 -0.0456 ≈4.06815.

So L≈4.06815e-15 meters.

Looking at the options again:

Option B is 4.0655 *10^-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223*10^-15.

Hmm. So my calculation is about 4.068e-15, which is close to option B, 4.0655e-15.

But wait, perhaps I should carry more precise calculations to see.

Wait, let me compute 1.97783e9 * 2.056875e-24 exactly.

Wait, 1.97783e9 =1.97783 *1e9.

2.056875e-24 =2.056875 *1e-24.

So multiplying 1.97783 *2.056875: Let's compute this with more precision.

1.97783 *2.056875 =

Let me compute 2*2.056875 =4.11375.

But wait, 1.97783 is 2 - 0.02217.

So (2 -0.02217) *2.056875 = 2*2.056875 - 0.02217*2.056875.

=4.11375 - (0.02217 *2.056875 )

Computing 0.02217 *2.056875:

0.02 *2.056875 =0.0411375.

0.00217 *2.056875 ≈ 0.004466.

Total: 0.0411375 +0.004466 ≈0.0456035.

So subtracting: 4.11375 - 0.0456035 ≈4.0681465.

So the product is 4.0681465e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. The slight discrepancy might be due to more precise values for ħ or beta.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for ħ. Let me double-check that. ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, but perhaps it's more accurate.

Wait, the exact value is ħ ≈ 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. So let's see.

Tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) *1e-25 s. 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875. So tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

That's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the relativistic mean lifetime, which is gamma tau. So L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, no, the formula is L=gamma * beta * c * tau, which is the same as gamma beta c tau.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the mean lifetime is gamma tau, and the speed is beta c, so the mean decay length is L = beta c * gamma tau.

Yes, same as before.

Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma beta. Let's compute it more accurately.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.666666666666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 )= sqrt(1 -0.0225)= sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887140529.

So gamma * beta = (20/3)*0.9887140529 ≈6.666666667 *0.9887140529.

Let me compute 6.666666667 *0.9887140529.

6 *0.9887140529 = 5.932284317.

0.666666667 *0.9887140529 ≈0.660476035.

Adding together:5.932284317 +0.660476035 ≈6.59276035.

So gamma beta is approximately6.59276035.

So L =6.59276035 *3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.59276035 *3e8 =1.9778281e9.

Then, multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.9778281e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.9778281 *2.056875 )e-15.

Compute 1.9778281 *2.056875.

Let me compute this precisely.

1.9778281 *2.056875 = ?

Let me break it down:

2 *2.056875 =4.11375.

Subtract ( (2 -1.9778281) ) *2.056875.

2 -1.9778281=0.0221719.

0.0221719 *2.056875 =0.0456035.

So 4.11375 - 0.0456035=4.0681465.

So L=4.0681465e-15 meters.

So approximately 4.068e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. Maybe I should check if I used the correct tau.

Wait, let me check the calculation of tau again.

Tau is ħ divided by Gamma. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau=6.582e-25 / 0.32 =6.582 /0.32 * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so tau=20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

That's correct.

Hmm, so perhaps the exact value of gamma beta is a bit off. Let's compute gamma beta more precisely.

Gamma=20/3=6.666666666666667.

Beta= sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 )= sqrt(1 -0.0225)= sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887140529.

Gamma * beta=6.666666667 *0.9887140529.

Let me compute 6 *0.9887140529=5.932284317.

0.666666667 *0.9887140529=?

Compute 0.666666667 *0.9887140529.

0.6 *0.9887140529=0.5932284317.

0.066666667 *0.9887140529=0.0659142702.

Adding those gives 0.5932284317 +0.0659142702=0.6591427019.

So gamma beta=5.932284317 +0.6591427019=6.591427019.

So gamma beta ≈6.591427019.

So the product 6.591427019 * c * tau.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So 6.591427019 *3e8 =1.9774281057e9.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24:

1.9774281057e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.9774281057 *2.056875 )e-15.

Compute 1.9774281057 *2.056875.

Let me compute this precisely.

1.9774281057 *2.056875.

Break it down:

1.9774281057 *2 =3.9548562114.

1.9774281057 *0.056875 = ?

Compute 0.056875 = 1/17.56875, but perhaps compute step by step.

0.05 *1.9774281057=0.098871405285.

0.006875 *1.9774281057= approximately 0.0135536079.

So sum: 0.098871405285 +0.0135536079 ≈0.112425013185.

So total is 3.9548562114 +0.112425013185≈4.067281224585.

So 4.067281224585e-15 meters.

Which is approximately 4.0673e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma beta. Let me use more precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation gives 4.0655e-15.

Hmm, perhaps when I computed gamma beta, I used 6.591427 *3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.591427 * (3e8 * 2.056875e-24) =6.591427 * (6.170625e-16) )= ?

Wait, wait, 3e8 *2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16.

So 6.591427 *6.170625e-16 = ?

Compute 6 *6.170625e-16=3.702375e-15.

0.591427 *6.170625e-16≈0.591427 *6.170625e-16.

Compute 0.5 *6.170625e-16=3.0853125e-16.

0.091427 *6.170625e-16≈ approx 0.091427 *6.17e-16= approx 5.647e-17.

So total is 3.0853e-16 +5.647e-17=3.65e-16.

So 3.702375e-15 + 3.65e-16=4.067375e-15.

Which is about 4.0674e-15 meters.

So the options are:

A)5.0223e-16

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16

So our calculated value is approximately 4.0674e-15, which is very close to option B:4.0655e-15.

Perhaps the slight difference is due to more precise values in the calculation, like using more decimal places for beta or gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation using more precise values of beta and gamma would yield 4.0655e-15.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X}
\]

where \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the velocity \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \gamma \beta \)
\[
\gamma \beta = \gamma \cdot \beta = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \approx 6.5928
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \gamma \beta = 6.5928 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 6.5928 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( 6.5928 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \):

\[
6.5928 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1.97784 \times 10^9
\]

Next, multiply by \( 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
L = 1.97784 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = (1.97784 \cdot 2.056875) \times 10^{-15}
\]

Calculate \( 1.97784 \cdot 2.056875 \):

\[
1.97784 \cdot 2.056875 \approx 4.0673
\]

Thus:

\[
L \approx 4.0673 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 6: Compare with the options

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question gives me a meson X with production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different values in meters. 

Wait, what do I remember about meson decay? I think mesons are subatomic particles, and their decay distance is related to their lifetime. Oh right, the mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So the formula probably involves the lifetime multiplied by the speed of the particle.

The formula I remember is decay length L = γ * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime. But wait, in particle physics, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. Oh right, Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime τ is connected via the uncertainty principle. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, units—Gamma is in MeV, and ħ is in J·s or something like that. So I need to handle the units carefully.

First, let me get the proper lifetime τ. Since Γ is the decay width, τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. But wait, there’s a factor here. I think Γ is the total decay rate, which has units of energy. So Γ in GeV would be the same as GeV/ (must convert to appropriate units).

But wait, another approach: the mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the decay width Γ. So τ = ħ / (Γ c^2) ? Or perhaps it's τ = ħ/(Γ). Let me think. The natural units are used in particle physics, so Γ is in GeV, ħ is in GeV·s. So τ has units of seconds.

So let's compute τ first. The width Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ. 

Wait, what's ħ in GeV·s? I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Let me confirm that. Yes, because 1 GeV is about 1.602e-10 J, and ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So converting ħ to GeV·s: 1.0545718e-34 J·s / 1.602e-10 J/GeV = approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Right.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. So that's the proper lifetime, τ.

Next, I need to find the particle's velocity. The production energy is E_X = 8 GeV, and the mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the energy is much higher than the rest mass. Let me find the Lorentz factor γ. 

The relativistic energy formula is E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). But since E and m are both in GeV, and c is 1 in natural units (GeV, seconds), so γ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So γ is about 6.6667. But wait, I might need to be more precise. 8 divided by 1.2 is 20/3, which is about 6.6667.

The velocity β can be found from γ. The relation between γ and β is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So solving for β:

γ² = 1/(1 - β²) → β² = 1 - 1/γ².

So β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (20/3)^2 ))) → let's compute that.

(20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/ γ² is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887. Therefore, the velocity v is approximately 0.9887c.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, another formula for velocity in terms of gamma: β = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)} ). Since E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2. Then, p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2) ) / c. But in natural units where c=1, p = sqrt( E² - m² ), so beta is p c / E, which is beta = sqrt( E² - m^2 ) / E. So beta = sqrt( (8^2 - 1.2^2 ) ) /8. Let me compute that.

8^2 is 64, 1.2^2 is 1.44. 64 -1.44=62.56. sqrt(62.56)=7.91. So beta=7.91/8=0.98875. So same as before, 0.98875. So v≈0.98875c.

Now, the mean decay length L is γ c τ. Because L = v τ γ ? Wait, no. Wait, decay length is (v * τ) multiplied by gamma? Wait, I think the formula is L = gamma * c * tau. Because gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is time dilation, so the lifetime as seen in the lab is gamma * tau. Then, since c is the speed, L = v * t_lab, and t_lab = gamma tau. So L = v gamma tau. But since v is beta c, L= beta c gamma tau. Wait, but gamma can be expressed in terms of beta. Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1-beta^2). So putting it all together: L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

Wait, but wait, tau is the proper time, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So decay length L = v * (gamma tau) = beta c * gamma tau. Or, L = gamma beta c tau.

Alternatively, since gamma beta c tau can be written as gamma * c tau * beta. Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute as gamma * c tau * beta.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The mean decay length is the product of the speed of the particle, its lifetime (as observed in the lab frame), and the number of particles, but for a single particle, it's just speed multiplied by lifetime.

So L = v * t, where t is the lifetime in the lab frame. Since t = gamma tau, L = v gamma tau.

Wait, but v is beta c, so L = beta c gamma tau. Alternatively, gamma beta c tau.

But wait, in natural units, c=1, so it's easier. But since I'm working in SI units, let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute gamma beta as (gamma) * beta = gamma * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) ) = sqrt( gamma² -1 ). But wait, let's see. From gamma² = 1/(1 - beta²), so 1 - beta² = 1/gamma² → beta²=1-1/gamma² → beta= sqrt(1-1/gamma²).

So gamma beta = gamma * sqrt(1-1/gamma^2) = sqrt( gamma² (1 - 1/gamma^2) ) = sqrt( gamma² - 1 ). So yes, gamma beta = sqrt( gamma² -1 ).

But for our purposes, maybe it's easier to compute beta c gamma tau. Let's proceed step by step.

So, compute gamma beta first. Gamma is 6.6667, beta is ~0.98875. So gamma beta is 6.6667 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.6111. 

Alternatively, using the formula gamma beta = sqrt( gamma² -1 ), so gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444. Subtract 1, 43.444. sqrt(43.444) is about 6.587. Hmm, that's a bit different. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me compute gamma beta correctly. Let me compute beta again. We had E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV. So E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - m² c^4. So p = sqrt(E² - m²) / c. Since we're in natural units, c=1, so p = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c. Then, beta = (p c)/E → (7.91 GeV/c * c) / 8 GeV → 7.91/8 ≈ 0.98875. So beta is correct.

So gamma is 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma * beta is 6.6667 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.611.

So now, L = beta c gamma tau. Wait, but I think the correct formula is L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Because tau is the proper lifetime, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the particle moves at speed v = beta c for a time gamma tau, so L = v * gamma tau = beta c gamma tau.

Alternatively, L = gamma beta c tau.

So let's compute the numbers step by step.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Let's compute gamma beta c tau.

Gamma beta is approximately 6.611. c is 3e8 m/s. So putting it all together:

L = 6.611 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute this.

First, multiply 6.611 * 3e8 = 1.9833e9.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24:

1.9833e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.9833 * 2.056875 * 1e-15.

Compute 1.9833 * 2.056875.

Let me approximate this. 2 * 2.056 is approx 4.112, but more precisely:

1.9833 * 2.056875.

Let me compute 2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375. Then subtract 0.0167 * 2.056875 ≈ 0.0343. So 4.11375 - 0.0343 ≈ 4.07945. So approximately 4.07945.

So L ≈ 4.07945e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option C is 5.0223e-15. Hmm, my approximated value is 4.079e-15, which is close to option B, but perhaps I approximated gamma beta as 6.611, but let's be more precise.

Wait, perhaps I should compute without approximations. Let's recompute gamma beta.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44/64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.988714.

So gamma beta is (20/3) * 0.988714 ≈6.6666667 * 0.988714.

Let me compute 6.6666667 * 0.988714.

6 * 0.988714 = 5.932284.

0.6666667 * 0.988714 ≈ 0.6666667 * 0.988714 ≈ 0.660476.

Adding together: 5.932284 + 0.660476 ≈6.59276.

So gamma beta is approximately 6.59276.

So L = 6.59276 * c * tau.

Wait no, L = gamma beta * c * tau.

Wait, tau was 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, wait, let me recompute tau.

Tau = ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.

So tau=20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, compute L = gamma beta * c * tau.

So 6.59276 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiplying 6.59276 * 3e8 = 1.97783e9.

Then, 1.97783e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.97783 * 2.056875 * 1e-15.

Compute 1.97783 *2.056875.

Let me compute 2 * 2.056875 =4.11375.

But 1.97783 is 2 - 0.02217.

So 1.97783 *2.056875 = (2 *2.056875) - (0.02217 * 2.056875).

2*2.056875 is 4.11375.

0.02217 *2.056875 ≈0.0456.

So 4.11375 -0.0456 ≈4.06815.

So L≈4.06815e-15 meters.

Looking at the options again:

Option B is 4.0655 *10^-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223*10^-15.

Hmm. So my calculation is about 4.068e-15, which is close to option B, 4.0655e-15.

But wait, perhaps I should carry more precise calculations to see.

Wait, let me compute 1.97783e9 * 2.056875e-24 exactly.

Wait, 1.97783e9 =1.97783 *1e9.

2.056875e-24 =2.056875 *1e-24.

So multiplying 1.97783 *2.056875: Let's compute this with more precision.

1.97783 *2.056875 =

Let me compute 2*2.056875 =4.11375.

But wait, 1.97783 is 2 - 0.02217.

So (2 -0.02217) *2.056875 = 2*2.056875 - 0.02217*2.056875.

=4.11375 - (0.02217 *2.056875 )

Computing 0.02217 *2.056875:

0.02 *2.056875 =0.0411375.

0.00217 *2.056875 ≈ 0.004466.

Total: 0.0411375 +0.004466 ≈0.0456035.

So subtracting: 4.11375 - 0.0456035 ≈4.0681465.

So the product is 4.0681465e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. The slight discrepancy might be due to more precise values for ħ or beta.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for ħ. Let me double-check that. ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, but perhaps it's more accurate.

Wait, the exact value is ħ ≈ 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. So let's see.

Tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) *1e-25 s. 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875. So tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

That's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the relativistic mean lifetime, which is gamma tau. So L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, no, the formula is L=gamma * beta * c * tau, which is the same as gamma beta c tau.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the mean lifetime is gamma tau, and the speed is beta c, so the mean decay length is L = beta c * gamma tau.

Yes, same as before.

Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma beta. Let's compute it more accurately.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.666666666666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 )= sqrt(1 -0.0225)= sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887140529.

So gamma * beta = (20/3)*0.9887140529 ≈6.666666667 *0.9887140529.

Let me compute 6.666666667 *0.9887140529.

6 *0.9887140529 = 5.932284317.

0.666666667 *0.9887140529 ≈0.660476035.

Adding together:5.932284317 +0.660476035 ≈6.59276035.

So gamma beta is approximately6.59276035.

So L =6.59276035 *3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.59276035 *3e8 =1.9778281e9.

Then, multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.9778281e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.9778281 *2.056875 )e-15.

Compute 1.9778281 *2.056875.

Let me compute this precisely.

1.9778281 *2.056875 = ?

Let me break it down:

2 *2.056875 =4.11375.

Subtract ( (2 -1.9778281) ) *2.056875.

2 -1.9778281=0.0221719.

0.0221719 *2.056875 =0.0456035.

So 4.11375 - 0.0456035=4.0681465.

So L=4.0681465e-15 meters.

So approximately 4.068e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. Maybe I should check if I used the correct tau.

Wait, let me check the calculation of tau again.

Tau is ħ divided by Gamma. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau=6.582e-25 / 0.32 =6.582 /0.32 * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so tau=20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

That's correct.

Hmm, so perhaps the exact value of gamma beta is a bit off. Let's compute gamma beta more precisely.

Gamma=20/3=6.666666666666667.

Beta= sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 )= sqrt(1 -0.0225)= sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887140529.

Gamma * beta=6.666666667 *0.9887140529.

Let me compute 6 *0.9887140529=5.932284317.

0.666666667 *0.9887140529=?

Compute 0.666666667 *0.9887140529.

0.6 *0.9887140529=0.5932284317.

0.066666667 *0.9887140529=0.0659142702.

Adding those gives 0.5932284317 +0.0659142702=0.6591427019.

So gamma beta=5.932284317 +0.6591427019=6.591427019.

So gamma beta ≈6.591427019.

So the product 6.591427019 * c * tau.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So 6.591427019 *3e8 =1.9774281057e9.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24:

1.9774281057e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.9774281057 *2.056875 )e-15.

Compute 1.9774281057 *2.056875.

Let me compute this precisely.

1.9774281057 *2.056875.

Break it down:

1.9774281057 *2 =3.9548562114.

1.9774281057 *0.056875 = ?

Compute 0.056875 = 1/17.56875, but perhaps compute step by step.

0.05 *1.9774281057=0.098871405285.

0.006875 *1.9774281057= approximately 0.0135536079.

So sum: 0.098871405285 +0.0135536079 ≈0.112425013185.

So total is 3.9548562114 +0.112425013185≈4.067281224585.

So 4.067281224585e-15 meters.

Which is approximately 4.0673e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma beta. Let me use more precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation gives 4.0655e-15.

Hmm, perhaps when I computed gamma beta, I used 6.591427 *3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.591427 * (3e8 * 2.056875e-24) =6.591427 * (6.170625e-16) )= ?

Wait, wait, 3e8 *2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16.

So 6.591427 *6.170625e-16 = ?

Compute 6 *6.170625e-16=3.702375e-15.

0.591427 *6.170625e-16≈0.591427 *6.170625e-16.

Compute 0.5 *6.170625e-16=3.0853125e-16.

0.091427 *6.170625e-16≈ approx 0.091427 *6.17e-16= approx 5.647e-17.

So total is 3.0853e-16 +5.647e-17=3.65e-16.

So 3.702375e-15 + 3.65e-16=4.067375e-15.

Which is about 4.0674e-15 meters.

So the options are:

A)5.0223e-16

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16

So our calculated value is approximately 4.0674e-15, which is very close to option B:4.0655e-15.

Perhaps the slight difference is due to more precise values in the calculation, like using more decimal places for beta or gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation using more precise values of beta and gamma would yield 4.0655e-15.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X}
\]

where \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the velocity \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \gamma \beta \)
\[
\gamma \beta = \gamma \cdot \beta = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \approx 6.5928
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \gamma \beta = 6.5928 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 6.5928 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( 6.5928 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \):

\[
6.5928 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1.97784 \times 10^9
\]

Next, multiply by \( 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
L = 1.97784 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = (1.97784 \cdot 2.056875) \times 10^{-15}
\]

Calculate \( 1.97784 \cdot 2.056875 \):

\[
1.97784 \cdot 2.056875 \approx 4.0673
\]

Thus:

\[
L \approx 4.0673 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]
