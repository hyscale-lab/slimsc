Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the problem again and see what it's asking.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which means that the eigenstates of P_z are our basis here.

I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²), where A is the operator. So in this case, A is P_z.

But wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of P_z. So the expectation value of P_z might not be zero, and the expectation value of P_z squared will give us the average of its square. Then we can compute the uncertainty.

First, I need to find the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. Let me write down the matrix form of P_z as given. P_z is a 3x3 matrix:

Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)

So the matrix looks diagonal because it's already in the basis of its eigenvectors. That's helpful because taking the expectation value might be straightforward.

The state vector is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ]. So it's a column vector with three components. Let me denote the components as ψ₁, ψ₂, ψ₃.

To compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can calculate ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward.

The diagonal elements of P_z are:
- P_z(1,1) = ħ
- P_z(2,2) = 0
- P_z(3,3) = -ħ

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ₁* * P_z(1,1) * ψ₁ + ψ₂* * P_z(2,2) * ψ₂ + ψ₃* * P_z(3,3) * ψ₃.

Let me plug in the values. The state components are ψ₁ = -1/2, ψ₂ = 1/√2, ψ₃ = -1/2. Are these complex? The given state seems to have real components, so their conjugates are the same.

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ + ( (1/√2)^2 ) * 0 + ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (-ħ)

Calculate each term:

First term: (1/4) * ħ
Second term: 0
Third term: (1/4) * (-ħ) = -ħ/4

Adding them up: (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) ) = 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That's interesting.

Now, I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is already diagonal, P_z squared is also diagonal, with each diagonal element squared. So P_z² has diagonal entries (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2, which are ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ψ† P_z² ψ.

Calculating each term:

First term: ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (ħ²) = (1/4) * ħ²
Second term: (1/√2)^2 * 0 = 0
Third term: ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (ħ²) = (1/4) * ħ²

Adding them up: (1/4 + 0 + 1/4) * ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this simplifies to sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), option C is ħ/2. Hmm. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through it again.

The state is |ψ⟩ = [ a, b, c ]^T where a= -1/2, b=1/√2, c= -1/2.

⟨P_z⟩ = a* a ħ + b* b * 0 + c* c * (-ħ)

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because P_z acting on each basis vector gives P_z's eigenvalues. So the expectation is:

⟨P_z⟩ = |a|^2 * (ħ) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ).

Ah, because each basis vector is the eigenvector of P_z, the expectation is the sum of each component's squared modulus multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

So let's compute each |a|^2:

|a|^2 = ( (-1/2) )^2 = 1/4.

|b|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

|c|^2 = ( (-1/2) )^2 = 1/4.

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. Correct.

⟨P_z²⟩ is the same approach but with P_z squared. So each eigenvalue is squared.

P_z squared eigenvalues are ħ², 0, ħ².

So,

⟨P_z²⟩ = |a|^2 * ħ² + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * ħ².

= (1/4) ħ² + 0 + (1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩^2) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).

So the uncertainty is ħ divided by the square root of 2.

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the operator. The operator is P_z, and the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, so the expectation is calculated correctly.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The matrix $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The given state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $|b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $|c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix $P_z^2$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting $|a|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $|b|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $|c|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the problem again and see what it's asking.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which means that the eigenstates of P_z are our basis here.

I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²), where A is the operator. So in this case, A is P_z.

But wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of P_z. So the expectation value of P_z might not be zero, and the expectation value of P_z squared will give us the average of its square. Then we can compute the uncertainty.

First, I need to find the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. Let me write down the matrix form of P_z as given. P_z is a 3x3 matrix:

Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)

So the matrix looks diagonal because it's already in the basis of its eigenvectors. That's helpful because taking the expectation value might be straightforward.

The state vector is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ]. So it's a column vector with three components. Let me denote the components as ψ₁, ψ₂, ψ₃.

To compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can calculate ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward.

The diagonal elements of P_z are:
- P_z(1,1) = ħ
- P_z(2,2) = 0
- P_z(3,3) = -ħ

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ₁* * P_z(1,1) * ψ₁ + ψ₂* * P_z(2,2) * ψ₂ + ψ₃* * P_z(3,3) * ψ₃.

Let me plug in the values. The state components are ψ₁ = -1/2, ψ₂ = 1/√2, ψ₃ = -1/2. Are these complex? The given state seems to have real components, so their conjugates are the same.

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ + ( (1/√2)^2 ) * 0 + ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (-ħ)

Calculate each term:

First term: (1/4) * ħ
Second term: 0
Third term: (1/4) * (-ħ) = -ħ/4

Adding them up: (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) ) = 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That's interesting.

Now, I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is already diagonal, P_z squared is also diagonal, with each diagonal element squared. So P_z² has diagonal entries (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2, which are ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ψ† P_z² ψ.

Calculating each term:

First term: ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (ħ²) = (1/4) * ħ²
Second term: (1/√2)^2 * 0 = 0
Third term: ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (ħ²) = (1/4) * ħ²

Adding them up: (1/4 + 0 + 1/4) * ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this simplifies to sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), option C is ħ/2. Hmm. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through it again.

The state is |ψ⟩ = [ a, b, c ]^T where a= -1/2, b=1/√2, c= -1/2.

⟨P_z⟩ = a* a ħ + b* b * 0 + c* c * (-ħ)

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because P_z acting on each basis vector gives P_z's eigenvalues. So the expectation is:

⟨P_z⟩ = |a|^2 * (ħ) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ).

Ah, because each basis vector is the eigenvector of P_z, the expectation is the sum of each component's squared modulus multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

So let's compute each |a|^2:

|a|^2 = ( (-1/2) )^2 = 1/4.

|b|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

|c|^2 = ( (-1/2) )^2 = 1/4.

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. Correct.

⟨P_z²⟩ is the same approach but with P_z squared. So each eigenvalue is squared.

P_z squared eigenvalues are ħ², 0, ħ².

So,

⟨P_z²⟩ = |a|^2 * ħ² + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * ħ².

= (1/4) ħ² + 0 + (1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩^2) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).

So the uncertainty is ħ divided by the square root of 2.

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the operator. The operator is P_z, and the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, so the expectation is calculated correctly.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The matrix $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The given state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $|b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $|c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix $P_z^2$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting $|a|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $|b|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $|c|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
