Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the reactivity of nucleophiles in aqueous solution. Hmm, I remember that nucleophilicity depends on a few factors like the solvent, the basicity of the nucleophile, and the structure of the molecule.

The question lists five nucleophiles and asks to arrange them from the most reactive to the least reactive. The options are numbered 1 through 5. Let me list them again to make sure I have them right:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide
3. Propionate
4. Methanol
5. Ethanethiolate

Wait, wait. I need to figure out their nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Oh right, in an aqueous (protic) solvent, the nucleophilicity is usually influenced by how well the nucleophile can shed its solvent molecules. Stronger bases are better nucleophiles in such conditions.

But wait, in protic solvents, the more polarizable and less solvated the nucleophile, the better it can attack. Or is it the other way around? Oh, right, in a protic solvent, the nucleophile's ability to donate electrons is affected by solvation. So more basic nucleophiles tend to be better nucleophiles in such conditions because they're less stabilized by solvation.

So let me think about each of these one by one.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: That's an alkoxide ion. Alkoxides are strong bases, so they should be good nucleophiles, but their reactivity can depend on their structure. The 4-methyl substitution might make it more stabilized, but I'm not sure how that affects nucleophilicity. Maybe it's more bulky, which could hinder attack, but in terms of basicity, it's still a good nucleophile.

2. Hydroxide (OH-): That's another alkoxide, very strong base. In aqueous solution, though, OH- is the conjugate base of water, so it's quite well-solvated. Wait, but if it's in aqueous solution, the solvent is H2O, which is a protic solvent. So OH- is surrounded by solvent molecules, which would make it less nucleophilic than it might be in a less polar solvent. Wait, but in a protic solvent, the more basic the nucleophile, the better it is as a nucleophile, right? Because it's less solvated. Or wait, maybe the opposite. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in a protic solvent, the nucleophile is solvated by the solvent (H-bonding), which slows it down. So the more polarizable or the weaker the solvation, the more reactive. So, for example, in water, the order of nucleophilicity for common ions is: I- > Br- > Cl- > F- because F- is more highly charged and gets more solvated, making it a worse nucleophile in water.

So, in this case, let's consider the basicity and solvation.

3. Propionate (CH2CH2COO-): That's the conjugate base of propionic acid. It's a weaker base than hydroxide because it's the anion of a stronger acid (acids with lower pKa have stronger conjugate bases). So propionate is less basic than hydroxide and other strong bases here.

4. Methanol (CH3OH): That's a neutral molecule, not an anion. So as a nucleophile, it's less reactive because it's not charged. In aqueous solution, it's a poor nucleophile because it's not a strong base and it's not a good electron donor.

5. Ethanethiolate (HS-): Wait, no. Ethanethiolate is the conjugate base of ethanethiol. Wait, ethanethiol is CH3CH2SH. Its conjugate base would be CH3CH2S-. So that's a thiols, which are generally weaker bases than the corresponding alcohols because S is larger and less electronegative, so the conjugate base is less stabilized. Wait, no, wait. Wait, alcohols are weaker acids than thiols. Wait, no, wait: actually, thiols are weaker acids than alcohols. Because the thiol group is less O-like. Wait, that's not right. No, wait, thiols are more acidic than alcohols. Wait, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think. The pKa of ethanol is around 16-19, while the pKa of ethanethiol is around 10. So ethanethiol is more acidic than ethanol. So its conjugate base, ethanethiolate, is a weaker base than the ethoxide ion.

Wait, but in this case, the nucleophile is the thiolate. So being a weaker base than, say, hydroxide, but more polarizable. So in a protic solvent, the nucleophilicity might be influenced by both factors.

So putting this all together.

Nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (protic solvent) generally follows the trend where better nucleophiles are more basic and less solvated. So among the given species, the strongest bases would be the best nucleophiles.

Looking at each:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: Alkoxide, strong base.

2. Hydroxide (OH-): Very strong base, but in aqueous solution, it's the conjugate base of water, so it's well-solvated. But wait, in protic solvents, the more basic the nucleophile, the better it is because it's less solvated? Or more solvated? Hmm. Wait, I'm confused. So in a protic solvent like water, a strong base like OH- is more stabilized because it's surrounded by solvent molecules. But that solvation shell may make it less reactive as a nucleophile because it's not as free to attack. Alternatively, maybe the stronger the base, the less it is solvated because it can better stabilize the charge.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to arrange the nucleophiles based on their basicity, but considering the solvent effect. In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is often the same as the order of basicity because stronger bases are less solvated and thus more reactive. But I'm not entirely sure.

So, let's list the basicity of each nucleophile:

- Ethanethiolate (HS-, since it's CH3CH2S-): Since ethanethiol is more acidic than ethanol, the thiolate is a weaker base than hydroxide. Because, for example, if ethanol has a pKa around 19, ethanethiol has a pKa around 10, so its conjugate base (thiolate) is weaker than OH-.

- Hydroxide (OH-): It's a strong base, with a pKa around 15.5 for water.

- 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: It's an alkoxide ion, so it's a strong base. Since cyclohexanol has a pKa around 16-17, the conjugate base (the cyclohexoxide) is stronger than hydroxide. So this is a stronger base than OH-.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the pKa of cyclohexanol is around 16-17, so its conjugate base (the cyclohexoxide) has a higher basicity than hydroxide? Because if the acid is weaker (higher pKa), the conjugate base is stronger. So cyclohexanol has a higher pKa (~16) than ethanol (~16-19), but I'm not exact on these numbers. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexoxide is a stronger base than hydroxide.

Wait, let me think: the pKa of cyclohexanol is about 16.5, and ethanol is about 19. Wait, that can't be right because in reality, ethanol is more acidic than cyclohexanol. Oh wait, maybe I have it backwards. No, wait, wait: the pKa of ethanol is about 16-19, while cyclohexanol's pKa is around 19. So that would make ethanol a stronger acid than cyclohexanol, so the cyclohexoxide ion is a stronger base than ethoxide.

Wait, no, no, the weaker the acid, the stronger the conjugate base. If ethanol has a lower pKa than cyclohexanol, that would mean ethanol is a stronger acid, so ethoxide is a weaker base than cyclohexoxide. So if cyclohexanol has higher pKa, its conjugate base (cyclohexoxide) is stronger.

So, in this case, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) is a stronger base than OH- (2).

Then, Ethanethiolate (5) is a weaker base than OH- because ethanethiol is a stronger acid (pKa ~10) than water. So the thiolate is a weaker base.

Propionate (3) is the conjugate base of propionic acid (pKa ~4.88). So propionate is a very weak base compared to the others.

Methanol (4) is a neutral molecule, so it's a poor nucleophile.

So, arranging the nucleophiles from strongest to weakest base (and thus, possibly, from most to least nucleophilic in aqueous solution):

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base)
2. Hydroxide (OH-)
5. Ethanethiolate
3. Propionate
4. Methanol (weakest, neutral)

Wait, but wait. Wait, I thought Ethanethiolate was weaker than hydroxide. Let me confirm: hydroxide is a stronger base than thiolate. Because H2O has a pKa ~15.7, and ethanethiol has a pKa ~10. So the thiolate is a weaker base than hydroxide.

So putting them in order of base strength (from strongest to weakest):

1 > 2 >5>3>4.

But wait, but in aqueous solution (protic solvent), the more basic nucleophiles (like 1) are better nucleophiles because they're less solvated, right? So in aqueous, the order is the same as their basicity.

But wait, there's another factor. In protic solvents, steric factors can play a role, but I'm not sure about that. But in this case, all are monodentate, so steric effects might be less important.

Wait, but wait. Ethanethiolate is a larger ion than hydroxide. Because S is bigger than O, so it's more polarizable. In a protic solvent, maybe the thiolate has less solvation because it's larger, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the solvation is stronger because the larger size allows more H-bonds. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I remember that in protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity generally follows the order of basicity, but sometimes with some exceptions based on polarizability.

Wait, for example, in polar aprotic solvents, nucleophilicity follows the order of basicity because there's no strong solvation. In protic solvents, the more basic the nucleophile, the better it is, but sometimes less basic, more polarizable nucleophiles can be better. For example, I- is a better nucleophile in polar aprotic solvents than in protic because in protic, it's heavily solvated. But in protic solvents, the order might change.

Wait, but among the given nucleophiles, the order would be 1, 2, 5, 3, 4. Or wait, let me think again.

Wait, another approach: in aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity order for common ions is often:

HS- (ethanethiolate) > I- > Br- > Cl- > F- > OH-.

Wait, no, that's not right. In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is usually F- < Cl- < Br- < I-, because they're less solvated. Wait, no, wait, in protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity is inversely related to their basicity, sometimes. Because the stronger bases are more solvated and thus less nucleophilic. Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier.

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. For halides, the order of nucleophilicity in water is I- > Br- > Cl- > F-. Because F- is more electronegative and forms stronger bonds with H, making it more solvated and less reactive. So in protic solvents, the larger, more polarizable ions are better nucleophiles because they're less solvated.

So applying that logic, I think that in aqueous solution, a thiolate ion (larger, more polarizable) would be a better nucleophile than hydroxide because it's less solvated. Wait, but wait, thiolate is weaker base than hydroxide.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the pKa of the conjugate acids. A lower pKa means a stronger acid, so the conjugate base is weaker.

So, the conjugate acids:

- 4-methylcyclohexanol: pKa ~19 (approx)
- Water: pKa ~15.7
- Ethanethiol: pKa ~10
- Propionic acid: pKa ~4.88
- Methanol: pKa ~19.2

So the order of conjugate acid strength (from strongest to weakest): Propionic acid (pKa ~4.88) > Ethanethiol (~10) > Water (~15.7) > 4-methylcyclohexanol (~19) > Methanol (~19.2).

Wait, because a lower pKa means stronger acid. So the conjugate bases are stronger in the reverse order.

So the order of conjugate base strength (weakest to strongest): Propionate (weakest base) < Ethanethiolate < Hydroxide < 4-methylcyclohexanolate < Methanol's conjugate base (but methanol is neutral).

Wait, but methanol is neutral, so its conjugate base (methoxide) would be stronger than hydroxide, but it's not part of the nucleophiles here.

Wait, the nucleophiles are 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate), 2 (OH-), 3 (propionate), 4 (methanol), 5 (ethanethiolate).

So the order of strength of their conjugate bases (from strongest to weakest):

1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate) > 2 (OH-) >5 (ethanethiolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol is neutral, so weakest).

But in aqueous solution, nucleophilicity may not directly follow the conjugate base strength because of solvation. For example, the more the nucleophile is solvated, the less nucleophilic it is.

So, in aqueous solution, the thiolate ion (5) is less basic than OH- (2) but more polarizable. So maybe in water, the thiolate is a better nucleophile than OH- because it's less solvated, despite being a weaker base.

Wait, no. Wait, thiolate is a weaker base (because ethanethiol is more acidic than water) so in water, it's less basic. But in a protic solvent, the more basic the nucleophile, the better it is as a nucleophile because stronger bases are less solvated (they can better break the H-bonds with the solvent), making them more available to attack.

Wait, but if that's the case, then OH- would be a better nucleophile than the ethanethiolate in aqueous solution. Because OH- is a stronger base, so in water, it's less solvated, making it a better nucleophile.

Wait, but I remember that in polar aprotic solvents, nucleophilicity follows basicity because there's no significant solvation. In protic solvents, the more polarizable the nucleophile, the better it is, because they are less solvated. For example, I- is a better nucleophile in protic solvents than in aprotic because in aprotic solvents, it's not solvated as much and can attack more effectively. Wait, no, I think it's the opposite.

Wait, I think in protic solvents, smaller, more highly charged ions are more solvated, making them less nucleophilic. Larger, less charged ions are less solvated and thus more nucleophilic.

So in a protic solvent, the order of nucleophilicity for the halides is I- > Br- > Cl- > F-, because F- is more solvated.

So applying this logic, the thiolate ion (5) is S- which is larger than O- (like OH-), so it's less solvated, making it a better nucleophile in aqueous solution than OH-.

Wait, that would mean that in aqueous solution, the thiolate is a better nucleophile than hydroxide.

But earlier, I thought that the order of basicity is 1 >2>5>3>4.

So, putting it all together, in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity would be:

5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (OH-) >1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, but wait. Let me check:

If the thiolate is less solvated than hydroxide, it would be a better nucleophile. Because in protic solvents, better nucleophiles are those that are less solvated (can break away more easily from solvent molecules to attack the electrophile).

So, in the list, the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution would be:

Most reactive: 5 (ethanethiolate), then 2 (OH-), then 1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate), then 3 (propionate), then 4 (methanol).

Wait, but wait again. That conflicts with the basicity order. Because 1 is stronger base than 2, but in aqueous solution, 2 is a better nucleophile than 1? No, that doesn't make sense. Because 1 is a stronger base, so in aqueous, it should be a better nucleophile.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the effects of basicity and solvation. Let me think about the solvation effect for each.

The 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) is a strong base, but perhaps it's more stabilized (solvated) than the thiolate (5) because of its charge. Wait, no, the thiolate has a larger size. So perhaps the thiolate is less solvated than the smaller, more highly charged hydroxide ion.

Wait, actually, I think that larger, less electronegative atoms (like S) have weaker solvation because their charges are less concentrated and their size allows less close approach of the solvent molecules. So thiolate is less solvated than hydroxide.

So, in water, the thiolate (5) would be a better nucleophile than hydroxide (2), despite being a weaker base, because less solvated.

But wait, if that's the case, then the order in aqueous solution would be:

5 > 2 >1 >3 >4.

But let's think about another data point. For example, between CH3O- and CH3S- in water.

In aqueous solution, thiolate (S-) is a better nucleophile than methoxide (O-) because S is larger, less solvated, so more available to attack.

In this problem, the options include hydroxide and ethanethiolate.

So, based on that, ethanethiolate (5) is a better nucleophile in water than hydroxide (2).

So the order would be:

5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) >1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, but what about 4-methylcyclohexanolate? It's a stronger base than hydroxide, so in aqueous solution, perhaps it's a better nucleophile. Because stronger bases are less solvated in protic solvents, making them better nucleophiles.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me try to think of it another way.

In aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity order is generally:

For same type ions: I- > Br- > Cl- > F- (because F- is more solvated).

For different atoms: RS- is a better nucleophile than RO- because S is larger, less solvated.

So between ethanethiolate (5) and hydroxide (2), 5 should be a better nucleophile in aqueous solution.

Now, between 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) and hydroxide (2), 1 is a stronger base. So in aqueous solution, 1 is a better nucleophile than 2.

Wait, that can't be, because in aqueous solution, the more basic the nucleophile, the better it is as a nucleophile. Because it's less solvated.

So, perhaps the order is 1 >5>2>3>4.

Wait, but that can't be right because 5 is a weaker base than 2, which is weaker than 1. But from the nucleophilicity standpoint, perhaps 1 is better than 2, which is better than 5.

No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Nucleophilicity in aqueous solution is influenced both by basicity (stronger bases are better nucleophiles) and solvation (less solvated nucleophiles are better).

So, 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) is a stronger base than OH- (2). So in aqueous, 1 is a better nucleophile than 2.

Ethanethiolate (5) is a weaker base than 2 but a better nucleophile in aqueous solution because it's less solvated.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because 1 is even more basic. So would 1 be more reactive than 5?

Hmm, perhaps I should look for some examples.

In aqueous solution, the thiolate ion (e.g., HS-) is a better nucleophile than the hydroxide ion. For example, in the SN2 reaction, thiolate is a better nucleophile in aqueous solution than hydroxide.

So, putting it all together:

The order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution should be:

5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) >1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, but 1 is a stronger base than 2. So why is 2 more nucleophilic than 1 in aqueous?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake. Because in aqueous solution, the more basic nucleophile is better, so 1 should be better than 2. But in reality, maybe the steric effects or solvation play a bigger role.

Wait, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a bulky nucleophile. So even though it's a strong base, its bulkiness might hinder its nucleophilic attack, making it less reactive in practice.

So maybe the actual order in aqueous solution is:

5 (ethanethiolate) >2 (hydroxide) >1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

But wait, I'm not certain about the position of 1. Alternatively, perhaps the order is 5 >2>1>3>4.

Looking back at the options, let's see what each option says.

The options are:

A) 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4 → No, because 3 is propionate, which is less basic than 1.

B) 2,5,1,4,3 → Hmm, that would be 2 first, which doesn't fit what I thought.

C) 2,5,3,4,3 → Doesn't make sense, same number appears twice.

D)5,2,1,3,4 → That's the order I thought earlier: 5,2,1,3,4.

Wait, option D is 5,2,1,3,4.

So, the order would be:

5 (ethanethiolate) is most reactive,

then 2 (hydroxide),

then 1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate),

then 3 (propionate),

then 4 (methanol).

So the correct order is 5,2,1,3,4.

Looking at the options, option D is 5, 2, 1, 3, 4. So the answer should be option D.

Wait, but what about the actual reactivity of 4-methylcyclohexanolate compared to hydroxide? Because 4-methyl cyclohexanolate is more basic, so in aqueous solution, it should be a better nucleophile than hydroxide. So why in option D, hydroxide is more reactive than 1? That doesn't fit.

Ah! I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.

Because 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) is a stronger base than hydroxide (2), in aqueous solution, it should be a better nucleophile. So the correct order should have 1 before 2.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the order would be:

1 (most reactive), 2, 5,3,4.

But that's not any of the options. Wait, looking at the options:

Option A:5,2,3,1,4 → No.

Option B:2,5,1,4,3 → No.

Option C:2,5,3,4,3 → No.

Option D:5,2,1,3,4.

Hmm, none of the options have 1 in first place except none. Because in the given options, option D starts with 5, then 2, then 1.

So according to the options, the correct order must be 5,2,1,3,4.

But according to our earlier reasoning, that would mean that hydroxide (2) is a better nucleophile than 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1), which contradicts basicity.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up some concepts here.

Wait, maybe in aqueous solution, the 4-methylcyclohexanolate is less reactive than hydroxide because of its steric bulk. So even though it's a stronger base, the bulky structure makes it less effective as a nucleophile.

So in that case, the order would be 5 (ethanethiolate) is the best, followed by hydroxide (2), then 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1), then propionate (3), and finally methanol (4).

So that would match option D.

So the correct order is 5, 2, 1,3,4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the reactivity of the given nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we need to consider factors such as basicity, solvation effects, and steric bulk. In aqueous (protic) solvents, nucleophilicity is influenced by how well the nucleophile is solvated. Stronger bases are generally better nucleophiles in protic solvents because they are less solvated, making them more available to attack. Additionally, larger, more polarizable nucleophiles are less solvated and thus more nucleophilic in protic solvents.

### Analysis of Each Nucleophile:
1. **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: This is a strong base (alkoxide ion) and a good nucleophile. However, its steric bulk may hinder its reactivity compared to less bulky nucleophiles.
2. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: A very strong base and a good nucleophile. In aqueous solution, it is well-solvated, but it is still highly reactive.
3. **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻)**: A weak base compared to the others, as it is the conjugate base of a strong acid (propionic acid). It is a poor nucleophile in aqueous solution.
4. **Methanol (CH₃OH)**: A neutral molecule, making it a very poor nucleophile in aqueous solution.
5. **Ethanethiolate (CH₃CH₂S⁻)**: A weaker base than hydroxide but more polarizable. In aqueous solution, it is less solvated than hydroxide, making it a better nucleophile despite being a weaker base.

### Order of Reactivity:
- **Ethanethiolate (5)** is the most reactive due to its high polarizability and reduced solvation in aqueous solution.
- **Hydroxide (2)** follows, as it is a strong base and less solvated than propionate and methanol.
- **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)** is next, despite being a stronger base than hydroxide, because its steric bulk reduces its nucleophilicity.
- **Propionate (3)** is less reactive due to its weak basicity.
- **Methanol (4)** is the least reactive as a neutral molecule.

### Correct Order:
5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 3 (propionate) > 4 (methanol).

This matches **Option D**.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the reactivity of nucleophiles in aqueous solution. Hmm, I remember that nucleophilicity depends on a few factors like the solvent, the basicity of the nucleophile, and the structure of the molecule.

The question lists five nucleophiles and asks to arrange them from the most reactive to the least reactive. The options are numbered 1 through 5. Let me list them again to make sure I have them right:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide
3. Propionate
4. Methanol
5. Ethanethiolate

Wait, wait. I need to figure out their nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Oh right, in an aqueous (protic) solvent, the nucleophilicity is usually influenced by how well the nucleophile can shed its solvent molecules. Stronger bases are better nucleophiles in such conditions.

But wait, in protic solvents, the more polarizable and less solvated the nucleophile, the better it can attack. Or is it the other way around? Oh, right, in a protic solvent, the nucleophile's ability to donate electrons is affected by solvation. So more basic nucleophiles tend to be better nucleophiles in such conditions because they're less stabilized by solvation.

So let me think about each of these one by one.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: That's an alkoxide ion. Alkoxides are strong bases, so they should be good nucleophiles, but their reactivity can depend on their structure. The 4-methyl substitution might make it more stabilized, but I'm not sure how that affects nucleophilicity. Maybe it's more bulky, which could hinder attack, but in terms of basicity, it's still a good nucleophile.

2. Hydroxide (OH-): That's another alkoxide, very strong base. In aqueous solution, though, OH- is the conjugate base of water, so it's quite well-solvated. Wait, but if it's in aqueous solution, the solvent is H2O, which is a protic solvent. So OH- is surrounded by solvent molecules, which would make it less nucleophilic than it might be in a less polar solvent. Wait, but in a protic solvent, the more basic the nucleophile, the better it is as a nucleophile, right? Because it's less solvated. Or wait, maybe the opposite. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in a protic solvent, the nucleophile is solvated by the solvent (H-bonding), which slows it down. So the more polarizable or the weaker the solvation, the more reactive. So, for example, in water, the order of nucleophilicity for common ions is: I- > Br- > Cl- > F- because F- is more highly charged and gets more solvated, making it a worse nucleophile in water.

So, in this case, let's consider the basicity and solvation.

3. Propionate (CH2CH2COO-): That's the conjugate base of propionic acid. It's a weaker base than hydroxide because it's the anion of a stronger acid (acids with lower pKa have stronger conjugate bases). So propionate is less basic than hydroxide and other strong bases here.

4. Methanol (CH3OH): That's a neutral molecule, not an anion. So as a nucleophile, it's less reactive because it's not charged. In aqueous solution, it's a poor nucleophile because it's not a strong base and it's not a good electron donor.

5. Ethanethiolate (HS-): Wait, no. Ethanethiolate is the conjugate base of ethanethiol. Wait, ethanethiol is CH3CH2SH. Its conjugate base would be CH3CH2S-. So that's a thiols, which are generally weaker bases than the corresponding alcohols because S is larger and less electronegative, so the conjugate base is less stabilized. Wait, no, wait. Wait, alcohols are weaker acids than thiols. Wait, no, wait: actually, thiols are weaker acids than alcohols. Because the thiol group is less O-like. Wait, that's not right. No, wait, thiols are more acidic than alcohols. Wait, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think. The pKa of ethanol is around 16-19, while the pKa of ethanethiol is around 10. So ethanethiol is more acidic than ethanol. So its conjugate base, ethanethiolate, is a weaker base than the ethoxide ion.

Wait, but in this case, the nucleophile is the thiolate. So being a weaker base than, say, hydroxide, but more polarizable. So in a protic solvent, the nucleophilicity might be influenced by both factors.

So putting this all together.

Nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (protic solvent) generally follows the trend where better nucleophiles are more basic and less solvated. So among the given species, the strongest bases would be the best nucleophiles.

Looking at each:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: Alkoxide, strong base.

2. Hydroxide (OH-): Very strong base, but in aqueous solution, it's the conjugate base of water, so it's well-solvated. But wait, in protic solvents, the more basic the nucleophile, the better it is because it's less solvated? Or more solvated? Hmm. Wait, I'm confused. So in a protic solvent like water, a strong base like OH- is more stabilized because it's surrounded by solvent molecules. But that solvation shell may make it less reactive as a nucleophile because it's not as free to attack. Alternatively, maybe the stronger the base, the less it is solvated because it can better stabilize the charge.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to arrange the nucleophiles based on their basicity, but considering the solvent effect. In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is often the same as the order of basicity because stronger bases are less solvated and thus more reactive. But I'm not entirely sure.

So, let's list the basicity of each nucleophile:

- Ethanethiolate (HS-, since it's CH3CH2S-): Since ethanethiol is more acidic than ethanol, the thiolate is a weaker base than hydroxide. Because, for example, if ethanol has a pKa around 19, ethanethiol has a pKa around 10, so its conjugate base (thiolate) is weaker than OH-.

- Hydroxide (OH-): It's a strong base, with a pKa around 15.5 for water.

- 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: It's an alkoxide ion, so it's a strong base. Since cyclohexanol has a pKa around 16-17, the conjugate base (the cyclohexoxide) is stronger than hydroxide. So this is a stronger base than OH-.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the pKa of cyclohexanol is around 16-17, so its conjugate base (the cyclohexoxide) has a higher basicity than hydroxide? Because if the acid is weaker (higher pKa), the conjugate base is stronger. So cyclohexanol has a higher pKa (~16) than ethanol (~16-19), but I'm not exact on these numbers. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexoxide is a stronger base than hydroxide.

Wait, let me think: the pKa of cyclohexanol is about 16.5, and ethanol is about 19. Wait, that can't be right because in reality, ethanol is more acidic than cyclohexanol. Oh wait, maybe I have it backwards. No, wait, wait: the pKa of ethanol is about 16-19, while cyclohexanol's pKa is around 19. So that would make ethanol a stronger acid than cyclohexanol, so the cyclohexoxide ion is a stronger base than ethoxide.

Wait, no, no, the weaker the acid, the stronger the conjugate base. If ethanol has a lower pKa than cyclohexanol, that would mean ethanol is a stronger acid, so ethoxide is a weaker base than cyclohexoxide. So if cyclohexanol has higher pKa, its conjugate base (cyclohexoxide) is stronger.

So, in this case, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) is a stronger base than OH- (2).

Then, Ethanethiolate (5) is a weaker base than OH- because ethanethiol is a stronger acid (pKa ~10) than water. So the thiolate is a weaker base.

Propionate (3) is the conjugate base of propionic acid (pKa ~4.88). So propionate is a very weak base compared to the others.

Methanol (4) is a neutral molecule, so it's a poor nucleophile.

So, arranging the nucleophiles from strongest to weakest base (and thus, possibly, from most to least nucleophilic in aqueous solution):

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base)
2. Hydroxide (OH-)
5. Ethanethiolate
3. Propionate
4. Methanol (weakest, neutral)

Wait, but wait. Wait, I thought Ethanethiolate was weaker than hydroxide. Let me confirm: hydroxide is a stronger base than thiolate. Because H2O has a pKa ~15.7, and ethanethiol has a pKa ~10. So the thiolate is a weaker base than hydroxide.

So putting them in order of base strength (from strongest to weakest):

1 > 2 >5>3>4.

But wait, but in aqueous solution (protic solvent), the more basic nucleophiles (like 1) are better nucleophiles because they're less solvated, right? So in aqueous, the order is the same as their basicity.

But wait, there's another factor. In protic solvents, steric factors can play a role, but I'm not sure about that. But in this case, all are monodentate, so steric effects might be less important.

Wait, but wait. Ethanethiolate is a larger ion than hydroxide. Because S is bigger than O, so it's more polarizable. In a protic solvent, maybe the thiolate has less solvation because it's larger, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the solvation is stronger because the larger size allows more H-bonds. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I remember that in protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity generally follows the order of basicity, but sometimes with some exceptions based on polarizability.

Wait, for example, in polar aprotic solvents, nucleophilicity follows the order of basicity because there's no strong solvation. In protic solvents, the more basic the nucleophile, the better it is, but sometimes less basic, more polarizable nucleophiles can be better. For example, I- is a better nucleophile in polar aprotic solvents than in protic because in protic, it's heavily solvated. But in protic solvents, the order might change.

Wait, but among the given nucleophiles, the order would be 1, 2, 5, 3, 4. Or wait, let me think again.

Wait, another approach: in aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity order for common ions is often:

HS- (ethanethiolate) > I- > Br- > Cl- > F- > OH-.

Wait, no, that's not right. In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is usually F- < Cl- < Br- < I-, because they're less solvated. Wait, no, wait, in protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity is inversely related to their basicity, sometimes. Because the stronger bases are more solvated and thus less nucleophilic. Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier.

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. For halides, the order of nucleophilicity in water is I- > Br- > Cl- > F-. Because F- is more electronegative and forms stronger bonds with H, making it more solvated and less reactive. So in protic solvents, the larger, more polarizable ions are better nucleophiles because they're less solvated.

So applying that logic, I think that in aqueous solution, a thiolate ion (larger, more polarizable) would be a better nucleophile than hydroxide because it's less solvated. Wait, but wait, thiolate is weaker base than hydroxide.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the pKa of the conjugate acids. A lower pKa means a stronger acid, so the conjugate base is weaker.

So, the conjugate acids:

- 4-methylcyclohexanol: pKa ~19 (approx)
- Water: pKa ~15.7
- Ethanethiol: pKa ~10
- Propionic acid: pKa ~4.88
- Methanol: pKa ~19.2

So the order of conjugate acid strength (from strongest to weakest): Propionic acid (pKa ~4.88) > Ethanethiol (~10) > Water (~15.7) > 4-methylcyclohexanol (~19) > Methanol (~19.2).

Wait, because a lower pKa means stronger acid. So the conjugate bases are stronger in the reverse order.

So the order of conjugate base strength (weakest to strongest): Propionate (weakest base) < Ethanethiolate < Hydroxide < 4-methylcyclohexanolate < Methanol's conjugate base (but methanol is neutral).

Wait, but methanol is neutral, so its conjugate base (methoxide) would be stronger than hydroxide, but it's not part of the nucleophiles here.

Wait, the nucleophiles are 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate), 2 (OH-), 3 (propionate), 4 (methanol), 5 (ethanethiolate).

So the order of strength of their conjugate bases (from strongest to weakest):

1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate) > 2 (OH-) >5 (ethanethiolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol is neutral, so weakest).

But in aqueous solution, nucleophilicity may not directly follow the conjugate base strength because of solvation. For example, the more the nucleophile is solvated, the less nucleophilic it is.

So, in aqueous solution, the thiolate ion (5) is less basic than OH- (2) but more polarizable. So maybe in water, the thiolate is a better nucleophile than OH- because it's less solvated, despite being a weaker base.

Wait, no. Wait, thiolate is a weaker base (because ethanethiol is more acidic than water) so in water, it's less basic. But in a protic solvent, the more basic the nucleophile, the better it is as a nucleophile because stronger bases are less solvated (they can better break the H-bonds with the solvent), making them more available to attack.

Wait, but if that's the case, then OH- would be a better nucleophile than the ethanethiolate in aqueous solution. Because OH- is a stronger base, so in water, it's less solvated, making it a better nucleophile.

Wait, but I remember that in polar aprotic solvents, nucleophilicity follows basicity because there's no significant solvation. In protic solvents, the more polarizable the nucleophile, the better it is, because they are less solvated. For example, I- is a better nucleophile in protic solvents than in aprotic because in aprotic solvents, it's not solvated as much and can attack more effectively. Wait, no, I think it's the opposite.

Wait, I think in protic solvents, smaller, more highly charged ions are more solvated, making them less nucleophilic. Larger, less charged ions are less solvated and thus more nucleophilic.

So in a protic solvent, the order of nucleophilicity for the halides is I- > Br- > Cl- > F-, because F- is more solvated.

So applying this logic, the thiolate ion (5) is S- which is larger than O- (like OH-), so it's less solvated, making it a better nucleophile in aqueous solution than OH-.

Wait, that would mean that in aqueous solution, the thiolate is a better nucleophile than hydroxide.

But earlier, I thought that the order of basicity is 1 >2>5>3>4.

So, putting it all together, in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity would be:

5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (OH-) >1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, but wait. Let me check:

If the thiolate is less solvated than hydroxide, it would be a better nucleophile. Because in protic solvents, better nucleophiles are those that are less solvated (can break away more easily from solvent molecules to attack the electrophile).

So, in the list, the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution would be:

Most reactive: 5 (ethanethiolate), then 2 (OH-), then 1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate), then 3 (propionate), then 4 (methanol).

Wait, but wait again. That conflicts with the basicity order. Because 1 is stronger base than 2, but in aqueous solution, 2 is a better nucleophile than 1? No, that doesn't make sense. Because 1 is a stronger base, so in aqueous, it should be a better nucleophile.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the effects of basicity and solvation. Let me think about the solvation effect for each.

The 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) is a strong base, but perhaps it's more stabilized (solvated) than the thiolate (5) because of its charge. Wait, no, the thiolate has a larger size. So perhaps the thiolate is less solvated than the smaller, more highly charged hydroxide ion.

Wait, actually, I think that larger, less electronegative atoms (like S) have weaker solvation because their charges are less concentrated and their size allows less close approach of the solvent molecules. So thiolate is less solvated than hydroxide.

So, in water, the thiolate (5) would be a better nucleophile than hydroxide (2), despite being a weaker base, because less solvated.

But wait, if that's the case, then the order in aqueous solution would be:

5 > 2 >1 >3 >4.

But let's think about another data point. For example, between CH3O- and CH3S- in water.

In aqueous solution, thiolate (S-) is a better nucleophile than methoxide (O-) because S is larger, less solvated, so more available to attack.

In this problem, the options include hydroxide and ethanethiolate.

So, based on that, ethanethiolate (5) is a better nucleophile in water than hydroxide (2).

So the order would be:

5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) >1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, but what about 4-methylcyclohexanolate? It's a stronger base than hydroxide, so in aqueous solution, perhaps it's a better nucleophile. Because stronger bases are less solvated in protic solvents, making them better nucleophiles.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me try to think of it another way.

In aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity order is generally:

For same type ions: I- > Br- > Cl- > F- (because F- is more solvated).

For different atoms: RS- is a better nucleophile than RO- because S is larger, less solvated.

So between ethanethiolate (5) and hydroxide (2), 5 should be a better nucleophile in aqueous solution.

Now, between 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) and hydroxide (2), 1 is a stronger base. So in aqueous solution, 1 is a better nucleophile than 2.

Wait, that can't be, because in aqueous solution, the more basic the nucleophile, the better it is as a nucleophile. Because it's less solvated.

So, perhaps the order is 1 >5>2>3>4.

Wait, but that can't be right because 5 is a weaker base than 2, which is weaker than 1. But from the nucleophilicity standpoint, perhaps 1 is better than 2, which is better than 5.

No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Nucleophilicity in aqueous solution is influenced both by basicity (stronger bases are better nucleophiles) and solvation (less solvated nucleophiles are better).

So, 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) is a stronger base than OH- (2). So in aqueous, 1 is a better nucleophile than 2.

Ethanethiolate (5) is a weaker base than 2 but a better nucleophile in aqueous solution because it's less solvated.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because 1 is even more basic. So would 1 be more reactive than 5?

Hmm, perhaps I should look for some examples.

In aqueous solution, the thiolate ion (e.g., HS-) is a better nucleophile than the hydroxide ion. For example, in the SN2 reaction, thiolate is a better nucleophile in aqueous solution than hydroxide.

So, putting it all together:

The order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution should be:

5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) >1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, but 1 is a stronger base than 2. So why is 2 more nucleophilic than 1 in aqueous?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake. Because in aqueous solution, the more basic nucleophile is better, so 1 should be better than 2. But in reality, maybe the steric effects or solvation play a bigger role.

Wait, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a bulky nucleophile. So even though it's a strong base, its bulkiness might hinder its nucleophilic attack, making it less reactive in practice.

So maybe the actual order in aqueous solution is:

5 (ethanethiolate) >2 (hydroxide) >1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

But wait, I'm not certain about the position of 1. Alternatively, perhaps the order is 5 >2>1>3>4.

Looking back at the options, let's see what each option says.

The options are:

A) 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4 → No, because 3 is propionate, which is less basic than 1.

B) 2,5,1,4,3 → Hmm, that would be 2 first, which doesn't fit what I thought.

C) 2,5,3,4,3 → Doesn't make sense, same number appears twice.

D)5,2,1,3,4 → That's the order I thought earlier: 5,2,1,3,4.

Wait, option D is 5,2,1,3,4.

So, the order would be:

5 (ethanethiolate) is most reactive,

then 2 (hydroxide),

then 1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate),

then 3 (propionate),

then 4 (methanol).

So the correct order is 5,2,1,3,4.

Looking at the options, option D is 5, 2, 1, 3, 4. So the answer should be option D.

Wait, but what about the actual reactivity of 4-methylcyclohexanolate compared to hydroxide? Because 4-methyl cyclohexanolate is more basic, so in aqueous solution, it should be a better nucleophile than hydroxide. So why in option D, hydroxide is more reactive than 1? That doesn't fit.

Ah! I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.

Because 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) is a stronger base than hydroxide (2), in aqueous solution, it should be a better nucleophile. So the correct order should have 1 before 2.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the order would be:

1 (most reactive), 2, 5,3,4.

But that's not any of the options. Wait, looking at the options:

Option A:5,2,3,1,4 → No.

Option B:2,5,1,4,3 → No.

Option C:2,5,3,4,3 → No.

Option D:5,2,1,3,4.

Hmm, none of the options have 1 in first place except none. Because in the given options, option D starts with 5, then 2, then 1.

So according to the options, the correct order must be 5,2,1,3,4.

But according to our earlier reasoning, that would mean that hydroxide (2) is a better nucleophile than 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1), which contradicts basicity.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up some concepts here.

Wait, maybe in aqueous solution, the 4-methylcyclohexanolate is less reactive than hydroxide because of its steric bulk. So even though it's a stronger base, the bulky structure makes it less effective as a nucleophile.

So in that case, the order would be 5 (ethanethiolate) is the best, followed by hydroxide (2), then 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1), then propionate (3), and finally methanol (4).

So that would match option D.

So the correct order is 5, 2, 1,3,4.


To determine the reactivity of the given nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we need to consider factors such as basicity, solvation effects, and steric bulk. In aqueous (protic) solvents, nucleophilicity is influenced by how well the nucleophile is solvated. Stronger bases are generally better nucleophiles in protic solvents because they are less solvated, making them more available to attack. Additionally, larger, more polarizable nucleophiles are less solvated and thus more nucleophilic in protic solvents.

### Analysis of Each Nucleophile:
1. **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: This is a strong base (alkoxide ion) and a good nucleophile. However, its steric bulk may hinder its reactivity compared to less bulky nucleophiles.
2. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: A very strong base and a good nucleophile. In aqueous solution, it is well-solvated, but it is still highly reactive.
3. **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻)**: A weak base compared to the others, as it is the conjugate base of a strong acid (propionic acid). It is a poor nucleophile in aqueous solution.
4. **Methanol (CH₃OH)**: A neutral molecule, making it a very poor nucleophile in aqueous solution.
5. **Ethanethiolate (CH₃CH₂S⁻)**: A weaker base than hydroxide but more polarizable. In aqueous solution, it is less solvated than hydroxide, making it a better nucleophile despite being a weaker base.

### Order of Reactivity:
- **Ethanethiolate (5)** is the most reactive due to its high polarizability and reduced solvation in aqueous solution.
- **Hydroxide (2)** follows, as it is a strong base and less solvated than propionate and methanol.
- **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)** is next, despite being a stronger base than hydroxide, because its steric bulk reduces its nucleophilicity.
- **Propionate (3)** is less reactive due to its weak basicity.
- **Methanol (4)** is the least reactive as a neutral molecule.

### Correct Order:
5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 3 (propionate) > 4 (methanol).

This matches **Option D**.

Answer: D
