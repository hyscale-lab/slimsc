Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have 10,000 identical systems. Each has a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measure the position, none are found at x < 1 or x >3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. I need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that the wave function must be normalized. Normalization means that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in space is 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

Since the wave function is given as ψ(x) = a / sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i, the absolute square is |ψ(x)|². Let me compute that.

The absolute square is (ψ*)ψ, where ψ* is the complex conjugate. So ψ* would be a / sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i. Multiply them together:

ψ*ψ = (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (a/sqrt(1+x))(0.5i) + (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5i)(-0.5i).

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute as (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2, because when you expand (a + b)(a - b), it's a² - b², but wait no, the wave function is a sum, not a product. Wait, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5i), so when you take the conjugate, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - (-0.5i), which is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So when you multiply, you get [a^2/(1+x)] + [ (a)(0.5i)/sqrt(1+x) ] + [ (a)(-0.5i)/sqrt(1+x) ] + (0.5i)(-0.5i). The cross terms with i will cancel out because one is positive and the other negative. The last term is (-0.25i²), which is -0.25*(-1) = +0.25. So the absolute square is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute this correctly. Let me write ψ as real + imaginary. So ψ = A + B i, where A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is -0.5. So the complex conjugate is A - B i. Then ψ*ψ = (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² + B². So that's [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So |ψ|² = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, no. Because B is -0.5, so B² is 0.25. Oh right, correct.

So the probability density is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So I think I did it right.

Now, the normalization condition is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3, because the wave function is zero outside this region? Or wait, the problem says that when measured, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So does that mean that the wave function is zero outside this region? Or is it that the wave function is non-zero only within this region, so our integration is from 1 to 3?

Wait, the problem says that none were found at x <1 and x>3, implying that the wave function is zero outside. But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps the actual wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the given expression is valid only in the region where the particle can be found.

Wait, the problem states: "the wave function... can be described as: (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i; where 'i' is the square root of -1, and 'sqrt()' means the square root of."

Ah, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be continuous and must go to zero at boundaries if the particle is confined. So perhaps that's the case here. So the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the integral for normalization is from x=1 to x=3.

So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

So we have the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So maybe the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. But in the wave function, the imaginary component is a constant (-0.5i), which is unusual because typically wave functions have spatially dependent real and imaginary parts. But perhaps in this case, the imaginary part is a constant. That might complicate the normalization.

Wait, but |ψ|² is [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, as I computed earlier. So the integral becomes the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

We can split this integral into two parts: a² times the integral of 1/(1+x) dx plus 0.25 times the integral of dx, both from 1 to 3.

Compute each part:

First integral: ∫[1/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first part is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is (3-1) = 2. So 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that value.

I remember that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is the closest. So the answer is B.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → ln(2) ≈ 0.693147.

0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.7213475.

Square root of that is sqrt(0.7213475) ≈ 0.849. So yes, 0.85 is option B.

To solve the problem, we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the total probability of finding the particle in all of space must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The particles are only found between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\), so the normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Substituting \(|\psi(x)|^2\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 1
\]

1. Compute the first integral:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln\left(\frac{4}{2}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

2. Compute the second integral:

\[
\int_1^3 dx = 3 - 1 = 2
\]

Substitute these results back:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

Solve for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Take the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest value to \(a\) among the options is \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.
