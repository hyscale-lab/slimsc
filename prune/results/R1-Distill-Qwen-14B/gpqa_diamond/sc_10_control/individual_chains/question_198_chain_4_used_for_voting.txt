Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the percentage of a particular cobalt complex in solution. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with stability constants and the distribution of metal complexes based on ligand concentration and the constants.

Alright, so the problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, wait, that seems a bit odd because usually the higher β means a more stable complex. Oh, maybe they are in order of increasing n, like the number of SCN- ligands? So, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)2]^ something, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^- or something, and β4 would be [Co(SCN)4]^2- or similar. But wait, the question specifically asks about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, right? So that would be the Co(SCN)_2 complex. But wait, which one has two SCN-? So β2 is 40, that's the stability constant for the +2 charge? Or maybe it's the second complex.

Wait, the problem is asking about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. I'm trying to recall if the blue color is associated with the tetra-aqua or some other complex. Oh, wait, in the case of Co(II), the [Co(H2O)6]^2+ is pink, and when SCN- comes in, it forms [Co(SCN)]^+, which is blue, but wait, no, wait. I think that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue. Or wait, maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is blue. I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

Wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato", which is two SCN- groups. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2] something. The charge would be 2+ for each SCN- (since SCN- is -1). So two SCN- would contribute -2. Co^2+ plus two SCN^- would be neutral? Wait, [Co(SCN)_2] would be Co^2+ plus 2 SCN^- each with charge -1. So the complex would have a charge of 0? Or wait, no, I think the formula is [Co(SCN)_n]^m. So for n=2, let's see: Co is 2+, each SCN is -1. So 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So the complex would be neutral, but wait, that doesn't make sense because Co^2+ can't form a neutral complex with just two SCN^-? Or wait, maybe the charge is +2 - (n * 1). Wait, let me think again. For each SCN-, it's a -1 charge. So for n SCN-, the total negative charge is n*(-1). The Co^2+ has a +2 charge. So the overall charge is 2+ - n*(-1) = 2+ - (n) * (-1) )= 2+ - (-n) → 2+ +n. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, the formula is [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge). So Co is +2. Each SCN is -1. So the charge of the complex is +2 - n*(1), because each SCN is contributing -1. Wait, no, because each SCN is a ligand, so each contributes -1. So the complex charge is Co's charge plus the sum of ligand charges. So [Co(SCN)_n]^m → m = 2+ + (n * (-1)). So m = 2 - n.

So for n=1: m=1+. For n=2: m=0. For n=3: m= -1. For n=4: m= -2. So the complexes would have charges 1+, 0, -1, -2.

But the question is about the dithiocyanato complexes, which is n=2. So that would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, a neutral complex.

Hmm. But I'm not entirely sure about the colors. I think the blue color is more associated with the tetra-aqua complex, but wait, I might be mixing up Co(III) and Co(II). Let me think: [Co(H2O)6]^2+ is pink, and when SCN- is added, it forms [Co(H2O)(SCN)_5]^+, which is blue, but that's a different scenario. Or wait, maybe the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue, which would be n=4. Hmm, but the question is about dithiocyanato, which is n=2. So perhaps I'm wrong about the color. Oh! Wait, maybe the first complex, the monothiocyanato, [Co(SCN)]^+, is blue. Because I've heard that adding SCN- to Co(II) solution gives a blue color due to [Co(SCN)]^+.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. So the blue is the dithiocyanato, which is n=2. So the complex in question is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So its stability constant is β2=40.

Wait, but the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β1 is for n=1, β2 for n=2, β3 for n=3, β4 for n=4. That makes sense.

So, the problem is to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (the dithiocyanato complex) among all cobalt species in solution. The total cobalt concentration is [Co] = 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M.

I think I need to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the others, based on their stability constants and the ligand concentration.

In such cases, the fraction of each complex is determined by the log of the stability constants and the ligand concentrations.

Wait, the general approach is that the fraction of each complex is proportional to (β^n * [SCN-]^n) / (total), where n is the number of ligands attached. But wait, the total is the sum over all possible n of (β^n * [SCN-]^n). Hmm, but wait, the formula for the fraction f_n is (β^n [SCN]^n) / (Σ (β^m [SCN]^m) for m=0 to 4), where m is the number of SCN attached.

Wait, but for each complex, the expression is β_n * [SCN]^n.

Wait, no. The stability constant β_n is defined as [complex]/([Co^2+][SCN]^n). So [complex] = β_n [Co^2+][SCN]^n.

The total concentration of Co is the sum of all possible complexes plus the free Co^2+ (but wait, in this case, the free Co^2+ is part of the species. So the total [Co] is [Co^2+] + Σ [complex_n].

But in our case, the total [Co] is given as 1e-2 M, so it's the sum of all species, including the free Co^2+ and all the complexes.

Wait, but perhaps in this scenario, the concentration of free Co^2+ is very low due to the high ligand concentration. Wait, the [SCN-] is 0.1 M, which is higher than the [Co^2+] (0.01 M), so the ligand is in excess, so most of the Co^2+ would be complexed. But maybe not all. So we need to find the fraction of each complex.

Hmm, but to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2], which is the n=2 complex, we can model the distribution of Co species using the stability constants and the [SCN-] concentration.

The approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex, f_n, which is equal to (β_n [SCN]^n) / (β_0 [Co^2+] [SCN]^0 + β_1 [Co^2+][SCN]^1 + β_2 [Co^2+][SCN]^2 + ... + β_4 [Co^2+] [SCN]^4 )

But wait, the problem is that [Co^2+] is present in all terms. So maybe we can factor that out. Let me define [Co^2+] as a variable, say x.

So the total [Co] is x (free) + sum over n (β_n x [SCN]^n) ) = 1e-2 M.

Hmm, but that's a bit complicated because x is in all terms. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that x is negligible compared to the sum, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, perhaps it's better to let the fraction f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 β_m [SCN]^m )

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The fraction of each complex is [complex_n] / total [Co], where total [Co] is [Co^2+] + sum [complex_n].

Wait, but perhaps we can model the distribution using the following approach: for each n, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n] is β_n [Co^2+][SCN-]^n.

The total concentration of Co is [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} [Co(SCN)_n} ] = 1e-2 M.

But solving for [Co^2+] would involve setting up an equation:

[Co^2+] + β_1 [Co^2+][SCN]^1 + β_2 [Co^2+][SCN]^2 + β_3 [Co^2+][SCN]^3 + β_4 [Co^2+][SCN]^4 = 1e-2.

We can factor out [Co^2+]:

[Co^2+] (1 + β_1 [SCN] + β_2 [SCN]^2 + β_3 [SCN]^3 + β_4 [SCN]^4 ) ) = 1e-2.

So,

[Co^2+] = (1e-2) / (1 + β_1 [SCN] + β_2 [SCN]^2 + β_3 [SCN]^3 + β_4 [SCN]^4 )

Once we have [Co^2+], we can compute each [complex_n] as β_n [Co^2+][SCN]^n.

The fraction f_n for each complex is [complex_n] / total [Co], which is [Co^2+] (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (1e-2).

So, f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (1 + β_1 [SCN] + β_2 [SCN]^2 + β_3 [SCN]^3 + β_4 [SCN]^4 )

So, the denominator is the same for all f_n, and the numerator is β_n [SCN]^n.

So, let me compute each term in the denominator:

Given [SCN] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term_0 = 1 (since it's 1 in the denominator expression)

Term_1 = β_1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term_2 = β_2 * [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

Term_3 = β_3 * [SCN]^3 =63 * (0.1)^3 =63 * 0.001=0.063

Term_4 =β_4 * [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001 =0.0016

Now sum them all up:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

+0.4 → 2.3

+0.063 → 2.363

+0.0016 → 2.3646.

So denominator = sum = 2.3646.

Now, for each n, compute numerator = β_n [SCN]^n.

So for n=2:

numerator = β_2 [SCN]^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

So f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ let's calculate that.

Let me compute 0.4 ÷ 2.3646.

Well, 2.3646 ≈ 2.3646.

So 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ let's see, 2.3646 × 0.169 ≈ 0.399.

So 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ approximately 0.169, or 16.9%.

Wait, but wait, the options have 16.9% as option D. So is that correct?

Wait, but wait. The denominator in the fraction f_n is the sum of all terms, which is 2.3646. So for f_2, 0.4 / 2.3646 is approximately 0.169, which is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, earlier I thought that [Co(SCN)_2] is the dithiocyanato complex. But if the calculation gives 16.9%, which is option D, but I have to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial assumption about which complex is blue.

Wait, what if the blue complex is the monothiocyanate ([Co(SCN)]^+) instead? Let me think. So n=1 would have β1=9.

If the blue complex is n=1, then for f_1, the numerator would be 9 * 0.1 = 0.9. So f_1 = 0.9 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.381, which is 38.1%. That's option C.

Hmm, that's a problem. So now I'm confused. Which complex is blue?

Wait, I think I mixed up the colors. Let me think again. Co(II) complexes with thiocyanate:

The first complex formed when SCN- is added is [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1), which is blue. Then, with excess SCN-, it forms [Co(SCN)_2], which may precipitate as a different color, but perhaps it's not blue. Or maybe [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue. I'm a bit shaky on the exact colors.

Wait, I might be confusing Co(II) with Co(III). Let me think again. Co(II) in solution forms [Co(H2O)6]^2+ which is pink. When SCN- is added, it replaces some water ligands. The first complex is [Co(H2O)(SCN)_5]^+ which is blue. Wait, but that's n=5 SCN- ligands. Hmm, but in this problem, the complexes are up to n=4.

Alternatively, maybe the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue. Let me check some references in my mind. Oh, wait, I think the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue. So n=4.

Wait, that would mean that the stability constant β4 is 16. So to find the percentage for n=4, I'll have to compute f_4.

So, let's compute f_4.

f_4 = (β4 [SCN]^4) / sum.

β4 is 16, [SCN]^4 is (0.1)^4 = 0.0001. So 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016.

So f_4 is 0.0016 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.000676, which is 0.0676% (less than 0.1%). So that's not a major component.

Wait, but that's only 0.0676% which is way below the options given, so perhaps I was wrong about which complex is blue.

Alternatively, maybe the [Co(SCN)_2] complex is blue. Let me think again. If the blue is for n=2, then our initial calculation of 16.9% is correct, but that's option D. But looking at the options, option C is 38.1%, which would be f_1. So perhaps I got the wrong complex for the color.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this all wrong, and the correct approach is to compute all the fractions and see which one matches the options.

Let me compute all f_n:

For each n:

n=0: [Co^2+] is free. f_0 = 1/2.3646 ≈0.423 →42.3% (option A)

n=1: 0.9/2.3646 ≈0.381 →38.1% (option C)

n=2: 0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9% (option D)

n=3: 0.063 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.0266 →2.66%

n=4: 0.0016 /2.3646≈0.000676 →0.0676%

So the percentages are:

n=0: ~42.3%

n=1: ~38.1%

n=2: ~16.9%

n=3: ~2.66%

n=4: ~0.0676%

So the major species are n=0 (free Co^2+), n=1, and n=2.

Wait, but the total sum of all f_n should be 100%, let me check:

42.3 +38.1=80.4, plus 16.9=97.3, plus 2.66=99.96, plus 0.0676≈99.96+0.0676=100.0276%, which is almost 100%, considering rounding errors.

So the largest fraction is n=0 (42.3%), then n=1 (38.1%), then n=2 (16.9%).

So if the question is asking about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes, which is n=2, then the answer would be 16.9%, option D.

But wait, earlier I thought that the blue color is for [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1), which would be 38.1% (option C). But the question refers to dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- groups, so n=2.

Alternatively, perhaps the dithiocyanate complex is n=2, but the color is not blue. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should focus on what the problem states. It says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." So dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

But looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which matches that.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused because another thought is that maybe the solution considers the sum of all the complex species, excluding the free Co^2+.

But according to the calculation, the [Co(SCN)_2] is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, what's the actual question? It says, "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution."

Ah, all cobalt-containing species include all the complexes and the free Co^2+. So the [Co(SCN)_2] is a cobalt-containing species, and the percentage is 16.9% of all, which includes all the other species.

So the correct answer is 16.9%, option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the stability constants and the given concentrations.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: $[\text{Co}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}$
- Thiocyanate concentration: $[\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}$
- Stability constants:  
  $\beta_1 = 9$, $\beta_2 = 40$, $\beta_3 = 63$, $\beta_4 = 16$

The general formula for the fraction of each cobalt complex is:  
\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m}
\]
where $n$ is the number of thiocyanate ligands attached to cobalt.

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
The denominator is the sum of all terms $\beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m$ for $m = 0$ to $4$:
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Term}_0 &= 1, \\
\text{Term}_1 &= \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9, \\
\text{Term}_2 &= \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4, \\
\text{Term}_3 &= \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063, \\
\text{Term}_4 &= \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016.
\end{align*}
\]
Summing these terms:
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]
The numerator for $n = 2$ is:
\[
\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4.
\]
Thus, the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169.
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
The percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] is:
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%.
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution is **16.9%**.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the percentage of a particular cobalt complex in solution. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with stability constants and the distribution of metal complexes based on ligand concentration and the constants.

Alright, so the problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, wait, that seems a bit odd because usually the higher β means a more stable complex. Oh, maybe they are in order of increasing n, like the number of SCN- ligands? So, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)2]^ something, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^- or something, and β4 would be [Co(SCN)4]^2- or similar. But wait, the question specifically asks about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, right? So that would be the Co(SCN)_2 complex. But wait, which one has two SCN-? So β2 is 40, that's the stability constant for the +2 charge? Or maybe it's the second complex.

Wait, the problem is asking about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. I'm trying to recall if the blue color is associated with the tetra-aqua or some other complex. Oh, wait, in the case of Co(II), the [Co(H2O)6]^2+ is pink, and when SCN- comes in, it forms [Co(SCN)]^+, which is blue, but wait, no, wait. I think that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue. Or wait, maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is blue. I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

Wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato", which is two SCN- groups. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2] something. The charge would be 2+ for each SCN- (since SCN- is -1). So two SCN- would contribute -2. Co^2+ plus two SCN^- would be neutral? Wait, [Co(SCN)_2] would be Co^2+ plus 2 SCN^- each with charge -1. So the complex would have a charge of 0? Or wait, no, I think the formula is [Co(SCN)_n]^m. So for n=2, let's see: Co is 2+, each SCN is -1. So 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So the complex would be neutral, but wait, that doesn't make sense because Co^2+ can't form a neutral complex with just two SCN^-? Or wait, maybe the charge is +2 - (n * 1). Wait, let me think again. For each SCN-, it's a -1 charge. So for n SCN-, the total negative charge is n*(-1). The Co^2+ has a +2 charge. So the overall charge is 2+ - n*(-1) = 2+ - (n) * (-1) )= 2+ - (-n) → 2+ +n. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, the formula is [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge). So Co is +2. Each SCN is -1. So the charge of the complex is +2 - n*(1), because each SCN is contributing -1. Wait, no, because each SCN is a ligand, so each contributes -1. So the complex charge is Co's charge plus the sum of ligand charges. So [Co(SCN)_n]^m → m = 2+ + (n * (-1)). So m = 2 - n.

So for n=1: m=1+. For n=2: m=0. For n=3: m= -1. For n=4: m= -2. So the complexes would have charges 1+, 0, -1, -2.

But the question is about the dithiocyanato complexes, which is n=2. So that would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, a neutral complex.

Hmm. But I'm not entirely sure about the colors. I think the blue color is more associated with the tetra-aqua complex, but wait, I might be mixing up Co(III) and Co(II). Let me think: [Co(H2O)6]^2+ is pink, and when SCN- is added, it forms [Co(H2O)(SCN)_5]^+, which is blue, but that's a different scenario. Or wait, maybe the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue, which would be n=4. Hmm, but the question is about dithiocyanato, which is n=2. So perhaps I'm wrong about the color. Oh! Wait, maybe the first complex, the monothiocyanato, [Co(SCN)]^+, is blue. Because I've heard that adding SCN- to Co(II) solution gives a blue color due to [Co(SCN)]^+.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. So the blue is the dithiocyanato, which is n=2. So the complex in question is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So its stability constant is β2=40.

Wait, but the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β1 is for n=1, β2 for n=2, β3 for n=3, β4 for n=4. That makes sense.

So, the problem is to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (the dithiocyanato complex) among all cobalt species in solution. The total cobalt concentration is [Co] = 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M.

I think I need to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the others, based on their stability constants and the ligand concentration.

In such cases, the fraction of each complex is determined by the log of the stability constants and the ligand concentrations.

Wait, the general approach is that the fraction of each complex is proportional to (β^n * [SCN-]^n) / (total), where n is the number of ligands attached. But wait, the total is the sum over all possible n of (β^n * [SCN-]^n). Hmm, but wait, the formula for the fraction f_n is (β^n [SCN]^n) / (Σ (β^m [SCN]^m) for m=0 to 4), where m is the number of SCN attached.

Wait, but for each complex, the expression is β_n * [SCN]^n.

Wait, no. The stability constant β_n is defined as [complex]/([Co^2+][SCN]^n). So [complex] = β_n [Co^2+][SCN]^n.

The total concentration of Co is the sum of all possible complexes plus the free Co^2+ (but wait, in this case, the free Co^2+ is part of the species. So the total [Co] is [Co^2+] + Σ [complex_n].

But in our case, the total [Co] is given as 1e-2 M, so it's the sum of all species, including the free Co^2+ and all the complexes.

Wait, but perhaps in this scenario, the concentration of free Co^2+ is very low due to the high ligand concentration. Wait, the [SCN-] is 0.1 M, which is higher than the [Co^2+] (0.01 M), so the ligand is in excess, so most of the Co^2+ would be complexed. But maybe not all. So we need to find the fraction of each complex.

Hmm, but to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2], which is the n=2 complex, we can model the distribution of Co species using the stability constants and the [SCN-] concentration.

The approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex, f_n, which is equal to (β_n [SCN]^n) / (β_0 [Co^2+] [SCN]^0 + β_1 [Co^2+][SCN]^1 + β_2 [Co^2+][SCN]^2 + ... + β_4 [Co^2+] [SCN]^4 )

But wait, the problem is that [Co^2+] is present in all terms. So maybe we can factor that out. Let me define [Co^2+] as a variable, say x.

So the total [Co] is x (free) + sum over n (β_n x [SCN]^n) ) = 1e-2 M.

Hmm, but that's a bit complicated because x is in all terms. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that x is negligible compared to the sum, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, perhaps it's better to let the fraction f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 β_m [SCN]^m )

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The fraction of each complex is [complex_n] / total [Co], where total [Co] is [Co^2+] + sum [complex_n].

Wait, but perhaps we can model the distribution using the following approach: for each n, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n] is β_n [Co^2+][SCN-]^n.

The total concentration of Co is [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} [Co(SCN)_n} ] = 1e-2 M.

But solving for [Co^2+] would involve setting up an equation:

[Co^2+] + β_1 [Co^2+][SCN]^1 + β_2 [Co^2+][SCN]^2 + β_3 [Co^2+][SCN]^3 + β_4 [Co^2+][SCN]^4 = 1e-2.

We can factor out [Co^2+]:

[Co^2+] (1 + β_1 [SCN] + β_2 [SCN]^2 + β_3 [SCN]^3 + β_4 [SCN]^4 ) ) = 1e-2.

So,

[Co^2+] = (1e-2) / (1 + β_1 [SCN] + β_2 [SCN]^2 + β_3 [SCN]^3 + β_4 [SCN]^4 )

Once we have [Co^2+], we can compute each [complex_n] as β_n [Co^2+][SCN]^n.

The fraction f_n for each complex is [complex_n] / total [Co], which is [Co^2+] (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (1e-2).

So, f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (1 + β_1 [SCN] + β_2 [SCN]^2 + β_3 [SCN]^3 + β_4 [SCN]^4 )

So, the denominator is the same for all f_n, and the numerator is β_n [SCN]^n.

So, let me compute each term in the denominator:

Given [SCN] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term_0 = 1 (since it's 1 in the denominator expression)

Term_1 = β_1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term_2 = β_2 * [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

Term_3 = β_3 * [SCN]^3 =63 * (0.1)^3 =63 * 0.001=0.063

Term_4 =β_4 * [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001 =0.0016

Now sum them all up:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

+0.4 → 2.3

+0.063 → 2.363

+0.0016 → 2.3646.

So denominator = sum = 2.3646.

Now, for each n, compute numerator = β_n [SCN]^n.

So for n=2:

numerator = β_2 [SCN]^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

So f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ let's calculate that.

Let me compute 0.4 ÷ 2.3646.

Well, 2.3646 ≈ 2.3646.

So 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ let's see, 2.3646 × 0.169 ≈ 0.399.

So 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ approximately 0.169, or 16.9%.

Wait, but wait, the options have 16.9% as option D. So is that correct?

Wait, but wait. The denominator in the fraction f_n is the sum of all terms, which is 2.3646. So for f_2, 0.4 / 2.3646 is approximately 0.169, which is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, earlier I thought that [Co(SCN)_2] is the dithiocyanato complex. But if the calculation gives 16.9%, which is option D, but I have to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial assumption about which complex is blue.

Wait, what if the blue complex is the monothiocyanate ([Co(SCN)]^+) instead? Let me think. So n=1 would have β1=9.

If the blue complex is n=1, then for f_1, the numerator would be 9 * 0.1 = 0.9. So f_1 = 0.9 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.381, which is 38.1%. That's option C.

Hmm, that's a problem. So now I'm confused. Which complex is blue?

Wait, I think I mixed up the colors. Let me think again. Co(II) complexes with thiocyanate:

The first complex formed when SCN- is added is [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1), which is blue. Then, with excess SCN-, it forms [Co(SCN)_2], which may precipitate as a different color, but perhaps it's not blue. Or maybe [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue. I'm a bit shaky on the exact colors.

Wait, I might be confusing Co(II) with Co(III). Let me think again. Co(II) in solution forms [Co(H2O)6]^2+ which is pink. When SCN- is added, it replaces some water ligands. The first complex is [Co(H2O)(SCN)_5]^+ which is blue. Wait, but that's n=5 SCN- ligands. Hmm, but in this problem, the complexes are up to n=4.

Alternatively, maybe the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue. Let me check some references in my mind. Oh, wait, I think the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue. So n=4.

Wait, that would mean that the stability constant β4 is 16. So to find the percentage for n=4, I'll have to compute f_4.

So, let's compute f_4.

f_4 = (β4 [SCN]^4) / sum.

β4 is 16, [SCN]^4 is (0.1)^4 = 0.0001. So 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016.

So f_4 is 0.0016 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.000676, which is 0.0676% (less than 0.1%). So that's not a major component.

Wait, but that's only 0.0676% which is way below the options given, so perhaps I was wrong about which complex is blue.

Alternatively, maybe the [Co(SCN)_2] complex is blue. Let me think again. If the blue is for n=2, then our initial calculation of 16.9% is correct, but that's option D. But looking at the options, option C is 38.1%, which would be f_1. So perhaps I got the wrong complex for the color.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this all wrong, and the correct approach is to compute all the fractions and see which one matches the options.

Let me compute all f_n:

For each n:

n=0: [Co^2+] is free. f_0 = 1/2.3646 ≈0.423 →42.3% (option A)

n=1: 0.9/2.3646 ≈0.381 →38.1% (option C)

n=2: 0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9% (option D)

n=3: 0.063 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.0266 →2.66%

n=4: 0.0016 /2.3646≈0.000676 →0.0676%

So the percentages are:

n=0: ~42.3%

n=1: ~38.1%

n=2: ~16.9%

n=3: ~2.66%

n=4: ~0.0676%

So the major species are n=0 (free Co^2+), n=1, and n=2.

Wait, but the total sum of all f_n should be 100%, let me check:

42.3 +38.1=80.4, plus 16.9=97.3, plus 2.66=99.96, plus 0.0676≈99.96+0.0676=100.0276%, which is almost 100%, considering rounding errors.

So the largest fraction is n=0 (42.3%), then n=1 (38.1%), then n=2 (16.9%).

So if the question is asking about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes, which is n=2, then the answer would be 16.9%, option D.

But wait, earlier I thought that the blue color is for [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1), which would be 38.1% (option C). But the question refers to dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- groups, so n=2.

Alternatively, perhaps the dithiocyanate complex is n=2, but the color is not blue. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should focus on what the problem states. It says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." So dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

But looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which matches that.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused because another thought is that maybe the solution considers the sum of all the complex species, excluding the free Co^2+.

But according to the calculation, the [Co(SCN)_2] is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, what's the actual question? It says, "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution."

Ah, all cobalt-containing species include all the complexes and the free Co^2+. So the [Co(SCN)_2] is a cobalt-containing species, and the percentage is 16.9% of all, which includes all the other species.

So the correct answer is 16.9%, option D.


To determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the stability constants and the given concentrations.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: $[\text{Co}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}$
- Thiocyanate concentration: $[\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}$
- Stability constants:  
  $\beta_1 = 9$, $\beta_2 = 40$, $\beta_3 = 63$, $\beta_4 = 16$

The general formula for the fraction of each cobalt complex is:  
\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m}
\]
where $n$ is the number of thiocyanate ligands attached to cobalt.

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
The denominator is the sum of all terms $\beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m$ for $m = 0$ to $4$:
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Term}_0 &= 1, \\
\text{Term}_1 &= \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9, \\
\text{Term}_2 &= \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4, \\
\text{Term}_3 &= \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063, \\
\text{Term}_4 &= \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016.
\end{align*}
\]
Summing these terms:
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]
The numerator for $n = 2$ is:
\[
\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4.
\]
Thus, the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169.
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
The percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] is:
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%.
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution is **16.9%**.
