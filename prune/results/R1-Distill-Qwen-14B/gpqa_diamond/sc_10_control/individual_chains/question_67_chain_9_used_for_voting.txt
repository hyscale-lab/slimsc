Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again and try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about two electrons in p orbitals. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l=1. So the problem is dealing with their orbital angular momentum states. Spin is being ignored here, so I don't have to worry about that part.

The given state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, so l1 and l2 are both 1, which makes sense because they're p orbitals. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, which is the sum of l1 and l2 (1+1=2). The m value is -1. 

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. Specifically, what's the joint probability that both measurements give -ħ? 

Wait, L_z is the z-component of angular momentum. For each electron, L1z and L2z have eigenvalues m1ħ and m2ħ, respectively. So for both to be -ħ, each must have m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. 

Now, the state given is |1,1,2,-1>. I think this must be an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared (L²) and its z-component (Lz). So, the state is an eigenstate of Lz with eigenvalue mħ. In this case, m is -1, so Lz = -ħ. 

But how does this relate to the individual electrons' m1 and m2? Because the total m (which is -1) is the sum of m1 and m2. So, m = m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, the electrons are in a coupled angular momentum state. So their individual states are combined into a state with total l and m. To find the probability of both electrons having m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, I need to expand the given state in terms of the product states |m1, m2> and find the amplitude for m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Alternatively, the state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1> is a combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

But wait, the total state should be a combination of all possible m1 and m2 pairs that sum to m_total. So for m_total = -1, the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0), (0,-1), and maybe (-2,1) but wait, since each electron can only have m values from -1 to +1. So possible pairs where m1 + m2 = -1 are (-1,0), (0,-1), but also ( -2, 1) is not possible because l1 and l2 are 1, so m1 and m2 can't be -2 or 2. So the possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait no, m1 can be -1, 0, +1 and same for m2. So m1 + m2 = -1 can happen when:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → sum is -1.

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum is -1.

m1=1, m2=-2 → but m2 can't be -2 since l=1, so m2 ranges from -1 to +1. So only two possibilities.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a linear combination of these two states: |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

But wait, when combining two angular momenta, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients come into play. The state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a combination of |m1, m2> states with m1 + m2 = m_total = -1.

I think the expansion is:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( (1)(1+2) ) / sqrt( (2)(2+1) ) ) × [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ].

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact coefficients, but the key point is that the state is a superposition of the two possible (m1,m2) pairs that sum to -1.

So the state is an equal superposition of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, scaled by some normalization factor.

Wait, no, wait. The coefficients are given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For adding two angular momenta j1=1 and j2=1 to get J=2, m_J=-1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for m1 + m2 = m_J is <m1, m2 | J, m_J>.

The formula for the coefficients when J = j1 + j2 (like 1+1=2) is something like sqrt( (j + m)(j - m + 1) ) / sqrt(2j(2j + 1)) ) when m is negative, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, for J=2 and m_J = -1, the state is a combination of m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1.

Looking it up in my notes, the state |j1=1, j2=1, J=2, M=-1> can be expressed as:

|1,1,2,-1> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ |1, -2> + |0, -1> + |-1, 0> + ... ] Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, for M=-1, the possible m1 and m2 are:

m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

m2 same.

So for m1 + m2 = -1:

m1 = -1 → m2 = 0 → state |m1=-1, m2=0>.

m1=0 → m2=-1 → state |m1=0, m2=-1>.

m1=1 → m2=-2 → but m2 can't be -2, so that's not allowed.

So the state is a combination of those two. Let's find the coefficients.

The general formula for the CG coefficients is:

< m1, m2 | J, M> = sqrt( ( ( J - M + m2 )! ( J + M - m1 )! ) / ( ( J + M + m1 + 1 )! ( J - M - m2 + 1 )! ) ) ) * something.

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to recall for two spin-1 particles, the states for J=2 and M=-1.

Wait, for two spin-1 particles:

The state |2, -1> is a combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, the expansion is:

|2, -1> = [ |1, -2> (invalid) + |0, -1> ] + [ | -1, 0> ] ?

Wait no, I'm getting confused. Let me think. For two spin-1 particles, when combining to J=2 and M=-1, the possible (m1, m2) are:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → sum -1.

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum -1.

But wait, I also have m1=1, m2=-2, but m2 can't be -2 because each particle has l=1, so m can only be -1,0,1.

So the only possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

So the state |1,1,2,-1> should be a normalized sum of these two states.

What's the normalization factor?

The coefficients are sqrt( ( (J + m1 + 1) (J - m1) ) / ( (2J +1) (J +1) ) ) ), but I'm not exactly recalling correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many ways to reach M from m1 and m2.

Wait, another approach. The number of terms in the state for |J,M> is determined by how many ways you can get M from m1 + m2.

For J=2, M=-1.

Each term in the expansion corresponds to a (m1, m2) pair where m1 + m2 = M = -1.

The coefficients are such that each term is multiplied by a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

I think for two spin-1 particles, the coefficients for J=2 and M=-1 would be:

|2, -1> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ |1, -2> (invalid) + |0, -1> + |-1, 0> ].

Wait, but wait again. If J=2, M=-1, the possible pairs (m1, m2) are:

m1=1, m2=-2 → invalid.

m1=0, m2=-1 → valid.

m1=-1, m2=0 → valid.

So only two terms. So the state would be |2, -1> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ |0, -1> + |-1, 0> ].

Wait, but let me check the normalization. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1.

Each term is (1/sqrt(2)) squared is 1/2, and there are two terms, so 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So that works.

So the state is (1/sqrt(2)) (|0, -1> + |-1, 0>).

So, the given state |1,1,2,-1> is exactly this combination.

Now, the question is about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. That is, m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Wait, no. Because L1z has eigenvalues m1 ħ, so if m1 is -1, then L1z is -ħ. Similarly for m2.

So the measurement is m1 = -1 and m2 =-1. So the product state is |m1=-1, m2=-1> = |-1, -1>.

But wait, in our state |2,-1>, the expansion is (1/sqrt(2)) (|0,-1> + |-1, 0>). There's no |-1,-1> term in this expansion.

So the coefficient for |-1,-1> in the state |2,-1> is zero.

Therefore, the amplitude for |-1,-1> is zero, so the probability is |0|² = 0.

So the probability is zero.

Wait, but let me think again. The state is a combination of (0,-1) and (-1,0). So the only possible outcomes when measuring m1 and m2 are:

Either m1=0 and m2=-1, or m1=-1 and m2=0.

Thus, the possible results are one electron has m=-1 and the other has m=0.

There's no term where both have m=-1. So the probability for both being -1 is zero.

So the answer is D, which is 0.

The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, where each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state of the two-electron system is given as \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \). Here, \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, \( l \) is the total angular momentum quantum number, and \( m \) is the total \( z \)-component of angular momentum.

The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \), which corresponds to \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \). To determine this, the given state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) must be expressed in terms of the product states \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \), where \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the \( z \)-components of the orbital angular momentum for the two electrons.

For the total \( m = -1 \), the possible pairs \( (m_1, m_2) \) that satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \) are:
- \( (m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0) \)
- \( (m_1, m_2) = (0, -1) \)

The state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) is a normalized superposition of these two states:
\[
|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle + |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle \right).
\]

There is no term in the expansion corresponding to \( (m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1) \), meaning the coefficient for \( |-1, -1\rangle \) is zero. Therefore, the probability of measuring \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \) is:
\[
P(m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1) = |0|^2 = 0.
\]

Thus, the joint probability of obtaining \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) is zero.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again and try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about two electrons in p orbitals. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l=1. So the problem is dealing with their orbital angular momentum states. Spin is being ignored here, so I don't have to worry about that part.

The given state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, so l1 and l2 are both 1, which makes sense because they're p orbitals. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, which is the sum of l1 and l2 (1+1=2). The m value is -1. 

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. Specifically, what's the joint probability that both measurements give -ħ? 

Wait, L_z is the z-component of angular momentum. For each electron, L1z and L2z have eigenvalues m1ħ and m2ħ, respectively. So for both to be -ħ, each must have m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. 

Now, the state given is |1,1,2,-1>. I think this must be an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared (L²) and its z-component (Lz). So, the state is an eigenstate of Lz with eigenvalue mħ. In this case, m is -1, so Lz = -ħ. 

But how does this relate to the individual electrons' m1 and m2? Because the total m (which is -1) is the sum of m1 and m2. So, m = m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, the electrons are in a coupled angular momentum state. So their individual states are combined into a state with total l and m. To find the probability of both electrons having m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, I need to expand the given state in terms of the product states |m1, m2> and find the amplitude for m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Alternatively, the state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1> is a combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

But wait, the total state should be a combination of all possible m1 and m2 pairs that sum to m_total. So for m_total = -1, the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0), (0,-1), and maybe (-2,1) but wait, since each electron can only have m values from -1 to +1. So possible pairs where m1 + m2 = -1 are (-1,0), (0,-1), but also ( -2, 1) is not possible because l1 and l2 are 1, so m1 and m2 can't be -2 or 2. So the possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait no, m1 can be -1, 0, +1 and same for m2. So m1 + m2 = -1 can happen when:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → sum is -1.

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum is -1.

m1=1, m2=-2 → but m2 can't be -2 since l=1, so m2 ranges from -1 to +1. So only two possibilities.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a linear combination of these two states: |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

But wait, when combining two angular momenta, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients come into play. The state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a combination of |m1, m2> states with m1 + m2 = m_total = -1.

I think the expansion is:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( (1)(1+2) ) / sqrt( (2)(2+1) ) ) × [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ].

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact coefficients, but the key point is that the state is a superposition of the two possible (m1,m2) pairs that sum to -1.

So the state is an equal superposition of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, scaled by some normalization factor.

Wait, no, wait. The coefficients are given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For adding two angular momenta j1=1 and j2=1 to get J=2, m_J=-1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for m1 + m2 = m_J is <m1, m2 | J, m_J>.

The formula for the coefficients when J = j1 + j2 (like 1+1=2) is something like sqrt( (j + m)(j - m + 1) ) / sqrt(2j(2j + 1)) ) when m is negative, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, for J=2 and m_J = -1, the state is a combination of m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1.

Looking it up in my notes, the state |j1=1, j2=1, J=2, M=-1> can be expressed as:

|1,1,2,-1> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ |1, -2> + |0, -1> + |-1, 0> + ... ] Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, for M=-1, the possible m1 and m2 are:

m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

m2 same.

So for m1 + m2 = -1:

m1 = -1 → m2 = 0 → state |m1=-1, m2=0>.

m1=0 → m2=-1 → state |m1=0, m2=-1>.

m1=1 → m2=-2 → but m2 can't be -2, so that's not allowed.

So the state is a combination of those two. Let's find the coefficients.

The general formula for the CG coefficients is:

< m1, m2 | J, M> = sqrt( ( ( J - M + m2 )! ( J + M - m1 )! ) / ( ( J + M + m1 + 1 )! ( J - M - m2 + 1 )! ) ) ) * something.

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to recall for two spin-1 particles, the states for J=2 and M=-1.

Wait, for two spin-1 particles:

The state |2, -1> is a combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, the expansion is:

|2, -1> = [ |1, -2> (invalid) + |0, -1> ] + [ | -1, 0> ] ?

Wait no, I'm getting confused. Let me think. For two spin-1 particles, when combining to J=2 and M=-1, the possible (m1, m2) are:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → sum -1.

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum -1.

But wait, I also have m1=1, m2=-2, but m2 can't be -2 because each particle has l=1, so m can only be -1,0,1.

So the only possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

So the state |1,1,2,-1> should be a normalized sum of these two states.

What's the normalization factor?

The coefficients are sqrt( ( (J + m1 + 1) (J - m1) ) / ( (2J +1) (J +1) ) ) ), but I'm not exactly recalling correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many ways to reach M from m1 and m2.

Wait, another approach. The number of terms in the state for |J,M> is determined by how many ways you can get M from m1 + m2.

For J=2, M=-1.

Each term in the expansion corresponds to a (m1, m2) pair where m1 + m2 = M = -1.

The coefficients are such that each term is multiplied by a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

I think for two spin-1 particles, the coefficients for J=2 and M=-1 would be:

|2, -1> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ |1, -2> (invalid) + |0, -1> + |-1, 0> ].

Wait, but wait again. If J=2, M=-1, the possible pairs (m1, m2) are:

m1=1, m2=-2 → invalid.

m1=0, m2=-1 → valid.

m1=-1, m2=0 → valid.

So only two terms. So the state would be |2, -1> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ |0, -1> + |-1, 0> ].

Wait, but let me check the normalization. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1.

Each term is (1/sqrt(2)) squared is 1/2, and there are two terms, so 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So that works.

So the state is (1/sqrt(2)) (|0, -1> + |-1, 0>).

So, the given state |1,1,2,-1> is exactly this combination.

Now, the question is about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. That is, m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Wait, no. Because L1z has eigenvalues m1 ħ, so if m1 is -1, then L1z is -ħ. Similarly for m2.

So the measurement is m1 = -1 and m2 =-1. So the product state is |m1=-1, m2=-1> = |-1, -1>.

But wait, in our state |2,-1>, the expansion is (1/sqrt(2)) (|0,-1> + |-1, 0>). There's no |-1,-1> term in this expansion.

So the coefficient for |-1,-1> in the state |2,-1> is zero.

Therefore, the amplitude for |-1,-1> is zero, so the probability is |0|² = 0.

So the probability is zero.

Wait, but let me think again. The state is a combination of (0,-1) and (-1,0). So the only possible outcomes when measuring m1 and m2 are:

Either m1=0 and m2=-1, or m1=-1 and m2=0.

Thus, the possible results are one electron has m=-1 and the other has m=0.

There's no term where both have m=-1. So the probability for both being -1 is zero.

So the answer is D, which is 0.


The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, where each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state of the two-electron system is given as \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \). Here, \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, \( l \) is the total angular momentum quantum number, and \( m \) is the total \( z \)-component of angular momentum.

The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \), which corresponds to \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \). To determine this, the given state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) must be expressed in terms of the product states \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \), where \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the \( z \)-components of the orbital angular momentum for the two electrons.

For the total \( m = -1 \), the possible pairs \( (m_1, m_2) \) that satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \) are:
- \( (m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0) \)
- \( (m_1, m_2) = (0, -1) \)

The state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) is a normalized superposition of these two states:
\[
|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle + |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle \right).
\]

There is no term in the expansion corresponding to \( (m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1) \), meaning the coefficient for \( |-1, -1\rangle \) is zero. Therefore, the probability of measuring \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \) is:
\[
P(m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1) = |0|^2 = 0.
\]

Thus, the joint probability of obtaining \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) is zero.
