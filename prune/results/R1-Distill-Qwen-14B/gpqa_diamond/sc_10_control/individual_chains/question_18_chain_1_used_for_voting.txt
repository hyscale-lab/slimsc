Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see. I remember that these kinds of problems involve using the given abundance ratios to find the actual number ratios of elements. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

Wait, the given data includes [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, both stars have [Fe/H]_1 = 0 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. Oh wait, no, looking again: [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So for Star_1, the iron abundance is the same as the Sun's. And for Star_2, magnesium is same as the Sun's.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, so log(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12= -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for magnesium, log(nMg/nH)=7.5-12= -4.5? Wait wait, wait. Wait the Sun's data: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7? Or is it 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = something else. Let me re-read.

Ah, the problem says for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. So for Fe, log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12= -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^-4.5. Similarly, for Mg, log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5. So nMg/nH is 10^-5.

Now, I think I need to find the [Si/H] for each star, then compute the ratios.

Wait, the problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So (nSi_1)/(nSi_2).

But how do I get nSi for each star? I think I need to use the given abundance ratios and the Sun's data.

Let me think about Star_1 first.

Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun. So nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^-4.5.

Also, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. Which means (nSi_1/nFe_1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

Wait, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun) = log(nX/nY) - [X/Y]_sun. So for [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3, which is log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.3.

So, log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

Which means, nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

But wait, nFe_1 is nFe_sun, because [Fe/H]_1=0. So nFe_1 = nFe_sun *10^{0} =nFe_sun.

So nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

Since nFe_1 = nFe_sun, this becomes nFe_sun * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^{0.3} = nSi_sun * 10^{0.3}.

Wait, that's interesting. So the Si abundance in Star_1 is 10^{0.3} times that of the Sun. Because [Si/Fe] is +0.3, and Fe is same as Sun, so Si is higher.

Similarly, for Star_2.

Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. So log(nMg_2/nSi_2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) =0.3.

Which means, log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

So, nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

But I also know that [Mg/H]_2=0. So nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

Wait, nMg_2 = (nH_2) * (nMg_sun /nH_sun) = nH_2 * 10^-5.

Hmm. So from nMg_2 = nH_2 * 10^-5.

But we can also write nMg_2 = (nSi_2) * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

So: (nSi_2) * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3} = nH_2 * 10^-5.

Hmm, because nMg_2 = (nSi_2) * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Wait, maybe it's better to solve for nSi_2.

Let me try that. From the equation:

nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2.

Because [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

So nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2 = (10^-5) * nH_2.

Also, from [Mg/Si]_2=0.3:

nMg_2 / nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

So substituting nMg_2 from above:

(10^-5 * nH_2) / nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Wait, what is nMg_sun /nSi_sun?

Wait, for the Sun, nMg/nH =10^-5, and nFe/nH=10^-4.5.

But I need nMg/nSi. So nMg/nSi = (nMg/nH) / (nSi/nH) = (10^-5) / (nSi/nH)_sun.

Wait, what's nSi_sun /nH_sun?

Wait, the Sun's composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(7.5-12) =10^-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → nMg/nH =10^(7-12)=10^-5.

But what about nSi/nH_sun? Not directly given. Hmm, I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can express nSi_sun in terms of [Si/Fe]_sun or something. Wait, but I don't have [Si/Fe]_sun given. Oh wait, the problem doesn't give [Si/Fe]_sun, so maybe I can find it from the data given.

Wait, but wait. I have the Sun's nFe/nH and nMg/nH. But not nSi/nH. So I might need to assume that in the Sun, [Mg/Si] is a certain value. Alternatively, maybe we can find [Mg/Si]_sun from the given data.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. Since the problem is about the ratio of Si in the two stars compared to each other, maybe I can relate their Si abundances without needing the Sun's Si abundance.

Wait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of the Sun's nH, nFe, nMg, and then find nSi_1 and nSi_2.

Let me restate the variables:

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1 = nFe_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1 /nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) +0.3.

So, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But nFe_1 = nFe_sun. So,

nSi_1 = nFe_sun * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi_1 = nSi_sun *10^0.3.

So the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Sun is 10^0.3.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg_2 /nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) +0.3.

Also, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun).

Wait, nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun) → nMg_2 = (10^-5) * (nH_2 /nH_sun).

Because nMg_sun/nH_sun =10^-5.

So, substituting into the [Mg/Si] equation:

nMg_2 /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

Substituting nMg_2:

( (10^-5) (nH_2 /nH_sun) ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But nMg_sun /nSi_sun = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) → (10^-5) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Wait, that's (10^-5) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) = (10^-5) / (nSi/nH)_sun.

Hmm, but I don't know (nSi/nH)_sun. Oh wait, maybe I can find it from the other data.

Wait, but perhaps I can find nSi_sun in terms of other elements.

Wait, I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps I can express nSi_2 in terms of nH_2.

Wait, let's rearrange the equation.

nSi_2 = (nMg_2) / [ (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3} ) ]

But nMg_2 = (10^-5) * (nH_2/nH_sun).

So,

nSi_2 = [ (10^-5) (nH_2/nH_sun) ) ] / [ (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^{0.3} ) ]

But nMg_sun/nSi_sun = 10^-5 / (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Wait, so let me substitute that:

nMg_sun/nSi_sun = (10^-5) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

So, substituting into the equation:

nSi_2 = [ (10^-5) (nH_2/nH_sun) ) ] / [ (10^-5 / (nSi_sun/nH_sun)) * 10^{0.3} ) ].

Simplify denominator:

(10^-5 / (nSi_sun/nH_sun)) *10^{0.3} = (10^-5 *10^{0.3}) ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

So,

nSi_2 = [ (10^-5) (nH_2/nH_sun) ) ] / [ (10^(-5 + 0.3) ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) ]

Hmm, let's compute that.

Denominator becomes (10^(-4.7)) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

So,

nSi_2 = (10^-5) (nH_2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) / (10^-4.7) )

Simplify the exponents:

10^-5 /10^-4.7 = 10^(-5 +4.7) =10^-0.3.

So,

nSi_2 = (10^-0.3) * (nH_2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) )

Wait, but (nH_2/nH_sun) is (nH_2) * (nH_sun)^-1.

And (nSi_sun/nH_sun) is (nSi_sun) * (nH_sun)^-1.

So,

nSi_2 = 10^-0.3 * (nH_2) * (nH_sun)^-1 * nSi_sun * (nH_sun)^-1 )

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, (nH_2/nH_sun) is (nH_2) / (nH_sun).

And (nSi_sun/nH_sun) is (nSi_sun)/(nH_sun).

So,

nSi_2 = 10^-0.3 * [ (nH_2) / nH_sun ] * [ nSi_sun / nH_sun ].

Which is 10^-0.3 * nH_2 * nSi_sun / (nH_sun)^2.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I should express nH_2 in terms of other variables.

Wait, another approach: since all stars' atmospheres are considered under LTE, and using the EW method which gives abundance ratios, perhaps I can express the ratio of nSi_1 to nSi_2.

So, ratio = nSi_1 / nSi_2.

nSi_1 is nSi_sun *10^0.3.

nSi_2 is ... well, let's think again.

Wait, for Star_2, from [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, we have nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

And nMg_2 is (nMg_sun) * (nH_2/nH_sun) because [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, (nMg_sun (nH_2/nH_sun)) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Divide both sides by nMg_sun:

(nH_2)/(nH_sun nSi_2) = (1/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Rearranging, nSi_2 = (nH_2 / (nH_sun)) * (nSi_sun) * 10^{-0.3}.

So,

nSi_2 = (nH_2 / nH_sun) * nSi_sun *10^{-0.3}.

But what is (nH_2/nH_sun)?

Wait, for Star_2, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, but Star_2's [Fe/H] isn't given. Wait, in the problem statement, only [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

Wait, so Star_2's [Fe/H] is not given. Hmm, perhaps I need to find H in Star_2's photosphere. But without more info, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of nH_2 to nH_sun is needed. Let's think.

Wait, but perhaps H is the same in both stars as in the Sun? No, stars can have different H abundances, but perhaps these stars are main-sequence, which would have H as the dominant element. Hmm, but I don't think we can assume that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio nH_2/nH_sun can be expressed in terms of other abundances.

Wait, another thought: perhaps we can relate nH_2 to nFe_2 or nMg_2.

Wait, Star_2's [Fe/H] isn't given. So maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me try to proceed step by step.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = nFe_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

Thus, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

But nFe_1 =nFe_sun → nSi_1 = nFe_sun * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3 =nSi_sun *10^{0.3}.

So nSi_1 = nSi_sun *10^{0.3}.

For Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (nMg_2/nSi_2) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → (nMg_2/nH_2) = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

So substituting into the first equation:

(nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun)) / nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Divide both sides by nMg_sun:

(nH_2/(nH_sun)) /nSi_2 = (1/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Multiply both sides by nSi_2 and nSi_sun:

nSi_sun * (nH_2/(nH_sun)) ) = nSi_2 *10^{0.3}.

So,

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun * (nH_2/(nH_sun)) ) / 10^{0.3}.

Hmm, but I don't know nH_2. Oh wait, but perhaps I can relate nH_2 to nH_sun.

Wait, in Star_2, [Fe/H] isn't given, but I don't think there's data to find nH_2.

Hmm, perhaps I can express the ratio (nSi_1 /nSi_2) in terms of known quantities.

Because the problem asks for (nSi_1 /nSi_2 ), maybe I can write this ratio using the expressions we have.

nSi_1 =nSi_sun *10^{0.3}.

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun * (nH_2/(nH_sun)) ) /10^{0.3}.

So,

(nSi_1 /nSi_2) = [nSi_sun *10^{0.3} ] / [ (nSi_sun*(nH_2/nH_sun)) /10^{0.3} ) ]

Simplify:

= [10^{0.3} ] * [10^{0.3} ] / (nH_2/nH_sun) )

= (10^{0.6}) * (nH_sun /nH_2) )

But I still don't know nH_2/nH_sun. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I can find that using another relation in Star_2.

Wait, [Fe/H] is not given for Star_2, but perhaps we can find [Fe/H]_2 from the given data.

Wait, Star_2's [Fe/H] is not given. So perhaps I need to make another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can express nH_2 in terms of other elements in Star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of nH_2 to nH_sun by looking at the composition.

Wait, wait! Another thought: the total number of atoms in a star's photosphere is dominated by hydrogen, so nH is much larger than nFe or nMg. So perhaps the ratio nH_2/nH_sun might be related to the mass of the star, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps mass doesn't directly influence the abundance ratios if they are given as [X/H].

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the elemental abundances are determined using the EW method, assuming LTE. So the [X/H] is the logarithmic abundance relative to hydrogen.

Wait, [Fe/H]_1 =0, meaning that the Fe abundance is same as Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H] =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun.

Wait, but for Star_2, [Fe/H] is not given, so I can't directly say anything about Fe in Star_2.

Hmm, but perhaps I need to find the ratio (nH_2/nH_sun), which could be expressed in terms of other variables.

Wait, another approach: let's find the ratio of nH_2 to nH_sun from the fact that in Star_2, [Mg/H] =0 → nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But without knowing nMg_2, that doesn't help.

Wait, but perhaps I can express nH_2 in terms of other elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (nH_2/nH_sun) can be found using the relation for nSi_2.

Wait, let's go back to the equation for nSi_2:

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun)) ) / 10^{0.3}.

So, perhaps I can express (nH_2/nH_sun) = (nSi_2 *10^{0.3}) ) /nSi_sun.

But without knowing nSi_2, that's not helpful.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let me take a step back.

I need to find (nSi_1 /nSi_2).

nSi_1 =nSi_sun *10^{0.3}.

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun)) /10^{0.3}.

So, the ratio is:

(nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = [nSi_sun *10^{0.3}] / [ (nSi_sun (nH_2/nH_sun)) /10^{0.3} ]

= [10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} ] * [nH_sun /nH_2 ].

= 10^{0.6} * (nH_sun /nH_2 ).

But what is (nH_sun /nH_2 )? That's (nH_2 /nH_sun )^{-1}.

Hmm, but without knowing (nH_2/nH_sun ), I can't compute this.

Wait, but perhaps I can find another relation involving nH_2.

Wait, for Star_2, [Fe/H] is unknown, but perhaps we can find [Fe/H]_2 from the given data.

Wait, in Star_2, we have [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Fe/H]_2 using the fact that in the Sun, the [Fe/Mg] is known.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/Mg] can be calculated from its elemental abundances.

Wait, in the Sun, [Fe/Mg] = log(nFe/nMg) - log(nFe_sun/nMg_sun).

Wait, but no, [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun) = log( (nX/nY)/(nX_sun/nY_sun) ).

So, [Fe/Mg]_sun = log( (nFe/nMg) ) - log( nFe_sun/nMg_sun ).

Wait, but from the Sun's data:

nFe/nH=10^-4.5.

nMg/nH=10^-5.

So, nFe/nMg = (nFe/nH)/(nMg/nH) ) = (10^-4.5)/(10^-5) )= 10^{0.5}.

So, log(nFe/nMg) = 0.5.

And nFe_sun/nMg_sun = same as nFe/nMg in the Sun, which is 10^0.5.

So, [Fe/Mg]_sun = log(10^0.5) - log(10^0.5) )=0.

Hmm, so [Fe/Mg]_sun =0. So the Sun's Fe and Mg abundances are the same relative to each other.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps in Star_2, I can find [Fe/Mg]_2.

Wait, from Star_2's [Mg/Si] =0.3, [Mg/H] =0.

Hmm, but perhaps I can express [Fe/Mg]_2 in terms of other parameters.

Wait, but I don't have [Fe/Mg]_2 given.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Fe/Mg]_2 using [Fe/H]_2 and [Mg/H]_2.

Wait, [Fe/Mg]_2 = [Fe/H]_2 - [Mg/H]_2.

Because [Fe/Mg] = [Fe/H] - [Mg/H].

So, [Fe/Mg]_2 = [Fe/H]_2 -0 → [Fe/H]_2.

So, [Fe/Mg]_2 = [Fe/H]_2.

But without knowing [Fe/Mg]_2, I can't proceed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I don't need to know nH_2. Maybe I can find the ratio in terms of Sun's H.

Wait, let me think about the ratio (nSi_1 /nSi_2) again.

nSi_1 =nSi_sun *10^{0.3}.

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) ) /10^{0.3}.

So,

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (10^{0.3}) / [ (nH_2/nH_sun) /10^{0.3} ) ] = 10^{0.6} * (nH_sun /nH_2 ).

Hmm. So if I can find (nH_sun/nH_2 ), I can compute this.

Wait, but how? Let me think about Star_2's composition.

In Star_2, [Mg/H] =0, so nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun =10^-5.

But also, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

We can write nMg_2 =nMg_sun *nH_2/nH_sun.

So,

nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Cancel nMg_sun from both sides:

(nH_2)/(nH_sun *nSi_2 )= (1/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Multiply both sides by nH_sun *nSi_2:

nH_2 = (nH_sun *nSi_2 *10^{0.3} ) /nSi_sun.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, but I can substitute nSi_2 from earlier.

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun )/10^{0.3}.

So,

nH_2 = [nH_sun * ( (nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun )/10^{0.3} ) ) *10^{0.3} ] /nSi_sun.

Simplify numerator inside:

nH_sun * (nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun) ) = nH_2 *nSi_sun.

So,

nH_2 = [ (nH_2 *nSi_sun ) *10^{0.3} *10^{-0.3} ) ] /nSi_sun.

Wait, 10^{0.3} *10^{-0.3} =1.

So,

nH_2 = [nH_2 *nSi_sun *1 ]/nSi_sun.

Which simplifies to nH_2 =nH_2 → which is a tautology. So no new information.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

But from [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, nMg_2 =nMg_sun/nSi_sun *10^{0.3} *nSi_2.

So,

nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun ) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_2.

Cancel nMg_sun:

nH_2/(nH_sun ) = (1/nSi_sun ) *10^{0.3} *nSi_2.

Multiply both sides by nH_sun:

nH_2 = (nH_sun *10^{0.3} *nSi_2 ) /nSi_sun.

Hmm. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can substitute nSi_2 from the earlier expression.

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun ) /10^{0.3}.

So,

nH_2 = (nH_sun *10^{0.3} * [ (nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun ) /10^{0.3} ] ) /nSi_sun.

Simplify inside the brackets:

(nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun ) /10^{0.3} = (nH_2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^{0.3}).

So,

nH_2 = (nH_sun *10^{0.3} * (nH_2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^{0.3} )) ) /nSi_sun.

Simplify numerator:

nH_sun *10^{0.3} * (nH_2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^{0.3} )) = nH_2 *nSi_sun.

So,

nH_2 = (nH_2 *nSi_sun ) /nSi_sun → nH_2 =nH_2.

Again, a tautology. So this doesn't help.

Hmm. Perhaps I need to make an assumption that the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun? But I don't think that's correct, as stars can have varying H abundances.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key piece of information. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the problem gives the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but actually, the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero by definition, but in this case, the problem states the Sun's 12 +log(nFe/nH)=7.5, which is [Fe/H]_sun =7.5-12=-4.5? Wait no, wait. Wait, the notation [X/H] is log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun). So [X/H]_sun is zero for the Sun.

Wait, that makes sense. Because [X/H]_sun = log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun) = log(nX/nH)/(nX/nH)_sun.

But since (nX/nH)_sun is the same as (nX/nH) for the Sun, their log would be zero. So [X/H]_sun is zero.

But in our problem, the Sun's [Fe/H] is not zero, but we're given that 12+log(nFe/nH)=7.5. So that would mean [Fe/H]_sun =7.5-12= -4.5? No, wait, no. Because [Fe/H]_sun is zero. So perhaps the given data is the solar values, and [Fe/H]_sun is zero.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm confusing the notation.

The problem says: for the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5-12 =-4.5 → nFe/nH=10^-4.5.

Similarly, log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=10^-5.

So, in the Sun, [Fe/H]_sun =0 by definition. So any star's [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - (-4.5) = log(nFe/nH) +4.5.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) +4.5 =0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1)= -4.5 → nFe_1/nH_1=10^-4.5 = same as Sun.

Which means, for Star_1, nFe_1 =nFe_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg_2/nH_2) = log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg_2 =nMg_sun*(nH_2/nH_sun).

Hmm, maybe I can find the ratio nH_2/nH_sun from another abundance.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the total number of heavy elements (Fe, Mg, Si, etc.) might be the same as in the Sun, but I don't think that's given.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express nH_2/nH_sun in terms of another abundance ratio.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think differently.

The problem is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2.

So, (nSi_1/nSi_2).

We have nSi_1 =nSi_sun *10^{0.3}.

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun)) ) /10^{0.3}.

So, the ratio becomes:

(nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = [nSi_sun *10^{0.3}] / [ (nSi_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun)) ) /10^{0.3} ]

= [10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} ] * (nH_sun/nH_2 )

= 10^{0.6} * (nH_sun/nH_2 )

Hmm. So I need to find (nH_sun/nH_2). 

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can find [Fe/H]_2 using the given data.

Wait, for Star_2, [Mg/H] =0.

And [Mg/Si]_2=0.3.

But without knowing [Fe/Mg]_2, I can't find [Fe/H]_2.

Wait, but perhaps I can find [Fe/Mg]_2 from the Sun's [Fe/Mg] and the abundance ratios.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to see if the ratio (nH_2/nH_sun) can be expressed in terms of known quantities.

Wait, perhaps I can find nH_2 in terms of nFe_2.

But I don't have [Fe/H]_2 for Star_2.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I can express nH_2 in terms of other elements in Star_2.

Wait, but without knowing the mass, or any other abundance, I can't.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can make an assumption that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun. I don't think that's correct, but maybe the problem expects that.

If that's the case, then (nH_2/nH_sun )=1.

Then,

nSi_1/nSi_2 =10^{0.6} *1 = approx 10^{0.6}.

What's 10^0.6? Let's compute.

10^0.6 is about 3.98, so approximately 4. So the ratio would be about 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because I made an assumption that H is same in both stars, which might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find nH_2 from the given data.

Wait, in Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

So,

nMg_2 =10^-5 * (nH_2/nH_sun).

But also, from [Mg/Si]_2=0.3:

nMg_2 =nMg_sun /nSi_sun *10^{0.3} *nSi_2.

So,

10^-5 * (nH_2/nH_sun ) = (10^-5 /nSi_sun ) *10^{0.3} *nSi_2.

Wait, because nMg_sun=10^-5 *nH_sun.

So,

nMg_sun=10^-5 *nH_sun.

So,

nMg_sun /nSi_sun = (10^-5 nH_sun ) /nSi_sun.

So,

10^-5 * (nH_2/nH_sun ) = (10^-5 nH_sun /nSi_sun ) *10^{0.3} *nSi_2.

Cancel 10^-5 from both sides:

nH_2/nH_sun = (nH_sun /nSi_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_2.

Rearranging,

nH_2 = (nH_sun^2 /nSi_sun ) *10^{0.3} *nSi_2.

But from earlier, nSi_2= (nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun ) /10^{0.3}.

So,

nH_2 = (nH_sun^2 /nSi_sun ) *10^{0.3} * [ (nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun ) /10^{0.3} ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

(nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun ) /10^{0.3} = (nH_2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^{0.3}).

So,

nH_2 = (nH_sun^2 /nSi_sun ) *10^{0.3} * (nH_2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^{0.3} )).

Simplify:

nH_sun^2 * nH_2 *nSi_sun *10^{0.3} / (nSi_sun *nH_sun *10^{0.3} )).

The nSi_sun and 10^{0.3} terms cancel.

So,

nH_2 = (nH_sun^2 *nH_2 ) / (nH_sun ) )

= nH_sun *nH_2.

Thus,

nH_2 =nH_sun *nH_2 → which implies that 1 =nH_sun → which can't be correct unless nH_sun=1, which it's not.

So this again leads to a tautology, meaning no new info.

Hmm, I think the only way to proceed is to make an assumption about nH_2. Perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun, meaning (nH_2/nH_sun )=1. If that's the case, then the ratio would be 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is option A (~3.9).

So the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately 4.

So the answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the Sun's photospheric composition as a reference.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) + 0.3 \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) + 0.3 \).

3. **Sun's Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3:
\[
\log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) + 0.3.
\]
Since \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \), we find:
\[
n_{\text{Si,1}} = n_{\text{Si,sun}} \cdot 10^{0.3}.
\]

#### For Star_2:
From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3:
\[
\log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) + 0.3.
\]
Using \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \), we find:
\[
n_{\text{Si,2}} = n_{\text{Si,sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot 10^{-0.3}.
\]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{n_{\text{Si,sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot 10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}.
\]

To proceed, we assume \( n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} = 1 \) (i.e., the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun). Substituting this:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

### Calculation:
\( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), which is approximately 3.9.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see. I remember that these kinds of problems involve using the given abundance ratios to find the actual number ratios of elements. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

Wait, the given data includes [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, both stars have [Fe/H]_1 = 0 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. Oh wait, no, looking again: [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So for Star_1, the iron abundance is the same as the Sun's. And for Star_2, magnesium is same as the Sun's.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, so log(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12= -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for magnesium, log(nMg/nH)=7.5-12= -4.5? Wait wait, wait. Wait the Sun's data: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7? Or is it 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = something else. Let me re-read.

Ah, the problem says for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. So for Fe, log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12= -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^-4.5. Similarly, for Mg, log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5. So nMg/nH is 10^-5.

Now, I think I need to find the [Si/H] for each star, then compute the ratios.

Wait, the problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So (nSi_1)/(nSi_2).

But how do I get nSi for each star? I think I need to use the given abundance ratios and the Sun's data.

Let me think about Star_1 first.

Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun. So nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^-4.5.

Also, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. Which means (nSi_1/nFe_1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

Wait, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun) = log(nX/nY) - [X/Y]_sun. So for [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3, which is log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.3.

So, log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

Which means, nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

But wait, nFe_1 is nFe_sun, because [Fe/H]_1=0. So nFe_1 = nFe_sun *10^{0} =nFe_sun.

So nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

Since nFe_1 = nFe_sun, this becomes nFe_sun * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^{0.3} = nSi_sun * 10^{0.3}.

Wait, that's interesting. So the Si abundance in Star_1 is 10^{0.3} times that of the Sun. Because [Si/Fe] is +0.3, and Fe is same as Sun, so Si is higher.

Similarly, for Star_2.

Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. So log(nMg_2/nSi_2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) =0.3.

Which means, log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

So, nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

But I also know that [Mg/H]_2=0. So nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

Wait, nMg_2 = (nH_2) * (nMg_sun /nH_sun) = nH_2 * 10^-5.

Hmm. So from nMg_2 = nH_2 * 10^-5.

But we can also write nMg_2 = (nSi_2) * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

So: (nSi_2) * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3} = nH_2 * 10^-5.

Hmm, because nMg_2 = (nSi_2) * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Wait, maybe it's better to solve for nSi_2.

Let me try that. From the equation:

nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2.

Because [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

So nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2 = (10^-5) * nH_2.

Also, from [Mg/Si]_2=0.3:

nMg_2 / nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

So substituting nMg_2 from above:

(10^-5 * nH_2) / nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Wait, what is nMg_sun /nSi_sun?

Wait, for the Sun, nMg/nH =10^-5, and nFe/nH=10^-4.5.

But I need nMg/nSi. So nMg/nSi = (nMg/nH) / (nSi/nH) = (10^-5) / (nSi/nH)_sun.

Wait, what's nSi_sun /nH_sun?

Wait, the Sun's composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(7.5-12) =10^-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → nMg/nH =10^(7-12)=10^-5.

But what about nSi/nH_sun? Not directly given. Hmm, I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can express nSi_sun in terms of [Si/Fe]_sun or something. Wait, but I don't have [Si/Fe]_sun given. Oh wait, the problem doesn't give [Si/Fe]_sun, so maybe I can find it from the data given.

Wait, but wait. I have the Sun's nFe/nH and nMg/nH. But not nSi/nH. So I might need to assume that in the Sun, [Mg/Si] is a certain value. Alternatively, maybe we can find [Mg/Si]_sun from the given data.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. Since the problem is about the ratio of Si in the two stars compared to each other, maybe I can relate their Si abundances without needing the Sun's Si abundance.

Wait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of the Sun's nH, nFe, nMg, and then find nSi_1 and nSi_2.

Let me restate the variables:

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1 = nFe_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1 /nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) +0.3.

So, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But nFe_1 = nFe_sun. So,

nSi_1 = nFe_sun * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi_1 = nSi_sun *10^0.3.

So the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Sun is 10^0.3.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg_2 /nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) +0.3.

Also, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun).

Wait, nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun) → nMg_2 = (10^-5) * (nH_2 /nH_sun).

Because nMg_sun/nH_sun =10^-5.

So, substituting into the [Mg/Si] equation:

nMg_2 /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

Substituting nMg_2:

( (10^-5) (nH_2 /nH_sun) ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But nMg_sun /nSi_sun = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) → (10^-5) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Wait, that's (10^-5) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) = (10^-5) / (nSi/nH)_sun.

Hmm, but I don't know (nSi/nH)_sun. Oh wait, maybe I can find it from the other data.

Wait, but perhaps I can find nSi_sun in terms of other elements.

Wait, I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps I can express nSi_2 in terms of nH_2.

Wait, let's rearrange the equation.

nSi_2 = (nMg_2) / [ (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3} ) ]

But nMg_2 = (10^-5) * (nH_2/nH_sun).

So,

nSi_2 = [ (10^-5) (nH_2/nH_sun) ) ] / [ (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^{0.3} ) ]

But nMg_sun/nSi_sun = 10^-5 / (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Wait, so let me substitute that:

nMg_sun/nSi_sun = (10^-5) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

So, substituting into the equation:

nSi_2 = [ (10^-5) (nH_2/nH_sun) ) ] / [ (10^-5 / (nSi_sun/nH_sun)) * 10^{0.3} ) ].

Simplify denominator:

(10^-5 / (nSi_sun/nH_sun)) *10^{0.3} = (10^-5 *10^{0.3}) ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

So,

nSi_2 = [ (10^-5) (nH_2/nH_sun) ) ] / [ (10^(-5 + 0.3) ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) ]

Hmm, let's compute that.

Denominator becomes (10^(-4.7)) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

So,

nSi_2 = (10^-5) (nH_2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) / (10^-4.7) )

Simplify the exponents:

10^-5 /10^-4.7 = 10^(-5 +4.7) =10^-0.3.

So,

nSi_2 = (10^-0.3) * (nH_2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) )

Wait, but (nH_2/nH_sun) is (nH_2) * (nH_sun)^-1.

And (nSi_sun/nH_sun) is (nSi_sun) * (nH_sun)^-1.

So,

nSi_2 = 10^-0.3 * (nH_2) * (nH_sun)^-1 * nSi_sun * (nH_sun)^-1 )

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, (nH_2/nH_sun) is (nH_2) / (nH_sun).

And (nSi_sun/nH_sun) is (nSi_sun)/(nH_sun).

So,

nSi_2 = 10^-0.3 * [ (nH_2) / nH_sun ] * [ nSi_sun / nH_sun ].

Which is 10^-0.3 * nH_2 * nSi_sun / (nH_sun)^2.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I should express nH_2 in terms of other variables.

Wait, another approach: since all stars' atmospheres are considered under LTE, and using the EW method which gives abundance ratios, perhaps I can express the ratio of nSi_1 to nSi_2.

So, ratio = nSi_1 / nSi_2.

nSi_1 is nSi_sun *10^0.3.

nSi_2 is ... well, let's think again.

Wait, for Star_2, from [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, we have nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

And nMg_2 is (nMg_sun) * (nH_2/nH_sun) because [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, (nMg_sun (nH_2/nH_sun)) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Divide both sides by nMg_sun:

(nH_2)/(nH_sun nSi_2) = (1/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Rearranging, nSi_2 = (nH_2 / (nH_sun)) * (nSi_sun) * 10^{-0.3}.

So,

nSi_2 = (nH_2 / nH_sun) * nSi_sun *10^{-0.3}.

But what is (nH_2/nH_sun)?

Wait, for Star_2, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, but Star_2's [Fe/H] isn't given. Wait, in the problem statement, only [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

Wait, so Star_2's [Fe/H] is not given. Hmm, perhaps I need to find H in Star_2's photosphere. But without more info, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of nH_2 to nH_sun is needed. Let's think.

Wait, but perhaps H is the same in both stars as in the Sun? No, stars can have different H abundances, but perhaps these stars are main-sequence, which would have H as the dominant element. Hmm, but I don't think we can assume that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio nH_2/nH_sun can be expressed in terms of other abundances.

Wait, another thought: perhaps we can relate nH_2 to nFe_2 or nMg_2.

Wait, Star_2's [Fe/H] isn't given. So maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me try to proceed step by step.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = nFe_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

Thus, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

But nFe_1 =nFe_sun → nSi_1 = nFe_sun * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3 =nSi_sun *10^{0.3}.

So nSi_1 = nSi_sun *10^{0.3}.

For Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (nMg_2/nSi_2) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → (nMg_2/nH_2) = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

So substituting into the first equation:

(nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun)) / nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Divide both sides by nMg_sun:

(nH_2/(nH_sun)) /nSi_2 = (1/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Multiply both sides by nSi_2 and nSi_sun:

nSi_sun * (nH_2/(nH_sun)) ) = nSi_2 *10^{0.3}.

So,

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun * (nH_2/(nH_sun)) ) / 10^{0.3}.

Hmm, but I don't know nH_2. Oh wait, but perhaps I can relate nH_2 to nH_sun.

Wait, in Star_2, [Fe/H] isn't given, but I don't think there's data to find nH_2.

Hmm, perhaps I can express the ratio (nSi_1 /nSi_2) in terms of known quantities.

Because the problem asks for (nSi_1 /nSi_2 ), maybe I can write this ratio using the expressions we have.

nSi_1 =nSi_sun *10^{0.3}.

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun * (nH_2/(nH_sun)) ) /10^{0.3}.

So,

(nSi_1 /nSi_2) = [nSi_sun *10^{0.3} ] / [ (nSi_sun*(nH_2/nH_sun)) /10^{0.3} ) ]

Simplify:

= [10^{0.3} ] * [10^{0.3} ] / (nH_2/nH_sun) )

= (10^{0.6}) * (nH_sun /nH_2) )

But I still don't know nH_2/nH_sun. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I can find that using another relation in Star_2.

Wait, [Fe/H] is not given for Star_2, but perhaps we can find [Fe/H]_2 from the given data.

Wait, Star_2's [Fe/H] is not given. So perhaps I need to make another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can express nH_2 in terms of other elements in Star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of nH_2 to nH_sun by looking at the composition.

Wait, wait! Another thought: the total number of atoms in a star's photosphere is dominated by hydrogen, so nH is much larger than nFe or nMg. So perhaps the ratio nH_2/nH_sun might be related to the mass of the star, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps mass doesn't directly influence the abundance ratios if they are given as [X/H].

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the elemental abundances are determined using the EW method, assuming LTE. So the [X/H] is the logarithmic abundance relative to hydrogen.

Wait, [Fe/H]_1 =0, meaning that the Fe abundance is same as Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H] =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun.

Wait, but for Star_2, [Fe/H] is not given, so I can't directly say anything about Fe in Star_2.

Hmm, but perhaps I need to find the ratio (nH_2/nH_sun), which could be expressed in terms of other variables.

Wait, another approach: let's find the ratio of nH_2 to nH_sun from the fact that in Star_2, [Mg/H] =0 → nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But without knowing nMg_2, that doesn't help.

Wait, but perhaps I can express nH_2 in terms of other elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (nH_2/nH_sun) can be found using the relation for nSi_2.

Wait, let's go back to the equation for nSi_2:

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun)) ) / 10^{0.3}.

So, perhaps I can express (nH_2/nH_sun) = (nSi_2 *10^{0.3}) ) /nSi_sun.

But without knowing nSi_2, that's not helpful.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let me take a step back.

I need to find (nSi_1 /nSi_2).

nSi_1 =nSi_sun *10^{0.3}.

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun)) /10^{0.3}.

So, the ratio is:

(nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = [nSi_sun *10^{0.3}] / [ (nSi_sun (nH_2/nH_sun)) /10^{0.3} ]

= [10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} ] * [nH_sun /nH_2 ].

= 10^{0.6} * (nH_sun /nH_2 ).

But what is (nH_sun /nH_2 )? That's (nH_2 /nH_sun )^{-1}.

Hmm, but without knowing (nH_2/nH_sun ), I can't compute this.

Wait, but perhaps I can find another relation involving nH_2.

Wait, for Star_2, [Fe/H] is unknown, but perhaps we can find [Fe/H]_2 from the given data.

Wait, in Star_2, we have [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Fe/H]_2 using the fact that in the Sun, the [Fe/Mg] is known.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/Mg] can be calculated from its elemental abundances.

Wait, in the Sun, [Fe/Mg] = log(nFe/nMg) - log(nFe_sun/nMg_sun).

Wait, but no, [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun) = log( (nX/nY)/(nX_sun/nY_sun) ).

So, [Fe/Mg]_sun = log( (nFe/nMg) ) - log( nFe_sun/nMg_sun ).

Wait, but from the Sun's data:

nFe/nH=10^-4.5.

nMg/nH=10^-5.

So, nFe/nMg = (nFe/nH)/(nMg/nH) ) = (10^-4.5)/(10^-5) )= 10^{0.5}.

So, log(nFe/nMg) = 0.5.

And nFe_sun/nMg_sun = same as nFe/nMg in the Sun, which is 10^0.5.

So, [Fe/Mg]_sun = log(10^0.5) - log(10^0.5) )=0.

Hmm, so [Fe/Mg]_sun =0. So the Sun's Fe and Mg abundances are the same relative to each other.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps in Star_2, I can find [Fe/Mg]_2.

Wait, from Star_2's [Mg/Si] =0.3, [Mg/H] =0.

Hmm, but perhaps I can express [Fe/Mg]_2 in terms of other parameters.

Wait, but I don't have [Fe/Mg]_2 given.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Fe/Mg]_2 using [Fe/H]_2 and [Mg/H]_2.

Wait, [Fe/Mg]_2 = [Fe/H]_2 - [Mg/H]_2.

Because [Fe/Mg] = [Fe/H] - [Mg/H].

So, [Fe/Mg]_2 = [Fe/H]_2 -0 → [Fe/H]_2.

So, [Fe/Mg]_2 = [Fe/H]_2.

But without knowing [Fe/Mg]_2, I can't proceed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I don't need to know nH_2. Maybe I can find the ratio in terms of Sun's H.

Wait, let me think about the ratio (nSi_1 /nSi_2) again.

nSi_1 =nSi_sun *10^{0.3}.

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) ) /10^{0.3}.

So,

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (10^{0.3}) / [ (nH_2/nH_sun) /10^{0.3} ) ] = 10^{0.6} * (nH_sun /nH_2 ).

Hmm. So if I can find (nH_sun/nH_2 ), I can compute this.

Wait, but how? Let me think about Star_2's composition.

In Star_2, [Mg/H] =0, so nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun =10^-5.

But also, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

We can write nMg_2 =nMg_sun *nH_2/nH_sun.

So,

nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Cancel nMg_sun from both sides:

(nH_2)/(nH_sun *nSi_2 )= (1/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Multiply both sides by nH_sun *nSi_2:

nH_2 = (nH_sun *nSi_2 *10^{0.3} ) /nSi_sun.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, but I can substitute nSi_2 from earlier.

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun )/10^{0.3}.

So,

nH_2 = [nH_sun * ( (nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun )/10^{0.3} ) ) *10^{0.3} ] /nSi_sun.

Simplify numerator inside:

nH_sun * (nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun) ) = nH_2 *nSi_sun.

So,

nH_2 = [ (nH_2 *nSi_sun ) *10^{0.3} *10^{-0.3} ) ] /nSi_sun.

Wait, 10^{0.3} *10^{-0.3} =1.

So,

nH_2 = [nH_2 *nSi_sun *1 ]/nSi_sun.

Which simplifies to nH_2 =nH_2 → which is a tautology. So no new information.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

But from [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, nMg_2 =nMg_sun/nSi_sun *10^{0.3} *nSi_2.

So,

nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun ) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_2.

Cancel nMg_sun:

nH_2/(nH_sun ) = (1/nSi_sun ) *10^{0.3} *nSi_2.

Multiply both sides by nH_sun:

nH_2 = (nH_sun *10^{0.3} *nSi_2 ) /nSi_sun.

Hmm. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can substitute nSi_2 from the earlier expression.

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun ) /10^{0.3}.

So,

nH_2 = (nH_sun *10^{0.3} * [ (nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun ) /10^{0.3} ] ) /nSi_sun.

Simplify inside the brackets:

(nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun ) /10^{0.3} = (nH_2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^{0.3}).

So,

nH_2 = (nH_sun *10^{0.3} * (nH_2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^{0.3} )) ) /nSi_sun.

Simplify numerator:

nH_sun *10^{0.3} * (nH_2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^{0.3} )) = nH_2 *nSi_sun.

So,

nH_2 = (nH_2 *nSi_sun ) /nSi_sun → nH_2 =nH_2.

Again, a tautology. So this doesn't help.

Hmm. Perhaps I need to make an assumption that the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun? But I don't think that's correct, as stars can have varying H abundances.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key piece of information. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the problem gives the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but actually, the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero by definition, but in this case, the problem states the Sun's 12 +log(nFe/nH)=7.5, which is [Fe/H]_sun =7.5-12=-4.5? Wait no, wait. Wait, the notation [X/H] is log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun). So [X/H]_sun is zero for the Sun.

Wait, that makes sense. Because [X/H]_sun = log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun) = log(nX/nH)/(nX/nH)_sun.

But since (nX/nH)_sun is the same as (nX/nH) for the Sun, their log would be zero. So [X/H]_sun is zero.

But in our problem, the Sun's [Fe/H] is not zero, but we're given that 12+log(nFe/nH)=7.5. So that would mean [Fe/H]_sun =7.5-12= -4.5? No, wait, no. Because [Fe/H]_sun is zero. So perhaps the given data is the solar values, and [Fe/H]_sun is zero.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm confusing the notation.

The problem says: for the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5-12 =-4.5 → nFe/nH=10^-4.5.

Similarly, log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=10^-5.

So, in the Sun, [Fe/H]_sun =0 by definition. So any star's [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - (-4.5) = log(nFe/nH) +4.5.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) +4.5 =0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1)= -4.5 → nFe_1/nH_1=10^-4.5 = same as Sun.

Which means, for Star_1, nFe_1 =nFe_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg_2/nH_2) = log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg_2 =nMg_sun*(nH_2/nH_sun).

Hmm, maybe I can find the ratio nH_2/nH_sun from another abundance.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the total number of heavy elements (Fe, Mg, Si, etc.) might be the same as in the Sun, but I don't think that's given.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express nH_2/nH_sun in terms of another abundance ratio.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think differently.

The problem is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2.

So, (nSi_1/nSi_2).

We have nSi_1 =nSi_sun *10^{0.3}.

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun)) ) /10^{0.3}.

So, the ratio becomes:

(nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = [nSi_sun *10^{0.3}] / [ (nSi_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun)) ) /10^{0.3} ]

= [10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} ] * (nH_sun/nH_2 )

= 10^{0.6} * (nH_sun/nH_2 )

Hmm. So I need to find (nH_sun/nH_2). 

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can find [Fe/H]_2 using the given data.

Wait, for Star_2, [Mg/H] =0.

And [Mg/Si]_2=0.3.

But without knowing [Fe/Mg]_2, I can't find [Fe/H]_2.

Wait, but perhaps I can find [Fe/Mg]_2 from the Sun's [Fe/Mg] and the abundance ratios.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to see if the ratio (nH_2/nH_sun) can be expressed in terms of known quantities.

Wait, perhaps I can find nH_2 in terms of nFe_2.

But I don't have [Fe/H]_2 for Star_2.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I can express nH_2 in terms of other elements in Star_2.

Wait, but without knowing the mass, or any other abundance, I can't.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can make an assumption that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun. I don't think that's correct, but maybe the problem expects that.

If that's the case, then (nH_2/nH_sun )=1.

Then,

nSi_1/nSi_2 =10^{0.6} *1 = approx 10^{0.6}.

What's 10^0.6? Let's compute.

10^0.6 is about 3.98, so approximately 4. So the ratio would be about 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because I made an assumption that H is same in both stars, which might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find nH_2 from the given data.

Wait, in Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

So,

nMg_2 =10^-5 * (nH_2/nH_sun).

But also, from [Mg/Si]_2=0.3:

nMg_2 =nMg_sun /nSi_sun *10^{0.3} *nSi_2.

So,

10^-5 * (nH_2/nH_sun ) = (10^-5 /nSi_sun ) *10^{0.3} *nSi_2.

Wait, because nMg_sun=10^-5 *nH_sun.

So,

nMg_sun=10^-5 *nH_sun.

So,

nMg_sun /nSi_sun = (10^-5 nH_sun ) /nSi_sun.

So,

10^-5 * (nH_2/nH_sun ) = (10^-5 nH_sun /nSi_sun ) *10^{0.3} *nSi_2.

Cancel 10^-5 from both sides:

nH_2/nH_sun = (nH_sun /nSi_sun) *10^{0.3} *nSi_2.

Rearranging,

nH_2 = (nH_sun^2 /nSi_sun ) *10^{0.3} *nSi_2.

But from earlier, nSi_2= (nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun ) /10^{0.3}.

So,

nH_2 = (nH_sun^2 /nSi_sun ) *10^{0.3} * [ (nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun ) /10^{0.3} ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

(nSi_sun *nH_2/nH_sun ) /10^{0.3} = (nH_2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^{0.3}).

So,

nH_2 = (nH_sun^2 /nSi_sun ) *10^{0.3} * (nH_2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^{0.3} )).

Simplify:

nH_sun^2 * nH_2 *nSi_sun *10^{0.3} / (nSi_sun *nH_sun *10^{0.3} )).

The nSi_sun and 10^{0.3} terms cancel.

So,

nH_2 = (nH_sun^2 *nH_2 ) / (nH_sun ) )

= nH_sun *nH_2.

Thus,

nH_2 =nH_sun *nH_2 → which implies that 1 =nH_sun → which can't be correct unless nH_sun=1, which it's not.

So this again leads to a tautology, meaning no new info.

Hmm, I think the only way to proceed is to make an assumption about nH_2. Perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun, meaning (nH_2/nH_sun )=1. If that's the case, then the ratio would be 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is option A (~3.9).

So the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately 4.

So the answer should be option A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the Sun's photospheric composition as a reference.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) + 0.3 \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) + 0.3 \).

3. **Sun's Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3:
\[
\log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) + 0.3.
\]
Since \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \), we find:
\[
n_{\text{Si,1}} = n_{\text{Si,sun}} \cdot 10^{0.3}.
\]

#### For Star_2:
From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3:
\[
\log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) + 0.3.
\]
Using \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \), we find:
\[
n_{\text{Si,2}} = n_{\text{Si,sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot 10^{-0.3}.
\]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{n_{\text{Si,sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot 10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}.
\]

To proceed, we assume \( n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} = 1 \) (i.e., the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun). Substituting this:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

### Calculation:
\( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), which is approximately 3.9.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

**Answer: A**
