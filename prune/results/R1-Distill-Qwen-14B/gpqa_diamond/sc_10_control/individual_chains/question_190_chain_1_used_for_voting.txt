Okay, so I have this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solutions, and I need to arrange the given nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least reactive. Hmm, let me think. I remember that nucleophilicity can depend on various factors like the solvent, the charge of the nucleophile, and the structure.

The nucleophiles given are:
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)
3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)

Wait, right, in aqueous solution, the solvent is polar and protic. So the reactivity of nucleophiles in such a solvent is influenced by solvation. Stronger bases are better nucleophiles in such conditions because they're less solvated. But wait, I might be getting that mixed up. Let me think again.

In polar protic solvents, larger, less solvated ions are better nucleophiles. For example, I⁻ is a better nucleophile in such solvents than Cl⁻ because it's less tightly held by the solvent. So the size of the ion matters. Also, the charge—more charge means better nucleophile, but if it's too tightly solvated, it might not be as reactive.

Looking at the options, some are conjugate bases of strong acids. Let's see:

Hydroxide (OH⁻) is the conjugate base of a strong acid, HCl? Wait no, HCl is a strong acid, but OH⁻ comes from H2O. Oh wait, hydroxide is a stronger base than, say, propionate or ethanethiolate?

Wait, I think the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (polar protic) for common ions is: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻. But wait, that's for halides. What about these other nucleophiles?

Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) is the conjugate base of HSH (wait, no, ethanethiol is CH3CH2SH). So HS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻? Because sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, so the thiolate ion is a weaker base? Wait no, actually, the pKa of ethanethiol is around 10, while for water it's about 15.7. So the conjugate base of ethanethiol (HS⁻) is a weaker base than OH⁻. Wait, no, wait: a stronger acid has a weaker conjugate base. So if ethanethiol (HS) has a lower pKa (like around 10) than water (pKa ~15.7), then HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So the HS⁻ ion is less basic than OH⁻, which would mean that in a polar protic solvent, HS⁻ is a better nucleophile than OH⁻? Because being a weaker base, it's less stabilized by solvation.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the opposite. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. In protic solvents, larger, less solvated ions are better nucleophiles. So SN2 reactions in protic solvents favor larger, less solvated nucleophiles. So for example, in the gas phase, I⁻ is a better nucleophile than F⁻. But in water, because I⁻ is larger and less solvated, it's a better nucleophile than F⁻. So in the case of HS⁻ and OH⁻, HS⁻ is larger (sulfur is bigger than oxygen), so maybe it's a better nucleophile in aqueous solution.

Wait, but HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. Wait, no, HS⁻ is a weaker base because ethanethiol is a stronger acid than water. So HS⁻ is less basic. But in a protic solvent, less basic (weaker) nucleophiles are better nucleophiles because they're less solvated. So I think HS⁻ is a better nucleophile than OH⁻ in aqueous solution.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of examples. For instance, in SN2 reactions, iodide is a better nucleophile than hydroxide in polar protic solvents because it's less solvated. So in that case, HS⁻ (which is larger than OH⁻) would be a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

So the order so far: HS⁻ (5) is more nucleophilic than OH⁻ (2).

What about the other nucleophiles?

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate. That's a conjugate base of 4-methylcyclohexanol. Since it's an alkoxide, its nucleophilicity depends on the stability of the base. The more stable the base (due to conjugation or structure), the weaker the base, but perhaps the better the nucleophile in polar protic solvents? Wait, no. Wait, if the base is more stable (weaker base), it's less solvated, thus more nucleophilic in protic solvents.

So the cyclohexan-olate is a stronger base than something like propionate? Because propionate is the conjugate base of a weak acid. Wait, propionic acid has a pKa around 4.88. So the propionate ion is a weaker base than hydroxide (pKa of water is 15.7). So the propionate ion is less basic than OH⁻.

Wait, but the cyclohexan-olate is a stronger base than propionate? Because the pKa of cyclohexanol is around 19, which is more acidic than propionic acid (pKa ~5). Wait, no: a higher pKa means a weaker acid. Cyclohexanol has a pKa around 19.5, so it's a weaker acid than propionic acid. So the conjugate base of cyclohexanol (the cyclohexanolate) is a stronger base than propionate. Because a weaker acid (higher pKa) has a stronger conjugate base.

So the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than propionate. So in aqueous solution, which is a polar protic solvent, the cyclohexanolate would be less nucleophilic than something that is a weaker base because stronger bases are more solvated.

Wait, no, wait: in polar protic solvents, weaker bases are better nucleophiles. So if cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than propionate, then propionate is a weaker base. So in aqueous solution, propionate would be a better nucleophile than cyclohexanolate? No, wait, stronger bases are more solvated and thus worse nucleophiles. So a weaker base, which is less solvated, is a better nucleophile.

But I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The order of nucleophilicity in a polar protic solvent (like aqueous) is based on how well the nucleophile is solvated. Poor solvation means the nucleophile is more available to attack. So, stronger bases (which are smaller, like OH⁻) are more solvated, so less reactive. Whereas weaker bases, which are larger, are less solvated and more reactive.

But wait, in the case of the cyclohexanolate, it's a larger anion compared to OH⁻. So maybe it's less solvated than OH⁻, making it a better nucleophile. But if the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than propionate, which is a weaker base than OH⁻, then the order of nucleophilicity would be: cyclohexanolate is less basic than OH⁻? No, because cyclohexanol is a weaker acid (pKa ~19) than water (pKa ~15.7). Wait, no, wait: cyclohexanol is a weaker acid than water because it has a higher pKa. So the conjugate base (cyclohexanolate) is a stronger base than hydroxide. Because, in water, a weaker acid (higher pKa) has a stronger conjugate base. So cyclohexanol (pKa 19) is weaker acid than H2O (pKa 15.7), so cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻.

So, in aqueous solution, the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻. So in a protic solvent, stronger bases are more solvated and hence less nucleophilic. So weaker bases (like propionate, which is a weaker base than cyclohexanolate) would be better nucleophiles.

Wait, wait, let me make a table:

Nucleophile | Conjugate Acid pKa | Strength of Base
--- | --- | ---
HS⁻ (ethanethiolate) | ~10 | weaker base (since thiol is stronger acid than water)
OH⁻ | ~15.7 | stronger base than HS⁻
Propionate (CH2CH2COO⁻) | ~4.88 | weaker base than OH⁻ and cyclohexanolate
4-Methylcyclohexanolate | ~19.5 | stronger base than OH⁻
Methanol (CH3OH) | ~19.7 | a neutral molecule, not a strong nucleophile

Wait, so the propionate is a weaker base than OH⁻, and the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻. Methanol is a neutral molecule and a poor nucleophile in aqueous solution because it's not deprotonated. So its nucleophilicity is low.

So arranging from strongest to weakest nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (polar protic):

Weaker bases (less solvated) are better nucleophiles.

Looking at the list:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻): Weaker base than OH⁻, so more nucleophilic than OH⁻.

Wait, no. Wait, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻ because H2S is a stronger acid than H2O. So HS⁻ is less stabilized by solvation (because it's a weaker base) and thus more nucleophilic in a protic solvent.

So HS⁻ (5) is more nucleophilic than OH⁻ (2).

Next, looking at 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1): it's a stronger base than OH⁻ (since its conjugate acid is weaker). So in a protic solvent, it's more solvated, making it a worse nucleophile than OH⁻. So its nucleophilicity would be lower than OH⁻?

Wait, no. Wait, if the base is stronger, it is more solvated. So stronger base → more solvation → less nucleophilicity.

So HS⁻ (weaker base) is less solvated → better nucleophile than OH⁻.

Then, OH⁻ is a stronger base than propionate and cyclohexanolate?

Wait, no, cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify:

- The order of the strength of the bases: 4-methylcyclohexanolate (pKa 19.5) > OH⁻ (pKa 15.7) > HS⁻ (pKa ~10) > propionate (pKa ~4.88).

Wait no, wait. Wait, the order of the conjugate acids being weaker (higher pKa) would mean their conjugate bases are stronger. So:

Conjugate acids' pKa:

Propionic acid: ~4.88 → propionate is a weak base.

Water: 15.7 → OH⁻ is a stronger base than propionate.

4-Methylcyclohexanol: ~19.5 → cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻.

Ethanethiol: ~10 → HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻.

So the strength of the bases from strongest to weakest: 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) > OH⁻ (2) > HS⁻ (5) > propionate (3), and methanol is neutral.

Wait, no. Wait, for the base strength: the higher the pKa of the conjugate acid, the stronger the base. So:

Conj. Acid | pKa
--- | ---
4-MeCyclohexanol | ~19.5 → Base: 4-MeCyclohexanolate
Water | ~15.7 → OH⁻
Ethanethiol | ~10 → HS⁻
Propionic acid | ~4.88 → Propionate

So base strength order: 4-MeCyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

But in a polar protic solvent, the more basic the nucleophile, the more it is solvated, making it less nucleophilic.

So the nucleophilicity order (from best to worst) in aqueous solution would be the reverse of the base strength. So:

Weakest base → less solvated → better nucleophile.

So the order would be Propionate < HS⁻ < OH⁻ < 4-MeCyclohexanolate.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

In aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity order is determined by how well the nucleophile is solvated. Stronger bases are more solvated and thus less nucleophilic. So the weaker the base (the stronger the conjugate acid), the less it's solvated and the better the nucleophile in a protic solvent.

So the order of nucleophilicity would be:

Least basic → most nucleophilic.

So:

Propionate (weakest base here) → but wait, looking at the list, HS⁻ is weaker than OH⁻, but stronger than propionate?

Wait, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, but stronger than propionate (since propionate's conjugate acid is stronger, so propionate's base is weaker).

Wait, propionate's conjugate acid (propionic acid) has a pKa of ~4.88. Ethanethiol has pKa ~10. So HS⁻ is weaker base than cyclohexanolate and OH⁻, but stronger base than propionate?

Wait, no. Wait, the strength of the base is inversely related to the strength of the acid (conjugate acid). So a weaker acid has a stronger conjugate base.

Ethanethiol is stronger acid than propionic acid. So HS⁻ is weaker base than propionate.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the acid is stronger, the conjugate base is weaker. So propionic acid (pKa ~4.88) is a stronger acid than ethanethiol (pKa ~10). So propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻) is a weaker base than HS⁻.

Wait, that makes sense. So the order of base strength:

4-MeCyclohexanolate (strongest) > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate (weakest).

So in aqueous (protic) solution, the weakest bases are better nucleophiles. So the nucleophilicity order is:

Propionate (3) < HS⁻ (5) < OH⁻ (2) < 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1).

Wait, but wait, that would mean that propionate is the worst nucleophile, followed by HS⁻, then OH⁻, then cyclohexanolate. Then, methanol is a neutral molecule, so it's a poor nucleophile.

Wait, but then where does methanol fit in? Methanol is a neutral molecule, which is a weaker nucleophile than the deprotonated species. So in the nucleophilicity order, it's the least reactive.

So putting it all together, the order from most reactive to least reactive nucleophile in aqueous solution would be:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So in aqueous solution, being a weaker base, HS⁻ is less solvated and thus a better nucleophile than OH⁻? Or is the opposite true?

I think I might have this wrong. Let me think about another example. In aqueous solution, iodide (I⁻) is a better nucleophile than hydroxide (OH⁻). I⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻ because HI is a stronger acid than H2O. So in a protic solvent, the weaker base (I⁻) is a better nucleophile.

So applying that same logic, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, so it should be a better nucleophile than OH⁻ in aqueous solution.

So the order should be:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

Wait, but wait, 4-MeCyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻. So, in aqueous, it's more solvated and less nucleophilic than OH⁻. So, HS⁻ is better than OH⁻, which is better than 4-MeCyclohexanolate?

No, wait. No. The order of base strength is:

4-MeCyclohexanolate (strongest) > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

In aqueous, nucleophilicity is inversely related to base strength. So the weakest base is the best nucleophile. So:

Propionate (weakest base) → but wait, no. Wait, the weakest base is propionate, which would be the best nucleophile? Wait, that can't be right because propionate is a less basic anion but might be poor in nucleophilicity.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the trend again. In polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity order tends to be: weaker base (larger, less solvated) > stronger base (smaller, more solvated).

So for the given nucleophiles:

HS⁻ (weaker base than OH⁻) → better nucleophile than OH⁻.

4-MeCyclohexanolate (stronger base than OH⁻) → worse nucleophile than OH⁻.

Wait, no. Because 4-MeCyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it's more solvated, making it a less effective nucleophile than OH⁻.

So the correct order would be:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Because I thought that the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base, so worse nucleophile than OH⁻. So the order between HS⁻, OH⁻, and cyclohexanolate would be:

HS⁻ (5) is the best, then OH⁻ (2), then cyclohexanolate (1) is worse than OH⁻.

Then, after that comes propionate (3), which is a weaker base than HS⁻, but it's less nucleophilic than HS⁻ and OH⁻. Wait, no. Propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻? Because propionic acid is stronger acid than ethanethiol. So the conjugate base of propionic acid (propionate) is weaker than HS⁻.

So the base strength order: 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > OH⁻ (2) > HS⁻ (5) > Propionate (3).

So in terms of nucleophilicity in aqueous (protic):

Propionate (3) is the weakest base, but in reality, propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻, meaning HS⁻ is a better nucleophile than propionate.

Wait, maybe I got it reversed. Let me think: weaker base → less solvated → better nucleophile.

So the order from best to worst nucleophile in aqueous:

HS⁻ (5) → weaker base than OH⁻ → better nucleophilicity than OH⁻.

Then, OH⁻ (2) → stronger base than HS⁻ → worse nucleophilicity than HS⁻.

Then, the order continues with 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) being the strongest base, so the worst nucleophile.

Wait, but 4-MeCyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so in aqueous it's worse nucleophile than OH⁻.

So the order is:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

Wait, but propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻, so it should be a better nucleophile. But according to the base strength, propionate is weaker than HS⁻. Then, propionate would be a better nucleophile than HS⁻. No, that can't be. Because HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, which makes it a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Let me rank each nucleophile's nucleophilicity in aqueous solution.

In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for common ions is typically:

I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ > OH⁻ > (some other ions).

But in this case, we have HS⁻, which is a larger ion. So perhaps it's a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

So, let's list the nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strong base → poor nucleophile in aqueous)
2. OH⁻ (moderate base → moderate nucleophile)
3. Propionate (weak base → better nucleophile than OH⁻?)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) (weak base → better nucleophile than OH⁻)
4. Methanol (neutral → poor nucleophile)

Wait, no, because in aqueous solution, the strength of the base is inversely related to nucleophilicity. So weaker bases are better nucleophiles.

So, the strength of the bases from strongest to weakest:

4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > OH⁻ (2) > HS⁻ (5) > Propionate (3).

So the order of nucleophilicity (weakest base first, since they are better nucleophiles) would be:

Propionate (3) < HS⁻ (5) < OH⁻ (2) < 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1).

Wait, that doesn't make sense because propionate is a weaker base, it should be a better nucleophile than HS⁻.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the pKa values again. Propionate comes from a stronger acid (pKa ~4.88) than HS⁻ (pKa ~10). So propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻. So HS⁻ is a stronger base than propionate.

So, in terms of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, the order would be:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

But wait, why is 4-MeCyclohexanolate less nucleophilic than OH⁻? Because it is a stronger base, more solvated, so less reactive.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

But that doesn't align with the base strength. Because 4-MeCyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it should be less nucleophilic.

Alternatively, let me think about the HSAB theory. Hard nucleophiles prefer hard solvents, soft prefer soft. HS⁻ is a soft nucleophile, OH⁻ is hard. But in aqueous solution (a hard solvent), OH⁻ is more favored. So perhaps in aqueous solution, HS⁻ isn't as good as OH⁻. Hmm, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

In aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity order is: 4-MeCyclohexanolate < OH⁻ < HS⁻.

Wait, no, that can't be because 4-MeCyclohexanolate is a stronger base and thus more solvated, making it a worse nucleophile.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

But I'm not confident. Let's think about the options given.

The options are:

A) 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4

Which would be: 5 (HS⁻), 2 (OH⁻), 3 (propionate), 1 (cyclohexanolate), 4 (methanol).

But wait, that would mean propionate is more reactive than cyclohexanolate. But according to the base strength, propionate is weaker than HS⁻ and OH⁻, but stronger than cyclohexanolate? No, because cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, which is stronger than HS⁻, which is stronger than propionate.

Wait, so in the order, propionate is the weakest base, so the best nucleophile. But earlier I thought that in aqueous, weaker bases are better nucleophiles. So the order would be:

Propionate (3) > HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Methanol (4).

But wait, that can't be right because HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, so it's a better nucleophile than OH⁻. So propionate being weaker than HS⁻ would mean it's a better nucleophile than HS⁻.

Wait, no. Propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻. So, propionate should be a better nucleophile than HS⁻ in aqueous solution because it's a weaker base, less solvated.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻, it's less stabilized by solvation and more available to attack. So propionate would be more nucleophilic than HS⁻.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because I thought HS⁻ would be a better nucleophile than OH⁻, which is better than propionate.

Wait, perhaps I need to correct this.

The correct ranking based on base strength (strongest to weakest):

4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > OH⁻ (2) > HS⁻ (5) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

In aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity is inversely proportional to base strength. So weaker bases are better nucleophiles.

Thus, the order from most to least nucleophilic would be:

Propionate (3) > HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Methanol (4).

But that would mean that propionate is the best nucleophile, which doesn't align with my earlier thought that HS⁻ is better than OH⁻.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach.

The nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (protic) generally follows the trend: weaker base → better nucleophile.

We have:

Nucleophile | Base Strength (Strongest to Weakest)
--- | ---
4-MeCyclohexanolate | Strongest
OH⁻ | Stronger than HS⁻ and Propionate
HS⁻ | Weaker than OH⁻ but stronger than Propionate
Propionate | Weakest
Methanol | Neutral (weakest)

So, the nucleophilicity order (weakest base first):

Propionate (3) > HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Methanol (4).

But wait, Methanol is a neutral molecule, so it's a poor nucleophile. So the order would be:

3 (Propionate) >5 (HS⁻) >2 (OH⁻) >1 (4-MeCyclohexanolate) >4 (Methanol).

But looking at the options, which option matches this?

The options are:

A) 5,2,3,1,4 → 5 (HS⁻), 2 (OH⁻),3 (Prop),1 (4-MeCyclo),4 (MeOH)
B)2,5,1,4,3 → 2 (OH⁻),5,1,4,3
C)2,5,3,4,3 → Doesn't make sense
D)5,2,1,3,4 →5,2,1,3,4

Wait, none of the options match the order I proposed (3,5,2,1,4). Since none of the options have Propionate as the most reactive, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering propionate's base strength. Let me check the pKa of propionic acid again. Propionic acid has a pKa of around 4.88, so the propionate ion is a weaker base than HS⁻ (pKa ~10), which is weaker than OH⁻ (pKa ~15.7), which is weaker than 4-MeCyclohexanolate (pKa ~19.5).

So, if the correct order of base strength is:

4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > OH⁻ (2) > HS⁻ (5) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

Then, their nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (weaker base → better nucleophile) would be:

Propionate (3) > HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) >4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Methanol (4).

But the options don't have this order. Let me look at the options again.

Option A:5,2,3,1,4 → HS⁻, OH⁻, Prop, 4-MeCyclo, MeOH.

Option D:5,2,1,3,4 → HS⁻, OH⁻, 4-MeCyclo, Prop, MeOH.

Neither of these match my proposed order. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the order is HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) >4-MeCyclo (1) > Prop (3) > MeOH (4).

So that's the order I thought earlier. Let's see if any option matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option A is 5,2,3,1,4 → 5,2,3,1,4.

No, that's HS⁻, OH⁻, Prop, 4-MeCyclo, MeOH.

Option D is 5,2,1,3,4 → 5,2,1,3,4.

So HS⁻, OH⁻,4-MeCyclo, Prop, MeOH.

Which option matches the order I thought (5 > 2 > 1 >3>4)?

Option D:5,2,1,3,4.

So, the order is 5 (HS⁻), 2 (OH⁻), 1 (4-MeCyclo),3 (Prop),4 (MeOH).

Wait, but according to base strength, 4-MeCyclo is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it should be less nucleophilic than OH⁻. So that can't be. So the correct order should have OH⁻ more nucleophilic than 4-MeCyclo.

So the correct order should be 5 (HS⁻), 2 (OH⁻), then 1 (4-MeCyclo) comes after? But that would mean 4-MeCyclo is less nucleophilic than OH⁻, which is correct since it's a stronger base.

So the order would be:

5 (HS⁻) > 2 (OH⁻) > 1 (4-MeCyclo) >3 (Prop) >4 (MeOH).

Which matches Option D:5,2,1,3,4.

Wait, but according to base strength, Prop is weaker than HS⁻, so it should be a better nucleophile than HS⁻. So I'm confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the basicity and nucleophilicity in polar aprotic solvents, but the question is about aqueous solution, which is polar protic.

In polar aprotic, nucleophilicity correlates with basicity. But in polar protic, it's the opposite.

So for polar protic:

Weaker base → better nucleophile.

So, the order from weakest to strongest base:

Propionate (3) < HS⁻ (5) < OH⁻ (2) <4-MeCyclo (1).

So the nucleophilicity order would be:

Prop (3) > HS (5) > OH (2) >4-MeCyclo (1) > MeOH (4).

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct answer is option D?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the structure of the cyclohexanolate. 4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a bulky base. In SN2 reactions, bulky groups can hinder the backside attack, but in terms of nucleophilicity in solution, bulk might influence solvation. Maybe the bulky cyclohexanolate is less solvated than a less bulky base like OH⁻.

Wait, but in protic solvents, bulky bases are less solvated because the solvent can't get in as easily. So a bulky base like 4-MeCyclohexanolate might be less solvated, making it a better nucleophile than less bulky bases.

Wait, that could change the order. So if 4-MeCyclohexanolate is a bulky base, it might not be as solvated as OH⁻, making it a better nucleophile than OH⁻ despite being a stronger base.

But I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous is:

HS⁻ (5) >4-MeCyclo (1) > OH⁻ (2) > Prop (3) > MeOH (4).

But I don't know. This is getting complicated.

Looking at the options, option D is 5,2,1,3,4. So 5,2,1,3,4.

Which corresponds to HS⁻, OH⁻, 4-MeCyclo, Prop, MeOH.

If that's the case, then 4-MeCyclo would be more nucleophilic than Prop. But according to base strength, 4-MeCyclo is stronger base than Prop, so it should be less nucleophilic. So this doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I overlooked something. Methanol is a poor nucleophile because it's a neutral molecule. So it's the least reactive. Propionate is a weak base but perhaps not as good a nucleophile as HS⁻ and OH⁻.

So perhaps the correct order is HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) >4-MeCyclo (1) > Prop (3) >MeOH (4).

Which would match option D.

But I'm really not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 5,2,1,3,4.

Looking at the options, option D is that.

So I think the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the nucleophilicity of the given nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we consider the following:

1. **Nucleophilicity in Polar Protic Solvents**: In aqueous solution, nucleophilicity is inversely related to the strength of the base. Weaker bases are better nucleophiles because they are less solvated and more available to attack. Stronger bases are more solvated, making them less nucleophilic.

2. **Base Strength and pKa**: The strength of a base is determined by the pKa of its conjugate acid. A higher pKa of the conjugate acid indicates a stronger base. For the given nucleophiles:
   - **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)**: Derived from 4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa ~19.5), it is the strongest base.
   - **Hydroxide (OH⁻) (2)**: Derived from water (pKa ~15.7), it is a moderately strong base.
   - **Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) (5)**: Derived from ethanethiol (pKa ~10), it is a weaker base than OH⁻.
   - **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻) (3)**: Derived from propionic acid (pKa ~4.88), it is the weakest base.
   - **Methanol (CH₃OH) (4)**: A neutral molecule, it is the poorest nucleophile.

3. **Nucleophilicity Order**: Based on the above, the nucleophilicity order in aqueous solution (from most reactive to least reactive) is:
   - **Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) (5)**: A weaker base than OH⁻, it is less solvated and more nucleophilic.
   - **Hydroxide (OH⁻) (2)**: A stronger base than HS⁻, it is less nucleophilic.
   - **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)**: A stronger base than OH⁻, it is less nucleophilic due to greater solvation.
   - **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻) (3)**: The weakest base, but also less nucleophilic due to its charge and structure.
   - **Methanol (CH₃OH) (4)**: A neutral molecule, it is the poorest nucleophile.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A (5, 2, 3, 1, 4)**: Incorrect, as it places propionate (3) as more reactive than 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1), which contradicts the base strength and nucleophilicity relationship.
   - **Option B (2, 5, 1, 4, 3)**: Incorrect, as it places hydroxide (2) as more reactive than ethanethiolate (5), which is inconsistent with their base strengths.
   - **Option C (2, 5, 3, 4, 3)**: Invalid, as it repeats propionate (3) and does not match the correct order.
   - **Option D (5, 2, 1, 3, 4)**: Correct, as it aligns with the nucleophilicity order derived above.

**Final Answer**: The correct order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution is **5 (HS⁻) > 2 (OH⁻) > 1 (4-MeCyclo) > 3 (Prop) > 4 (MeOH)**, which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I have this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solutions, and I need to arrange the given nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least reactive. Hmm, let me think. I remember that nucleophilicity can depend on various factors like the solvent, the charge of the nucleophile, and the structure.

The nucleophiles given are:
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)
3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)

Wait, right, in aqueous solution, the solvent is polar and protic. So the reactivity of nucleophiles in such a solvent is influenced by solvation. Stronger bases are better nucleophiles in such conditions because they're less solvated. But wait, I might be getting that mixed up. Let me think again.

In polar protic solvents, larger, less solvated ions are better nucleophiles. For example, I⁻ is a better nucleophile in such solvents than Cl⁻ because it's less tightly held by the solvent. So the size of the ion matters. Also, the charge—more charge means better nucleophile, but if it's too tightly solvated, it might not be as reactive.

Looking at the options, some are conjugate bases of strong acids. Let's see:

Hydroxide (OH⁻) is the conjugate base of a strong acid, HCl? Wait no, HCl is a strong acid, but OH⁻ comes from H2O. Oh wait, hydroxide is a stronger base than, say, propionate or ethanethiolate?

Wait, I think the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (polar protic) for common ions is: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻. But wait, that's for halides. What about these other nucleophiles?

Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) is the conjugate base of HSH (wait, no, ethanethiol is CH3CH2SH). So HS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻? Because sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, so the thiolate ion is a weaker base? Wait no, actually, the pKa of ethanethiol is around 10, while for water it's about 15.7. So the conjugate base of ethanethiol (HS⁻) is a weaker base than OH⁻. Wait, no, wait: a stronger acid has a weaker conjugate base. So if ethanethiol (HS) has a lower pKa (like around 10) than water (pKa ~15.7), then HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So the HS⁻ ion is less basic than OH⁻, which would mean that in a polar protic solvent, HS⁻ is a better nucleophile than OH⁻? Because being a weaker base, it's less stabilized by solvation.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the opposite. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. In protic solvents, larger, less solvated ions are better nucleophiles. So SN2 reactions in protic solvents favor larger, less solvated nucleophiles. So for example, in the gas phase, I⁻ is a better nucleophile than F⁻. But in water, because I⁻ is larger and less solvated, it's a better nucleophile than F⁻. So in the case of HS⁻ and OH⁻, HS⁻ is larger (sulfur is bigger than oxygen), so maybe it's a better nucleophile in aqueous solution.

Wait, but HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. Wait, no, HS⁻ is a weaker base because ethanethiol is a stronger acid than water. So HS⁻ is less basic. But in a protic solvent, less basic (weaker) nucleophiles are better nucleophiles because they're less solvated. So I think HS⁻ is a better nucleophile than OH⁻ in aqueous solution.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of examples. For instance, in SN2 reactions, iodide is a better nucleophile than hydroxide in polar protic solvents because it's less solvated. So in that case, HS⁻ (which is larger than OH⁻) would be a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

So the order so far: HS⁻ (5) is more nucleophilic than OH⁻ (2).

What about the other nucleophiles?

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate. That's a conjugate base of 4-methylcyclohexanol. Since it's an alkoxide, its nucleophilicity depends on the stability of the base. The more stable the base (due to conjugation or structure), the weaker the base, but perhaps the better the nucleophile in polar protic solvents? Wait, no. Wait, if the base is more stable (weaker base), it's less solvated, thus more nucleophilic in protic solvents.

So the cyclohexan-olate is a stronger base than something like propionate? Because propionate is the conjugate base of a weak acid. Wait, propionic acid has a pKa around 4.88. So the propionate ion is a weaker base than hydroxide (pKa of water is 15.7). So the propionate ion is less basic than OH⁻.

Wait, but the cyclohexan-olate is a stronger base than propionate? Because the pKa of cyclohexanol is around 19, which is more acidic than propionic acid (pKa ~5). Wait, no: a higher pKa means a weaker acid. Cyclohexanol has a pKa around 19.5, so it's a weaker acid than propionic acid. So the conjugate base of cyclohexanol (the cyclohexanolate) is a stronger base than propionate. Because a weaker acid (higher pKa) has a stronger conjugate base.

So the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than propionate. So in aqueous solution, which is a polar protic solvent, the cyclohexanolate would be less nucleophilic than something that is a weaker base because stronger bases are more solvated.

Wait, no, wait: in polar protic solvents, weaker bases are better nucleophiles. So if cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than propionate, then propionate is a weaker base. So in aqueous solution, propionate would be a better nucleophile than cyclohexanolate? No, wait, stronger bases are more solvated and thus worse nucleophiles. So a weaker base, which is less solvated, is a better nucleophile.

But I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The order of nucleophilicity in a polar protic solvent (like aqueous) is based on how well the nucleophile is solvated. Poor solvation means the nucleophile is more available to attack. So, stronger bases (which are smaller, like OH⁻) are more solvated, so less reactive. Whereas weaker bases, which are larger, are less solvated and more reactive.

But wait, in the case of the cyclohexanolate, it's a larger anion compared to OH⁻. So maybe it's less solvated than OH⁻, making it a better nucleophile. But if the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than propionate, which is a weaker base than OH⁻, then the order of nucleophilicity would be: cyclohexanolate is less basic than OH⁻? No, because cyclohexanol is a weaker acid (pKa ~19) than water (pKa ~15.7). Wait, no, wait: cyclohexanol is a weaker acid than water because it has a higher pKa. So the conjugate base (cyclohexanolate) is a stronger base than hydroxide. Because, in water, a weaker acid (higher pKa) has a stronger conjugate base. So cyclohexanol (pKa 19) is weaker acid than H2O (pKa 15.7), so cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻.

So, in aqueous solution, the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻. So in a protic solvent, stronger bases are more solvated and hence less nucleophilic. So weaker bases (like propionate, which is a weaker base than cyclohexanolate) would be better nucleophiles.

Wait, wait, let me make a table:

Nucleophile | Conjugate Acid pKa | Strength of Base
--- | --- | ---
HS⁻ (ethanethiolate) | ~10 | weaker base (since thiol is stronger acid than water)
OH⁻ | ~15.7 | stronger base than HS⁻
Propionate (CH2CH2COO⁻) | ~4.88 | weaker base than OH⁻ and cyclohexanolate
4-Methylcyclohexanolate | ~19.5 | stronger base than OH⁻
Methanol (CH3OH) | ~19.7 | a neutral molecule, not a strong nucleophile

Wait, so the propionate is a weaker base than OH⁻, and the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻. Methanol is a neutral molecule and a poor nucleophile in aqueous solution because it's not deprotonated. So its nucleophilicity is low.

So arranging from strongest to weakest nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (polar protic):

Weaker bases (less solvated) are better nucleophiles.

Looking at the list:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻): Weaker base than OH⁻, so more nucleophilic than OH⁻.

Wait, no. Wait, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻ because H2S is a stronger acid than H2O. So HS⁻ is less stabilized by solvation (because it's a weaker base) and thus more nucleophilic in a protic solvent.

So HS⁻ (5) is more nucleophilic than OH⁻ (2).

Next, looking at 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1): it's a stronger base than OH⁻ (since its conjugate acid is weaker). So in a protic solvent, it's more solvated, making it a worse nucleophile than OH⁻. So its nucleophilicity would be lower than OH⁻?

Wait, no. Wait, if the base is stronger, it is more solvated. So stronger base → more solvation → less nucleophilicity.

So HS⁻ (weaker base) is less solvated → better nucleophile than OH⁻.

Then, OH⁻ is a stronger base than propionate and cyclohexanolate?

Wait, no, cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify:

- The order of the strength of the bases: 4-methylcyclohexanolate (pKa 19.5) > OH⁻ (pKa 15.7) > HS⁻ (pKa ~10) > propionate (pKa ~4.88).

Wait no, wait. Wait, the order of the conjugate acids being weaker (higher pKa) would mean their conjugate bases are stronger. So:

Conjugate acids' pKa:

Propionic acid: ~4.88 → propionate is a weak base.

Water: 15.7 → OH⁻ is a stronger base than propionate.

4-Methylcyclohexanol: ~19.5 → cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻.

Ethanethiol: ~10 → HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻.

So the strength of the bases from strongest to weakest: 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) > OH⁻ (2) > HS⁻ (5) > propionate (3), and methanol is neutral.

Wait, no. Wait, for the base strength: the higher the pKa of the conjugate acid, the stronger the base. So:

Conj. Acid | pKa
--- | ---
4-MeCyclohexanol | ~19.5 → Base: 4-MeCyclohexanolate
Water | ~15.7 → OH⁻
Ethanethiol | ~10 → HS⁻
Propionic acid | ~4.88 → Propionate

So base strength order: 4-MeCyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

But in a polar protic solvent, the more basic the nucleophile, the more it is solvated, making it less nucleophilic.

So the nucleophilicity order (from best to worst) in aqueous solution would be the reverse of the base strength. So:

Weakest base → less solvated → better nucleophile.

So the order would be Propionate < HS⁻ < OH⁻ < 4-MeCyclohexanolate.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

In aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity order is determined by how well the nucleophile is solvated. Stronger bases are more solvated and thus less nucleophilic. So the weaker the base (the stronger the conjugate acid), the less it's solvated and the better the nucleophile in a protic solvent.

So the order of nucleophilicity would be:

Least basic → most nucleophilic.

So:

Propionate (weakest base here) → but wait, looking at the list, HS⁻ is weaker than OH⁻, but stronger than propionate?

Wait, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, but stronger than propionate (since propionate's conjugate acid is stronger, so propionate's base is weaker).

Wait, propionate's conjugate acid (propionic acid) has a pKa of ~4.88. Ethanethiol has pKa ~10. So HS⁻ is weaker base than cyclohexanolate and OH⁻, but stronger base than propionate?

Wait, no. Wait, the strength of the base is inversely related to the strength of the acid (conjugate acid). So a weaker acid has a stronger conjugate base.

Ethanethiol is stronger acid than propionic acid. So HS⁻ is weaker base than propionate.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the acid is stronger, the conjugate base is weaker. So propionic acid (pKa ~4.88) is a stronger acid than ethanethiol (pKa ~10). So propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻) is a weaker base than HS⁻.

Wait, that makes sense. So the order of base strength:

4-MeCyclohexanolate (strongest) > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate (weakest).

So in aqueous (protic) solution, the weakest bases are better nucleophiles. So the nucleophilicity order is:

Propionate (3) < HS⁻ (5) < OH⁻ (2) < 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1).

Wait, but wait, that would mean that propionate is the worst nucleophile, followed by HS⁻, then OH⁻, then cyclohexanolate. Then, methanol is a neutral molecule, so it's a poor nucleophile.

Wait, but then where does methanol fit in? Methanol is a neutral molecule, which is a weaker nucleophile than the deprotonated species. So in the nucleophilicity order, it's the least reactive.

So putting it all together, the order from most reactive to least reactive nucleophile in aqueous solution would be:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So in aqueous solution, being a weaker base, HS⁻ is less solvated and thus a better nucleophile than OH⁻? Or is the opposite true?

I think I might have this wrong. Let me think about another example. In aqueous solution, iodide (I⁻) is a better nucleophile than hydroxide (OH⁻). I⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻ because HI is a stronger acid than H2O. So in a protic solvent, the weaker base (I⁻) is a better nucleophile.

So applying that same logic, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, so it should be a better nucleophile than OH⁻ in aqueous solution.

So the order should be:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

Wait, but wait, 4-MeCyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻. So, in aqueous, it's more solvated and less nucleophilic than OH⁻. So, HS⁻ is better than OH⁻, which is better than 4-MeCyclohexanolate?

No, wait. No. The order of base strength is:

4-MeCyclohexanolate (strongest) > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

In aqueous, nucleophilicity is inversely related to base strength. So the weakest base is the best nucleophile. So:

Propionate (weakest base) → but wait, no. Wait, the weakest base is propionate, which would be the best nucleophile? Wait, that can't be right because propionate is a less basic anion but might be poor in nucleophilicity.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the trend again. In polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity order tends to be: weaker base (larger, less solvated) > stronger base (smaller, more solvated).

So for the given nucleophiles:

HS⁻ (weaker base than OH⁻) → better nucleophile than OH⁻.

4-MeCyclohexanolate (stronger base than OH⁻) → worse nucleophile than OH⁻.

Wait, no. Because 4-MeCyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it's more solvated, making it a less effective nucleophile than OH⁻.

So the correct order would be:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Because I thought that the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base, so worse nucleophile than OH⁻. So the order between HS⁻, OH⁻, and cyclohexanolate would be:

HS⁻ (5) is the best, then OH⁻ (2), then cyclohexanolate (1) is worse than OH⁻.

Then, after that comes propionate (3), which is a weaker base than HS⁻, but it's less nucleophilic than HS⁻ and OH⁻. Wait, no. Propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻? Because propionic acid is stronger acid than ethanethiol. So the conjugate base of propionic acid (propionate) is weaker than HS⁻.

So the base strength order: 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > OH⁻ (2) > HS⁻ (5) > Propionate (3).

So in terms of nucleophilicity in aqueous (protic):

Propionate (3) is the weakest base, but in reality, propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻, meaning HS⁻ is a better nucleophile than propionate.

Wait, maybe I got it reversed. Let me think: weaker base → less solvated → better nucleophile.

So the order from best to worst nucleophile in aqueous:

HS⁻ (5) → weaker base than OH⁻ → better nucleophilicity than OH⁻.

Then, OH⁻ (2) → stronger base than HS⁻ → worse nucleophilicity than HS⁻.

Then, the order continues with 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) being the strongest base, so the worst nucleophile.

Wait, but 4-MeCyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so in aqueous it's worse nucleophile than OH⁻.

So the order is:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

Wait, but propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻, so it should be a better nucleophile. But according to the base strength, propionate is weaker than HS⁻. Then, propionate would be a better nucleophile than HS⁻. No, that can't be. Because HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, which makes it a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Let me rank each nucleophile's nucleophilicity in aqueous solution.

In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for common ions is typically:

I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ > OH⁻ > (some other ions).

But in this case, we have HS⁻, which is a larger ion. So perhaps it's a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

So, let's list the nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strong base → poor nucleophile in aqueous)
2. OH⁻ (moderate base → moderate nucleophile)
3. Propionate (weak base → better nucleophile than OH⁻?)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) (weak base → better nucleophile than OH⁻)
4. Methanol (neutral → poor nucleophile)

Wait, no, because in aqueous solution, the strength of the base is inversely related to nucleophilicity. So weaker bases are better nucleophiles.

So, the strength of the bases from strongest to weakest:

4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > OH⁻ (2) > HS⁻ (5) > Propionate (3).

So the order of nucleophilicity (weakest base first, since they are better nucleophiles) would be:

Propionate (3) < HS⁻ (5) < OH⁻ (2) < 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1).

Wait, that doesn't make sense because propionate is a weaker base, it should be a better nucleophile than HS⁻.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the pKa values again. Propionate comes from a stronger acid (pKa ~4.88) than HS⁻ (pKa ~10). So propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻. So HS⁻ is a stronger base than propionate.

So, in terms of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, the order would be:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

But wait, why is 4-MeCyclohexanolate less nucleophilic than OH⁻? Because it is a stronger base, more solvated, so less reactive.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

But that doesn't align with the base strength. Because 4-MeCyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it should be less nucleophilic.

Alternatively, let me think about the HSAB theory. Hard nucleophiles prefer hard solvents, soft prefer soft. HS⁻ is a soft nucleophile, OH⁻ is hard. But in aqueous solution (a hard solvent), OH⁻ is more favored. So perhaps in aqueous solution, HS⁻ isn't as good as OH⁻. Hmm, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

In aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity order is: 4-MeCyclohexanolate < OH⁻ < HS⁻.

Wait, no, that can't be because 4-MeCyclohexanolate is a stronger base and thus more solvated, making it a worse nucleophile.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

But I'm not confident. Let's think about the options given.

The options are:

A) 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4

Which would be: 5 (HS⁻), 2 (OH⁻), 3 (propionate), 1 (cyclohexanolate), 4 (methanol).

But wait, that would mean propionate is more reactive than cyclohexanolate. But according to the base strength, propionate is weaker than HS⁻ and OH⁻, but stronger than cyclohexanolate? No, because cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, which is stronger than HS⁻, which is stronger than propionate.

Wait, so in the order, propionate is the weakest base, so the best nucleophile. But earlier I thought that in aqueous, weaker bases are better nucleophiles. So the order would be:

Propionate (3) > HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Methanol (4).

But wait, that can't be right because HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, so it's a better nucleophile than OH⁻. So propionate being weaker than HS⁻ would mean it's a better nucleophile than HS⁻.

Wait, no. Propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻. So, propionate should be a better nucleophile than HS⁻ in aqueous solution because it's a weaker base, less solvated.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻, it's less stabilized by solvation and more available to attack. So propionate would be more nucleophilic than HS⁻.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because I thought HS⁻ would be a better nucleophile than OH⁻, which is better than propionate.

Wait, perhaps I need to correct this.

The correct ranking based on base strength (strongest to weakest):

4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > OH⁻ (2) > HS⁻ (5) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

In aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity is inversely proportional to base strength. So weaker bases are better nucleophiles.

Thus, the order from most to least nucleophilic would be:

Propionate (3) > HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Methanol (4).

But that would mean that propionate is the best nucleophile, which doesn't align with my earlier thought that HS⁻ is better than OH⁻.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach.

The nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (protic) generally follows the trend: weaker base → better nucleophile.

We have:

Nucleophile | Base Strength (Strongest to Weakest)
--- | ---
4-MeCyclohexanolate | Strongest
OH⁻ | Stronger than HS⁻ and Propionate
HS⁻ | Weaker than OH⁻ but stronger than Propionate
Propionate | Weakest
Methanol | Neutral (weakest)

So, the nucleophilicity order (weakest base first):

Propionate (3) > HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Methanol (4).

But wait, Methanol is a neutral molecule, so it's a poor nucleophile. So the order would be:

3 (Propionate) >5 (HS⁻) >2 (OH⁻) >1 (4-MeCyclohexanolate) >4 (Methanol).

But looking at the options, which option matches this?

The options are:

A) 5,2,3,1,4 → 5 (HS⁻), 2 (OH⁻),3 (Prop),1 (4-MeCyclo),4 (MeOH)
B)2,5,1,4,3 → 2 (OH⁻),5,1,4,3
C)2,5,3,4,3 → Doesn't make sense
D)5,2,1,3,4 →5,2,1,3,4

Wait, none of the options match the order I proposed (3,5,2,1,4). Since none of the options have Propionate as the most reactive, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering propionate's base strength. Let me check the pKa of propionic acid again. Propionic acid has a pKa of around 4.88, so the propionate ion is a weaker base than HS⁻ (pKa ~10), which is weaker than OH⁻ (pKa ~15.7), which is weaker than 4-MeCyclohexanolate (pKa ~19.5).

So, if the correct order of base strength is:

4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > OH⁻ (2) > HS⁻ (5) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

Then, their nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (weaker base → better nucleophile) would be:

Propionate (3) > HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) >4-MeCyclohexanolate (1) > Methanol (4).

But the options don't have this order. Let me look at the options again.

Option A:5,2,3,1,4 → HS⁻, OH⁻, Prop, 4-MeCyclo, MeOH.

Option D:5,2,1,3,4 → HS⁻, OH⁻, 4-MeCyclo, Prop, MeOH.

Neither of these match my proposed order. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the order is HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) >4-MeCyclo (1) > Prop (3) > MeOH (4).

So that's the order I thought earlier. Let's see if any option matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option A is 5,2,3,1,4 → 5,2,3,1,4.

No, that's HS⁻, OH⁻, Prop, 4-MeCyclo, MeOH.

Option D is 5,2,1,3,4 → 5,2,1,3,4.

So HS⁻, OH⁻,4-MeCyclo, Prop, MeOH.

Which option matches the order I thought (5 > 2 > 1 >3>4)?

Option D:5,2,1,3,4.

So, the order is 5 (HS⁻), 2 (OH⁻), 1 (4-MeCyclo),3 (Prop),4 (MeOH).

Wait, but according to base strength, 4-MeCyclo is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it should be less nucleophilic than OH⁻. So that can't be. So the correct order should have OH⁻ more nucleophilic than 4-MeCyclo.

So the correct order should be 5 (HS⁻), 2 (OH⁻), then 1 (4-MeCyclo) comes after? But that would mean 4-MeCyclo is less nucleophilic than OH⁻, which is correct since it's a stronger base.

So the order would be:

5 (HS⁻) > 2 (OH⁻) > 1 (4-MeCyclo) >3 (Prop) >4 (MeOH).

Which matches Option D:5,2,1,3,4.

Wait, but according to base strength, Prop is weaker than HS⁻, so it should be a better nucleophile than HS⁻. So I'm confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the basicity and nucleophilicity in polar aprotic solvents, but the question is about aqueous solution, which is polar protic.

In polar aprotic, nucleophilicity correlates with basicity. But in polar protic, it's the opposite.

So for polar protic:

Weaker base → better nucleophile.

So, the order from weakest to strongest base:

Propionate (3) < HS⁻ (5) < OH⁻ (2) <4-MeCyclo (1).

So the nucleophilicity order would be:

Prop (3) > HS (5) > OH (2) >4-MeCyclo (1) > MeOH (4).

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct answer is option D?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the structure of the cyclohexanolate. 4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a bulky base. In SN2 reactions, bulky groups can hinder the backside attack, but in terms of nucleophilicity in solution, bulk might influence solvation. Maybe the bulky cyclohexanolate is less solvated than a less bulky base like OH⁻.

Wait, but in protic solvents, bulky bases are less solvated because the solvent can't get in as easily. So a bulky base like 4-MeCyclohexanolate might be less solvated, making it a better nucleophile than less bulky bases.

Wait, that could change the order. So if 4-MeCyclohexanolate is a bulky base, it might not be as solvated as OH⁻, making it a better nucleophile than OH⁻ despite being a stronger base.

But I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous is:

HS⁻ (5) >4-MeCyclo (1) > OH⁻ (2) > Prop (3) > MeOH (4).

But I don't know. This is getting complicated.

Looking at the options, option D is 5,2,1,3,4. So 5,2,1,3,4.

Which corresponds to HS⁻, OH⁻, 4-MeCyclo, Prop, MeOH.

If that's the case, then 4-MeCyclo would be more nucleophilic than Prop. But according to base strength, 4-MeCyclo is stronger base than Prop, so it should be less nucleophilic. So this doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I overlooked something. Methanol is a poor nucleophile because it's a neutral molecule. So it's the least reactive. Propionate is a weak base but perhaps not as good a nucleophile as HS⁻ and OH⁻.

So perhaps the correct order is HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) >4-MeCyclo (1) > Prop (3) >MeOH (4).

Which would match option D.

But I'm really not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 5,2,1,3,4.

Looking at the options, option D is that.

So I think the answer is D.


To determine the nucleophilicity of the given nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we consider the following:

1. **Nucleophilicity in Polar Protic Solvents**: In aqueous solution, nucleophilicity is inversely related to the strength of the base. Weaker bases are better nucleophiles because they are less solvated and more available to attack. Stronger bases are more solvated, making them less nucleophilic.

2. **Base Strength and pKa**: The strength of a base is determined by the pKa of its conjugate acid. A higher pKa of the conjugate acid indicates a stronger base. For the given nucleophiles:
   - **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)**: Derived from 4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa ~19.5), it is the strongest base.
   - **Hydroxide (OH⁻) (2)**: Derived from water (pKa ~15.7), it is a moderately strong base.
   - **Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) (5)**: Derived from ethanethiol (pKa ~10), it is a weaker base than OH⁻.
   - **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻) (3)**: Derived from propionic acid (pKa ~4.88), it is the weakest base.
   - **Methanol (CH₃OH) (4)**: A neutral molecule, it is the poorest nucleophile.

3. **Nucleophilicity Order**: Based on the above, the nucleophilicity order in aqueous solution (from most reactive to least reactive) is:
   - **Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) (5)**: A weaker base than OH⁻, it is less solvated and more nucleophilic.
   - **Hydroxide (OH⁻) (2)**: A stronger base than HS⁻, it is less nucleophilic.
   - **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)**: A stronger base than OH⁻, it is less nucleophilic due to greater solvation.
   - **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻) (3)**: The weakest base, but also less nucleophilic due to its charge and structure.
   - **Methanol (CH₃OH) (4)**: A neutral molecule, it is the poorest nucleophile.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A (5, 2, 3, 1, 4)**: Incorrect, as it places propionate (3) as more reactive than 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1), which contradicts the base strength and nucleophilicity relationship.
   - **Option B (2, 5, 1, 4, 3)**: Incorrect, as it places hydroxide (2) as more reactive than ethanethiolate (5), which is inconsistent with their base strengths.
   - **Option C (2, 5, 3, 4, 3)**: Invalid, as it repeats propionate (3) and does not match the correct order.
   - **Option D (5, 2, 1, 3, 4)**: Correct, as it aligns with the nucleophilicity order derived above.

**Final Answer**: The correct order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution is **5 (HS⁻) > 2 (OH⁻) > 1 (4-MeCyclo) > 3 (Prop) > 4 (MeOH)**, which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
