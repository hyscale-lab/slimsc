Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question. Let me read it carefully. The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and found mutations in the first exon area. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so any changes there can affect the protein product. The anti-nutritional compound is a product of this gene, so we probably want a mutation that disrupts its synthesis. That could be a loss-of-function mutation, like a premature stop codon or a frameshift that changes the protein structure.

Looking at the options, all the mutants have changes in the first exon. Let me compare each mutant's sequence to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...
Wait, let me look at the differences. The first part: Intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT... Mutant 1 is ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT... So the fourth codon in the intact is TTT (Phe), in Mutant 1 it's TTC (also Phe), but the next codon changes. Wait, the third position maybe? Or perhaps another substitution.

Wait, let me write the sequences more clearly.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC...

Wait, in the first part, the second codon is TTC (Phe) instead of TTT (Phe). So that's a silent mutation; same amino acid. Then the third codon in the intact is CTC (Leu), but in Mutant 1, it's TAC (Tyr). Oh, so that's a change in the third codon. So the third amino acid would change from Leu to Tyr. That's an amino acid substitution. But would that disrupt the protein enough to stop the anti-nutritional compound? Maybe, but I'm not sure yet.

Mutant 2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC...
Wait, the third codon is TAA. Let me see. The first part of the intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT... So the first codon is ATG (Met), the second TTT (Phe), third CTC (Leu). In Mutant 2, the third codon is TAA. Wait, no. Wait, the first part is ATG TTC TAA GCT... So the second codon is TTC (Phe), third is TAA. TAA is a stop codon, right? Oh! So the third codon becomes TAA, which is a stop codon. If that's the case, the protein synthesis would terminate early. So the protein would be shorter. Maybe this would disrupt the function, perhaps inactivating the gene. So if the gene product is the anti-nutritional compound, this mutation might eliminate it.

Wait, but wait. Let me check. In the mutant 2 sequence, the third codon after the Met is TTC (Phe), then TAA. So the third codon is TAA, which is a stop signal. So the gene would produce a truncated protein. That could disrupt the function of the compound, possibly inactivating it. So that's a candidate.

Mutant 3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA...
Wait, looking at the sequence: Intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... So in Mutant 3, the third codon is TAC, which is Tyr. Wait, but looking further, perhaps another change. Wait, the third codon is the third position in the exon. Let me check. Wait, I think I need to compare each part.

Alternatively, maybe I should count the changes. Let me look for any frameshifts or new stop codons.

Mutant 3: Let me see the sequence. The first part is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Wait, the intact gene is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant 3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Wait, the first part: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA...

So the third codon is TAC (Tyr), which in the intact is CTC (Leu). So that's a substitution. But then, the next codon is GCT (Ala) in intact, but in mutant 3, it's GCT as well? Wait, no. Wait, the intact after CTC GCT is GCT GGT (Leu Ala Gly). In Mutant 3, the sequence is TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT. Wait, so after TAC (third codon), the next is GCT (fourth codon), same as before, but the fifth codon is GGT in intact, but in Mutant 3 it's GTC. So that's a change from Gly to Val. More substitution. So this is a missense mutation, but not a frameshift. So the protein would have different amino acids but same length. Maybe this doesn't cause a complete loss of function.

Mutant 4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to intact: The first part of intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... So the third codon is CTC (Leu), and fourth GCT (Ala), fifth GGT (Gly), sixth ACT (Thr).

In Mutant 4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG... So after TAC (third codon), the fourth is GCT (Ala), fifth is ACT (Thr) instead of GCT (Ala) and ACT (Thr) in the original?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write the codons for each mutant.

Intact gene:
1: ATG (Met)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: CTC (Leu)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: GGT (Gly)
6: ACT (Thr)
...

Mutant 1:
1: ATG
2: TTC (Phe)
3: TAC (Tyr) → Change from Leu to Tyr
4: GCT
5: GGT
6: ACT
... So only the third codon is changed. So a missense mutation, not a frameshift or premature stop.

Mutant 2:
1: ATG
2: TTC (Phe)
3: TAA (Stop) → So the protein would be much shorter. So this is a nonsense mutation causing a premature stop.

Mutant 3:
1: ATG
2: TTT (Phe)
3: TAC (Tyr)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: GTC (Val) → Change from Gly to Val
6: ACT (Thr)
... So two substitutions, but no stop.

Mutant 4:
1: ATG
2: TTT (Phe)
3: TAC (Tyr)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: ACT (Thr) → Wait, no. Wait, the fifth codon in intact is GGT (Gly), but in Mutant 4, the fifth codon is ACT? Or is it different?

Wait, let me look again. The sequence of mutant 4 is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So the first part is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Wait, let me break it down:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So:

1: ATG (Met)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: TAC (Tyr)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: ACT (Thr)
6: TCT (Ser)

Wait, so in the intact gene, the fifth codon is GGT (Gly), but in Mutant 4, the fifth is ACT (Thr). So the fifth codon changed from GGT to ACT. So Gly to Thr. Also, is there a change in the number of codons? Let me see. The length of the sequence seems the same as the intact, so no frameshift.

So Mutant 4 has substitutions but no stop.

Wait, but looking back, I think I might have made a mistake. The original gene starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT... So the third codon is CTC (Leu), and fourth is GCT (Ala), fifth GGT (Gly), sixth ACT (Thr), seventh TCT (Ser), and so on.

In Mutant 4, the third codon is TAC, the fourth is GCT, the fifth is ACT. So fifth codon is ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So there's a substitution, but not a frameshift.

Now, the question is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That would happen if the gene product is non-functional. So a nonsense mutation (premature stop) in the early part of the gene would likely produce a non-functional protein.

So looking at the mutants:

- Mutant 2 has a stop codon at the third codon. That's a nonsense mutation. So the protein would be only the first two amino acids (Met, Phe), then stop. That's a good candidate for a loss of function.

- Mutant 1 and 3: missense mutations, but the rest of the protein is intact. So the gene product might still function, maybe with reduced activity but not eliminated.

- Mutant 4: another missense, same reasoning.

Wait, but what about the position of the mutation? The question states that the changes are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon. So these are early changes. So a stop codon early on would truncate the protein significantly.

So the best candidates are Mutant 2, which introduces a stop codon, and perhaps others that disrupt the reading frame.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Does Mutant 2 have a stop codon?

Yes. The third codon becomes TAA, which is a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA are the three). So that would cause the protein to terminate after the second amino acid. So the protein would be much shorter, likely non-functional.

So the correct answer should be Mutant 2, which is option A.

To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. The anti-nutritional compound is synthesized by this gene, so a loss-of-function mutation, such as a premature stop codon or a frameshift, would likely achieve this.
