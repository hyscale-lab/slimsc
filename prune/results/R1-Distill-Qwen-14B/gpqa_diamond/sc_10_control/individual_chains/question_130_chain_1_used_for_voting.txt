Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says: Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. And when it's absorbed by neutral hydrogen, it's called the Lyman-alpha forest. These absorption lines are seen in the spectra of quasars when there's intergalactic medium hydrogen along the line of sight.

Wait, but the question is about redshift. So the idea is that the Lyman alpha wavelength is observed at longer wavelengths due to redshift. But optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet, right? So the redshifted wavelength has to be in the optical range for ground-based telescopes to detect it.

Oh, right, because the atmosphere absorbs a lot of UV light, so ground-based telescopes can't observe much UV. So for the Lyman-alpha absorption line to be in the optical, it must be redshifted into the visible spectrum.

So the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. I think 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nanometers, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far ultraviolet. To be in the optical, which starts around 400 nm (violet) and goes up, the wavelength after redshift has to be at least 400 nm. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the optical range for ground-based telescopes is roughly 400 nm to about 700 nm or so, I think. So the observed wavelength after redshift must be within this range.

Wait, but for the absorption to be in the optical, the redshifted wavelength λ_obs must be >= 400 nm. Because if it's less than that, it's in the UV, which we can't see from the ground.

So the formula for redshift is z = (λ_obs / λ_emit) - 1. So λ_emit is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. We want λ_obs >= 400 nm, so z >= (400 / 121.6) - 1. Let me compute that.

400 divided by 121.6 is approximately 3.29. Subtract 1, so z is about 2.29. So the redshift has to be at least around 2.3 or higher. So what's the lower limit? The question is about the lower limit on the redshift, which would be when λ_obs is 400 nm.

So the minimal z would be (400 / 121.6) -1. Let me calculate that more precisely. 400 / 121.6 is 3.2907. So z is 2.2907. So approximately 2.3.

Looking at the options: option C is 2.4, which is near that. Option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29, so it would put the observed wavelength below 400 nm, which can't be detected. So the lower limit is a redshift of about 2.3, so option C is 2.4, which is just above that. So the lower limit is when z is just enough to bring lambda_obs to 400, so any z above that is detectable, but the lower limit is about 2.29.

Wait, but wait a second. Do we need to consider the exact optical range? Because sometimes the optical telescopes can't go much below about 350 nm or so. Hmm, if the optical range is shorter, like 350, then z would be (350 / 121.6) -1. Let's see: 350 / 121.6 is approximately 2.88. So z is 1.88. So then the lower limit would be higher redshift if the cutoff is lower. But I think the ground-based optical telescopes start at around 400 nm, so the cutoff is 400.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra as absorption lines in the UV. But if the quasar's emission is at a higher redshift, the Lyman-alpha absorption could be shifted into the optical.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the quasar itself emits light. If the quasar is at a high redshift, its emitted Lyman alpha (1216 Angstroms) is redshifted into the optical. But wait, the question is about the absorption by neutral hydrogen clouds in front of the quasar. So the quasar's light passes through these clouds, which imprint absorption lines at their own redshifts.

Wait, no. Let's clarify. The quasar emits light across the spectrum. The neutral hydrogen clouds in between the quasar and us absorb at their own rest frame Lyman alpha wavelength, which is 1216 Angstroms. So for us, the observed wavelength is λ = λ_emit * (1 + z_cloud), where z_cloud is the redshift of the cloud.

But to see that absorption in the optical range (so that ground-based telescopes can detect it), λ must be less than about 700 nm (red) but more than 400 nm (violet). So the redshifted wavelength must be in this range.

So if the cloud's redshift is such that 400 <= 1216 * (1 + z_cloud) <= 700?

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Because the cloud is at redshift z_cloud. So the wavelength we observe is λ = 1216 * (1 + z_cloud). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the cloud's Lyman alpha is at 1216 Angstroms in its rest frame. If the cloud is at redshift z, then the observed wavelength is λ = 1216 * (1 + z). So for the cloud to be observed in optical, this λ must be >= 400 nm (since 400 nm is the start of optical, and anything below is UV, which is absorbed by the atmosphere and not visible from the ground).

Wait, but 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So 1216*(1 + z) >= 4000 Angstroms.

So solving for z: 1 + z >= 4000/1216 ≈ 3.2907 → z >= 2.2907.

So the minimal redshift is about 2.29. So the lower limit is z=2.29. But looking at the options, option C is 2.4 and option D is 1.9.

Wait, but wait another thing. Another thought: sometimes, the quasar itself has a certain redshift, and the clouds in front of it have lower redshifts. Because the cloud is between us and the quasar. So the cloud's redshift is less than that of the quasar.

Wait, no. Wait, if the quasar is at redshift z_q, and the cloud is at redshift z_c, then z_c < z_q because the cloud is closer to us than the quasar. So the cloud's redshift is lower.

But in terms of the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption, is it 1216 * (1 + z_c), which must be in the optical range.

So the minimal redshift of the cloud is when 1216*(1 + z_c) = 4000 Angstroms? So z_c is about 2.29 as before.

Wait, but that can't be right because quasars are typically at higher redshifts, like z=2 or higher. So if the cloud is at z=2.29, the quasar must be at a higher redshift than that.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the object (the cloud), not the quasar. So the minimal z is when the cloud's Lyman-alpha is just at the limit of optical.

So the minimal z is about 2.29, which is around 2.3.

Looking at the options, the closest higher option is C) 2.4. So the lower limit would be just above 2.29, so the minimal redshift is 2.3, so the lower limit is approximately z=2.3.

So the answer would be option C) 2.4.

Wait, but wait another thing. Do we consider the exact definition of optical? If the optical range is lower, like starting at 350 nm, then the calculation would change.

So if optical starts at 350 nm, then 1216*(1+z) >= 3500 Angstroms (350 nm is 3500 Angstroms). So z >= (3500/1216) -1 ≈ (2.88) - 1 = 1.88.

So then the lower limit would be around 1.88, which is option D) 1.9.

Hmm, now I'm confused. Which is correct?

I think I need to clarify the optical range. What is the typical range observable by ground-based optical telescopes? I think it's roughly 400 nm to about 700 nm. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So the Lyman-alpha at 1216 Ang must be redshifted to 4000 Ang or longer to be in the optical.

So with that in mind, the calculation is z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29.

So the minimal z is approx 2.29. Therefore, the lower limit is z=2.3.

So the options are: C is 2.4, which is the next higher option. So the lower limit is about 2.3, so the minimal redshift is above that.

So the answer must be C) 2.4.

Wait, but another thing: sometimes, the definition of optical may vary. For example, some sources consider the optical range to start at 380 nm, which is near the UV. If that's the case, then the calculation would be (3800/1216) -1, which is approximately (3.123) -1 = 2.123.

So z = 2.123, so the minimal redshift would be about 2.12.

But none of the options is exactly 2.12. The options are 1.9, 2.4, etc. So perhaps option D) 1.9 is too low because 1.9 would give (1216*(1+1.9))=1216*2.9=3526.4 Angstroms, which is 352.6 nm, which is in the near-UV (since UV is below 400 nm). So ground-based telescopes can't see that, so the minimal z would be when λ_obs is 400 nm.

So going back, I think the correct lower limit is z≈2.29, so the closest option is C) 2.4.

To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman-alpha absorption (rest wavelength ~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we must ensure the redshifted wavelength falls within the optical range. Optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths from ~400 nm (violet) to ~700 nm (red). Since the atmosphere absorbs ultraviolet light, the Lyman-alpha wavelength must be redshifted to at least 400 nm for detection.

The redshift formula is:

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{emit}}} - 1
\]

Here, \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} = 121.6 \, \text{nm}\), and \(\lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 400 \, \text{nm}\) (the start of the optical range). Substituting these values:

\[
z \geq \frac{400}{121.6} - 1 \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \(z \approx 2.29\). Among the given options, the closest value is \(z = 2.4\) (option C). 

Option D (\(z = 1.9\)) corresponds to a redshifted wavelength of:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \times (1 + 1.9) = 1216 \times 2.9 = 3526.4 \, \text{Å} = 352.6 \, \text{nm},
\]

which is in the ultraviolet and not detectable by optical ground-based telescopes. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is \(z \approx 2.29\), and the correct answer is the closest option, \(z = 2.4\).

To be in the optical, which starts around 400 nm (violet) and goes up, the wavelength after redshift has to be at least 400 nm. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the optical range for ground-based telescopes is roughly 400 nm to about 700 nm or so, I think. So the observed wavelength after redshift must be within this range.

Wait, but for the absorption to be in the optical, the redshifted wavelength λ_obs must be >= 400 nm. Because if it's less than that, it's in the UV, which we can't see from the ground.

So the formula for redshift is z = (λ_obs / λ_emit) - 1. So λ_emit is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. We want λ_obs >= 400 nm, so z >= (400 / 121.6) - 1. Let me compute that.

400 divided by 121.6 is approximately 3.29. Subtract 1, so z is about 2.29. So the redshift has to be at least around 2.3 or higher. So what's the lower limit? The question is about the lower limit on the redshift, which would be when λ_obs is 400 nm.

So the minimal z would be (400 / 121.6) -1. Let me calculate that more precisely. 400 / 121.6 is 3.2907. So z is 2.2907. So approximately 2.3.

Looking at the options: option C is 2.4, which is near that. Option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29, so it would put the observed wavelength below 400 nm, which can't be detected. So the lower limit is a redshift of about 2.3, so option C is 2.4, which is just above that. So the lower limit is when z is just enough to bring lambda_obs to 400, so any z above that is detectable, but the lower limit is about 2.29.

Wait, but wait a second. Do we need to consider the exact optical range? Because sometimes the optical telescopes can't go much below about 350 nm or so. Hmm, if the optical range is shorter, like 350, then z would be (350 / 121.6) -1. Let's see: 350 / 121.6 is approximately 2.88. So z is 1.88. So then the lower limit would be higher redshift if the cutoff is lower. But I think the ground-based optical telescopes start at around 400 nm, so the cutoff is 400.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra as absorption lines in the UV. But if the quasar's emission is at a higher redshift, the Lyman-alpha absorption could be shifted into the optical.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the quasar itself emits light. If the quasar is at a high redshift, its emitted Lyman alpha (1216 Angstroms) is redshifted into the optical. But wait, the question is about the absorption by neutral hydrogen clouds in front of the quasar. So the quasar's light passes through these clouds, which imprint absorption lines at their own redshifts.

Wait, no. Let's clarify. The quasar emits light across the spectrum. The neutral hydrogen clouds in between the quasar and us absorb at their own rest frame Lyman alpha wavelength, which is 1216 Angstroms. So for us, the observed wavelength is λ = λ_emit * (1 + z_cloud), where z_cloud is the redshift of the cloud.

But to see that absorption in the optical range (so that ground-based telescopes can detect it), λ must be less than about 700 nm (red) but more than 400 nm (violet). So the redshifted wavelength must be in this range.

So if the cloud's redshift is such that 400 <= 1216 * (1 + z_cloud) <= 700?

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Because the cloud is at redshift z_cloud. So the wavelength we observe is λ = 1216 * (1 + z_cloud). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the cloud's Lyman alpha is at 1216 Angstroms in its rest frame. If the cloud is at redshift z, then the observed wavelength is λ = 1216 * (1 + z). So for the cloud to be observed in optical, this λ must be >= 400 nm (since 400 nm is the start of optical, and anything below is UV, which is absorbed by the atmosphere and not visible from the ground).

Wait, but 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So 1216*(1 + z) >= 4000 Angstroms.

So solving for z: 1 + z >= 4000/1216 ≈ 3.2907 → z >= 2.2907.

So the minimal redshift is about 2.29. So the lower limit is z=2.29. But looking at the options, option C is 2.4 and option D is 1.9.

Wait, but wait another thing. Another thought: sometimes, the quasar itself has a certain redshift, and the clouds in front of it have lower redshifts. Because the cloud is between us and the quasar. So the cloud's redshift is less than that of the quasar.

Wait, no. Wait, if the quasar is at redshift z_q, and the cloud is at redshift z_c, then z_c < z_q because the cloud is closer to us than the quasar. So the cloud's redshift is lower.

But in terms of the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption, is it 1216 * (1 + z_c), which must be in the optical range.

So the minimal redshift of the cloud is when 1216*(1 + z_c) = 4000 Angstroms? So z_c is about 2.29 as before.

Wait, but that can't be right because quasars are typically at higher redshifts, like z=2 or higher. So if the cloud is at z=2.29, the quasar must be at a higher redshift than that.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the object (the cloud), not the quasar. So the minimal z is when the cloud's Lyman-alpha is just at the limit of optical.

So the minimal z is about 2.29, which is around 2.3.

Looking at the options, the closest higher option is C) 2.4. So the lower limit would be just above 2.29, so the minimal redshift is 2.3, so the lower limit is approximately z=2.3.

So the answer would be option C) 2.4.

Wait, but wait another thing. Do we consider the exact definition of optical? If the optical range is lower, like starting at 350 nm, then the calculation would change.

So if optical starts at 350 nm, then 1216*(1+z) >= 3500 Angstroms (350 nm is 3500 Angstroms). So z >= (3500/1216) -1 ≈ (2.88) - 1 = 1.88.

So then the lower limit would be around 1.88, which is option D) 1.9.

Hmm, now I'm confused. Which is correct?

I think I need to clarify the optical range. What is the typical range observable by ground-based optical telescopes? I think it's roughly 400 nm to about 700 nm. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So the Lyman-alpha at 1216 Ang must be redshifted to 4000 Ang or longer to be in the optical.

So with that in mind, the calculation is z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29.

So the minimal z is approx 2.29. Therefore, the lower limit is z=2.3.

So the options are: C is 2.4, which is the next higher option. So the lower limit is about 2.3, so the minimal redshift is above that.

So the answer must be C) 2.4.

Wait, but another thing: sometimes, the definition of optical may vary. For example, some sources consider the optical range to start at 380 nm, which is near the UV. If that's the case, then the calculation would be (3800/1216) -1, which is approximately (3.123) -1 = 2.123.

So z = 2.123, so the minimal redshift would be about 2.12.

But none of the options is exactly 2.12. The options are 1.9, 2.4, etc. So perhaps option D) 1.9 is too low because 1.9 would give (1216*(1+1.9))=1216*2.9=3526.4 Angstroms, which is 352.6 nm, which is in the near-UV (since UV is below 400 nm). So ground-based telescopes can't see that, so the minimal z would be when λ_obs is 400 nm.

So going back, I think the correct lower limit is z≈2.29, so the closest option is C) 2.4.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman-alpha absorption (rest wavelength ~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we must ensure the redshifted wavelength falls within the optical range. Optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths from ~400 nm (violet) to ~700 nm (red). Since the atmosphere absorbs ultraviolet light, the Lyman-alpha wavelength must be redshifted to at least 400 nm for detection.

The redshift formula is:

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{emit}}} - 1
\]

Here, \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} = 121.6 \, \text{nm}\), and \(\lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 400 \, \text{nm}\) (the start of the optical range). Substituting these values:

\[
z \geq \frac{400}{121.6} - 1 \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \(z \approx 2.29\). Among the given options, the closest value is \(z = 2.4\) (option C). 

Option D (\(z = 1.9\)) corresponds to a redshifted wavelength of:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \times (1 + 1.9) = 1216 \times 2.9 = 3526.4 \, \text{Å} = 352.6 \, \text{nm},
\]

which is in the ultraviolet and not detectable by optical ground-based telescopes. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is \(z \approx 2.29\), and the correct answer is the closest option, \(z = 2.4\).

Answer: C
