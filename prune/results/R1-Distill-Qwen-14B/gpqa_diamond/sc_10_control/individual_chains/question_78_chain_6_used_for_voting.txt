Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields, and these can be described using scalar and vector potentials. Let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the question says there's a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is being observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated at an earlier time tr to the observation point r. The velocity of the charge at time tr is v. And I need to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, where t is later than tr.

Wait, so the setup is that the charge was at position s(tr) at time tr. The field at point r is due to the charge's position and motion at time tr, and since t > tr, the fields are retarded (meaning they travel at the speed of light). So the potentials should depend on the retarded time.

I recall that the scalar potential V is usually given by Coulomb's law divided by something. The standard expression for the scalar potential due to a charge is V = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge to the point of observation. But wait, when the charge is moving, since we're considering the retarded time, r' isn't just the current distance. Oh, but maybe for the scalar potential, it's still based on the charge's position, but considering the time delay.

Alternatively, I remember that in the static case, V is q/(4πε₀ r), but when the charge is moving, there might be some other terms. Wait, but maybe the scalar potential doesn't involve the velocity, only the charge's position. Hmm.

The vector potential A, on the other hand, is usually proportional to the velocity of the charge. Because the magnetic field comes from moving charges. The standard expression I remember is A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² r) for static cases, but again, considering the retarded time and the vector d, perhaps it's more involved.

Wait, but let's think about the retarded time. The vector d is from the charge's position at tr (the point where the field was generated) to the observation point r. So d = r - s(tr), right? Or is it s(tr) to r? Oh, the question says d is from the field generating point (s(tr)) to r, so d is the vector pointing from s(tr) to r. So d = r - s(tr). But since we're considering the potentials, maybe it's more about the distance along the direction of d.

Wait, but in the options, the denominators involve terms like d c minus the dot product of d and v. Hmm. Because when considering the motion, there's a term that comes from the velocity. Oh right, because the retarded time calculation involves the time it takes for the fields to propagate from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So the charge's position at tr is s(tr), and the time taken for the field to reach r is the distance between s(tr) and r divided by c. So tr' = tr + (d · r̂)/c, or something like that.

But for the potentials, I think the expressions involve a term like 1/(d c - v·d), but wait, wait. Let me think again. The standard expressions for the potentials when the charge is moving are given by J.D. Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics, I believe.

The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [ (1/(d c - v·d)) ]? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think about the Liénard potentials. The scalar potential is given by V(r,t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(r - (v t)/c²)) ), but considering the retarded time.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall the general form. The scalar potential from a moving charge is similar to the static case but with a term involving the velocity. Alternatively, perhaps it's V = (q/(4πε₀)) / (d - (v t_r)/c²), where t_r is the retarded time.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to write down the expressions.

The scalar potential from a moving charge is given by:

V(r, t) = [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ 1 / (r' - (v t_r)/c²) ) ]

Wait, no, I think it's more accurate to say that the scalar potential is given by integrating the charge's contribution over its worldline, but perhaps that's more advanced than needed here.

Alternatively, for a charge moving with velocity v, the potentials are:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ (1) / ( |d| - v·(d̂) * t_r / c ) ]

Wait, maybe not. Let me think in terms of the options given.

Looking at the options, option C and D have denominators involving (d c - d · v) or (d c + d · v). So the denominator is (d c ± v·d). Let me see, the denominator in V is (d c - v·d) for option C and (d c + v·d) in D.

Wait, but let's think about how the velocity term would appear. When you're considering the potentials due to a moving charge, the denominator often has a term that accounts for the relativistic contraction or the motion's effect on the distance. So perhaps the denominator is (d c - v · d), where d is the vector from the charge's position at time tr to r.

Wait, more accurately, the denominator might come from the expression (r - s(tr)) c - (v × (r - s(tr)) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's (r - s(tr)) · (c - v) ?

Wait, another approach: the Lorentz gauge condition is used often, where the potentials satisfy ∇·A + (1/c²) ∂V/∂t = 0. But I'm not sure if that's needed here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the expressions for V and A in terms of the charge's position and velocity. The scalar potential V is Coulomb's law modified for the motion, and the vector potential A is proportional to v × something.

Wait, let me think about the general form of the potentials. The scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1 / (r' - (v t_r)) ]

Wait, no, that's not correct. I think the correct expression for V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r' - (v t))], but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator involves (r - s(tr)) and some terms involving velocity and the time.

Wait, another approach: the scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(r - (s(tr) + v (t - tr)) )) ), but this might not be exact. Alternatively, because the field propagates at speed c, the time delay is involved.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option.

Option A: V is the static Coulomb potential, and A is v squared times V. That seems unlikely because the vector potential usually depends linearly on velocity, not velocity squared.

Option B: V is the Coulomb potential, A is v times V divided by c squared. Hmm, that's dimensionally possible. Because A should have units of (velocity × V), but I'm not sure.

Option C: V has a denominator of (d c - d · v), and A is proportional to v times V. The denominator is (d c - v · d). So if d is the vector from the charge's position to r, then d · v is the component of velocity along d. So the denominator becomes c times the distance (d) minus the component of velocity along d times something.

Wait, but the denominator would have units of length. Since d is a vector with units of length, so c (m/s) multiplied by d (m) gives m²/s. And v·d is (m/s) * m = m²/s. So the denominator (d c - v·d) would have units of m²/s, which doesn't match. So that can't be correct. Wait, wait, unless the denominator is (d c - (v · d)/c) or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me compute the dimensions of the denominator in option C: d has units of meters, v has units of m/s. So d c is (m)*(m/s) = m²/s. And v · d is (m/s)*m = m²/s. So the denominator is (m²/s - m²/s), so the entire denominator is in m²/s. Then, (d c - v · d) would be m²/s. So, the denominator is m²/s. So the unit of V would be [ q ] / [ ε₀ ] [ (m²/s) ].

Wait, the unit of charge q is Coulombs (C). ε₀ has units of C²/(N·m²). So let's see: V has units (C) / [ (C²/(N·m²)) * (m²/s) ) ].

Wait, let me compute that:

V's unit is C / ( [C²/(N·m²)] * [m²/s] )

= C * [ N·m²/(C²) ) ] * [ s/m² ]

= (C * N m² s )/( C² m² )

Simplify:

N is kg·m/s².

So:

C * (kg·m/s²) * m² * s ) / ( C² m² )

= ( kg·m³ s ) / ( C m² )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the units. Maybe this isn't the best way. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator in option C is incorrect in terms of units, but maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator should be in terms of (d c - (v · d)/c), which would have units of meters. Because d c is (m)(m/s) = m²/s. (v·d) is (m/s)(m) = m²/s. So (v·d)/c is (m²/s) / (m/s) ) = m. So (d c) is m²/s, and (v·d)/c is m. So this wouldn't match either, unless perhaps the denominator is (d c - (v · d)).

Wait, but that would give units of m²/s - m²/s, which is 0, so that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating the units.

Let me think about the correct expressions for V and A when a charge is moving. The scalar potential V is usually similar to Coulomb's potential but adjusted for the charge's motion. The vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² r) multiplied by some function involving the direction and relative velocity.

Wait, I think the correct expressions are:

V(r, t) = ( q / (4πε₀) ) * [ 1 / (r - (v t_r) ) ]

But perhaps more accurately, considering the retarded time t_r, which is t - |r - s(tr)| / c.

Alternatively, the potentials are given by:

V(r,t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |d| - (v t_r) ) ]

Wait, but that doesn't seem quite right. Another approach: the scalar potential from a moving charge is given by

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/(d - (v t_r)) ]

But perhaps I'm mixing up terms here.

Wait, let's think about the retarded time. The retarded time t_r is the time when the charge was at position s(tr), and the field from that position and time propagates to r at time t. So, the distance between s(tr) and r is |d|. The time it takes for the field to reach r from s(tr) is |d|/c. So, t_r = t - |d|/c.

Wait, but I'm trying to express the potentials in terms of d, the vector from s(tr) to r. So, perhaps the potentials are functions of d and v.

In the options, option C has V as (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)). Let me see the units of this expression.

Denominator: d c has units (m)(m/s) = m²/s. v·d is (m/s)(m) = m²/s. So denominator is m²/s - m²/s, which is zero. Hmm, that can't be right. So maybe the denominator is something else, perhaps (d c - (v · d)/c ), which would have units of m (since (v·d)/c is (m²/s)/(m/s) )= m). So (d c) would be m²/s, and (v·d)/c is m. So that's mixing different units, which doesn't work.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again. Another approach: the denominator in the potentials for a moving charge is (r - (s(tr) + v (t - tr)) ), but considering the time it takes for the field to reach r.

Wait, the correct expression for the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/( (r - s(tr)) - v (t - tr) ) ]

But because the field takes time (t - tr) to reach r, the effective position is s(tr) + v (t - tr) - (r - s(tr)) / c (t - tr) ) ?

Wait, no, that seems complicated. Maybe I should refer to the standard expressions.

In J.D. Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics, the scalar potential due to a charge q moving with velocity v is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/( (r - s(tr)) - (v (t - tr) ) ) ]

But this isn't correct because the term (r - s(tr)) is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point, and (v (t - tr)) is the displacement of the charge during that time. So the denominator is (r - s(tr)) - v (t - tr), but that's a vector. The denominator should be a scalar, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, the correct expression is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/( (r - s(tr)) - (v t_r) ) ]

where t_r is the retarded time, which is the time when the field was emitted, t_r = t - |r - s(tr)| / c.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: V = (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d))

Wait, the denominator is d c - v·d. Let me compute the units:

d has units m, c is m/s, v is m/s.

d c: m * m/s = m²/s

v·d: (m/s) * m = m²/s

So denominator is (m²/s) - (m²/s) = 0. That can't be right, so perhaps this option is incorrect.

Option D: denominator is (d c + v·d) → same issue as C, units-wise.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/c somewhere. For example, if the denominator is (d c - v · d / c ), then:

d c → m * (m/s) = m²/s

v·d / c → (m²/s) / (m/s) )= m

So denominator would have m²/s and m, which are different units and can't be added. So that doesn't work either.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the vector potential. The vector potential A is given by (μ₀/(4π)) (q v)/( (r - s(tr)) - v t_r ) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, in SI units, the vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π)) (q v)/( (r - s(tr)) - v t_r ), but I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, the vector potential can be written as (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * [ 1/(d c - v·d) ] * something.

Wait, looking at option C: A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d)).

So the units for A would be (H/m) * (C) * (m/s) ) / (something with units m²/s).

H is Ω·m = (V·s)/(A·m). Wait, getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the correct form. The vector potential is proportional to velocity and the charge, and inversely proportional to the distance, but adjusted for motion.

Wait, I think I remember that the vector potential A is (μ₀ q v )/(4π c² r) * something. Maybe in the case of a moving charge, the vector potential is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² r) multiplied by 1/( 1 - (v·r̂)/c ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the denominator in the potentials should account for the motion of the charge. So for scalar potential V, it's 1/(d c - v·d), and for vector potential A, it's the same denominator. Let's see.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)), A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d)).

So V and A have the same denominator. Let's see if that makes sense in terms of units.

V has units: [ q ] [ c ] / ( [d c ] - [ v·d ] )

Wait, but in terms of units, it's [C] [m/s] / ( [m * m/s] - [m²/s] )

Wait, m * m/s is m²/s, and m²/s minus m²/s is zero. So that's a problem again.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should be (d c - (v · d)/c ), because that would have units of m: since (v·d) has units m²/s, divided by c (m/s) gives m.

So denominator would be m²/s - m → which doesn't make sense either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the potentials in terms of the Liénard potentials.

The Liénard potentials for a charge q moving with velocity v are given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/(r - (v t_r) ) ]

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) * [ v/(r - (v t_r) ) ]

But t_r is the retarded time, t_r = t - |r - s(tr)| / c.

But perhaps in terms of the vectors, r - s(tr) is the vector from the charge's position to r, which is d. So r - s(tr) = d. So,

V = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/(d - v t_r ) ]

But t_r is (t - |d|/c ).

Wait, but substituting that in:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/(d - v (t - |d|/c )) ]

= (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/( d - v t + (v · d)/c ) ]

Because v (t - |d|/c ) = v t - (v · d)/c, assuming v is parallel to d. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, if d is the vector from s(tr) to r, then v is the velocity at tr. So the term v |d|/c is the component of v in the direction of d multiplied by |d|/c.

But perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Let me look at the options again.

Option C: V = qc/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d) )

So denominator is (d c - v·d). Let me compute the term d c - v·d.

Wait, if d is a vector, then d c is the vector multiplied by c. But option C's denominator seems to treat it as a scalar, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's d · (c) – no, that can't be.

Wait, no. Wait, the denominator in option C is written as (d c - vec{d} · vec{v}), which makes me think it's a scalar. Because d is a vector, and c is a scalar, so d c is a vector multiplied by a scalar. Similarly, vec{d} · vec{v} is a scalar.

So the denominator would be a vector (d c) minus a scalar (vec{d}·vec{v}), which doesn't make sense because you can't subtract a scalar from a vector. So that's a problem. Oh, but perhaps the denominator is (d c - (vec{d} · vec{v}) ), where all terms are treated as scalars. But that doesn't make sense either, because d is a vector's magnitude.

Ah! Wait, perhaps in the denominator, 'd' is the magnitude of vector d, and 'v' is the magnitude of vector v. So, for example, option C would have:

denominator = (d * c) - (d · v), where d is |d| and v is |v| multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them. So effectively, (d c - v d cosθ).

But that would make the denominator a scalar.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the denominator would be |d| c - |d| |v| cosθ = |d| (c - |v| cosθ). So the denominator is |d| times (c - (v·d̂)), where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d.

Hmm, that makes the denominator a scalar, which would make sense. So the scalar potential V would be:

V = (q c) / [4πε₀ |d| (c - (v·d̂)) ]

But wait, in that case, the denominator is |d| (c - (v·d̂)), so the whole expression would be:

(q c) / [4πε₀ |d| (c - (v·d̂)) ].

But in option C, it's written as (d c - vec{d} · vec{v}) in the denominator, which if they're treating d as |d| and v as |v|, then it's the same as |d| c - |d| |v| cosθ = |d| (c - |v| cosθ). But in reality, the denominator should be |d| (c - (v·d̂)).

So, if I'm correct, then the denominator in option C is |d| (c - (v·d̂)), which would be |d| (c - (v cosθ)).

So for the scalar potential V, option C would be:

V = (q c) / [4πε₀ |d| (c - (v cosθ)) ].

Wait, but comparing to the standard expression for V, which is similar to Coulomb's law but with a factor involving velocity. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expressions are those in option C, assuming that the denominator is |d| c - (v·d). Because that's the only option where the denominator includes a term involving the velocity of the charge.

Now, looking at the vector potential in option C: A = (μ₀ q c v ) / [4π (d c - v·d) ].

Hmm, the numerator has μ₀ q c v, and the denominator is the same as in V but without the ε₀.

Wait, the units for A should be H/m (henrys per meter), which is equivalent to (kg·m)/(s²·A²) or something like that. But I'm not going to get into unit analysis here.

But thinking about the structure, the vector potential A is usually proportional to the velocity of the charge, so option C's structure for A seems plausible.

So, putting it all together, the correct expressions are in option C: V is (q c )/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)) and A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - v·d)).

Wait, but earlier I thought that the denominator in the potentials should involve (c - (v/c)) or similar terms, but perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, another approach: the potentials for a moving charge involve terms that account for both the electric and magnetic fields. The scalar potential V is associated with the electric field, and A with the magnetic field.

The electric field due to a moving charge is E = (1/ε₀) ( q ( (v × B) ) + ... ), but perhaps that's not helpful here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the potentials in terms of the multipole expansion. But that's getting a bit too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, based on the structure of the denominator involving the velocity and the distance.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the situation where the charge moves with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the field-generating instant \( t_r \), and the observation point \( \vec{r} \) is separated from the charge's position at \( t_r \) by the vector \( \vec{d} \). The potentials must account for the motion of the charge and the retarded time effects.

### Key Observations:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential for a moving charge is influenced by the charge's position and velocity. The denominator must include a term that accounts for the motion of the charge, typically involving \( \vec{d} \) (the vector from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \)) and \( \vec{v} \) (the velocity of the charge at \( t_r \)).
   - Among the options, only **Option C** includes a denominator of the form \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( d = |\vec{d}| \). This structure aligns with the expected form of the scalar potential for a moving charge, where the denominator adjusts for the relativistic effects of the charge's motion.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and inversely proportional to the same denominator as \( V(\vec{r}, t) \). This ensures consistency with the physical interpretation of \( \vec{A} \) being related to the magnetic field generated by the moving charge.
   - Option C also provides the correct proportionality for \( \vec{A} \), with the numerator involving \( \mu_0 q c \vec{v} \) and the denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), matching the expected structure.

3. **Analysis of Other Options:**
   - **Option A:** The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}^2 \), which is inconsistent with the linear dependence on \( \vec{v} \) expected for the vector potential.
   - **Option B:** While the scalar potential \( V \) is correct, the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}/c^2 \), which does not match the expected form.
   - **Option D:** The denominator in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) is \( d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), which is inconsistent with the correct relativistic adjustment involving subtraction rather than addition.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the correct expressions for both \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \), as it appropriately accounts for the motion of the charge and the relativistic effects in the denominators.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields, and these can be described using scalar and vector potentials. Let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the question says there's a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is being observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated at an earlier time tr to the observation point r. The velocity of the charge at time tr is v. And I need to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, where t is later than tr.

Wait, so the setup is that the charge was at position s(tr) at time tr. The field at point r is due to the charge's position and motion at time tr, and since t > tr, the fields are retarded (meaning they travel at the speed of light). So the potentials should depend on the retarded time.

I recall that the scalar potential V is usually given by Coulomb's law divided by something. The standard expression for the scalar potential due to a charge is V = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge to the point of observation. But wait, when the charge is moving, since we're considering the retarded time, r' isn't just the current distance. Oh, but maybe for the scalar potential, it's still based on the charge's position, but considering the time delay.

Alternatively, I remember that in the static case, V is q/(4πε₀ r), but when the charge is moving, there might be some other terms. Wait, but maybe the scalar potential doesn't involve the velocity, only the charge's position. Hmm.

The vector potential A, on the other hand, is usually proportional to the velocity of the charge. Because the magnetic field comes from moving charges. The standard expression I remember is A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² r) for static cases, but again, considering the retarded time and the vector d, perhaps it's more involved.

Wait, but let's think about the retarded time. The vector d is from the charge's position at tr (the point where the field was generated) to the observation point r. So d = r - s(tr), right? Or is it s(tr) to r? Oh, the question says d is from the field generating point (s(tr)) to r, so d is the vector pointing from s(tr) to r. So d = r - s(tr). But since we're considering the potentials, maybe it's more about the distance along the direction of d.

Wait, but in the options, the denominators involve terms like d c minus the dot product of d and v. Hmm. Because when considering the motion, there's a term that comes from the velocity. Oh right, because the retarded time calculation involves the time it takes for the fields to propagate from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So the charge's position at tr is s(tr), and the time taken for the field to reach r is the distance between s(tr) and r divided by c. So tr' = tr + (d · r̂)/c, or something like that.

But for the potentials, I think the expressions involve a term like 1/(d c - v·d), but wait, wait. Let me think again. The standard expressions for the potentials when the charge is moving are given by J.D. Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics, I believe.

The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [ (1/(d c - v·d)) ]? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think about the Liénard potentials. The scalar potential is given by V(r,t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(r - (v t)/c²)) ), but considering the retarded time.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall the general form. The scalar potential from a moving charge is similar to the static case but with a term involving the velocity. Alternatively, perhaps it's V = (q/(4πε₀)) / (d - (v t_r)/c²), where t_r is the retarded time.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to write down the expressions.

The scalar potential from a moving charge is given by:

V(r, t) = [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ 1 / (r' - (v t_r)/c²) ) ]

Wait, no, I think it's more accurate to say that the scalar potential is given by integrating the charge's contribution over its worldline, but perhaps that's more advanced than needed here.

Alternatively, for a charge moving with velocity v, the potentials are:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ (1) / ( |d| - v·(d̂) * t_r / c ) ]

Wait, maybe not. Let me think in terms of the options given.

Looking at the options, option C and D have denominators involving (d c - d · v) or (d c + d · v). So the denominator is (d c ± v·d). Let me see, the denominator in V is (d c - v·d) for option C and (d c + v·d) in D.

Wait, but let's think about how the velocity term would appear. When you're considering the potentials due to a moving charge, the denominator often has a term that accounts for the relativistic contraction or the motion's effect on the distance. So perhaps the denominator is (d c - v · d), where d is the vector from the charge's position at time tr to r.

Wait, more accurately, the denominator might come from the expression (r - s(tr)) c - (v × (r - s(tr)) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's (r - s(tr)) · (c - v) ?

Wait, another approach: the Lorentz gauge condition is used often, where the potentials satisfy ∇·A + (1/c²) ∂V/∂t = 0. But I'm not sure if that's needed here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the expressions for V and A in terms of the charge's position and velocity. The scalar potential V is Coulomb's law modified for the motion, and the vector potential A is proportional to v × something.

Wait, let me think about the general form of the potentials. The scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1 / (r' - (v t_r)) ]

Wait, no, that's not correct. I think the correct expression for V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r' - (v t))], but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator involves (r - s(tr)) and some terms involving velocity and the time.

Wait, another approach: the scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(r - (s(tr) + v (t - tr)) )) ), but this might not be exact. Alternatively, because the field propagates at speed c, the time delay is involved.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option.

Option A: V is the static Coulomb potential, and A is v squared times V. That seems unlikely because the vector potential usually depends linearly on velocity, not velocity squared.

Option B: V is the Coulomb potential, A is v times V divided by c squared. Hmm, that's dimensionally possible. Because A should have units of (velocity × V), but I'm not sure.

Option C: V has a denominator of (d c - d · v), and A is proportional to v times V. The denominator is (d c - v · d). So if d is the vector from the charge's position to r, then d · v is the component of velocity along d. So the denominator becomes c times the distance (d) minus the component of velocity along d times something.

Wait, but the denominator would have units of length. Since d is a vector with units of length, so c (m/s) multiplied by d (m) gives m²/s. And v·d is (m/s) * m = m²/s. So the denominator (d c - v·d) would have units of m²/s, which doesn't match. So that can't be correct. Wait, wait, unless the denominator is (d c - (v · d)/c) or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me compute the dimensions of the denominator in option C: d has units of meters, v has units of m/s. So d c is (m)*(m/s) = m²/s. And v · d is (m/s)*m = m²/s. So the denominator is (m²/s - m²/s), so the entire denominator is in m²/s. Then, (d c - v · d) would be m²/s. So, the denominator is m²/s. So the unit of V would be [ q ] / [ ε₀ ] [ (m²/s) ].

Wait, the unit of charge q is Coulombs (C). ε₀ has units of C²/(N·m²). So let's see: V has units (C) / [ (C²/(N·m²)) * (m²/s) ) ].

Wait, let me compute that:

V's unit is C / ( [C²/(N·m²)] * [m²/s] )

= C * [ N·m²/(C²) ) ] * [ s/m² ]

= (C * N m² s )/( C² m² )

Simplify:

N is kg·m/s².

So:

C * (kg·m/s²) * m² * s ) / ( C² m² )

= ( kg·m³ s ) / ( C m² )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the units. Maybe this isn't the best way. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator in option C is incorrect in terms of units, but maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator should be in terms of (d c - (v · d)/c), which would have units of meters. Because d c is (m)(m/s) = m²/s. (v·d) is (m/s)(m) = m²/s. So (v·d)/c is (m²/s) / (m/s) ) = m. So (d c) is m²/s, and (v·d)/c is m. So this wouldn't match either, unless perhaps the denominator is (d c - (v · d)).

Wait, but that would give units of m²/s - m²/s, which is 0, so that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating the units.

Let me think about the correct expressions for V and A when a charge is moving. The scalar potential V is usually similar to Coulomb's potential but adjusted for the charge's motion. The vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² r) multiplied by some function involving the direction and relative velocity.

Wait, I think the correct expressions are:

V(r, t) = ( q / (4πε₀) ) * [ 1 / (r - (v t_r) ) ]

But perhaps more accurately, considering the retarded time t_r, which is t - |r - s(tr)| / c.

Alternatively, the potentials are given by:

V(r,t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |d| - (v t_r) ) ]

Wait, but that doesn't seem quite right. Another approach: the scalar potential from a moving charge is given by

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/(d - (v t_r)) ]

But perhaps I'm mixing up terms here.

Wait, let's think about the retarded time. The retarded time t_r is the time when the charge was at position s(tr), and the field from that position and time propagates to r at time t. So, the distance between s(tr) and r is |d|. The time it takes for the field to reach r from s(tr) is |d|/c. So, t_r = t - |d|/c.

Wait, but I'm trying to express the potentials in terms of d, the vector from s(tr) to r. So, perhaps the potentials are functions of d and v.

In the options, option C has V as (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)). Let me see the units of this expression.

Denominator: d c has units (m)(m/s) = m²/s. v·d is (m/s)(m) = m²/s. So denominator is m²/s - m²/s, which is zero. Hmm, that can't be right. So maybe the denominator is something else, perhaps (d c - (v · d)/c ), which would have units of m (since (v·d)/c is (m²/s)/(m/s) )= m). So (d c) would be m²/s, and (v·d)/c is m. So that's mixing different units, which doesn't work.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again. Another approach: the denominator in the potentials for a moving charge is (r - (s(tr) + v (t - tr)) ), but considering the time it takes for the field to reach r.

Wait, the correct expression for the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/( (r - s(tr)) - v (t - tr) ) ]

But because the field takes time (t - tr) to reach r, the effective position is s(tr) + v (t - tr) - (r - s(tr)) / c (t - tr) ) ?

Wait, no, that seems complicated. Maybe I should refer to the standard expressions.

In J.D. Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics, the scalar potential due to a charge q moving with velocity v is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/( (r - s(tr)) - (v (t - tr) ) ) ]

But this isn't correct because the term (r - s(tr)) is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point, and (v (t - tr)) is the displacement of the charge during that time. So the denominator is (r - s(tr)) - v (t - tr), but that's a vector. The denominator should be a scalar, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, the correct expression is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/( (r - s(tr)) - (v t_r) ) ]

where t_r is the retarded time, which is the time when the field was emitted, t_r = t - |r - s(tr)| / c.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: V = (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d))

Wait, the denominator is d c - v·d. Let me compute the units:

d has units m, c is m/s, v is m/s.

d c: m * m/s = m²/s

v·d: (m/s) * m = m²/s

So denominator is (m²/s) - (m²/s) = 0. That can't be right, so perhaps this option is incorrect.

Option D: denominator is (d c + v·d) → same issue as C, units-wise.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/c somewhere. For example, if the denominator is (d c - v · d / c ), then:

d c → m * (m/s) = m²/s

v·d / c → (m²/s) / (m/s) )= m

So denominator would have m²/s and m, which are different units and can't be added. So that doesn't work either.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the vector potential. The vector potential A is given by (μ₀/(4π)) (q v)/( (r - s(tr)) - v t_r ) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, in SI units, the vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π)) (q v)/( (r - s(tr)) - v t_r ), but I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, the vector potential can be written as (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * [ 1/(d c - v·d) ] * something.

Wait, looking at option C: A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d)).

So the units for A would be (H/m) * (C) * (m/s) ) / (something with units m²/s).

H is Ω·m = (V·s)/(A·m). Wait, getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the correct form. The vector potential is proportional to velocity and the charge, and inversely proportional to the distance, but adjusted for motion.

Wait, I think I remember that the vector potential A is (μ₀ q v )/(4π c² r) * something. Maybe in the case of a moving charge, the vector potential is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² r) multiplied by 1/( 1 - (v·r̂)/c ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the denominator in the potentials should account for the motion of the charge. So for scalar potential V, it's 1/(d c - v·d), and for vector potential A, it's the same denominator. Let's see.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)), A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d)).

So V and A have the same denominator. Let's see if that makes sense in terms of units.

V has units: [ q ] [ c ] / ( [d c ] - [ v·d ] )

Wait, but in terms of units, it's [C] [m/s] / ( [m * m/s] - [m²/s] )

Wait, m * m/s is m²/s, and m²/s minus m²/s is zero. So that's a problem again.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should be (d c - (v · d)/c ), because that would have units of m: since (v·d) has units m²/s, divided by c (m/s) gives m.

So denominator would be m²/s - m → which doesn't make sense either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the potentials in terms of the Liénard potentials.

The Liénard potentials for a charge q moving with velocity v are given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/(r - (v t_r) ) ]

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) * [ v/(r - (v t_r) ) ]

But t_r is the retarded time, t_r = t - |r - s(tr)| / c.

But perhaps in terms of the vectors, r - s(tr) is the vector from the charge's position to r, which is d. So r - s(tr) = d. So,

V = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/(d - v t_r ) ]

But t_r is (t - |d|/c ).

Wait, but substituting that in:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/(d - v (t - |d|/c )) ]

= (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/( d - v t + (v · d)/c ) ]

Because v (t - |d|/c ) = v t - (v · d)/c, assuming v is parallel to d. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, if d is the vector from s(tr) to r, then v is the velocity at tr. So the term v |d|/c is the component of v in the direction of d multiplied by |d|/c.

But perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Let me look at the options again.

Option C: V = qc/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d) )

So denominator is (d c - v·d). Let me compute the term d c - v·d.

Wait, if d is a vector, then d c is the vector multiplied by c. But option C's denominator seems to treat it as a scalar, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's d · (c) – no, that can't be.

Wait, no. Wait, the denominator in option C is written as (d c - vec{d} · vec{v}), which makes me think it's a scalar. Because d is a vector, and c is a scalar, so d c is a vector multiplied by a scalar. Similarly, vec{d} · vec{v} is a scalar.

So the denominator would be a vector (d c) minus a scalar (vec{d}·vec{v}), which doesn't make sense because you can't subtract a scalar from a vector. So that's a problem. Oh, but perhaps the denominator is (d c - (vec{d} · vec{v}) ), where all terms are treated as scalars. But that doesn't make sense either, because d is a vector's magnitude.

Ah! Wait, perhaps in the denominator, 'd' is the magnitude of vector d, and 'v' is the magnitude of vector v. So, for example, option C would have:

denominator = (d * c) - (d · v), where d is |d| and v is |v| multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them. So effectively, (d c - v d cosθ).

But that would make the denominator a scalar.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the denominator would be |d| c - |d| |v| cosθ = |d| (c - |v| cosθ). So the denominator is |d| times (c - (v·d̂)), where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d.

Hmm, that makes the denominator a scalar, which would make sense. So the scalar potential V would be:

V = (q c) / [4πε₀ |d| (c - (v·d̂)) ]

But wait, in that case, the denominator is |d| (c - (v·d̂)), so the whole expression would be:

(q c) / [4πε₀ |d| (c - (v·d̂)) ].

But in option C, it's written as (d c - vec{d} · vec{v}) in the denominator, which if they're treating d as |d| and v as |v|, then it's the same as |d| c - |d| |v| cosθ = |d| (c - |v| cosθ). But in reality, the denominator should be |d| (c - (v·d̂)).

So, if I'm correct, then the denominator in option C is |d| (c - (v·d̂)), which would be |d| (c - (v cosθ)).

So for the scalar potential V, option C would be:

V = (q c) / [4πε₀ |d| (c - (v cosθ)) ].

Wait, but comparing to the standard expression for V, which is similar to Coulomb's law but with a factor involving velocity. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expressions are those in option C, assuming that the denominator is |d| c - (v·d). Because that's the only option where the denominator includes a term involving the velocity of the charge.

Now, looking at the vector potential in option C: A = (μ₀ q c v ) / [4π (d c - v·d) ].

Hmm, the numerator has μ₀ q c v, and the denominator is the same as in V but without the ε₀.

Wait, the units for A should be H/m (henrys per meter), which is equivalent to (kg·m)/(s²·A²) or something like that. But I'm not going to get into unit analysis here.

But thinking about the structure, the vector potential A is usually proportional to the velocity of the charge, so option C's structure for A seems plausible.

So, putting it all together, the correct expressions are in option C: V is (q c )/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)) and A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - v·d)).

Wait, but earlier I thought that the denominator in the potentials should involve (c - (v/c)) or similar terms, but perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, another approach: the potentials for a moving charge involve terms that account for both the electric and magnetic fields. The scalar potential V is associated with the electric field, and A with the magnetic field.

The electric field due to a moving charge is E = (1/ε₀) ( q ( (v × B) ) + ... ), but perhaps that's not helpful here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the potentials in terms of the multipole expansion. But that's getting a bit too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, based on the structure of the denominator involving the velocity and the distance.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the situation where the charge moves with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the field-generating instant \( t_r \), and the observation point \( \vec{r} \) is separated from the charge's position at \( t_r \) by the vector \( \vec{d} \). The potentials must account for the motion of the charge and the retarded time effects.

### Key Observations:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential for a moving charge is influenced by the charge's position and velocity. The denominator must include a term that accounts for the motion of the charge, typically involving \( \vec{d} \) (the vector from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \)) and \( \vec{v} \) (the velocity of the charge at \( t_r \)).
   - Among the options, only **Option C** includes a denominator of the form \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( d = |\vec{d}| \). This structure aligns with the expected form of the scalar potential for a moving charge, where the denominator adjusts for the relativistic effects of the charge's motion.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and inversely proportional to the same denominator as \( V(\vec{r}, t) \). This ensures consistency with the physical interpretation of \( \vec{A} \) being related to the magnetic field generated by the moving charge.
   - Option C also provides the correct proportionality for \( \vec{A} \), with the numerator involving \( \mu_0 q c \vec{v} \) and the denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), matching the expected structure.

3. **Analysis of Other Options:**
   - **Option A:** The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}^2 \), which is inconsistent with the linear dependence on \( \vec{v} \) expected for the vector potential.
   - **Option B:** While the scalar potential \( V \) is correct, the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}/c^2 \), which does not match the expected form.
   - **Option D:** The denominator in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) is \( d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), which is inconsistent with the correct relativistic adjustment involving subtraction rather than addition.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the correct expressions for both \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \), as it appropriately accounts for the motion of the charge and the relativistic effects in the denominators.
