Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length a. When a monochromatic light of wavelength λ falls on it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Hmm, okay.

Let me think. I've heard about diffraction patterns before. When light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern. For a single slit, the minima occur at certain angles. But this is a polygon with many sides. Wait, if N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle.

Wait, but the problem says the apothems are all the same length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular N-gon, the apothem is the same for all sides. So when N approaches infinity, it's a circle with radius 'a' because the apothem in a regular polygon is related to the radius (the distance from center to a vertex) by the formula a = R * cos(π/N), but for large N, cos(π/N) ≈ 1, so the apothem a is approximately equal to the radius R. So the circle's radius is a.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about the apothem when N is very large. For a regular polygon, the apothem a is equal to R * cos(π/N), but since N is large, π/N is small. So cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π²)/(2N²), but as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1. So a ≈ R, meaning R is approximately a. So the radius of the circular aperture is a.

Wait, but wait, for a circle, the apothem is the same as the radius. So if N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. So the problem reduces to the case of a circular aperture.

But wait, no. Wait, the standard single-slit diffraction formula I think applies to a rectangular slit of width 'a', but in this case, the shape is a polygon. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the aperture as a circular one, but with a specific radius.

Wait, but the problem states that the apothems are all same length a. So for a regular N-gon, each side is at a distance a from the center. So for a polygon, the width is determined by the apothem. But when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, so the radius would be a, because the apothem in a regular polygon is the same as the radius when it's a circle.

Wait, no. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which for a regular polygon with side length s and number of sides N, is a = (s)/(2 tan(π/N)). So as N approaches infinity, tan(π/N) ≈ π/N, so a ≈ (s) * N/(2 π). But s is the side length. If N approaches infinity, and a is fixed, then s approaches zero. Hmm, but perhaps that's getting too detailed.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a circular aperture because when N is very large, the polygon approximates a circle with radius a. So the problem is about a circular aperture of radius a.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the diffraction pattern when the light falls on the aperture. For a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern is the Airy disk, which has a central bright spot surrounded by concentric rings. The minima between these rings occur at angles determined by the zeros of the Bessel functions. But the first minima (the first dark ring) occurs at an angle θ given by a sinθ = λ, so θ = λ/(a), but wait, that's not exactly right because the first minimum in the Airy pattern is when the argument of the Bessel function J1 reaches its first zero. The first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the minima in the Airy disk occur where the Bessel function of the first kind of order m has zeros. For the circular case, the minima occur when J_{m}(u) = 0. The first minima (the outer edge of the central bright spot) is the first zero of J1(u), where u = (π a sinθ)/λ. The first zero of J1 is at u ≈ 3.8317. So the condition is (π a sinθ)/λ ≈ 3.8317. So sinθ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(π a).

Wait, but when we take the small angle approximation, sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ, so we can say θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(π a). But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, no, the first minimum is the first ring. Wait, but for a circular aperture, the single-slit diffraction minima for a circle are different. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the question is about a polygonal aperture. But when N is large, it's a circle. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different model, like considering the aperture as a collection of small slits arranged in a polygon.

Wait, perhaps another approach. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has minima at angles given by a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: for a circular aperture, the minima occur at angles where (a sinθ) is approximately (m * λ) / (π) multiplied by some factor. Wait, no, I think I should get back to the basics.

Wait, no. For a single slit of width 'a', the minima occur at a sinθ = m λ, where m is ±1, ±2, etc. So the angular separation between successive minima is the same, but in this case, the aperture is a polygon. But when N is very large, perhaps the effective width is similar to a slit of width 'a'. Alternatively, maybe the polygon's width is such that the effective slit width is 2a, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. When N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. So the effective aperture is a circle of radius a. The far-field diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is the Airy pattern, and the first minimum occurs at an angle θ where a sinθ = 1.22 λ. Because the first zero of J1 occurs at approximately 3.8317, so (π a sinθ)/λ = 3.8317 → sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(π a) ≈ 1.22 λ/(a). So the angle θ is approximately 1.22 λ/a.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. For a circular aperture, the central maximum is surrounded by rings. The first minimum is the beginning of the first dark ring. The minima are the points where the intensity drops to zero. So the angle of the first minimum (m=1) is given by a sinθ = 1.22 λ, so θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a. But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, but in the Airy pattern, I think there's only one minimum for each ring. Or perhaps in the 2D pattern, there are multiple minima around the central disk, but in one direction (like along the x-axis for a 1D slit), the minima are spaced at regular intervals.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up 1D and 2D diffraction. So in 1D (like a single slit), the diffraction pattern has minima at θ = m λ/a, where m is an integer, starting from 1. The angular separation between consecutive minima is λ/(a). So the first minimum is at θ1 = λ/(a), the second at θ2 = 2λ/(a), and so on. The angular distance between them is θ2 - θ1 = λ/(a). But that's for a single slit.

Wait, but the question is about a polygonal aperture with N sides, where N is very large, so it's a circle. So perhaps when considering the diffraction pattern, the minima are spaced by the same formula as the single slit. But wait, no, because a circular aperture's diffraction pattern is different. The minima occur at specific angles, but the angular spacing between them isn't uniform as in the single slit case.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the angular distance between the first two minima is to be found. So perhaps the approach is to model the polygon as a circular aperture, but then think about the angular spacing between the first and second minima in their diffraction pattern.

Wait, but for a circular aperture, the minima (like the first and second rings) are at different angles. The first minimum is at θ1 ≈ 1.22 λ / a, and the second at θ2 ≈ 2.41 λ / a. The angular separation would then be (2.41 - 1.22) λ/a ≈ 1.19 λ/a. But that's not one of the options. Looking at the options: option C is 1.22, which is the first minimum, but the question is about the distance between first and second minima. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering a circular aperture but treating the N-sided polygon as a linear slit of width 'a', but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to a single slit, where the width is determined by the polygon's properties.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to model the polygon as a single slit of width 'a', because when N is very large, the polygon approximates a slit of width 'a' (since all apothems are 'a'). So then the minima would occur at θ = m λ /a, where m is an integer. The first minimum (m=1) is at θ1 = λ/(a), the second at θ2 = 2λ/a. The angular separation between them is θ2 - θ1 = λ/a. But looking at the options, option B is 0.500λ/a, which is half that. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. For a single slit, the minima are at a sinθ = m λ, so θ ≈ m λ/(a) (using small angle approx). Thus, the first minimum is at θ1 = λ/(a), the second at θ2 = 2λ/(a). The angular separation is λ/a. But none of the options directly match that. The closest is option C: 1.22 λ/a, which is the first minimum for a circular aperture.

Wait, but the problem is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So perhaps the first minima are θ=0 and θ=λ/(a), but that doesn't make sense either.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Wait, in the single slit, the first minimum is at θ = λ/(a), the second at 2λ/(a), etc. So the separation between the first and second minima would be λ/(a). But that's not matching any options. Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is considered as a double slit, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the question again. The problem states that when N is infinitely large, the shape is a circle with apothem 'a'. So, the radius is 'a' because the apothem is the radius for a circle. So the circular aperture has radius 'a', and we're to find the angular separation between the first two minima in the far field.

In the Airy disk, the first minimum (the edge of the central bright spot) occurs at θ = 1.22 λ/(a). But then the next minima are at higher angles. Wait, but the minima are not equally spaced. The first minimum is at θ1=1.22 λ/a, the second at θ2=2.41 λ/a. So the separation is about (2.41 - 1.22) λ/a ≈ 1.19 λ/a, which is approximately 1.22 λ/a, but none of the options match this except option C, but option C is 1.22.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So perhaps the first two minima are the first and second dark rings, which are spaced by about 1.22 λ/a apart. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is not about the Airy pattern but about something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a circular aperture but using the formula for the single-slit. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the first minimum in a circular aperture, but the angular separation is the angle between two consecutive minima.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact formula for the zeros of the Bessel functions. For the m-th zero of J_m, it occurs at u = x_{m,n}, where x_{m,1} is the first zero of J_m. For the circular aperture, the minima occur when J_m(u) = 0, so u = (π a sinθ)/λ = x_{m,n}.

The first minima (the first dark ring) is when m=1, n=1, so x_{1,1} ≈ 3.8317. So (π a sinθ)/λ = 3.8317 → sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(π a) ≈ (1.22 λ)/(a), so θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a. That's the first minimum.

The next minimum would be the next zero of J_1, which is x_{1,2} ≈ 7.0156. So u=7.0156, so sinθ = (7.0156 λ)/(π a) ≈ (2.236 λ)/(a). So θ ≈ 2.236 λ/a.

So the angular separation between the first and second minima is 2.236 λ/a - 1.22 λ/a ≈ 1.016 λ/a. None of the options match that exactly, but looking at the options, option C is 1.22 λ/a, which is the first minimum. But the question asks for the distance between the first two minima, which would be approximately 1.016 λ/a. But that's not an option. The options are:

A) 0.610 λ /a

B) 0.500 λ /a

C) 1.220 λ /a 

D) 0.506 λ / a

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong in my approach. Maybe the problem isn't considering a circular aperture but a polygonal one and uses a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the polygon can be considered as a collection of multiple slits, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is modeled as a single slit with width 'a', but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the double-slit interference, but that doesn't seem related to diffraction minima.

Wait, another approach: For a polygon with N sides, each side can be considered as a small slit, and the overall diffraction pattern is the product of the diffraction from each slit. But when N is large, perhaps it's treated as a continuous distribution, leading to a circular aperture.

Wait, but perhaps I should model the problem as a single slit of width 'a', leading to minima at θ = m λ/a. So the first minimum is at θ = λ/a, the second at 2λ/a, so the separation is λ/a. But none of the options match that except... wait, option B is 0.500 λ/a, which is half of that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. The problem says 'the apothems are of the same length a.' For a polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So when the polygon is a regular N-gon, each side has length s = 2a tan(π/N). But when N is large, tan(π/N) ≈ π/N, so s ≈ 2a (π/N). So each side is very small.

But perhaps, the overall width of the polygon in a particular direction is determined by the number of sides and the apothem. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum dimension of the polygon is 2a, which would be the diameter of the circle it approximates. So the slit width 'a' in the single-slit formula would be the diameter, which is 2a_polygon. So if the diameter is 'd', then the single-slit formula uses d = 2a, so the minima are at θ = m λ/(d) = m λ/(2a). So the first minimum is at λ/(2a), the second at 2λ/(2a)=λ/a. The separation between the first and second minima would be λ/(2a). So the angular distance between the first two minima is λ/(2a). Looking at the options, option B is 0.500 λ/a, which is λ/(2a). So that would be the case if the width of the aperture is 2a, so the single-slit formula uses d=2a.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me think again. If the polygon is a regular N-gon with apothem 'a', then the radius is R = a / cos(π/N). Because apothem a = R cos(π/N). For large N, cos(π/N) ≈ 1, so R ≈ a. So the radius is a, so the diameter would be 2a. So if the polygon's width in a certain direction is 2a, then the single-slit formula would use d=2a. So the minima would be at θ = m λ/(2a). So the first minimum is at θ1=λ/(2a), the second at θ2=2λ/(2a)=λ/a. The angular separation is θ2 - θ1 = (λ/a - λ/(2a)) )= λ/(2a) = 0.5 λ/a. So the answer would be option B: 0.500 λ/a.

But wait, why would the polygon's width be 2a? Because for a regular N-gon, the maximum width (diameter) is 2R, where R is the distance from center to vertex. But for a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to R by a = R cos(π/N). So R = a / cos(π/N). For large N, R ≈ a (since cos(π/N) ≈ 1). So the diameter is approximately 2a. So the width of the aperture is 2a. So in the single-slit formula, d=2a. So the minima are at θ = m λ/(2a), so the separation between minima is 0.5 λ/a. So the angular distance between the first two minima would be 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought the problem was a circular aperture, but maybe it's considering the polygon's maximum width as 2a, so the single-slit formula applies. So the correct answer would be option B: 0.500 λ/a.

But wait, the options don't have that. Let me check the options again. Oh, option B is 0.500 λ/a, which matches the calculation. So the answer should be B.

The problem involves an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon, where all apothems are of length \(a\). When a monochromatic light of wavelength \(\lambda\) falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern in the far field. The task is to determine the angular distance between the first two minima when \(N\) is infinitely large, assuming small angles where \(\tan\theta \approx \theta\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Shape of the Aperture**:  
   When \(N\) is infinitely large, the regular N-sided polygon approximates a circle. For a regular polygon, the apothem \(a\) is related to the radius \(R\) by \(a = R \cos(\pi/N)\). For large \(N\), \(\cos(\pi/N) \approx 1\), so \(R \approx a\). Thus, the circular aperture has a radius \(a\).

2. **Diffraction Pattern**:  
   For a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern is characterized by the Airy disk. The minima in the Airy pattern occur where the Bessel function \(J_m(u)\) has zeros, with \(u = \frac{\pi a \sin\theta}{\lambda}\). The first minimum (edge of the central bright spot) occurs at the first zero of \(J_1(u)\), which is approximately \(u \approx 3.8317\). This gives the condition:
   \[
   \sin\theta \approx \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{\pi a} \approx 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
   \]
   Using the small-angle approximation \(\sin\theta \approx \theta\), the first minimum occurs at \(\theta_1 \approx 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{a}\).

3. **Angular Distance Between Minima**:  
   The second minimum corresponds to the second zero of \(J_1(u)\), which is approximately \(u \approx 7.0156\). This gives:
   \[
   \sin\theta \approx \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{\pi a} \approx 2.236 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
   \]
   Using the small-angle approximation, the second minimum occurs at \(\theta_2 \approx 2.236 \frac{\lambda}{a}\).

   The angular distance between the first and second minima is:
   \[
   \Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 \approx 2.236 \frac{\lambda}{a} - 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 1.016 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
   \]

4. **Revisiting the Polygon as a Slit**:  
   Alternatively, if the polygon is treated as a single slit of width \(a\), the minima occur at:
   \[
   a \sin\theta = m \lambda, \quad m = 1, 2, 3, \dots
   \]
   For small angles, \(\sin\theta \approx \theta\), so the minima are at:
   \[
   \theta_m = \frac{m \lambda}{a}.
   \]
   The first minimum is at \(\theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{a}\), and the second minimum is at \(\theta_2 = \frac{2\lambda}{a}\). The angular separation is:
   \[
   \Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{a}.
   \]

5. **Matching the Options**:  
   The problem specifies the angular distance between the first two minima. If the polygon is treated as a single slit, the angular separation is \(\frac{\lambda}{2a}\), corresponding to option **B**. This interpretation aligns with the idea that the polygon's width effectively behaves like a slit of width \(2a\) (diameter), leading to the angular separation \(\frac{\lambda}{2a}\).

### Conclusion:
The angular distance between the first two minima is best interpreted using the single-slit diffraction formula, yielding an angular separation of \(0.500 \frac{\lambda}{a}\), which corresponds to **option B**.

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length a. When a monochromatic light of wavelength λ falls on it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Hmm, okay.

Let me think. I've heard about diffraction patterns before. When light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern. For a single slit, the minima occur at certain angles. But this is a polygon with many sides. Wait, if N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle.

Wait, but the problem says the apothems are all the same length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular N-gon, the apothem is the same for all sides. So when N approaches infinity, it's a circle with radius 'a' because the apothem in a regular polygon is related to the radius (the distance from center to a vertex) by the formula a = R * cos(π/N), but for large N, cos(π/N) ≈ 1, so the apothem a is approximately equal to the radius R. So the circle's radius is a.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about the apothem when N is very large. For a regular polygon, the apothem a is equal to R * cos(π/N), but since N is large, π/N is small. So cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π²)/(2N²), but as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1. So a ≈ R, meaning R is approximately a. So the radius of the circular aperture is a.

Wait, but wait, for a circle, the apothem is the same as the radius. So if N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. So the problem reduces to the case of a circular aperture.

But wait, no. Wait, the standard single-slit diffraction formula I think applies to a rectangular slit of width 'a', but in this case, the shape is a polygon. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the aperture as a circular one, but with a specific radius.

Wait, but the problem states that the apothems are all same length a. So for a regular N-gon, each side is at a distance a from the center. So for a polygon, the width is determined by the apothem. But when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, so the radius would be a, because the apothem in a regular polygon is the same as the radius when it's a circle.

Wait, no. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which for a regular polygon with side length s and number of sides N, is a = (s)/(2 tan(π/N)). So as N approaches infinity, tan(π/N) ≈ π/N, so a ≈ (s) * N/(2 π). But s is the side length. If N approaches infinity, and a is fixed, then s approaches zero. Hmm, but perhaps that's getting too detailed.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a circular aperture because when N is very large, the polygon approximates a circle with radius a. So the problem is about a circular aperture of radius a.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the diffraction pattern when the light falls on the aperture. For a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern is the Airy disk, which has a central bright spot surrounded by concentric rings. The minima between these rings occur at angles determined by the zeros of the Bessel functions. But the first minima (the first dark ring) occurs at an angle θ given by a sinθ = λ, so θ = λ/(a), but wait, that's not exactly right because the first minimum in the Airy pattern is when the argument of the Bessel function J1 reaches its first zero. The first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the minima in the Airy disk occur where the Bessel function of the first kind of order m has zeros. For the circular case, the minima occur when J_{m}(u) = 0. The first minima (the outer edge of the central bright spot) is the first zero of J1(u), where u = (π a sinθ)/λ. The first zero of J1 is at u ≈ 3.8317. So the condition is (π a sinθ)/λ ≈ 3.8317. So sinθ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(π a).

Wait, but when we take the small angle approximation, sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ, so we can say θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(π a). But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, no, the first minimum is the first ring. Wait, but for a circular aperture, the single-slit diffraction minima for a circle are different. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the question is about a polygonal aperture. But when N is large, it's a circle. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different model, like considering the aperture as a collection of small slits arranged in a polygon.

Wait, perhaps another approach. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has minima at angles given by a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: for a circular aperture, the minima occur at angles where (a sinθ) is approximately (m * λ) / (π) multiplied by some factor. Wait, no, I think I should get back to the basics.

Wait, no. For a single slit of width 'a', the minima occur at a sinθ = m λ, where m is ±1, ±2, etc. So the angular separation between successive minima is the same, but in this case, the aperture is a polygon. But when N is very large, perhaps the effective width is similar to a slit of width 'a'. Alternatively, maybe the polygon's width is such that the effective slit width is 2a, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. When N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. So the effective aperture is a circle of radius a. The far-field diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is the Airy pattern, and the first minimum occurs at an angle θ where a sinθ = 1.22 λ. Because the first zero of J1 occurs at approximately 3.8317, so (π a sinθ)/λ = 3.8317 → sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(π a) ≈ 1.22 λ/(a). So the angle θ is approximately 1.22 λ/a.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. For a circular aperture, the central maximum is surrounded by rings. The first minimum is the beginning of the first dark ring. The minima are the points where the intensity drops to zero. So the angle of the first minimum (m=1) is given by a sinθ = 1.22 λ, so θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a. But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, but in the Airy pattern, I think there's only one minimum for each ring. Or perhaps in the 2D pattern, there are multiple minima around the central disk, but in one direction (like along the x-axis for a 1D slit), the minima are spaced at regular intervals.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up 1D and 2D diffraction. So in 1D (like a single slit), the diffraction pattern has minima at θ = m λ/a, where m is an integer, starting from 1. The angular separation between consecutive minima is λ/(a). So the first minimum is at θ1 = λ/(a), the second at θ2 = 2λ/(a), and so on. The angular distance between them is θ2 - θ1 = λ/(a). But that's for a single slit.

Wait, but the question is about a polygonal aperture with N sides, where N is very large, so it's a circle. So perhaps when considering the diffraction pattern, the minima are spaced by the same formula as the single slit. But wait, no, because a circular aperture's diffraction pattern is different. The minima occur at specific angles, but the angular spacing between them isn't uniform as in the single slit case.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the angular distance between the first two minima is to be found. So perhaps the approach is to model the polygon as a circular aperture, but then think about the angular spacing between the first and second minima in their diffraction pattern.

Wait, but for a circular aperture, the minima (like the first and second rings) are at different angles. The first minimum is at θ1 ≈ 1.22 λ / a, and the second at θ2 ≈ 2.41 λ / a. The angular separation would then be (2.41 - 1.22) λ/a ≈ 1.19 λ/a. But that's not one of the options. Looking at the options: option C is 1.22, which is the first minimum, but the question is about the distance between first and second minima. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering a circular aperture but treating the N-sided polygon as a linear slit of width 'a', but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to a single slit, where the width is determined by the polygon's properties.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to model the polygon as a single slit of width 'a', because when N is very large, the polygon approximates a slit of width 'a' (since all apothems are 'a'). So then the minima would occur at θ = m λ /a, where m is an integer. The first minimum (m=1) is at θ1 = λ/(a), the second at θ2 = 2λ/a. The angular separation between them is θ2 - θ1 = λ/a. But looking at the options, option B is 0.500λ/a, which is half that. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. For a single slit, the minima are at a sinθ = m λ, so θ ≈ m λ/(a) (using small angle approx). Thus, the first minimum is at θ1 = λ/(a), the second at θ2 = 2λ/(a). The angular separation is λ/a. But none of the options directly match that. The closest is option C: 1.22 λ/a, which is the first minimum for a circular aperture.

Wait, but the problem is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So perhaps the first minima are θ=0 and θ=λ/(a), but that doesn't make sense either.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Wait, in the single slit, the first minimum is at θ = λ/(a), the second at 2λ/(a), etc. So the separation between the first and second minima would be λ/(a). But that's not matching any options. Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is considered as a double slit, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the question again. The problem states that when N is infinitely large, the shape is a circle with apothem 'a'. So, the radius is 'a' because the apothem is the radius for a circle. So the circular aperture has radius 'a', and we're to find the angular separation between the first two minima in the far field.

In the Airy disk, the first minimum (the edge of the central bright spot) occurs at θ = 1.22 λ/(a). But then the next minima are at higher angles. Wait, but the minima are not equally spaced. The first minimum is at θ1=1.22 λ/a, the second at θ2=2.41 λ/a. So the separation is about (2.41 - 1.22) λ/a ≈ 1.19 λ/a, which is approximately 1.22 λ/a, but none of the options match this except option C, but option C is 1.22.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So perhaps the first two minima are the first and second dark rings, which are spaced by about 1.22 λ/a apart. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is not about the Airy pattern but about something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a circular aperture but using the formula for the single-slit. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the first minimum in a circular aperture, but the angular separation is the angle between two consecutive minima.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact formula for the zeros of the Bessel functions. For the m-th zero of J_m, it occurs at u = x_{m,n}, where x_{m,1} is the first zero of J_m. For the circular aperture, the minima occur when J_m(u) = 0, so u = (π a sinθ)/λ = x_{m,n}.

The first minima (the first dark ring) is when m=1, n=1, so x_{1,1} ≈ 3.8317. So (π a sinθ)/λ = 3.8317 → sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(π a) ≈ (1.22 λ)/(a), so θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a. That's the first minimum.

The next minimum would be the next zero of J_1, which is x_{1,2} ≈ 7.0156. So u=7.0156, so sinθ = (7.0156 λ)/(π a) ≈ (2.236 λ)/(a). So θ ≈ 2.236 λ/a.

So the angular separation between the first and second minima is 2.236 λ/a - 1.22 λ/a ≈ 1.016 λ/a. None of the options match that exactly, but looking at the options, option C is 1.22 λ/a, which is the first minimum. But the question asks for the distance between the first two minima, which would be approximately 1.016 λ/a. But that's not an option. The options are:

A) 0.610 λ /a

B) 0.500 λ /a

C) 1.220 λ /a 

D) 0.506 λ / a

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong in my approach. Maybe the problem isn't considering a circular aperture but a polygonal one and uses a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the polygon can be considered as a collection of multiple slits, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is modeled as a single slit with width 'a', but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the double-slit interference, but that doesn't seem related to diffraction minima.

Wait, another approach: For a polygon with N sides, each side can be considered as a small slit, and the overall diffraction pattern is the product of the diffraction from each slit. But when N is large, perhaps it's treated as a continuous distribution, leading to a circular aperture.

Wait, but perhaps I should model the problem as a single slit of width 'a', leading to minima at θ = m λ/a. So the first minimum is at θ = λ/a, the second at 2λ/a, so the separation is λ/a. But none of the options match that except... wait, option B is 0.500 λ/a, which is half of that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. The problem says 'the apothems are of the same length a.' For a polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So when the polygon is a regular N-gon, each side has length s = 2a tan(π/N). But when N is large, tan(π/N) ≈ π/N, so s ≈ 2a (π/N). So each side is very small.

But perhaps, the overall width of the polygon in a particular direction is determined by the number of sides and the apothem. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum dimension of the polygon is 2a, which would be the diameter of the circle it approximates. So the slit width 'a' in the single-slit formula would be the diameter, which is 2a_polygon. So if the diameter is 'd', then the single-slit formula uses d = 2a, so the minima are at θ = m λ/(d) = m λ/(2a). So the first minimum is at λ/(2a), the second at 2λ/(2a)=λ/a. The separation between the first and second minima would be λ/(2a). So the angular distance between the first two minima is λ/(2a). Looking at the options, option B is 0.500 λ/a, which is λ/(2a). So that would be the case if the width of the aperture is 2a, so the single-slit formula uses d=2a.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me think again. If the polygon is a regular N-gon with apothem 'a', then the radius is R = a / cos(π/N). Because apothem a = R cos(π/N). For large N, cos(π/N) ≈ 1, so R ≈ a. So the radius is a, so the diameter would be 2a. So if the polygon's width in a certain direction is 2a, then the single-slit formula would use d=2a. So the minima would be at θ = m λ/(2a). So the first minimum is at θ1=λ/(2a), the second at θ2=2λ/(2a)=λ/a. The angular separation is θ2 - θ1 = (λ/a - λ/(2a)) )= λ/(2a) = 0.5 λ/a. So the answer would be option B: 0.500 λ/a.

But wait, why would the polygon's width be 2a? Because for a regular N-gon, the maximum width (diameter) is 2R, where R is the distance from center to vertex. But for a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to R by a = R cos(π/N). So R = a / cos(π/N). For large N, R ≈ a (since cos(π/N) ≈ 1). So the diameter is approximately 2a. So the width of the aperture is 2a. So in the single-slit formula, d=2a. So the minima are at θ = m λ/(2a), so the separation between minima is 0.5 λ/a. So the angular distance between the first two minima would be 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought the problem was a circular aperture, but maybe it's considering the polygon's maximum width as 2a, so the single-slit formula applies. So the correct answer would be option B: 0.500 λ/a.

But wait, the options don't have that. Let me check the options again. Oh, option B is 0.500 λ/a, which matches the calculation. So the answer should be B.


The problem involves an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon, where all apothems are of length \(a\). When a monochromatic light of wavelength \(\lambda\) falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern in the far field. The task is to determine the angular distance between the first two minima when \(N\) is infinitely large, assuming small angles where \(\tan\theta \approx \theta\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Shape of the Aperture**:  
   When \(N\) is infinitely large, the regular N-sided polygon approximates a circle. For a regular polygon, the apothem \(a\) is related to the radius \(R\) by \(a = R \cos(\pi/N)\). For large \(N\), \(\cos(\pi/N) \approx 1\), so \(R \approx a\). Thus, the circular aperture has a radius \(a\).

2. **Diffraction Pattern**:  
   For a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern is characterized by the Airy disk. The minima in the Airy pattern occur where the Bessel function \(J_m(u)\) has zeros, with \(u = \frac{\pi a \sin\theta}{\lambda}\). The first minimum (edge of the central bright spot) occurs at the first zero of \(J_1(u)\), which is approximately \(u \approx 3.8317\). This gives the condition:
   \[
   \sin\theta \approx \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{\pi a} \approx 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
   \]
   Using the small-angle approximation \(\sin\theta \approx \theta\), the first minimum occurs at \(\theta_1 \approx 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{a}\).

3. **Angular Distance Between Minima**:  
   The second minimum corresponds to the second zero of \(J_1(u)\), which is approximately \(u \approx 7.0156\). This gives:
   \[
   \sin\theta \approx \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{\pi a} \approx 2.236 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
   \]
   Using the small-angle approximation, the second minimum occurs at \(\theta_2 \approx 2.236 \frac{\lambda}{a}\).

   The angular distance between the first and second minima is:
   \[
   \Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 \approx 2.236 \frac{\lambda}{a} - 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 1.016 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
   \]

4. **Revisiting the Polygon as a Slit**:  
   Alternatively, if the polygon is treated as a single slit of width \(a\), the minima occur at:
   \[
   a \sin\theta = m \lambda, \quad m = 1, 2, 3, \dots
   \]
   For small angles, \(\sin\theta \approx \theta\), so the minima are at:
   \[
   \theta_m = \frac{m \lambda}{a}.
   \]
   The first minimum is at \(\theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{a}\), and the second minimum is at \(\theta_2 = \frac{2\lambda}{a}\). The angular separation is:
   \[
   \Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{a}.
   \]

5. **Matching the Options**:  
   The problem specifies the angular distance between the first two minima. If the polygon is treated as a single slit, the angular separation is \(\frac{\lambda}{2a}\), corresponding to option **B**. This interpretation aligns with the idea that the polygon's width effectively behaves like a slit of width \(2a\) (diameter), leading to the angular separation \(\frac{\lambda}{2a}\).

### Conclusion:
The angular distance between the first two minima is best interpreted using the single-slit diffraction formula, yielding an angular separation of \(0.500 \frac{\lambda}{a}\), which corresponds to **option B**.

Answer: B
