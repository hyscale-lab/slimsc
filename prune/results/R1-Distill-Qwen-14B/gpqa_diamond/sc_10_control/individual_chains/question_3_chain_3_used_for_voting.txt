Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me think through it. The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator involving sigma_z and sigma_x for a spin-half particle. 

Alright, the particle is in a superposition state given by 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, but wait a second, I should check if this is a valid quantum state. Because the probabilities should add up to 1. Let me calculate the squared magnitudes. 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. Adding them together gives 1, so yes, it's a valid state. Good.

The operator given is 10σz +5σx. So I need to find the expectation value of this operator. Since expectation values are linear, I can break this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I'll calculate each expectation value separately and then sum them multiplied by their coefficients.

First, let me find ⟨σz⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. So, σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the probability of being in |↑⟩ minus the probability of being in |↓⟩.

Wait, the state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the probability of spin-up is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and spin-down is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = 3/4, which is 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, the tricky part is ⟨σx⟩. Because σx is the Pauli X matrix, and its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ or |↓⟩. Oh right, σx corresponds to spin in the x-direction, and its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

The matrix representation of σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to find ⟨σx⟩, I can compute ψ† σx ψ. Alternatively, since ψ is expressed in the σz basis, it's easier to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me write ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Let me compute ψ† σx ψ.

Wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is a row vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. Then, ψ† σx is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5], because when you multiply ψ† (which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] ) by σx, each element is ψ† times the corresponding column of σx.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute it step by step. Alternatively, I can compute the expectation value as the sum of amplitudes.

σx is (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|). So when I apply σx to ψ, I get |↑⟩ times ⟨↓|ψ⟩ + |↓⟩ times ⟨↑|ψ⟩.

So ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩.

So ⟨↓|ψ⟩ is √3/2, and ⟨↑|ψ⟩ is 0.5.

So σx |ψ⟩ = (0.5) |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Wait no, wait. Wait, σx |ψ⟩ = |↑⟩ ⟨↓|ψ⟩ + |↓⟩ ⟨↑|ψ⟩.

So ⟨↓|ψ⟩ is √3/2, so σx |ψ⟩ = (√3/2) |↑⟩ + (0.5) |↓⟩.

Now, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = the conjugate of ψ† times σx ψ. But since all the coefficients are real here, I can ignore the conjugation.

So ψ† is [0.5, √3/2]. σx ψ is [√3/2, 0.5], as we saw earlier. So the inner product is (0.5)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) = 0.5 *√3/2 *2, wait no, wait. Wait, no, it's 0.5 * (√3/2) + (√3/2) * (0.5). Because the first term is 0.5 multiplied by the first component of σx ψ, which is √3/2, and the second term is (√3/2) multiplied by the second component of σx ψ, which is 0.5.

So that's (√3/4) + (√3/4) = √3/2. So ⟨σx⟩ is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660...

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, because the expectation value of σx for a spin-1/2 particle in a state ψ is √3/2? Or did I make a mistake here.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx ψ = [0 *0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)] → [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. So when you take ψ† times σx ψ, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so:

0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * (0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

Oh wait, so that's correct. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So 5⟨σx⟩ is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 * 0.866 ≈4.33.

Now, adding the two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ is -5, and 5⟨σx⟩ is approximately 4.33. So total expectation is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it more accurately. Since sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So 5*0.866 is about 4.33.

So -5 +4.33 is about -0.67. Hmm. So the expectation value is approximately -0.67.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7, which is close. Let me see if I can calculate it more precisely.

Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.73205. So sqrt(3)/2 is 0.866025. So 5 * 0.866025 is 4.330125. So 10σz expectation is 10*(-0.5) =-5. So total is -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.

Rounded to one decimal place, that's approximately -0.7, so option C.

Wait, but let me think again. Are the coefficients correct? Let me recheck the state. The state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So when you apply σz, you get 0.5 *1 and sqrt(3)/2 * (-1), so the expectation is (0.5)^2 *1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1) → 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that part is correct.

And for σx, the calculation gave us sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.866. So that's correct as well.

So calculating 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 +5*(0.8660) = -5 +4.33= -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So the answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the superposition state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is linear, so we compute \( \langle 10\sigma_z \rangle \) and \( \langle 5\sigma_x \rangle \) separately and sum them.

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The state \( \psi \) has coefficients \( 0.5 \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The probabilities of measuring spin-up and spin-down are:
\[
P(|\uparrow\rangle) = |0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad P(|\downarrow\rangle) = \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75.
\]
The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = P(|\uparrow\rangle)(+1) + P(|\downarrow\rangle)(-1) = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]
Thus, \( \langle 10\sigma_z \rangle = 10 \times (-0.5) = -5 \).

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator is represented as:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state \( \psi \) can be written as a column vector:
\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
To compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \), we calculate \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_x \psi \). The conjugate transpose of \( \psi \) is:
\[
\psi^\dagger = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The product \( \sigma_x \psi \) is:
\[
\sigma_x \psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The inner product \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_x \psi \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \psi^\dagger (\sigma_x \psi) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Thus, \( \langle 5\sigma_x \rangle = 5 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 5 \times 0.866 = 4.33 \).

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = \langle 10\sigma_z \rangle + \langle 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounded to one decimal place, this is approximately \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is closest to **-0.7**, which corresponds to option **C**.

First, let me find ⟨σz⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. So, σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the probability of being in |↑⟩ minus the probability of being in |↓⟩.

Wait, the state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the probability of spin-up is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and spin-down is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = 3/4, which is 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, the tricky part is ⟨σx⟩. Because σx is the Pauli X matrix, and its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ or |↓⟩. Oh right, σx corresponds to spin in the x-direction, and its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

The matrix representation of σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to find ⟨σx⟩, I can compute ψ† σx ψ. Alternatively, since ψ is expressed in the σz basis, it's easier to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me write ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Let me compute ψ† σx ψ.

Wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is a row vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. Then, ψ† σx is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5], because when you multiply ψ† (which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] ) by σx, each element is ψ† times the corresponding column of σx.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute it step by step. Alternatively, I can compute the expectation value as the sum of amplitudes.

σx is (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|). So when I apply σx to ψ, I get |↑⟩ times ⟨↓|ψ⟩ + |↓⟩ times ⟨↑|ψ⟩.

So ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩.

So ⟨↓|ψ⟩ is √3/2, and ⟨↑|ψ⟩ is 0.5.

So σx |ψ⟩ = (0.5) |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Wait no, wait. Wait, σx |ψ⟩ = |↑⟩ ⟨↓|ψ⟩ + |↓⟩ ⟨↑|ψ⟩.

So ⟨↓|ψ⟩ is √3/2, so σx |ψ⟩ = (√3/2) |↑⟩ + (0.5) |↓⟩.

Now, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = the conjugate of ψ† times σx ψ. But since all the coefficients are real here, I can ignore the conjugation.

So ψ† is [0.5, √3/2]. σx ψ is [√3/2, 0.5], as we saw earlier. So the inner product is (0.5)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) = 0.5 *√3/2 *2, wait no, wait. Wait, no, it's 0.5 * (√3/2) + (√3/2) * (0.5). Because the first term is 0.5 multiplied by the first component of σx ψ, which is √3/2, and the second term is (√3/2) multiplied by the second component of σx ψ, which is 0.5.

So that's (√3/4) + (√3/4) = √3/2. So ⟨σx⟩ is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660...

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, because the expectation value of σx for a spin-1/2 particle in a state ψ is √3/2? Or did I make a mistake here.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx ψ = [0 *0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)] → [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. So when you take ψ† times σx ψ, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so:

0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * (0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

Oh wait, so that's correct. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So 5⟨σx⟩ is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 * 0.866 ≈4.33.

Now, adding the two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ is -5, and 5⟨σx⟩ is approximately 4.33. So total expectation is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it more accurately. Since sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So 5*0.866 is about 4.33.

So -5 +4.33 is about -0.67. Hmm. So the expectation value is approximately -0.67.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7, which is close. Let me see if I can calculate it more precisely.

Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.73205. So sqrt(3)/2 is 0.866025. So 5 * 0.866025 is 4.330125. So 10σz expectation is 10*(-0.5) =-5. So total is -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.

Rounded to one decimal place, that's approximately -0.7, so option C.

Wait, but let me think again. Are the coefficients correct? Let me recheck the state. The state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So when you apply σz, you get 0.5 *1 and sqrt(3)/2 * (-1), so the expectation is (0.5)^2 *1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1) → 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that part is correct.

And for σx, the calculation gave us sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.866. So that's correct as well.

So calculating 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 +5*(0.8660) = -5 +4.33= -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So the answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the superposition state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is linear, so we compute \( \langle 10\sigma_z \rangle \) and \( \langle 5\sigma_x \rangle \) separately and sum them.

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The state \( \psi \) has coefficients \( 0.5 \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The probabilities of measuring spin-up and spin-down are:
\[
P(|\uparrow\rangle) = |0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad P(|\downarrow\rangle) = \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75.
\]
The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = P(|\uparrow\rangle)(+1) + P(|\downarrow\rangle)(-1) = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]
Thus, \( \langle 10\sigma_z \rangle = 10 \times (-0.5) = -5 \).

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator is represented as:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state \( \psi \) can be written as a column vector:
\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
To compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \), we calculate \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_x \psi \). The conjugate transpose of \( \psi \) is:
\[
\psi^\dagger = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The product \( \sigma_x \psi \) is:
\[
\sigma_x \psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The inner product \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_x \psi \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \psi^\dagger (\sigma_x \psi) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Thus, \( \langle 5\sigma_x \rangle = 5 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 5 \times 0.866 = 4.33 \).

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = \langle 10\sigma_z \rangle + \langle 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounded to one decimal place, this is approximately \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is closest to **-0.7**, which corresponds to option **C**.

Answer: C
