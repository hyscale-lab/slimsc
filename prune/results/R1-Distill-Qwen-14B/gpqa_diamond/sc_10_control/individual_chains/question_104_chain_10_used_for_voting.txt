Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out.

Alright, the question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun each have a planet with masses similar to Neptune. The planets are both in circular orbits. They used the radial velocity (RV) method to detect them, and the shifts in their spectral lines are given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms respectively.

Wait, I remember that the RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity. The shift depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. Oh, but since both planets are detected, their orbits must be edge-on enough for us to see the shift.

The main point here is to find out how the orbital periods of the two planets compare. The question is asking how many times longer planet #2's period is compared to planet #1's.

I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the orbital period. The formula for K is something like K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3) ) ) ) ) / something... Wait, maybe it's better to think about the relationship between K and the orbital period.

Wait, another approach: Kepler's third law. But since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, which is the mass of the star, same as our Sun.

Kepler's third law says that (P^2) / (a^3) = 4π²/(G(M_*)), but I might be mixing units here. Alternatively, in astronomical units and years, it's P² = a³ / (M_*). Since both stars are solar mass, M_* is 1, so P² = a³.

Wait, but how does this relate to the RV measurements? The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star in the direction of the observer. The formula for K is:

K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so it simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p) ) / ( M_*^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

So rearranging for P:

P^(1/3) ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( K * M_*^(2/3) )

Wait, but maybe I should think about how K relates to P. Let's see: both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), so M_p is the same for both. The stars are same mass, so M_* is same. Therefore, the ratio of K1 to K2 depends on the inverse cube root of their orbital periods, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, wait, because K = (something) * (M_p) / ( M_*^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

So K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K2 is larger than K1. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), a larger K means a smaller P. So planet #2 would have a shorter orbital period than planet #1. Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1. That implies P2/P1.

But wait, wait, let me think again. Because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K2 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3) * K1.

Wait, maybe another approach: since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

We can solve for P2/P1.

Given K1 =5, K2=7.

So,

(5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1

Wait, that would mean P2 is smaller than P1. So P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but the question is: How many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? So P2 = 0.364 * P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So the period of P2 is 0.36 times P1, so it's about 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the formula. K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1 = (constant) / (P1)^(1/3), K2 = (constant) / (P2)^(1/3).

Therefore, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

(5)/(7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cubing both sides:

(125)/(343) = P2/P1

So P2 = (125/343) * P1 ≈ 0.364 * P1.

So P2 is ~0.36 times P1, so the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter. So the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? Which would be 0.36 times as long.

So the answer is A) ~0.36.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), i.e., 

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}.
\]

Given that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), we can write:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}.
\]

Calculating:

\[
\frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \approx 0.364 \, P_1 \), meaning the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's period is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's.

But since M_p << M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so it simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p) ) / ( M_*^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

So rearranging for P:

P^(1/3) ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( K * M_*^(2/3) )

Wait, but maybe I should think about how K relates to P. Let's see: both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), so M_p is the same for both. The stars are same mass, so M_* is same. Therefore, the ratio of K1 to K2 depends on the inverse cube root of their orbital periods, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, wait, because K = (something) * (M_p) / ( M_*^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

So K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K2 is larger than K1. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), a larger K means a smaller P. So planet #2 would have a shorter orbital period than planet #1. Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1. That implies P2/P1.

But wait, wait, let me think again. Because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K2 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3) * K1.

Wait, maybe another approach: since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

We can solve for P2/P1.

Given K1 =5, K2=7.

So,

(5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1

Wait, that would mean P2 is smaller than P1. So P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but the question is: How many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? So P2 = 0.364 * P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So the period of P2 is 0.36 times P1, so it's about 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the formula. K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1 = (constant) / (P1)^(1/3), K2 = (constant) / (P2)^(1/3).

Therefore, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

(5)/(7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cubing both sides:

(125)/(343) = P2/P1

So P2 = (125/343) * P1 ≈ 0.364 * P1.

So P2 is ~0.36 times P1, so the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter. So the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? Which would be 0.36 times as long.

So the answer is A) ~0.36.
