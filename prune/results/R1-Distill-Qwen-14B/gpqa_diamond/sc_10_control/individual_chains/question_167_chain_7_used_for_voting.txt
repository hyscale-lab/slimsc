Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Oh wait, I remember that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, right? Coherent states are Gaussian states, so the superposition of them would create a non-Gaussian state, which makes sense for a Schrödinger cat state—those are usually considered highly non-classical.

The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). Okay, so for given phi and alpha, I can compute N. The problem gives phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. Let me plug those numbers in.

First, compute sin(2*phi). Since phi is -pi/4, 2*phi is -pi/2. The sine of -pi/2 is -1. Then, exp(-2*alpha^2) with alpha=0.5: 2*(0.5)^2 is 0.5, so exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. Multiply those together: (-1) * 0.6065 ≈ -0.6065. Then, 1 + (-0.6065) is 0.3935. Take the square root: sqrt(0.3935) is about 0.6275. So N ≈ 0.6275.

Now, the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi). Let me compute those. phi is -pi/4. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So the state is (0.7071|0.5> - 0.7071| -0.5> ) / 0.6275.

The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the state's density matrix and tau is a Gaussian reference state. Wait, but relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is a measure of how non-Gaussian a state is. The idea is that if rho is Gaussian, del_b should be zero. But for non-Gaussian states, del_b is positive.

Wait, because relative entropy measures the difference between two states. So if rho is non-Gaussian and tau is the closest Gaussian state to it, then del_b would be the relative entropy between rho and tau. But in this question, they've phrased it as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Wait, isn't that the same as the relative entropy between rho and tau? Let me think.

The relative entropy between rho and tau is S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). Oh wait, but the question says del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. That's different. Because normally, relative entropy is rho ln rho - rho ln tau. But here, it's rho ln rho minus tau ln tau, which is the same as S(rho) - S(tau). Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the reference Gaussian state tau is the thermal state, or maybe the vacuum? Or maybe the Gaussian state that is the closest to rho. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the reference state is a Gaussian state that is the best approximation to rho. For Schrödinger cat states, the reference Gaussian state is often the Wigner-Weyl transformed state, or maybe the state that minimizes the relative entropy.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact calculation here. Maybe there's a simpler approach. Let's think about the specific case given.

The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. The density matrix rho would be |psi><psi|. For a superposition state like this, the Wigner function will have negative regions, making it non-Gaussian.

But how does that translate into the relative entropy measure? I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps this is a trick question. For certain parameters, the state might reduce to a Gaussian state, making the non-Gaussianity zero.

Wait, when does a superposition of coherent states become Gaussian? Well, Gaussian states are closed under linear operations, but a superposition of two coherent states isn't Gaussian unless perhaps the coefficients are zero in a certain way.

Wait, but let me think. For example, when phi is zero, the state becomes |alpha> / N, but N is sqrt(1 + 0) = 1, so it's just |alpha>, a coherent state, which is Gaussian. Similarly, if phi is pi/2, the state becomes sin(pi/2)|-alpha> = |-alpha>, another coherent state. So in those cases, the state is Gaussian, and del_b would be zero.

But in this case, phi is -pi/4 and alpha=0.5. So it's a superposition of two different coherent states. Therefore, it's non-Gaussian, and del_b should be positive.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is zero. So why would that be? Could the state become Gaussian under these parameters?

Wait, maybe when the relative entropy between rho and the reference Gaussian state is zero. That would happen if rho itself is Gaussian. So for phi = -pi/4, is the state still Gaussian?

No, because a superposition of two different coherent states can't be Gaussian. Because the Wigner function of a Gaussian state must be Gaussian in phase space, and a superposition would create interference terms, leading to non-Gaussian features.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: Maybe the state is a squeezed state. No, squeezed states are Gaussian as well. Unless the superposition leads to a state that's equivalent to a squeezed state. But I don't think so. A squeezed state is a linear combination of coherent states with complex coefficients, but perhaps not in a symmetric way.

Wait, but wait, perhaps in this specific case, the state ends up being a Gaussian state. Let me think: For a superposition like (|a> + |b>)/sqrt(2), where a and b are real and symmetric, like |a> and |-a>, then maybe it's a coherent state. No, wait, a coherent state is just |a>, and a superposition would not be. Let me compute for a simple case. Suppose alpha is zero. Then |psi> would be (cos(phi)|0> + sin(phi)|0>)/N = [some constant] |0>, so it's a coherent state. But with alpha being non-zero, like 0.5, it's a superposition of |0.5> and |-0.5>, which can't be Gaussian.

So del_b should be positive, so options A, B, or C.

But wait, the problem is to calculate it. Hmm. So maybe another approach: For the given state, calculate its Wigner function, compute the relative entropy compared to the closest Gaussian state, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a known formula for the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity for a two-mode squeezed state or a Schrödinger cat state. I vaguely recall that for certain cat states, the non-Gaussianity can be computed using specific formulas.

Alternatively, maybe in this specific case, the state is symmetric in phase space and can be approximated by a certain Gaussian state. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is defined as S(rho || tau), where tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho. So, to compute it, we have to find the Gaussian state tau that minimizes S(rho || tau), and then compute the difference.

But how? That's complicated. Maybe for the given state, the relative entropy simplifies.

Wait, another thought: The state is a superposition of two coherent states, and perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the Wigner quasi-probability distribution's Gaussian approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity can be calculated using the logarithmic negativity or other measures, but the question specifically uses relative entropy.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Let's think about the state's properties.

The state is a coherent superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are coherent states. The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

The relative entropy between rho and tau is a measure of how non-Gaussian rho is. If tau is the "best" Gaussian approximation, then del_b is the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity.

Wait, I think in some cases, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is given by the difference between the entropy of rho and the entropy of the closest Gaussian state. So perhaps del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho.

Alternatively, since the relative entropy is not symmetric, perhaps it's S(rho || tau). But the question says it's [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], which is S(rho) - S(tau).

Wait, but what is tau here? The reference Gaussian state. If the state is a two-mode state, perhaps tau is the vacuum or a thermal state. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, maybe tau is the Gaussian state that minimizes the relative entropy between rho and tau. Finding that state would require optimization, which might be complicated, but perhaps for this specific state, there's a known result.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the non-Gaussianity is zero. But why?

Wait, wait, another thought. For phi = -pi/4, let's compute sin(2phi). 2phi is -pi/2, sin is -1. So the normalization factor N is sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)).

Wait, exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065, so 1 - 0.6065 is 0.3935, and sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275 as I calculated earlier.

So the state is (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ) / 0.6275. Which is ( (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> + (-sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Wait, but let's see if this state can be rewritten as a product or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a squeezed vacuum state, but I don't think so. Squeezed states are Gaussian, so if this state becomes a squeezed state, then del_b would be zero. But wait, no, because a superposition of two coherent states isn't a squeezed state.

Wait, maybe in some cases, the state is a squeezed state. Let me think: For example, a squeezed vacuum state is a superposition of even or odd coherent states, but that's a different case.

Alternatively, perhaps for particular values of alpha and phi, the state becomes a vacuum or coherent state. For example, when phi is zero, the state becomes |alpha>, which is coherent, so del_b is zero. Similarly, phi = pi/2 would give |-alpha>, also a coherent state, del_b zero. But in this case, phi is -pi/4, so we're in a superposition.

Wait, what if the state is symmetric in some way that makes it Gaussian? For example, if the superposition leads to a state that is a displaced thermal state or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a product state, making it Gaussian. But no, because it's a superposition of two coherent states, which are entangled in phase space, making it non-Gaussian.

Hmm, but the question is about the relative entropy. Without knowing the exact formula or method to compute it, perhaps I can think about the possible answers. The options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

But if the state is non-Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity should be positive. So D) 0 is only correct if the state is Gaussian. But earlier, I thought it's non-Gaussian, so D) can't be the answer. Or can it?

Wait, wait. Another thought: Maybe the state is actually Gaussian after all. How? Because sometimes, certain superpositions can be expressed as Gaussian states. Let me think.

Wait, |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states. The state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. Let me compute this for phi = -pi/4.

phi is -pi/4, so cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes [ (sqrt(2)/2)|alpha> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-alpha> ] / N.

Let me think: can this be rewritten as a coherent state? No, because it's a superposition of two different coherent states. Because |alpha> and |-alpha> are orthogonal when alpha is real and non-zero. So the state is a sum of two orthogonal vectors, hence it's a superposition state, which is non-Gaussian.

Thus, the non-Gaussianity should be positive. So option D) 0 is incorrect.

So we're left with options A, B, C.

But how to compute del_b? I'm not sure. Maybe I can recall that for a two-mode squeezed vacuum state, the non-Gaussianity is a certain value, but I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps for a specific case, the relative entropy can be calculated using the formula del_b = (1 + ... ) but I can't remember.

Wait, another approach: The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is also known as the quantum relative entropy between the given state and the reference Gaussian state. The reference Gaussian state could be the state obtained by taking the Wigner-Weyl transform of the original state. But calculating that might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity can be found using the logarithmic von Neumann entropy. Because for Gaussian states, the entropy is known, and for the non-Gaussian state, it would be higher.

Wait, the relative entropy del_b is [S(rho) - S(tau)], where S is the von Neumann entropy. So perhaps I can compute S(rho) and S(tau) and subtract.

But I need to find S(rho) and S(tau). The problem is that rho is the state in question, which is a pure state. Because |psi> is a pure state, rho has rank 2, since it's a superposition of two orthogonal states.

Wait, let me compute rho. The state |psi> is (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2 * 0.3935) ? Wait, N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275. So, |psi> is ( (sqrt(2)/2)|alpha> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-alpha> ) / 0.6275.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. So rho is a pure state, so its entropy S(rho) is zero. Wait, no, wait: No, |psi> is a pure state, but the entropy of a pure state is zero. Wait, but wait, no, that's only if it's a single state. Wait, no, any pure state has von Neumann entropy zero. Because the density matrix is idempotent, rho^2 = rho, so the eigenvalues are 1 and 0, so the entropy is - (1 ln 1 + 0 ln 0) = 0.

Wait, but rho is a pure state, so S(rho) is zero. But then what is tau? Because tau is a Gaussian state. If tau is a Gaussian state that's the closest to rho, then S(tau) would be the entropy of that Gaussian state.

But del_b = [S(rho) - S(tau)] = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But relative entropy is supposed to be non-negative. Oh, wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Because the relative entropy is usually S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau), which is different from what the question states.

Wait, the question says del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Which is S(rho) - S(tau), which doesn't necessarily have to be non-negative. Hmm, that seems unconventional because relative entropy is usually S(rho||tau) which is non-negative. So maybe this is a different measure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition. Maybe the non-Gaussianity is defined as S(tau) - S(rho), which would make sense, but then del_b would be negative if rho is non-Gaussian.

But according to the question, del_b is as defined. So it's S(rho) minus S(tau). So if rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0. If tau is a mixed Gaussian state, S(tau) would be positive, so del_b would be negative. But the problem says to compute the nG (non-Gaussianity) using this measure, so probably it's the absolute value? Or perhaps the problem has a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually asking for the relative entropy S(rho || tau), which would be the usual non-Gaussianity measure. So perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

But regardless, since rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0. So del_b would be 0 - S(tau), which is negative. But the options are all positive. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering rho as a pure state. Let's think again: Wait, no, |psi> is a pure state, so rho is pure, which gives S(rho)=0. So del_b in the question's formula would be - S(tau), which is negative. But the options are positive.

So perhaps the formula in the question is actually the other way around. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Alternatively, perhaps tau is the maximally mixed state, but that's not Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps tau is the vacuum state. The vacuum state is Gaussian. The entropy of the vacuum is zero (since it's pure). So in that case, del_b would be S(rho) - 0 = 0 - 0 = 0, which would make the answer D) 0. But that doesn't make sense because rho is a non-Gaussian state, and the vacuum is a different state.

Hmm, I'm getting more confused. Maybe the problem is to compute the non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy between the state and the reference Gaussian state. But I'm not sure how to proceed with the calculation without more information.

Wait, another approach: The problem gives a definition for N. Let's compute N. Given phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Compute sin(2 * (-pi/4)) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)(0.6065)) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / 0.6275. Wait, because cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

Wait, so |psi> is [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

But wait, |0.5> and |-0.5> are coherent states. The state is a superposition of two orthogonal coherent states, making it a non-Gaussian state.

But how to compute the relative entropy with the given formula? I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a product state, but for a single mode, I don't think that matters. Wait, no, the state is for a single mode, so it's either a Gaussian or non-Gaussian state.

Wait, another thought: For a single-mode state, any Gaussian state can be written in terms of displacement, squeezing, and phase shifts. So perhaps this state can't be expressed as such, making it non-Gaussian.

Thus, del_b should be positive.

But without knowing how to compute it, I'm stuck. Maybe looking at the options, option B is 0.25. I'm not sure why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, the state becomes a Fock state, which is non-Gaussian, but I don't see how.

Wait, no, the state is a sum of two coherent states, which are superpositions of Fock states. So the state is a superposition of superpositions, making it a highly non-Gaussian state.

Hmm. Maybe I can think about the density matrix. For a pure state, the density matrix is |psi><psi|, which has rank 2. So the eigenvalues are 1 and 0 (since it's pure), but wait, no. Wait, the state is a superposition, but as a normalized vector, it's a pure state. So rho has eigenvalues 1 and 0, making S(rho)=0.

Wait, but tau is a Gaussian state. If tau is the vacuum state, then S(tau)=0. So del_b would be 0-0=0. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a different one. Maybe the state is compared to a thermal Gaussian state with the same average photon number as rho.

The average photon number for rho can be calculated. The average photon number for |alpha> is |alpha|^2, so for alpha=0.5, it's 0.25.

But rho is a superposition. The average photon number would be <n> = |psi|^2. Wait, no, it's |<alpha | psi> |^2 + |< -alpha | psi> |^2?

Wait, perhaps the expectation value of the number operator for rho is:

< n > = < psi | a† a | psi >.

Let me compute this. |psi> = (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / N.

So <n> = (1/N^2) [ <alpha| a† a |alpha> - <alpha| a† a |-alpha> - < -alpha | a† a |alpha> + < -alpha | a† a |-alpha> ].

But a† a is the number operator. For a coherent state |alpha>, a|alpha> = alpha |alpha>, so a† a |alpha> = alpha a |alpha> = alpha^2 |alpha>? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, a|alpha> = alpha |alpha>, so a† a |alpha> = alpha a |alpha> = alpha^2 |alpha>? No, wait, a† a is the number operator, and for a coherent state |alpha>, <alpha| a† a |alpha> = |alpha|^2. Because for coherent states, the average photon number is |alpha|^2.

So, <alpha| a† a |alpha> = |alpha|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25.

Similarly, < -alpha | a† a | -alpha > = | -alpha |^2 = 0.25.

Now, cross terms: <alpha| a† a |-alpha> = ?

But a† a is the number operator, which for a coherent state |alpha> gives |alpha|^2, but when you have <alpha| a† a |-alpha>, it's (a† a)_{alpha, -alpha}.

Wait, a† a is a diagonal operator in the number basis, but coherent states are not eigenstates of a† a. So the matrix element <alpha| a† a |-alpha> would involve the overlap between |alpha> and a† a | -alpha >, which might be zero.

Wait, but a† a | -alpha > = (-alpha) a† a | -alpha >? No, wait, a | -alpha > = -alpha | -alpha >. So a† a | -alpha > = a† (a | -alpha >) = a† ( - alpha | -alpha > ) = - alpha a† | -alpha >.

But a† | -alpha > is the coherent state with parameter -alpha +1 (because a† adds a photon). Or perhaps it's more complex. Alternatively, the matrix element might not be zero, but I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I can consider that for |alpha> and |-alpha>, the terms involving cross elements might be zero. So, let's proceed under the assumption that cross terms are zero.

So, <n> = (1/N^2) [ |alpha|^2 + | -alpha |^2 ].

Wait, no, I have four terms. Let's write it out:

<psi| a† a | psi> = [ (cos phi <alpha| - sin phi < -alpha | ) / N ] [ a† a (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi | -alpha> ) / N ]

= (1/N^2) [ cos phi cos phi <alpha| a† a |alpha> + cos phi sin phi <alpha| a† a | -alpha> 
- sin phi cos phi < -alpha| a† a |alpha> + sin phi sin phi < -alpha | a† a | -alpha> ]

Assuming cross terms are zero, so the middle terms are zero. Then,

= (1/N^2) [ cos^2 phi <alpha| a† a |alpha> + sin^2 phi < -alpha | a† a | -alpha> ]

= (1/N^2) [ cos^2 phi |alpha|^2 + sin^2 phi | -alpha |^2 ]

Since |alpha|^2 = | -alpha |^2 = 0.25, and cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi = 1,

= (1/N^2) [ 0.25 (cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi) ] = 0.25 / N^2.

N is sqrt(0.3935), so N^2 is 0.3935. Therefore, <n> = 0.25 / 0.3935 ≈ 0.635.

But wait, the average photon number might not directly relate to the reference Gaussian state's photon number.

Hmm, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the thermal state with the same average photon number. So, if tau is a thermal state with <n> = 0.635, then its entropy is S(tau) = (2 <n> +1) ln(2 <n> +1) - ( <n> +1 ) ln( <n> +1 ) - <n> ln <n> ?

Wait, no, the entropy of a thermal state is S = (2n +1) ln(2n+1) - (n+1) ln(n+1) - n ln n, where n is the average photon number. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the von Neumann entropy for a thermal state with occupation number n is S = - (p ln p + (1-p) ln(1-p)), where p = (n)/(n+1).

Wait, for a single mode, the thermal state is given by rho_thermal = (1 - p) |0><0| + p |1><1| + ... with p = 1/(e^{\beta \hbar \omega} + 1). But perhaps I can model it as a two-level system for simplicity. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum, which has zero entropy. But then, the relative entropy would be S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - 0 = 0, which brings us back to option D.

But that can't be right because rho is a non-Gaussian state. So perhaps the reference state is not the vacuum.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the same as the state rho, but only if rho is Gaussian. But in this case, rho is non-Gaussian, so tau must be a different state.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the problem is designed so that the non-Gaussianity is zero, but why?

Wait, another thought: The state |psi> could be a Gaussian state if the superposition can be rewritten as a displaced Gaussian state. For example, if the state is a displaced thermal state, it would still be Gaussian. But in this case, the state is a superposition of two coherent states, which can't be Gaussian unless the coefficients are arranged in a way that the superposition collapses into a coherent state, which is only the case when phi is 0 or pi/2.

In our case, phi is -pi/4, so it's a superposition, hence non-Gaussian. So del_b should be positive.

But without knowing the exact calculation, I can't determine the value. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The options are A: 2.48, B: 0.25, C:1.38, D:0.

I think the correct answer is not D. So the answer is either A, B, or C.

But I'm not sure what the correct value would be. Wait, another thought: Since the state is a superposition of two coherent states, the non-Gaussianity might be significant, but I don't know. Looking at the options, maybe the answer is A) 2.48, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a cat state, and the non-Gaussianity can be calculated using the formula for cat states. I remember that the non-Gaussianity for a cat state can be computed based on the parameters.

Wait, the cat state is often written as (|alpha> + e^{i theta} |-alpha> ) / N. Depending on theta, it can be symmetric or antisymmetric. In our case, theta is zero because phi is -pi/4, but the coefficients are cos(phi) and sin(phi). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for this particular state, when phi is -pi/4, the state is a certain type of cat state with a specific non-Gaussianity value.

But without the exact formula, I can't compute the exact value.

Wait, perhaps a smarter approach: since the problem gives N as sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)), and phi is -pi/4, alpha=0.5, perhaps the non-Gaussianity depends on this N.

The problem is to compute del_b, which is S(rho) - S(tau). But without knowing S(tau), I can't compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero in this case. Maybe I made a mistake earlier and the state is actually Gaussian. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the state is a coherent state. Because when phi=-pi/4, and the coefficients are cos(phi) and sin(phi), but perhaps combining them in a way that the state is still a coherent state.

Wait, another approach: write |psi> as (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / N. Let me compute the Wigner function. The Wigner function of a coherent state is Gaussian. The Wigner function of a superposition of coherent states typically has interference terms, leading to non-Gaussian features. So the state is non-Gaussian, making del_b positive.

But without the exact formula, I can't find the value. So perhaps I should choose option C) 1.38.

Wait, but why? Without any basis, it's a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is Gaussian. But earlier analysis suggested that it's not.

I'm stuck. Maybe the answer is D) 0, but I can't see why.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the state |psi> can be rewritten as a product of two coherent states or some other Gaussian state. Let me see.

Wait, |psi> = [ |alpha> - |-alpha> ] / N. Let me factor this:

= (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / N
= [ |alpha> + (-1)|-alpha> ] / N

This doesn't seem to be a product state. Alternatively, perhaps it's a two-mode entangled state but in this case, it's a single mode.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Another approach: since the relative entropy is the difference in the entropies, and rho is pure, so S(rho)=0. If the reference Gaussian state is pure, then S(tau)=0, so del_b=0. But that would imply the state is Gaussian, which it's not.

Wait, but perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is not the vacuum. Maybe it's a different state.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state obtained by taking the Gaussian approximation of rho. For a superposition of two coherent states, the Gaussian approximation might be a displaced thermal state or something else.

But I don't know.

Hmm, perhaps it's best to go with the initial thought that the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity is positive, and choose the smallest positive option, which is B) 0.25. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D) 0 because the state is actually Gaussian. But I can't see why.

Wait, another thought: Maybe when phi is -pi/4, sin(2 phi) is -1, so N is sqrt(1 - e^{-0.5}) ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275. But that doesn't make the state Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps the state can be rewritten as a squeezed state. But I don't think so.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and have to make an educated guess. The options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C)1.38, D)0.

I'm going to guess that the correct answer is C)1.38. But I'm really not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's B)0.25.

Wait, another angle: The non-Gaussianity can be calculated using the third or fourth moments, but I don't have the exact method.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a coherent state. But that can't be because it's a superposition.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the definition of N. Let me recheck.

The state is given as |psi> = ( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N.

N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Plugging in phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5:

sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

exp(-2 * (0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is (cos(-pi/4) |0.5> + sin(-pi/4) |-0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Which is ( (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ) / 0.6275.

So the state is (|0.5> - |-0.5> ) / sqrt(2 * 0.3935) ?

Wait, sqrt(2) times 0.6275 is about 0.884, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Maybe the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a squeezed vacuum state. But I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the state can be rewritten as a single coherent state with a different alpha. I don't think so because the superposition would change the state's properties.

Hmm. At this point, I think I'm stuck and have to make a guess. I'll go with option C) 1.38.

The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \( N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}} \). The relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity is given as:

\[
\Delta_b = \text{trace}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{trace}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Analysis:
1. **State Properties**: The state \(|\psi\rangle\) is a superposition of two coherent states \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|-\alpha\rangle\). Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition generally results in a non-Gaussian state. This makes the state non-Gaussian unless the coefficients collapse it into a coherent state, which occurs only for specific \(\phi\) values (e.g., \(\phi = 0\) or \(\phi = \pi/2\)).

2. **Parameters**: For \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\):
   - \(\sin(2\phi) = \sin(-\pi/2) = -1\),
   - \(e^{-2\alpha^2} = e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065\),
   - \(N = \sqrt{1 - 0.6065} = \sqrt{0.3935} \approx 0.6275\).

   Substituting these values, the state becomes:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(-\pi/4)|0.5\rangle - \sin(-\pi/4)|-0.5\rangle}{0.6275}.
   \]
   This is a superposition of two orthogonal coherent states, confirming the state is non-Gaussian.

3. **Relative Entropy Measure**: The relative entropy \(\Delta_b\) measures the difference between the non-Gaussian state \(\rho\) and the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\). Since \(\rho\) is non-Gaussian, \(\Delta_b\) should be positive. However, the exact calculation of \(\Delta_b\) requires knowledge of the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\), which is not explicitly provided in the problem.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option D (0)**: This would imply the state is Gaussian, which is incorrect because the state is a superposition of two coherent states.
   - **Options A, B, and C**: These represent positive values for \(\Delta_b\), consistent with the state being non-Gaussian. Without the exact formula for \(\Delta_b\), the value cannot be computed directly, but the smallest positive option (B: 0.25) or a moderate value (C: 1.38) is likely correct.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the state is non-Gaussian, so \(\Delta_b > 0\). Based on the options and the reasoning provided, the most plausible answer is **C) 1.38**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Oh wait, I remember that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, right? Coherent states are Gaussian states, so the superposition of them would create a non-Gaussian state, which makes sense for a Schrödinger cat state—those are usually considered highly non-classical.

The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). Okay, so for given phi and alpha, I can compute N. The problem gives phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. Let me plug those numbers in.

First, compute sin(2*phi). Since phi is -pi/4, 2*phi is -pi/2. The sine of -pi/2 is -1. Then, exp(-2*alpha^2) with alpha=0.5: 2*(0.5)^2 is 0.5, so exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. Multiply those together: (-1) * 0.6065 ≈ -0.6065. Then, 1 + (-0.6065) is 0.3935. Take the square root: sqrt(0.3935) is about 0.6275. So N ≈ 0.6275.

Now, the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi). Let me compute those. phi is -pi/4. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So the state is (0.7071|0.5> - 0.7071| -0.5> ) / 0.6275.

The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the state's density matrix and tau is a Gaussian reference state. Wait, but relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is a measure of how non-Gaussian a state is. The idea is that if rho is Gaussian, del_b should be zero. But for non-Gaussian states, del_b is positive.

Wait, because relative entropy measures the difference between two states. So if rho is non-Gaussian and tau is the closest Gaussian state to it, then del_b would be the relative entropy between rho and tau. But in this question, they've phrased it as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Wait, isn't that the same as the relative entropy between rho and tau? Let me think.

The relative entropy between rho and tau is S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). Oh wait, but the question says del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. That's different. Because normally, relative entropy is rho ln rho - rho ln tau. But here, it's rho ln rho minus tau ln tau, which is the same as S(rho) - S(tau). Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the reference Gaussian state tau is the thermal state, or maybe the vacuum? Or maybe the Gaussian state that is the closest to rho. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the reference state is a Gaussian state that is the best approximation to rho. For Schrödinger cat states, the reference Gaussian state is often the Wigner-Weyl transformed state, or maybe the state that minimizes the relative entropy.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact calculation here. Maybe there's a simpler approach. Let's think about the specific case given.

The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. The density matrix rho would be |psi><psi|. For a superposition state like this, the Wigner function will have negative regions, making it non-Gaussian.

But how does that translate into the relative entropy measure? I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps this is a trick question. For certain parameters, the state might reduce to a Gaussian state, making the non-Gaussianity zero.

Wait, when does a superposition of coherent states become Gaussian? Well, Gaussian states are closed under linear operations, but a superposition of two coherent states isn't Gaussian unless perhaps the coefficients are zero in a certain way.

Wait, but let me think. For example, when phi is zero, the state becomes |alpha> / N, but N is sqrt(1 + 0) = 1, so it's just |alpha>, a coherent state, which is Gaussian. Similarly, if phi is pi/2, the state becomes sin(pi/2)|-alpha> = |-alpha>, another coherent state. So in those cases, the state is Gaussian, and del_b would be zero.

But in this case, phi is -pi/4 and alpha=0.5. So it's a superposition of two different coherent states. Therefore, it's non-Gaussian, and del_b should be positive.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is zero. So why would that be? Could the state become Gaussian under these parameters?

Wait, maybe when the relative entropy between rho and the reference Gaussian state is zero. That would happen if rho itself is Gaussian. So for phi = -pi/4, is the state still Gaussian?

No, because a superposition of two different coherent states can't be Gaussian. Because the Wigner function of a Gaussian state must be Gaussian in phase space, and a superposition would create interference terms, leading to non-Gaussian features.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: Maybe the state is a squeezed state. No, squeezed states are Gaussian as well. Unless the superposition leads to a state that's equivalent to a squeezed state. But I don't think so. A squeezed state is a linear combination of coherent states with complex coefficients, but perhaps not in a symmetric way.

Wait, but wait, perhaps in this specific case, the state ends up being a Gaussian state. Let me think: For a superposition like (|a> + |b>)/sqrt(2), where a and b are real and symmetric, like |a> and |-a>, then maybe it's a coherent state. No, wait, a coherent state is just |a>, and a superposition would not be. Let me compute for a simple case. Suppose alpha is zero. Then |psi> would be (cos(phi)|0> + sin(phi)|0>)/N = [some constant] |0>, so it's a coherent state. But with alpha being non-zero, like 0.5, it's a superposition of |0.5> and |-0.5>, which can't be Gaussian.

So del_b should be positive, so options A, B, or C.

But wait, the problem is to calculate it. Hmm. So maybe another approach: For the given state, calculate its Wigner function, compute the relative entropy compared to the closest Gaussian state, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a known formula for the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity for a two-mode squeezed state or a Schrödinger cat state. I vaguely recall that for certain cat states, the non-Gaussianity can be computed using specific formulas.

Alternatively, maybe in this specific case, the state is symmetric in phase space and can be approximated by a certain Gaussian state. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is defined as S(rho || tau), where tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho. So, to compute it, we have to find the Gaussian state tau that minimizes S(rho || tau), and then compute the difference.

But how? That's complicated. Maybe for the given state, the relative entropy simplifies.

Wait, another thought: The state is a superposition of two coherent states, and perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the Wigner quasi-probability distribution's Gaussian approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity can be calculated using the logarithmic negativity or other measures, but the question specifically uses relative entropy.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Let's think about the state's properties.

The state is a coherent superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are coherent states. The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

The relative entropy between rho and tau is a measure of how non-Gaussian rho is. If tau is the "best" Gaussian approximation, then del_b is the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity.

Wait, I think in some cases, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is given by the difference between the entropy of rho and the entropy of the closest Gaussian state. So perhaps del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho.

Alternatively, since the relative entropy is not symmetric, perhaps it's S(rho || tau). But the question says it's [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], which is S(rho) - S(tau).

Wait, but what is tau here? The reference Gaussian state. If the state is a two-mode state, perhaps tau is the vacuum or a thermal state. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, maybe tau is the Gaussian state that minimizes the relative entropy between rho and tau. Finding that state would require optimization, which might be complicated, but perhaps for this specific state, there's a known result.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the non-Gaussianity is zero. But why?

Wait, wait, another thought. For phi = -pi/4, let's compute sin(2phi). 2phi is -pi/2, sin is -1. So the normalization factor N is sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)).

Wait, exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065, so 1 - 0.6065 is 0.3935, and sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275 as I calculated earlier.

So the state is (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ) / 0.6275. Which is ( (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> + (-sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Wait, but let's see if this state can be rewritten as a product or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a squeezed vacuum state, but I don't think so. Squeezed states are Gaussian, so if this state becomes a squeezed state, then del_b would be zero. But wait, no, because a superposition of two coherent states isn't a squeezed state.

Wait, maybe in some cases, the state is a squeezed state. Let me think: For example, a squeezed vacuum state is a superposition of even or odd coherent states, but that's a different case.

Alternatively, perhaps for particular values of alpha and phi, the state becomes a vacuum or coherent state. For example, when phi is zero, the state becomes |alpha>, which is coherent, so del_b is zero. Similarly, phi = pi/2 would give |-alpha>, also a coherent state, del_b zero. But in this case, phi is -pi/4, so we're in a superposition.

Wait, what if the state is symmetric in some way that makes it Gaussian? For example, if the superposition leads to a state that is a displaced thermal state or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a product state, making it Gaussian. But no, because it's a superposition of two coherent states, which are entangled in phase space, making it non-Gaussian.

Hmm, but the question is about the relative entropy. Without knowing the exact formula or method to compute it, perhaps I can think about the possible answers. The options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

But if the state is non-Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity should be positive. So D) 0 is only correct if the state is Gaussian. But earlier, I thought it's non-Gaussian, so D) can't be the answer. Or can it?

Wait, wait. Another thought: Maybe the state is actually Gaussian after all. How? Because sometimes, certain superpositions can be expressed as Gaussian states. Let me think.

Wait, |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states. The state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. Let me compute this for phi = -pi/4.

phi is -pi/4, so cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes [ (sqrt(2)/2)|alpha> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-alpha> ] / N.

Let me think: can this be rewritten as a coherent state? No, because it's a superposition of two different coherent states. Because |alpha> and |-alpha> are orthogonal when alpha is real and non-zero. So the state is a sum of two orthogonal vectors, hence it's a superposition state, which is non-Gaussian.

Thus, the non-Gaussianity should be positive. So option D) 0 is incorrect.

So we're left with options A, B, C.

But how to compute del_b? I'm not sure. Maybe I can recall that for a two-mode squeezed vacuum state, the non-Gaussianity is a certain value, but I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps for a specific case, the relative entropy can be calculated using the formula del_b = (1 + ... ) but I can't remember.

Wait, another approach: The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is also known as the quantum relative entropy between the given state and the reference Gaussian state. The reference Gaussian state could be the state obtained by taking the Wigner-Weyl transform of the original state. But calculating that might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity can be found using the logarithmic von Neumann entropy. Because for Gaussian states, the entropy is known, and for the non-Gaussian state, it would be higher.

Wait, the relative entropy del_b is [S(rho) - S(tau)], where S is the von Neumann entropy. So perhaps I can compute S(rho) and S(tau) and subtract.

But I need to find S(rho) and S(tau). The problem is that rho is the state in question, which is a pure state. Because |psi> is a pure state, rho has rank 2, since it's a superposition of two orthogonal states.

Wait, let me compute rho. The state |psi> is (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2 * 0.3935) ? Wait, N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275. So, |psi> is ( (sqrt(2)/2)|alpha> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-alpha> ) / 0.6275.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. So rho is a pure state, so its entropy S(rho) is zero. Wait, no, wait: No, |psi> is a pure state, but the entropy of a pure state is zero. Wait, but wait, no, that's only if it's a single state. Wait, no, any pure state has von Neumann entropy zero. Because the density matrix is idempotent, rho^2 = rho, so the eigenvalues are 1 and 0, so the entropy is - (1 ln 1 + 0 ln 0) = 0.

Wait, but rho is a pure state, so S(rho) is zero. But then what is tau? Because tau is a Gaussian state. If tau is a Gaussian state that's the closest to rho, then S(tau) would be the entropy of that Gaussian state.

But del_b = [S(rho) - S(tau)] = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But relative entropy is supposed to be non-negative. Oh, wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Because the relative entropy is usually S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau), which is different from what the question states.

Wait, the question says del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Which is S(rho) - S(tau), which doesn't necessarily have to be non-negative. Hmm, that seems unconventional because relative entropy is usually S(rho||tau) which is non-negative. So maybe this is a different measure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition. Maybe the non-Gaussianity is defined as S(tau) - S(rho), which would make sense, but then del_b would be negative if rho is non-Gaussian.

But according to the question, del_b is as defined. So it's S(rho) minus S(tau). So if rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0. If tau is a mixed Gaussian state, S(tau) would be positive, so del_b would be negative. But the problem says to compute the nG (non-Gaussianity) using this measure, so probably it's the absolute value? Or perhaps the problem has a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually asking for the relative entropy S(rho || tau), which would be the usual non-Gaussianity measure. So perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

But regardless, since rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0. So del_b would be 0 - S(tau), which is negative. But the options are all positive. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering rho as a pure state. Let's think again: Wait, no, |psi> is a pure state, so rho is pure, which gives S(rho)=0. So del_b in the question's formula would be - S(tau), which is negative. But the options are positive.

So perhaps the formula in the question is actually the other way around. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Alternatively, perhaps tau is the maximally mixed state, but that's not Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps tau is the vacuum state. The vacuum state is Gaussian. The entropy of the vacuum is zero (since it's pure). So in that case, del_b would be S(rho) - 0 = 0 - 0 = 0, which would make the answer D) 0. But that doesn't make sense because rho is a non-Gaussian state, and the vacuum is a different state.

Hmm, I'm getting more confused. Maybe the problem is to compute the non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy between the state and the reference Gaussian state. But I'm not sure how to proceed with the calculation without more information.

Wait, another approach: The problem gives a definition for N. Let's compute N. Given phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Compute sin(2 * (-pi/4)) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)(0.6065)) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / 0.6275. Wait, because cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

Wait, so |psi> is [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

But wait, |0.5> and |-0.5> are coherent states. The state is a superposition of two orthogonal coherent states, making it a non-Gaussian state.

But how to compute the relative entropy with the given formula? I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a product state, but for a single mode, I don't think that matters. Wait, no, the state is for a single mode, so it's either a Gaussian or non-Gaussian state.

Wait, another thought: For a single-mode state, any Gaussian state can be written in terms of displacement, squeezing, and phase shifts. So perhaps this state can't be expressed as such, making it non-Gaussian.

Thus, del_b should be positive.

But without knowing how to compute it, I'm stuck. Maybe looking at the options, option B is 0.25. I'm not sure why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, the state becomes a Fock state, which is non-Gaussian, but I don't see how.

Wait, no, the state is a sum of two coherent states, which are superpositions of Fock states. So the state is a superposition of superpositions, making it a highly non-Gaussian state.

Hmm. Maybe I can think about the density matrix. For a pure state, the density matrix is |psi><psi|, which has rank 2. So the eigenvalues are 1 and 0 (since it's pure), but wait, no. Wait, the state is a superposition, but as a normalized vector, it's a pure state. So rho has eigenvalues 1 and 0, making S(rho)=0.

Wait, but tau is a Gaussian state. If tau is the vacuum state, then S(tau)=0. So del_b would be 0-0=0. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a different one. Maybe the state is compared to a thermal Gaussian state with the same average photon number as rho.

The average photon number for rho can be calculated. The average photon number for |alpha> is |alpha|^2, so for alpha=0.5, it's 0.25.

But rho is a superposition. The average photon number would be <n> = |psi|^2. Wait, no, it's |<alpha | psi> |^2 + |< -alpha | psi> |^2?

Wait, perhaps the expectation value of the number operator for rho is:

< n > = < psi | a† a | psi >.

Let me compute this. |psi> = (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / N.

So <n> = (1/N^2) [ <alpha| a† a |alpha> - <alpha| a† a |-alpha> - < -alpha | a† a |alpha> + < -alpha | a† a |-alpha> ].

But a† a is the number operator. For a coherent state |alpha>, a|alpha> = alpha |alpha>, so a† a |alpha> = alpha a |alpha> = alpha^2 |alpha>? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, a|alpha> = alpha |alpha>, so a† a |alpha> = alpha a |alpha> = alpha^2 |alpha>? No, wait, a† a is the number operator, and for a coherent state |alpha>, <alpha| a† a |alpha> = |alpha|^2. Because for coherent states, the average photon number is |alpha|^2.

So, <alpha| a† a |alpha> = |alpha|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25.

Similarly, < -alpha | a† a | -alpha > = | -alpha |^2 = 0.25.

Now, cross terms: <alpha| a† a |-alpha> = ?

But a† a is the number operator, which for a coherent state |alpha> gives |alpha|^2, but when you have <alpha| a† a |-alpha>, it's (a† a)_{alpha, -alpha}.

Wait, a† a is a diagonal operator in the number basis, but coherent states are not eigenstates of a† a. So the matrix element <alpha| a† a |-alpha> would involve the overlap between |alpha> and a† a | -alpha >, which might be zero.

Wait, but a† a | -alpha > = (-alpha) a† a | -alpha >? No, wait, a | -alpha > = -alpha | -alpha >. So a† a | -alpha > = a† (a | -alpha >) = a† ( - alpha | -alpha > ) = - alpha a† | -alpha >.

But a† | -alpha > is the coherent state with parameter -alpha +1 (because a† adds a photon). Or perhaps it's more complex. Alternatively, the matrix element might not be zero, but I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I can consider that for |alpha> and |-alpha>, the terms involving cross elements might be zero. So, let's proceed under the assumption that cross terms are zero.

So, <n> = (1/N^2) [ |alpha|^2 + | -alpha |^2 ].

Wait, no, I have four terms. Let's write it out:

<psi| a† a | psi> = [ (cos phi <alpha| - sin phi < -alpha | ) / N ] [ a† a (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi | -alpha> ) / N ]

= (1/N^2) [ cos phi cos phi <alpha| a† a |alpha> + cos phi sin phi <alpha| a† a | -alpha> 
- sin phi cos phi < -alpha| a† a |alpha> + sin phi sin phi < -alpha | a† a | -alpha> ]

Assuming cross terms are zero, so the middle terms are zero. Then,

= (1/N^2) [ cos^2 phi <alpha| a† a |alpha> + sin^2 phi < -alpha | a† a | -alpha> ]

= (1/N^2) [ cos^2 phi |alpha|^2 + sin^2 phi | -alpha |^2 ]

Since |alpha|^2 = | -alpha |^2 = 0.25, and cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi = 1,

= (1/N^2) [ 0.25 (cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi) ] = 0.25 / N^2.

N is sqrt(0.3935), so N^2 is 0.3935. Therefore, <n> = 0.25 / 0.3935 ≈ 0.635.

But wait, the average photon number might not directly relate to the reference Gaussian state's photon number.

Hmm, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the thermal state with the same average photon number. So, if tau is a thermal state with <n> = 0.635, then its entropy is S(tau) = (2 <n> +1) ln(2 <n> +1) - ( <n> +1 ) ln( <n> +1 ) - <n> ln <n> ?

Wait, no, the entropy of a thermal state is S = (2n +1) ln(2n+1) - (n+1) ln(n+1) - n ln n, where n is the average photon number. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the von Neumann entropy for a thermal state with occupation number n is S = - (p ln p + (1-p) ln(1-p)), where p = (n)/(n+1).

Wait, for a single mode, the thermal state is given by rho_thermal = (1 - p) |0><0| + p |1><1| + ... with p = 1/(e^{\beta \hbar \omega} + 1). But perhaps I can model it as a two-level system for simplicity. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum, which has zero entropy. But then, the relative entropy would be S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - 0 = 0, which brings us back to option D.

But that can't be right because rho is a non-Gaussian state. So perhaps the reference state is not the vacuum.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the same as the state rho, but only if rho is Gaussian. But in this case, rho is non-Gaussian, so tau must be a different state.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the problem is designed so that the non-Gaussianity is zero, but why?

Wait, another thought: The state |psi> could be a Gaussian state if the superposition can be rewritten as a displaced Gaussian state. For example, if the state is a displaced thermal state, it would still be Gaussian. But in this case, the state is a superposition of two coherent states, which can't be Gaussian unless the coefficients are arranged in a way that the superposition collapses into a coherent state, which is only the case when phi is 0 or pi/2.

In our case, phi is -pi/4, so it's a superposition, hence non-Gaussian. So del_b should be positive.

But without knowing the exact calculation, I can't determine the value. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The options are A: 2.48, B: 0.25, C:1.38, D:0.

I think the correct answer is not D. So the answer is either A, B, or C.

But I'm not sure what the correct value would be. Wait, another thought: Since the state is a superposition of two coherent states, the non-Gaussianity might be significant, but I don't know. Looking at the options, maybe the answer is A) 2.48, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a cat state, and the non-Gaussianity can be calculated using the formula for cat states. I remember that the non-Gaussianity for a cat state can be computed based on the parameters.

Wait, the cat state is often written as (|alpha> + e^{i theta} |-alpha> ) / N. Depending on theta, it can be symmetric or antisymmetric. In our case, theta is zero because phi is -pi/4, but the coefficients are cos(phi) and sin(phi). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for this particular state, when phi is -pi/4, the state is a certain type of cat state with a specific non-Gaussianity value.

But without the exact formula, I can't compute the exact value.

Wait, perhaps a smarter approach: since the problem gives N as sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)), and phi is -pi/4, alpha=0.5, perhaps the non-Gaussianity depends on this N.

The problem is to compute del_b, which is S(rho) - S(tau). But without knowing S(tau), I can't compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero in this case. Maybe I made a mistake earlier and the state is actually Gaussian. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the state is a coherent state. Because when phi=-pi/4, and the coefficients are cos(phi) and sin(phi), but perhaps combining them in a way that the state is still a coherent state.

Wait, another approach: write |psi> as (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / N. Let me compute the Wigner function. The Wigner function of a coherent state is Gaussian. The Wigner function of a superposition of coherent states typically has interference terms, leading to non-Gaussian features. So the state is non-Gaussian, making del_b positive.

But without the exact formula, I can't find the value. So perhaps I should choose option C) 1.38.

Wait, but why? Without any basis, it's a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is Gaussian. But earlier analysis suggested that it's not.

I'm stuck. Maybe the answer is D) 0, but I can't see why.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the state |psi> can be rewritten as a product of two coherent states or some other Gaussian state. Let me see.

Wait, |psi> = [ |alpha> - |-alpha> ] / N. Let me factor this:

= (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / N
= [ |alpha> + (-1)|-alpha> ] / N

This doesn't seem to be a product state. Alternatively, perhaps it's a two-mode entangled state but in this case, it's a single mode.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Another approach: since the relative entropy is the difference in the entropies, and rho is pure, so S(rho)=0. If the reference Gaussian state is pure, then S(tau)=0, so del_b=0. But that would imply the state is Gaussian, which it's not.

Wait, but perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is not the vacuum. Maybe it's a different state.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state obtained by taking the Gaussian approximation of rho. For a superposition of two coherent states, the Gaussian approximation might be a displaced thermal state or something else.

But I don't know.

Hmm, perhaps it's best to go with the initial thought that the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity is positive, and choose the smallest positive option, which is B) 0.25. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D) 0 because the state is actually Gaussian. But I can't see why.

Wait, another thought: Maybe when phi is -pi/4, sin(2 phi) is -1, so N is sqrt(1 - e^{-0.5}) ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275. But that doesn't make the state Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps the state can be rewritten as a squeezed state. But I don't think so.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and have to make an educated guess. The options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C)1.38, D)0.

I'm going to guess that the correct answer is C)1.38. But I'm really not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's B)0.25.

Wait, another angle: The non-Gaussianity can be calculated using the third or fourth moments, but I don't have the exact method.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a coherent state. But that can't be because it's a superposition.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the definition of N. Let me recheck.

The state is given as |psi> = ( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N.

N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Plugging in phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5:

sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

exp(-2 * (0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is (cos(-pi/4) |0.5> + sin(-pi/4) |-0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Which is ( (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ) / 0.6275.

So the state is (|0.5> - |-0.5> ) / sqrt(2 * 0.3935) ?

Wait, sqrt(2) times 0.6275 is about 0.884, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Maybe the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a squeezed vacuum state. But I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the state can be rewritten as a single coherent state with a different alpha. I don't think so because the superposition would change the state's properties.

Hmm. At this point, I think I'm stuck and have to make a guess. I'll go with option C) 1.38.


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \( N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}} \). The relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity is given as:

\[
\Delta_b = \text{trace}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{trace}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Analysis:
1. **State Properties**: The state \(|\psi\rangle\) is a superposition of two coherent states \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|-\alpha\rangle\). Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition generally results in a non-Gaussian state. This makes the state non-Gaussian unless the coefficients collapse it into a coherent state, which occurs only for specific \(\phi\) values (e.g., \(\phi = 0\) or \(\phi = \pi/2\)).

2. **Parameters**: For \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\):
   - \(\sin(2\phi) = \sin(-\pi/2) = -1\),
   - \(e^{-2\alpha^2} = e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065\),
   - \(N = \sqrt{1 - 0.6065} = \sqrt{0.3935} \approx 0.6275\).

   Substituting these values, the state becomes:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(-\pi/4)|0.5\rangle - \sin(-\pi/4)|-0.5\rangle}{0.6275}.
   \]
   This is a superposition of two orthogonal coherent states, confirming the state is non-Gaussian.

3. **Relative Entropy Measure**: The relative entropy \(\Delta_b\) measures the difference between the non-Gaussian state \(\rho\) and the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\). Since \(\rho\) is non-Gaussian, \(\Delta_b\) should be positive. However, the exact calculation of \(\Delta_b\) requires knowledge of the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\), which is not explicitly provided in the problem.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option D (0)**: This would imply the state is Gaussian, which is incorrect because the state is a superposition of two coherent states.
   - **Options A, B, and C**: These represent positive values for \(\Delta_b\), consistent with the state being non-Gaussian. Without the exact formula for \(\Delta_b\), the value cannot be computed directly, but the smallest positive option (B: 0.25) or a moderate value (C: 1.38) is likely correct.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the state is non-Gaussian, so \(\Delta_b > 0\). Based on the options and the reasoning provided, the most plausible answer is **C) 1.38**.
