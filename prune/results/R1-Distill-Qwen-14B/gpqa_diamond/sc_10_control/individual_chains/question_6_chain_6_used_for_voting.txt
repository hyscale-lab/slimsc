Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in a potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum, and there are four options to choose from.

Hmm, right. So first, I should probably analyze the potential to see what kind of system this is. The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ), which suggests it's a two-dimensional central force problem, maybe like the hydrogen atom or the harmonic oscillator.

Wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let's break this down. The first term, (1/2)kr², looks like a standard harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions because in 2D, the harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2) m ω² r², but here it's (1/2)kr². Oh wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the potential for a 2D harmonic oscillator is usually (1/2) m ω² (x² + y²), which in polar coordinates becomes (1/2) m ω² r². So here, if we have (1/2)kr², that would be similar but with k instead of m ω². So maybe k is m ω², or perhaps it's a scaled version. I'll keep that in mind.

The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, that's interesting. So the potential depends on both r and θ, which means it's not spherically symmetric. Wait, but it's a function of r² cos²θ. Let's think about how that affects the system.

Wait, cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So maybe I can rewrite the potential as:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Let me compute that: (3/2) * (1/2) is 3/4, so:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ).

Wait, let me compute that again. (3/2) kr² times (1/2)(1 + cos2θ) would be (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ). So the full potential is:

(1/2) kr² + (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ) = (1/2 + 3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Wait, 1/2 is 2/4, so 2/4 + 3/4 is 5/4. So the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, that might not directly help. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider a coordinate transformation or look for a way to separate variables. Because the potential has both r and θ terms, but the θ term is multiplied by r², which suggests that perhaps the potential is separable into radial and angular parts.

Wait, the first term is (1/2)kr², which is purely radial. The second term, (3/2)kr² cos²θ, can be written in terms of some angular function times r². So perhaps the potential can be written as V(r) + some angular term.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the angular part can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics or trigonometric functions. Let me think about the form of the potential. Because the potential depends on r² cos²θ, which is proportional to cos²θ, perhaps this leads to an effective potential that's similar to a harmonic oscillator in the angular direction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps we can rewrite the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates to see if it simplifies.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/r². Substituting into the potential:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x² / r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, that's interesting! Because r² is x² + y², so (1/2)k r² is (1/2)k(x² + y²). So combining the terms:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

So let's compute that:

(1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = ( (1/2 + 3/2) k x² ) + (1/2 k y² )

Which simplifies to:

2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, wait. 1/2 + 3/2 is 2, so 2k x². So the potential in Cartesian coordinates is:

V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Oh! That's a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions. Because the potential is V = (m ω_x² x² /2) + (m ω_y² y² /2), so in this case, our potential is 2k x² + (1/2)k y², which can be written as (1/2) m ω_x² x² + (1/2) m ω_y² y², so equating:

(1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/(m)
(1/2) m ω_y² = (1/2)k → ω_y² = k/m.

Wait, actually, the potential is written as 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Let me compare that to the standard form (1/2)m ω² x² + (1/2)m ω² y². Hmm, but in our case, the coefficients are different.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the potential as a sum of two harmonic oscillators with different frequencies. Let me write the potential in terms of x and y:

V(x, y) = (2k) x² + ( (1/2)k ) y².

So that's like having a harmonic oscillator in x with frequency ω_x where (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m). Similarly, for y, (1/2) m ω_y² = (1/2)k → ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

But wait, in the potential, the x term is 2k x², which is (2k) x², and the standard form is (1/2) m ω² x². So 2k = (1/2) m ω_x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m. Similarly, (1/2)k = (1/2) m ω_y² → ω_y² = (k)/m.

So the energy levels for each direction would be quantized. In 1D harmonic oscillator, energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) ħ ω, where n is 0,1,2,...

In two dimensions, the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction. So if the particle is in state n_x in x and n_y in y, the energy would be E = (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x + (n_y +1/2) ħ ω_y.

Substituting ω_x and ω_y:

E = (n_x + 1/2) ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)) ) + (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m) )

Simplify that:

E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ sqrt(k/m)

Wait, because 2 sqrt(k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m), and sqrt(k/m) is another term.

Wait, wait. Let me compute each part:

The x term: (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * (2 sqrt(k/m)) → [2(n_x + 1/2)] ħ sqrt(k/m)
The y term: (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m) → [ (n_y + 1/2) ] ħ sqrt(k/m)

Adding them together:

E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] ħ sqrt(k/m)

Let's expand this:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = (2n_x + n_y ) + 3/2

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ sqrt(k/m )

Wait, looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x + n_y +3/2) ℏ * sqrt(k/m), which matches what I have here.

So the energy spectrum would be option C.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me double-check the potential transformation. The original potential was (1/2) kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ.

Expressed in Cartesian coordinates, as I did earlier, that becomes 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So yes, that's correct.

The frequencies are:

For x: ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m)
For y: ω_y² = (k)/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m)

Thus, each direction's energy is (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x and (n_y + 1/2) ħ ω_y.

Adding them gives the total energy as:

E = (2n_x +1 ) * (sqrt(k/m) ) * ħ + (n_y + 1/2) * sqrt(k/m) * ħ.

Wait, because (n_x + 1/2) * 2 sqrt(k/m) is 2(n_x + 1/2) sqrt(k/m) → 2n_x +1.

Ah, so the total is (2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2) multiplied by ħ sqrt(k/m). Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 2(n_x + 1/2) = 2n_x +1.

And (n_y + 1/2) remains.

So adding these:

(2n_x +1 ) + (n_y + 1/2 ) = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

Yes, that's correct.

So the energy is [2n_x +n_y + 3/2] multiplied by ħ sqrt(k/m).

Looking at the options:

Option C says E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m), which matches.

So the answer should be option C.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). To find the energy spectrum, we analyze the potential and simplify it.

First, the potential is rewritten in Cartesian coordinates using \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \). Substituting \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \), the potential becomes:

\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cdot \frac{x^2}{r^2} = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
V(x, y) = \left(\frac{1}{2}k + \frac{3}{2}k\right)x^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This represents a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions. The frequencies are determined from the standard harmonic oscillator potential \( \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2r^2 \). For the \( x \)-direction, \( \frac{1}{2}m\omega_x^2 = 2k \), giving \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). For the \( y \)-direction, \( \frac{1}{2}m\omega_y^2 = \frac{1}{2}k \), giving \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

The energy levels for a 1D harmonic oscillator are \( E_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega \), where \( n \) is a non-negative integer. In two dimensions, the total energy is the sum of the energies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions:

\[
E = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y.
\]

Substituting \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) and \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \):

\[
E = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
E = \left[2n_x + 1 + n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right]\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options, the correct energy spectrum is:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

This matches **Option C**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in a potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum, and there are four options to choose from.

Hmm, right. So first, I should probably analyze the potential to see what kind of system this is. The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ), which suggests it's a two-dimensional central force problem, maybe like the hydrogen atom or the harmonic oscillator.

Wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let's break this down. The first term, (1/2)kr², looks like a standard harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions because in 2D, the harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2) m ω² r², but here it's (1/2)kr². Oh wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the potential for a 2D harmonic oscillator is usually (1/2) m ω² (x² + y²), which in polar coordinates becomes (1/2) m ω² r². So here, if we have (1/2)kr², that would be similar but with k instead of m ω². So maybe k is m ω², or perhaps it's a scaled version. I'll keep that in mind.

The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, that's interesting. So the potential depends on both r and θ, which means it's not spherically symmetric. Wait, but it's a function of r² cos²θ. Let's think about how that affects the system.

Wait, cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So maybe I can rewrite the potential as:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Let me compute that: (3/2) * (1/2) is 3/4, so:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ).

Wait, let me compute that again. (3/2) kr² times (1/2)(1 + cos2θ) would be (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ). So the full potential is:

(1/2) kr² + (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ) = (1/2 + 3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Wait, 1/2 is 2/4, so 2/4 + 3/4 is 5/4. So the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, that might not directly help. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider a coordinate transformation or look for a way to separate variables. Because the potential has both r and θ terms, but the θ term is multiplied by r², which suggests that perhaps the potential is separable into radial and angular parts.

Wait, the first term is (1/2)kr², which is purely radial. The second term, (3/2)kr² cos²θ, can be written in terms of some angular function times r². So perhaps the potential can be written as V(r) + some angular term.

Wait, another approach: perhaps we can rewrite the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates to see if it simplifies.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/r². Substituting into the potential:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x² / r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, that's interesting! Because r² is x² + y², so (1/2)k r² is (1/2)k(x² + y²). So combining the terms:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

So let's compute that:

(1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = ( (1/2 + 3/2) k x² ) + (1/2 k y² )

Which simplifies to:

2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, wait. 1/2 + 3/2 is 2, so 2k x². So the potential in Cartesian coordinates is:

V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Oh! That's a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions. Because the potential is V = (m ω_x² x² /2) + (m ω_y² y² /2), so in this case, our potential is 2k x² + (1/2)k y², which can be written as (1/2) m ω_x² x² + (1/2) m ω_y² y², so equating:

(1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/(m)
(1/2) m ω_y² = (1/2)k → ω_y² = k/m.

Wait, actually, the potential is written as 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Let me compare that to the standard form (1/2)m ω² x² + (1/2)m ω² y². Hmm, but in our case, the coefficients are different.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the potential as a sum of two harmonic oscillators with different frequencies. Let me write the potential in terms of x and y:

V(x, y) = (2k) x² + ( (1/2)k ) y².

So that's like having a harmonic oscillator in x with frequency ω_x where (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m). Similarly, for y, (1/2) m ω_y² = (1/2)k → ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

But wait, in the potential, the x term is 2k x², which is (2k) x², and the standard form is (1/2) m ω² x². So 2k = (1/2) m ω_x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m. Similarly, (1/2)k = (1/2) m ω_y² → ω_y² = (k)/m.

So the energy levels for each direction would be quantized. In 1D harmonic oscillator, energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) ħ ω, where n is 0,1,2,...

In two dimensions, the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction. So if the particle is in state n_x in x and n_y in y, the energy would be E = (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x + (n_y +1/2) ħ ω_y.

Substituting ω_x and ω_y:

E = (n_x + 1/2) ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)) ) + (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m) )

Simplify that:

E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ sqrt(k/m)

Wait, because 2 sqrt(k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m), and sqrt(k/m) is another term.

Wait, wait. Let me compute each part:

The x term: (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * (2 sqrt(k/m)) → [2(n_x + 1/2)] ħ sqrt(k/m)
The y term: (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m) → [ (n_y + 1/2) ] ħ sqrt(k/m)

Adding them together:

E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] ħ sqrt(k/m)

Let's expand this:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = (2n_x + n_y ) + 3/2

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ sqrt(k/m )

Wait, looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x + n_y +3/2) ℏ * sqrt(k/m), which matches what I have here.

So the energy spectrum would be option C.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me double-check the potential transformation. The original potential was (1/2) kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ.

Expressed in Cartesian coordinates, as I did earlier, that becomes 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So yes, that's correct.

The frequencies are:

For x: ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m)
For y: ω_y² = (k)/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m)

Thus, each direction's energy is (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x and (n_y + 1/2) ħ ω_y.

Adding them gives the total energy as:

E = (2n_x +1 ) * (sqrt(k/m) ) * ħ + (n_y + 1/2) * sqrt(k/m) * ħ.

Wait, because (n_x + 1/2) * 2 sqrt(k/m) is 2(n_x + 1/2) sqrt(k/m) → 2n_x +1.

Ah, so the total is (2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2) multiplied by ħ sqrt(k/m). Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 2(n_x + 1/2) = 2n_x +1.

And (n_y + 1/2) remains.

So adding these:

(2n_x +1 ) + (n_y + 1/2 ) = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

Yes, that's correct.

So the energy is [2n_x +n_y + 3/2] multiplied by ħ sqrt(k/m).

Looking at the options:

Option C says E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m), which matches.

So the answer should be option C.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). To find the energy spectrum, we analyze the potential and simplify it.

First, the potential is rewritten in Cartesian coordinates using \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \). Substituting \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \), the potential becomes:

\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cdot \frac{x^2}{r^2} = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
V(x, y) = \left(\frac{1}{2}k + \frac{3}{2}k\right)x^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This represents a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions. The frequencies are determined from the standard harmonic oscillator potential \( \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2r^2 \). For the \( x \)-direction, \( \frac{1}{2}m\omega_x^2 = 2k \), giving \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). For the \( y \)-direction, \( \frac{1}{2}m\omega_y^2 = \frac{1}{2}k \), giving \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

The energy levels for a 1D harmonic oscillator are \( E_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega \), where \( n \) is a non-negative integer. In two dimensions, the total energy is the sum of the energies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions:

\[
E = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y.
\]

Substituting \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) and \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \):

\[
E = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
E = \left[2n_x + 1 + n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right]\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options, the correct energy spectrum is:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

This matches **Option C**.

Answer: C
