Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. It's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So the scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where they overexpress the GADD45G protein. They've introduced a coding sequence with an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and are selecting for antibiotic resistance. But they can't overexpress the protein as expected. The question is why.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I need to figure out what's wrong. Let me think about the structure of a coding sequence. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then there’s the coding part for the protein. The end of the coding sequence is usually followed by a stop codon, which is one of UAA, UAG, or UGA.

Wait, looking at the end of the given DNA strand: ...TGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'. Let's focus on the last part. The last part of the plus strand is GAGTGA. If I look at that, the complementary DNA would be CTACTTAC... Wait, no, maybe I should check for the stop codon. The sequence ends with GAGTGA. Let me write the complementary strand. The DNA strand is 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand but with T replaced by U.

So the DNA's 3' end is ...GAGTGA3'. That would transcribe into mRNA as GAGU GA. Wait, let me see: the DNA goes 5' to 3', so the mRNA is synthesized from the template strand, which is complementary. So the plus strand (given) is coding. So the mRNA would be same as plus strand, except T becomes U.

Looking at the very end of the plus DNA strand: ...TGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'. Wait, let me check the last few nucleotides. The last few are GAGTGA. So the mRNA would end with GAGUGA. Wait, no: the DNA is 5' to 3', so the mRNA is same as the DNA's coding strand (since mRNA is made off the template, which is the complementary strand). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, to clarify: the DNA has two strands, the plus (coding) strand and the minus (template) strand. The mRNA is synthesized using the template (minus) strand as a template, so the mRNA is complementary to the template strand, which is the same as the plus strand except T becomes U.

So the sequence in the plus strand is 5' ... GAGTGA 3'. So the mRNA would have ...ACUACU... but wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The plus strand is the coding strand, and the mRNA is synthesized using the template (minus) strand, which is the reverse complement of the plus strand. So the mRNA is the same as the plus strand but with T→U.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: The DNA is double stranded, with the coding strand (plus) being the same as mRNA (except T→U), and the template strand is the opposite.

So if the plus strand ends with GAGTGA, then the template strand (complement) ends with CTACTA. So the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand, so it would end with GAGU GA?

Wait, no. Let me think of the mRNA as being built off the template. So the template has the sequence ...CTACTA..., then the mRNA would be ...GAGUGA...? Because mRNA is synthesized as the complement of the template.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look for the stop codon in the mRNA. The given DNA sequence is the plus strand, so the mRNA would be same sequence but with T→U. Let me find where the stop codon is.

Looking through the DNA sequence, the very last part is ...TGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'. Let me check the last part for the stop codon. The stop codons in mRNA are UAA, UAG, UGA.

So the last part of the mRNA would be ...GAGUGA... because the DNA is GAGTGA. So mRNA would have GAGUGA. Wait, but the last three nucleotides are AGTGA. So the mRNA would have UGA at the end. Because the last three bases are TGA in the DNA, so mRNA would be UGA.

Ah, so the last three nucleotides of the plus strand are TGA, so the mRNA ends with UGA. UGA is a stop codon. So the construct includes a stop codon in the coding sequence, which would terminate translation early.

Wait, but wait—the construct is designed to express the GADD45G protein with an N-terminal HA tag. If the DNA has a stop codon before the end, the mRNA would terminate early. So perhaps the construct includes a premature stop codon, causing the protein to be truncated, thus not expressed as expected.

Wait, but why would that happen? The person introduced the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the sequence starts with ATG (start), then the HA tag, then the GADD45G sequence.

Looking at the given DNA sequence, the very end is ...GAGTGA3'. So the mRNA would end with GAGUGA? No, wait, the DNA is plus strand, so the mRNA is the same as the plus strand, T→U. So the mRNA would have ...GAGUGA... but wait, the last three bases of the DNA are GAGTGA, so when converted to mRNA, the last three are UGA. So the mRNA would have ...UGA. So the mRNA would have a stop codon at the end, which is correct because the gene should end with a stop codon. So why can't the protein be expressed?

Wait, but looking at the DNA, perhaps I need to look for where the stop codon occurs. Let me see. So the plus strand sequence ends with ...GAGTGA. So the mRNA would end with ...GAGUGA, but the last three are UGA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, but maybe the problem is that the stop codon is in the middle of the sequence. Let me scan the entire DNA to see if there are any in-frame stop codons earlier.

Looking through the sequence for triplets that are TAA, TAG, or TGA in the DNA (since mRNA would be UAA, UAG, UGA).

Wait, maybe I should look for any occurrence of TGA in the DNA sequence. Let me scan the DNA.

Looking at the plus strand:

... TGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA ...

Wait, I see "GAGTGA" near the end. So the DNA has TGA in the coding sequence, which would be a stop codon in the mRNA. So the construct has a stop codon, which would terminate translation early.

Wait, but wait. The construct includes the coding sequence for the HA tag followed by GADD45G. If the stop codon is present, perhaps the mRNA includes it, causing the ribosome to stop early. So the protein would be truncated, which would prevent proper expression. Alternatively, maybe the stop codon is in the wrong place.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the stop codon is part of the original gene, but in the modified construct, it's placed in the wrong frame, causing the introduction of a premature stop.

Wait, but in this case, the given DNA sequence is the coding sequence (CDS), so including the stop codon at the end. So perhaps the construct includes an in-frame stop codon that's causing the protein to be cut short. But why would that happen?

Wait, maybe the person forgot to include a stop codon. No, because the sequence ends with a UGA, which is a stop codon. So the mRNA would have that, causing the ribosome to stop.

Wait, but the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So perhaps the stop codon is causing the ribosome to stop before the full-length protein is made.

Wait, but the GADD45G coding sequence should include its own stop codon. If the construct adds another stop codon after the HA tag, that might cause the protein to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein that's not functional—hence, no overexpression.

Wait, but wait. The HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the construct would be HA followed by GADD45G. If the HA tag is followed by GADD45G, then the stop codon comes after GADD45G. So the mRNA would have the HA, the GADD45G sequence, and then a stop codon, which is correct.

So why isn't the protein being expressed? Let me think about the sequence again. Looking at the end of the plus strand:

...CGAGTGA3'

So the mRNA would end with ...GAG UGA. So the stop codon is UGA.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the stop codon is in the wrong reading frame, but that's unlikely because the construct is designed for the HA tag and GADD45G.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is placed in a way that introduces an in-frame stop codon early in the sequence.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, typically YPYDHH (for the influenza HA). So the coding sequence would be something like ATG followed by the HA tag codons, then the GADD45G codons, and finally a stop codon.

But in the given DNA, perhaps the stop codon occurs before the end of the GADD45G sequence, causing the ribosome to stop early.

Wait, but looking at the sequence, the last part is the HA tag? Or is the HA tag at the beginning? The HA is at the N-terminus, so the sequence starts with ATG, then the HA, then GADD45G.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the person introduced an extra stop codon within the HA tag or the GADD45G sequence, which is causing the translation to terminate early.

So looking at the DNA sequence, maybe there's a premature stop codon within the coding sequence.

Let me scan the DNA for any TGA, TAG, or TAA sequences that could be in the coding frame.

Going through the sequence:

Looking for triplets in the plus strand:

- TAC CCATACG ATG TTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Looking for any triplet that is TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Hmm, let's go through each triplet:

Looking at the first part:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT ACG CCA AAT GAC TCT GGA AGA AGT CCG CGG CCA GGA CAC AGT TCC GGA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC C GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGT CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT G CTC ACT GCC GGC GT CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGT CTT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGC GTG AGG AGG AC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG AAG CAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC C TGC ACT GCA TCC TCA TTT CGA ACC CCA C GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GC CTT GGA G AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTC GCC AGC ATC ACC CCC CCG AGT GAG TGA

Wait, let me see specific spots. I notice a 'TGAGTGA' towards the end. Wait, let me break it into triplets:

...GAGTGAGTGA... Hmm, no. Let me see the exact ending: the last few triplets are 'TGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'.

Breaking into triplets:

- TGC GAG GAG AGC GCG AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CCC CCG AGT GAG TGA

Wait, looking for TGA in the triplet:

- The last triplet is AGT GAG TGA. Wait, no. The last nine nucleotides are CGAGTGA.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the triplet 'TGA' in the DNA sequence.

Looking through, I see:

...GCTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Looking for TGA:

Hmm, the sequence has 'CGAGTGA' as the last part. So the last triplet is AGT GAG TGA? Or is it the triplet TGA somewhere else?

Wait, the previous part is 'GAGTGA'. So in the plus strand, the last six nucleotides are GAGTGA. So the triplet before that would be CGAGTG.

Wait, maybe it's easier to look for 'TGA' as a triplet. So in the plus strand DNA, TGA would appear as TGA.

Looking through the sequence, I don't see any TGA except at the very end. So that's the only TGA. So the mRNA would have UGA as the stop codon.

So if the construct ends with UGA, that's appropriate as the stop codon. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the presence of the HA tag is causing the protein to be recognized as a signal peptide or something, leading to it being secreted instead of remaining in the cell, but that's more about protein localization, not expression levels.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mutation in the HA tag that causes the protein not to be expressed. Wait, the question says that you introduced the HA tag. Option A says the HA sequence has a missense mutation. If that's the case, the HA might not be correctly formed, but would that prevent expression?

Wait, but the problem is the inability to overexpress. If the HA tag is mutated, perhaps the protein is not expressed because the ribosome is terminating early. But in this case, the stop codon is at the end, so the protein would be full-length.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so any in-frame stop codon in the HA would cause premature termination. So let me check if the HA coding sequence has a stop codon.

The HA tag is typically a short sequence. Let me recall the amino acid sequence of the HA tag. The HA tag is derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. The commonly used HA tag is YPYDHH, which is encoded by the DNA sequence ATG TAC CAT ATC GAT GGT CCA GAT TAC GCA CCA TTA GCT AGA GAA GAA GAA GCT GCG GCC AGA CAC AGT TCC GGA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGG AGT TGC TGC TGC TCG GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC TCA CTC ACT GCC GGC GTG CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGT CTT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AAA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGC GTG AGG AGG AC CAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG AAG CAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GCG GCC GCG GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GCG GAC C TGC ACT GCA TCC TCA TTT CGA ACC CCA C GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GC CTT GGA G AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTC GCC AGC ATC ACC CCC CCG AGT GAG TGA.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the HA tag's DNA sequence. The HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDHH. The DNA coding for Y is TAC, P is CCA, Y is TAC, D is GAT, H is CAT, H is CAT. So the coding sequence for YPYDHH would be TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT CCA. Wait, but let me check the beginning of the given DNA sequence.

The given DNA starts with ATG TAC CCATACG ATG TTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the initial part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT ACG CCA AAT GAC TCT GGA AGA AGT CCG CGG CCA GGA CAC AGT TCC GGA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC C GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGT CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT G CTC ACT GCC GGC GT CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGT CTT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGC GTG AGG AGG AC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG AAG CAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC C TGC ACT GCA TCC TCA TTT CGA ACC CCA C GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GC CTT GGA G AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTC GCC AGC ATC ACC CCC CCG AGT GAG TGA.

Wait, the first part: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT ACG CCA AAT GAC TCT GGA AGA AGT CCG CGG CCA GGA CAC AGT TCC GGA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC C GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGT CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT G CTC ACT GCC GGC GT CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGT CTT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGC GTG AGG AGG AC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG AAG CAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC C TGC ACT GCA TCC TCA TTT CGA ACC CCA C GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GC CTT GGA G AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTC GCC AGC ATC ACC CCC CCG AGT GAG TGA.

Wait, the HA tag's DNA sequence is supposed to code for YPYDHH. So the first part after ATG is TAC (Y), then CCA (P), then TAC (Y), then GAT (D), then CAT (H), then CAT (H). So the initial sequence should be ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT CAT CAT... but looking at the given DNA, after ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT comes GTC CAG ATT ACG CCA AAT, which doesn't match the expected HA tag sequence.

Wait, that can't be right. The HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, so the initial part should be the HA coding sequence. But in the given DNA, after ATG, the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), then GTC (Val) instead of CAT (H). Oh, wait, in the given DNA, after the initial ATG TAC (Y) CCA (P) TAC (Y) GAT (D), the next codon is GTC, which is Val, but according to the HA tag, the next should be CAT (H). So that's a problem.

Ah, so the HA tag's coding sequence is incorrect. Instead of CAT (H), it's GTC (Val). So that's a missense mutation in the HA sequence. So the HA tag is messed up, but how does that affect protein expression?

Wait, but the construct includes the HA tag followed by GADD45G. If the HA tag has a mutation, perhaps the ribosome can still translate the entire protein, but the HA tag is incorrect. But the question is about overexpression. Alternatively, perhaps the ribosome is terminating early because of a stop codon introduced due to the mutation.

Wait, no. The HA tag is at the start, so a mutation in it shouldn't introduce a stop codon unless the mutation creates a stop codon. Let's see: the HA tag's expected DNA is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT CAT CAT ... but in the given sequence, it's ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC ... So the fifth codon after ATG is GAT (aspartic acid, D), which is correct. The next codon is GTC, which is Val (V), but according to HA, it should be CAT (H). So that's a substitution from CAT to GTC. So the triplet is GAT GTC instead of GAT CAT.

Wait, no. Wait, the HA sequence is YPYDHH. So the DNA sequence after ATG should be TAC (Y) CCA (P) TAC (Y) GAT (D) CAT (H) CAT (H). But in the given DNA, after GAT comes GTC, not CAT. So the fifth codon is GTC (Val) instead of CAT (His). That's a missense mutation in the HA tag.

So the HA tag is supposed to be YPYDHH, but it's YPYDvH (if V is at position 6). Wait, no. The HA tag is Y-P-Y-D-H-H. So the fifth amino acid is H, which is CAT in DNA. But in the given DNA, it's GTC, which is Val (V). So that's a mutation in the HA tag. So the HA would be YPYDvH instead of YPYDHH, but that's a missense mutation (changed from His to Val). So that would make the HA tag incorrect, perhaps not allowing the protein to be recognized for purification, but why would it prevent expression?

Wait, but the question is about overexpression. If the HA tag is messed up, the affinity purification might not work, but the protein should still be expressed, just not tag properly. But the problem is the inability to overexpress the protein. So perhaps the mutation in the HA tag causes a problem, but I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, maybe the mutation introduced a stop codon. Let me check: the DNA triplet is GTC. In mRNA, that would be GUC, which codes for Val. So it's not a stop codon.

So the HA tag is mutated from His to Val, but that shouldn't cause the ribosome to stop. So why can't the protein be expressed?

Looking back at the options:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

This is true, as the HA tag has a Val instead of His. But does this prevent overexpression?

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is at the N-terminus, and the mutation doesn't affect expression. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, perhaps the presence of the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early. No, the ribosome would read through as long as there's no stop codon.

Wait, going back to the DNA sequence—the very end. The last triplet is TGA, which is a stop codon. So the mRNA ends with UGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would stop there, meaning the protein is correctly terminated. So why isn't it expressed?

Wait, another thought: maybe the stop codon is in the wrong reading frame. But no, the HA tag and GADD45G are in the same reading frame.

Wait, perhaps the construct is missing a necessary element, like a Kozak sequence or a proper ribosome binding site. But the question says that they used Lipofectamine to transfect into CHO cells, so perhaps the promoter is working. Alternatively, perhaps the lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. Option C says the lack of linker is causing proteolysis of the nascent chain.

Hmm, proteolysis would degrade the protein, making it difficult to detect. If the HA tag is at the N-terminus and the protein is being degraded, perhaps the construct isn't stable. But why would the lack of a linker cause that? A linker usually refers to a short amino acid sequence between domains, like between the tag and the protein. If the HA tag is directly fused to GADD45G without a linker, perhaps proteases can cleave between them. But in the given DNA, the HA is directly followed by GADD45G, so no linker. So the resulting protein would be HA followed immediately by GADD45G. But does that cause proteolysis? Maybe if the tag and protein are causing a recognition site for proteases.

But in this case, the main issue is the absence of overexpression. If the protein is being made but rapidly degraded, it might not accumulate enough to be detected.

Another possibility is that the HA tag is causing the protein to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum or secreted, but that's more about localization.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct didn't include an appropriate poly-A tail or other elements necessary for mRNA stability. But the question doesn't mention that.

Wait, but looking back at the given DNA sequence, the very end is ...GAGTGA. So the mRNA ends with ...GAGUGA. The last three nucleotides are UGA, which is a stop codon. So the mRNA is correctly terminated.

Wait, but perhaps the presence of UGA in the mRNA is causing a problem. In some organisms, a UGA codon can be read as selenocysteine if a specific context is present, but CHO cells are mammalian and don't typically incorporate selenocysteine unless a special construct is made. So perhaps the UGA is being read as a stop codon, which is correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B says the ribosome terminated early, which would result in a truncated protein. But in the given DNA, the stop codon is at the end, so the ribosome wouldn't terminate early. Unless there is an in-frame stop codon earlier.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag has a stop codon in the middle. Let me check the HA coding sequence again. The HA tag's DNA sequence in the construct is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT... Wait, the HA tag should be ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT CAT CAT ... but in the given DNA, after GAT comes GTC, which is Val. So that's a mutation (Val instead of His). But that's not a stop codon.

Wait, but perhaps the mutation introduced a stop codon elsewhere. Let's see: the DNA sequence after the HA tag is GTC CAG ATT ACG CCA AAT GAC TCT GGA AGA AGT CCG CGG CCA GGA CAC AGT TCC GGA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC C GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGT CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT G CTC ACT GCC GGC GT CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGT CTT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGC GTG AGG AGG AC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG AAG CAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC C TGC ACT GCA TCC TCA TTT CGA ACC CCA C GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GC CTT GGA G AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTC GCC AGC ATC ACC CCC CCG AGT GAG TGA.

Wait, looking through this, is there any in-frame stop codon before the end?

Let me scan for TAA, TAG, or TGA triplets in the DNA (which would be UAA, UAG, UGA in mRNA).

Looking for triplets:

- ...TAC CCATACG ATG TTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for any TGA in the DNA. I see it only at the very end.

So the only stop codon is at the end.

So why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, another possibility: the codon usage in the construct is not optimal for CHO cells. Perhaps the codons are not preferred, leading to low expression. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid lacks an origin of replication or other necessary elements for expression in CHO cells. But the question says they transfected with Lipofectamine and selected for colonies, implying that the plasmid has an antibiotic resistance gene.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is B: the ribosome terminated early. But I don't see an early stop codon. Unless I'm missing one.

Wait, perhaps the plus strand has a stop codon earlier. Let me double-check.

Looking through the DNA again for any TGA, TAG, TAA triplets.

Hmm, perhaps I missed one earlier. Let me look.

Wait, the sequence includes 'TCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'.

Hmm, I don't see any TGA, TAG, or TAA triplets except at the end. So the ribosome shouldn't terminate early.

Another thought: the given DNA sequence is for the plus strand, but perhaps the correct coding sequence should be on the other strand. Wait, no, the plus strand is the coding strand.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the stop codon is in the wrong reading frame. For example, if the DNA has a frameshift, causing the stop codon to appear earlier. But the question states that the construct was modified by introducing the HA tag, so perhaps the reading frame is correct.

Wait, but the given DNA has the HA tag, then GADD45G, then a stop codon. So if the HA tag is in frame, then GADD45G should be as well.

So, going back, the only thing I can find is that the HA tag has a missense mutation (Val instead of His). So option A says that. But would that prevent overexpression?

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate. But why would a single amino acid substitution do that?

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is part of a signal peptide. If the HA tag is part of a signal sequence that directs the protein to the secretory pathway, but without the correct sequence, the protein might not be properly targeted, leading to degradation. But that's more about localization, not expression levels.

Wait, the question is about overexpression. If the HA tag is mutated, perhaps the protein is not being secreted and thus isn't detected in the cell. But the question says the issue is that the protein can't be overexpressed, implying that it's not being made in the first place.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's mutation introduces a premature stop codon in the mRNA. But looking at the DNA, the HA tag's codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTC (V), etc. None of those are stop codons. So the only stop codon is at the end.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the HA tag's mutation causes the ribosome to stall, leading to the mRNA being degraded. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid doesn't have a promoter, but the question says they transfected it into cells, implying that the construct has a promoter.

Wait, another angle: the construct includes the HA tag followed by GADD45G, but perhaps the GADD45G sequence has a premature stop codon. Looking through the DNA sequence, perhaps I missed one.

Wait, looking at the DNA after the HA tag, the first part is GTC CAG ATT... Let me translate that into amino acids:

GTC is Val, CAG is Gln, ATT is Ile, etc. So that's part of the GADD45G sequence. Do any of these codons form a stop codon? No, because the mRNA would have GUC, CAG, AUC, etc., none of which are stop codons.

Wait, perhaps the entire construct is in the wrong reading frame. Let me check the initial ATG. The first codon is ATG, which is correct. The next codons are TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTC, etc. So the reading frame is correct.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option D says the tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, but the stop codon is UGA, not UAA. So that wouldn't apply.

Option C: The lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. If the HA tag is directly fused to GADD45G, perhaps the linker is missing, making the protein susceptible to proteolysis. But why would that prevent overexpression? If the protein is made but rapidly degraded, it wouldn't accumulate enough to be detected. But the question says the protein isn't overexpressed, implying it's not being made.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing the protein to be recognized as foreign and leading to degradation. But that's more about immunogenicity, not expression.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early. But as per the mRNA, the stop codon is at the end.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag is placed in the wrong orientation. But the question says it's at the N-terminus, so the coding sequence is correct.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the HA tag's mutation introduces a stop codon when considering the mRNA's reading frame. Let me think: The DNA has GTC, which is Val. In mRNA, it's GUC. So no stop codon. The fifth codon after ATG is GUC (Val), but it should have been CAT (His). So that's a missense mutation but not a stop codon.

Wait, maybe the HA tag's mutation creates a cryptic splice site or something, but that's more about mRNA processing.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in the HA tag introduces a stop codon in the reverse complement. Let me think: the DNA has GTC. The reverse complement would be GAC, which is Asp in DNA. Not a stop codon.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me think about each option again.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. That's true, but how does that prevent overexpression? It would lead to a mutated HA tag but shouldn't prevent the protein from being expressed.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. But the mRNA doesn't have any stop codons before the end, so this shouldn't happen.

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. If the HA is directly fused, perhaps the protein is getting degraded. But that would lead to low levels, not a complete lack of expression.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. But the stop codon is UGA, so D is irrelevant.

So the only possible option left is A, but I'm not completely convinced. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early. But looking at the mRNA, the only stop codon is at the end.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's mutation causes a frameshift, introducing an early stop codon. How would that happen? Let me see: the HA tag is supposed to be 6xHis or similar, but in this case, it's a different HA tag.

Wait, the HA tag's correct DNA is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT CAT CAT GGT CCA GAT TAC GCA CCA TTA GCT AGA GAA GAA GAA GCT GCG GCC AGA CAC AGT TCC GGA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGG AGT TGC TGC TGC TCG GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC TCA CTC ACT GCC GGC GTG CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGT CTT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AAA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGC GTG AGG AGG AC CAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG AAG CAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GCG GCC GCG GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GCG GAC C TGC ACT GCA TCC TCA TTT CGA ACC CCA C GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GC CTT GGA G AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTC GCC AGC ATC ACC CCC CCG AGT GAG TGA.

Wait, in the given DNA, the HA tag is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT... So after the initial ATG, the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTC (V), CAG (Q), ATT (I), etc. So the fifth codon is GTC (Val) instead of CAT (His). So that's a substitution from His to Val. So the HA tag has a mutation, but the rest of the sequence continues as GADD45G.

So the HA tag is still in frame, and the GADD45G is correctly expressed. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the HA tag's coding sequence was not correctly included, leading to a frameshift. But the given sequence doesn't show any frameshift; the reading frame remains correct.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is not followed by the correct start codon for GADD45G. But the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the start codon is at the beginning.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's mutation creates a stop codon in the wrong reading frame. Let me think: the HA tag's DNA is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT... which is in the correct reading frame. The corresponding mRNA would be TAC CCA TAC GAT GUC CAG ATT... which doesn't include a stop codon.

I'm really stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The fact that the HA tag's DNA has a missense mutation (option A) is correct. But does that explain the lack of overexpression? I'm not sure, but it's the only option that directly relates to the DNA sequence problem I noticed.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's mutation causes the ribosome to terminate early because the Val is a stop codon in some contexts. No, because Val's codon is GUC or GUA or GUG. UGA is a stop codon, but that's not the same as the Val codon.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's mutation introduces a stop codon when considering the DNA's complementary strand. Let me check: the DNA has GTC, which is Val. The complementary strand would be CAG, which is Gln. Not a stop codon.

Wait, maybe the person forgot to include the stop codon after the HA tag, but the given DNA ends with UGA, so that's included.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the HA tag is in the wrong phase, causing the GADD45G sequence to be out of frame. But the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so it's in the same frame.

I think the only plausible option is A: the HA sequence has a missense mutation. So the correct answer is A.

The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein is not working as expected. The construct includes the coding sequence for GADD45G with an N-terminal HA tag and a stop codon at the end. The provided DNA sequence shows that the HA tag is incorrectly encoded, with a missense mutation where a Val (GTC) is substituted for the expected His (CAT). This mutation does not introduce a stop codon but alters the HA tag's sequence. The rest of the construct appears to be in frame, with no additional stop codons or frameshifts identified in the coding sequence.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.**  
   This is correct. The HA tag's DNA sequence shows a mutation where Val (GTC) replaces His (CAT), resulting in a missense mutation. While this does not introduce a stop codon, it alters the HA tag, which could affect downstream applications like affinity purification. However, this mutation alone does not explain the complete lack of protein expression.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.**  
   This is incorrect. The mRNA sequence does not contain any in-frame stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) before the end of the coding sequence. The only stop codon is at the very end (UGA), so the ribosome would not terminate early.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.**  
   This is unlikely. The absence of a linker between the HA tag and GADD45G might make the protein susceptible to proteolysis, but this would result in degradation of the protein rather than a complete lack of expression. The question specifies that the protein is not being overexpressed, implying it is not being made in sufficient quantities.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.**  
   This is irrelevant. The stop codon in the mRNA is UGA, not UAA, so the lack of a tRNA for UAA does not affect translation.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is **Option A**, as the missense mutation in the HA tag could interfere with the construct's expression or stability. While the mutation does not directly cause a stop codon or frameshift, it may indirectly affect the expression of the protein, leading to the observed lack of overexpression.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. It's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So the scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where they overexpress the GADD45G protein. They've introduced a coding sequence with an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and are selecting for antibiotic resistance. But they can't overexpress the protein as expected. The question is why.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I need to figure out what's wrong. Let me think about the structure of a coding sequence. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then there’s the coding part for the protein. The end of the coding sequence is usually followed by a stop codon, which is one of UAA, UAG, or UGA.

Wait, looking at the end of the given DNA strand: ...TGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'. Let's focus on the last part. The last part of the plus strand is GAGTGA. If I look at that, the complementary DNA would be CTACTTAC... Wait, no, maybe I should check for the stop codon. The sequence ends with GAGTGA. Let me write the complementary strand. The DNA strand is 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand but with T replaced by U.

So the DNA's 3' end is ...GAGTGA3'. That would transcribe into mRNA as GAGU GA. Wait, let me see: the DNA goes 5' to 3', so the mRNA is synthesized from the template strand, which is complementary. So the plus strand (given) is coding. So the mRNA would be same as plus strand, except T becomes U.

Looking at the very end of the plus DNA strand: ...TGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'. Wait, let me check the last few nucleotides. The last few are GAGTGA. So the mRNA would end with GAGUGA. Wait, no: the DNA is 5' to 3', so the mRNA is same as the DNA's coding strand (since mRNA is made off the template, which is the complementary strand). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, to clarify: the DNA has two strands, the plus (coding) strand and the minus (template) strand. The mRNA is synthesized using the template (minus) strand as a template, so the mRNA is complementary to the template strand, which is the same as the plus strand except T becomes U.

So the sequence in the plus strand is 5' ... GAGTGA 3'. So the mRNA would have ...ACUACU... but wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The plus strand is the coding strand, and the mRNA is synthesized using the template (minus) strand, which is the reverse complement of the plus strand. So the mRNA is the same as the plus strand but with T→U.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: The DNA is double stranded, with the coding strand (plus) being the same as mRNA (except T→U), and the template strand is the opposite.

So if the plus strand ends with GAGTGA, then the template strand (complement) ends with CTACTA. So the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand, so it would end with GAGU GA?

Wait, no. Let me think of the mRNA as being built off the template. So the template has the sequence ...CTACTA..., then the mRNA would be ...GAGUGA...? Because mRNA is synthesized as the complement of the template.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look for the stop codon in the mRNA. The given DNA sequence is the plus strand, so the mRNA would be same sequence but with T→U. Let me find where the stop codon is.

Looking through the DNA sequence, the very last part is ...TGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'. Let me check the last part for the stop codon. The stop codons in mRNA are UAA, UAG, UGA.

So the last part of the mRNA would be ...GAGUGA... because the DNA is GAGTGA. So mRNA would have GAGUGA. Wait, but the last three nucleotides are AGTGA. So the mRNA would have UGA at the end. Because the last three bases are TGA in the DNA, so mRNA would be UGA.

Ah, so the last three nucleotides of the plus strand are TGA, so the mRNA ends with UGA. UGA is a stop codon. So the construct includes a stop codon in the coding sequence, which would terminate translation early.

Wait, but wait—the construct is designed to express the GADD45G protein with an N-terminal HA tag. If the DNA has a stop codon before the end, the mRNA would terminate early. So perhaps the construct includes a premature stop codon, causing the protein to be truncated, thus not expressed as expected.

Wait, but why would that happen? The person introduced the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the sequence starts with ATG (start), then the HA tag, then the GADD45G sequence.

Looking at the given DNA sequence, the very end is ...GAGTGA3'. So the mRNA would end with GAGUGA? No, wait, the DNA is plus strand, so the mRNA is the same as the plus strand, T→U. So the mRNA would have ...GAGUGA... but wait, the last three bases of the DNA are GAGTGA, so when converted to mRNA, the last three are UGA. So the mRNA would have ...UGA. So the mRNA would have a stop codon at the end, which is correct because the gene should end with a stop codon. So why can't the protein be expressed?

Wait, but looking at the DNA, perhaps I need to look for where the stop codon occurs. Let me see. So the plus strand sequence ends with ...GAGTGA. So the mRNA would end with ...GAGUGA, but the last three are UGA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, but maybe the problem is that the stop codon is in the middle of the sequence. Let me scan the entire DNA to see if there are any in-frame stop codons earlier.

Looking through the sequence for triplets that are TAA, TAG, or TGA in the DNA (since mRNA would be UAA, UAG, UGA).

Wait, maybe I should look for any occurrence of TGA in the DNA sequence. Let me scan the DNA.

Looking at the plus strand:

... TGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA ...

Wait, I see "GAGTGA" near the end. So the DNA has TGA in the coding sequence, which would be a stop codon in the mRNA. So the construct has a stop codon, which would terminate translation early.

Wait, but wait. The construct includes the coding sequence for the HA tag followed by GADD45G. If the stop codon is present, perhaps the mRNA includes it, causing the ribosome to stop early. So the protein would be truncated, which would prevent proper expression. Alternatively, maybe the stop codon is in the wrong place.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the stop codon is part of the original gene, but in the modified construct, it's placed in the wrong frame, causing the introduction of a premature stop.

Wait, but in this case, the given DNA sequence is the coding sequence (CDS), so including the stop codon at the end. So perhaps the construct includes an in-frame stop codon that's causing the protein to be cut short. But why would that happen?

Wait, maybe the person forgot to include a stop codon. No, because the sequence ends with a UGA, which is a stop codon. So the mRNA would have that, causing the ribosome to stop.

Wait, but the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So perhaps the stop codon is causing the ribosome to stop before the full-length protein is made.

Wait, but the GADD45G coding sequence should include its own stop codon. If the construct adds another stop codon after the HA tag, that might cause the protein to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein that's not functional—hence, no overexpression.

Wait, but wait. The HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the construct would be HA followed by GADD45G. If the HA tag is followed by GADD45G, then the stop codon comes after GADD45G. So the mRNA would have the HA, the GADD45G sequence, and then a stop codon, which is correct.

So why isn't the protein being expressed? Let me think about the sequence again. Looking at the end of the plus strand:

...CGAGTGA3'

So the mRNA would end with ...GAG UGA. So the stop codon is UGA.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the stop codon is in the wrong reading frame, but that's unlikely because the construct is designed for the HA tag and GADD45G.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is placed in a way that introduces an in-frame stop codon early in the sequence.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, typically YPYDHH (for the influenza HA). So the coding sequence would be something like ATG followed by the HA tag codons, then the GADD45G codons, and finally a stop codon.

But in the given DNA, perhaps the stop codon occurs before the end of the GADD45G sequence, causing the ribosome to stop early.

Wait, but looking at the sequence, the last part is the HA tag? Or is the HA tag at the beginning? The HA is at the N-terminus, so the sequence starts with ATG, then the HA, then GADD45G.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the person introduced an extra stop codon within the HA tag or the GADD45G sequence, which is causing the translation to terminate early.

So looking at the DNA sequence, maybe there's a premature stop codon within the coding sequence.

Let me scan the DNA for any TGA, TAG, or TAA sequences that could be in the coding frame.

Going through the sequence:

Looking for triplets in the plus strand:

- TAC CCATACG ATG TTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Looking for any triplet that is TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Hmm, let's go through each triplet:

Looking at the first part:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT ACG CCA AAT GAC TCT GGA AGA AGT CCG CGG CCA GGA CAC AGT TCC GGA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC C GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGT CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT G CTC ACT GCC GGC GT CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGT CTT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGC GTG AGG AGG AC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG AAG CAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC C TGC ACT GCA TCC TCA TTT CGA ACC CCA C GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GC CTT GGA G AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTC GCC AGC ATC ACC CCC CCG AGT GAG TGA

Wait, let me see specific spots. I notice a 'TGAGTGA' towards the end. Wait, let me break it into triplets:

...GAGTGAGTGA... Hmm, no. Let me see the exact ending: the last few triplets are 'TGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'.

Breaking into triplets:

- TGC GAG GAG AGC GCG AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CCC CCG AGT GAG TGA

Wait, looking for TGA in the triplet:

- The last triplet is AGT GAG TGA. Wait, no. The last nine nucleotides are CGAGTGA.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the triplet 'TGA' in the DNA sequence.

Looking through, I see:

...GCTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Looking for TGA:

Hmm, the sequence has 'CGAGTGA' as the last part. So the last triplet is AGT GAG TGA? Or is it the triplet TGA somewhere else?

Wait, the previous part is 'GAGTGA'. So in the plus strand, the last six nucleotides are GAGTGA. So the triplet before that would be CGAGTG.

Wait, maybe it's easier to look for 'TGA' as a triplet. So in the plus strand DNA, TGA would appear as TGA.

Looking through the sequence, I don't see any TGA except at the very end. So that's the only TGA. So the mRNA would have UGA as the stop codon.

So if the construct ends with UGA, that's appropriate as the stop codon. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the presence of the HA tag is causing the protein to be recognized as a signal peptide or something, leading to it being secreted instead of remaining in the cell, but that's more about protein localization, not expression levels.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mutation in the HA tag that causes the protein not to be expressed. Wait, the question says that you introduced the HA tag. Option A says the HA sequence has a missense mutation. If that's the case, the HA might not be correctly formed, but would that prevent expression?

Wait, but the problem is the inability to overexpress. If the HA tag is mutated, perhaps the protein is not expressed because the ribosome is terminating early. But in this case, the stop codon is at the end, so the protein would be full-length.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so any in-frame stop codon in the HA would cause premature termination. So let me check if the HA coding sequence has a stop codon.

The HA tag is typically a short sequence. Let me recall the amino acid sequence of the HA tag. The HA tag is derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. The commonly used HA tag is YPYDHH, which is encoded by the DNA sequence ATG TAC CAT ATC GAT GGT CCA GAT TAC GCA CCA TTA GCT AGA GAA GAA GAA GCT GCG GCC AGA CAC AGT TCC GGA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGG AGT TGC TGC TGC TCG GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC TCA CTC ACT GCC GGC GTG CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGT CTT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AAA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGC GTG AGG AGG AC CAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG AAG CAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GCG GCC GCG GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GCG GAC C TGC ACT GCA TCC TCA TTT CGA ACC CCA C GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GC CTT GGA G AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTC GCC AGC ATC ACC CCC CCG AGT GAG TGA.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the HA tag's DNA sequence. The HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDHH. The DNA coding for Y is TAC, P is CCA, Y is TAC, D is GAT, H is CAT, H is CAT. So the coding sequence for YPYDHH would be TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT CCA. Wait, but let me check the beginning of the given DNA sequence.

The given DNA starts with ATG TAC CCATACG ATG TTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the initial part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT ACG CCA AAT GAC TCT GGA AGA AGT CCG CGG CCA GGA CAC AGT TCC GGA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC C GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGT CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT G CTC ACT GCC GGC GT CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGT CTT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGC GTG AGG AGG AC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG AAG CAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC C TGC ACT GCA TCC TCA TTT CGA ACC CCA C GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GC CTT GGA G AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTC GCC AGC ATC ACC CCC CCG AGT GAG TGA.

Wait, the first part: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT ACG CCA AAT GAC TCT GGA AGA AGT CCG CGG CCA GGA CAC AGT TCC GGA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC C GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGT CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT G CTC ACT GCC GGC GT CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGT CTT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGC GTG AGG AGG AC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG AAG CAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC C TGC ACT GCA TCC TCA TTT CGA ACC CCA C GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GC CTT GGA G AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTC GCC AGC ATC ACC CCC CCG AGT GAG TGA.

Wait, the HA tag's DNA sequence is supposed to code for YPYDHH. So the first part after ATG is TAC (Y), then CCA (P), then TAC (Y), then GAT (D), then CAT (H), then CAT (H). So the initial sequence should be ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT CAT CAT... but looking at the given DNA, after ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT comes GTC CAG ATT ACG CCA AAT, which doesn't match the expected HA tag sequence.

Wait, that can't be right. The HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, so the initial part should be the HA coding sequence. But in the given DNA, after ATG, the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), then GTC (Val) instead of CAT (H). Oh, wait, in the given DNA, after the initial ATG TAC (Y) CCA (P) TAC (Y) GAT (D), the next codon is GTC, which is Val, but according to the HA tag, the next should be CAT (H). So that's a problem.

Ah, so the HA tag's coding sequence is incorrect. Instead of CAT (H), it's GTC (Val). So that's a missense mutation in the HA sequence. So the HA tag is messed up, but how does that affect protein expression?

Wait, but the construct includes the HA tag followed by GADD45G. If the HA tag has a mutation, perhaps the ribosome can still translate the entire protein, but the HA tag is incorrect. But the question is about overexpression. Alternatively, perhaps the ribosome is terminating early because of a stop codon introduced due to the mutation.

Wait, no. The HA tag is at the start, so a mutation in it shouldn't introduce a stop codon unless the mutation creates a stop codon. Let's see: the HA tag's expected DNA is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT CAT CAT ... but in the given sequence, it's ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC ... So the fifth codon after ATG is GAT (aspartic acid, D), which is correct. The next codon is GTC, which is Val (V), but according to HA, it should be CAT (H). So that's a substitution from CAT to GTC. So the triplet is GAT GTC instead of GAT CAT.

Wait, no. Wait, the HA sequence is YPYDHH. So the DNA sequence after ATG should be TAC (Y) CCA (P) TAC (Y) GAT (D) CAT (H) CAT (H). But in the given DNA, after GAT comes GTC, not CAT. So the fifth codon is GTC (Val) instead of CAT (His). That's a missense mutation in the HA tag.

So the HA tag is supposed to be YPYDHH, but it's YPYDvH (if V is at position 6). Wait, no. The HA tag is Y-P-Y-D-H-H. So the fifth amino acid is H, which is CAT in DNA. But in the given DNA, it's GTC, which is Val (V). So that's a mutation in the HA tag. So the HA would be YPYDvH instead of YPYDHH, but that's a missense mutation (changed from His to Val). So that would make the HA tag incorrect, perhaps not allowing the protein to be recognized for purification, but why would it prevent expression?

Wait, but the question is about overexpression. If the HA tag is messed up, the affinity purification might not work, but the protein should still be expressed, just not tag properly. But the problem is the inability to overexpress the protein. So perhaps the mutation in the HA tag causes a problem, but I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, maybe the mutation introduced a stop codon. Let me check: the DNA triplet is GTC. In mRNA, that would be GUC, which codes for Val. So it's not a stop codon.

So the HA tag is mutated from His to Val, but that shouldn't cause the ribosome to stop. So why can't the protein be expressed?

Looking back at the options:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

This is true, as the HA tag has a Val instead of His. But does this prevent overexpression?

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is at the N-terminus, and the mutation doesn't affect expression. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, perhaps the presence of the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early. No, the ribosome would read through as long as there's no stop codon.

Wait, going back to the DNA sequence—the very end. The last triplet is TGA, which is a stop codon. So the mRNA ends with UGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would stop there, meaning the protein is correctly terminated. So why isn't it expressed?

Wait, another thought: maybe the stop codon is in the wrong reading frame. But no, the HA tag and GADD45G are in the same reading frame.

Wait, perhaps the construct is missing a necessary element, like a Kozak sequence or a proper ribosome binding site. But the question says that they used Lipofectamine to transfect into CHO cells, so perhaps the promoter is working. Alternatively, perhaps the lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. Option C says the lack of linker is causing proteolysis of the nascent chain.

Hmm, proteolysis would degrade the protein, making it difficult to detect. If the HA tag is at the N-terminus and the protein is being degraded, perhaps the construct isn't stable. But why would the lack of a linker cause that? A linker usually refers to a short amino acid sequence between domains, like between the tag and the protein. If the HA tag is directly fused to GADD45G without a linker, perhaps proteases can cleave between them. But in the given DNA, the HA is directly followed by GADD45G, so no linker. So the resulting protein would be HA followed immediately by GADD45G. But does that cause proteolysis? Maybe if the tag and protein are causing a recognition site for proteases.

But in this case, the main issue is the absence of overexpression. If the protein is being made but rapidly degraded, it might not accumulate enough to be detected.

Another possibility is that the HA tag is causing the protein to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum or secreted, but that's more about localization.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct didn't include an appropriate poly-A tail or other elements necessary for mRNA stability. But the question doesn't mention that.

Wait, but looking back at the given DNA sequence, the very end is ...GAGTGA. So the mRNA ends with ...GAGUGA. The last three nucleotides are UGA, which is a stop codon. So the mRNA is correctly terminated.

Wait, but perhaps the presence of UGA in the mRNA is causing a problem. In some organisms, a UGA codon can be read as selenocysteine if a specific context is present, but CHO cells are mammalian and don't typically incorporate selenocysteine unless a special construct is made. So perhaps the UGA is being read as a stop codon, which is correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B says the ribosome terminated early, which would result in a truncated protein. But in the given DNA, the stop codon is at the end, so the ribosome wouldn't terminate early. Unless there is an in-frame stop codon earlier.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag has a stop codon in the middle. Let me check the HA coding sequence again. The HA tag's DNA sequence in the construct is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT... Wait, the HA tag should be ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT CAT CAT ... but in the given DNA, after GAT comes GTC, which is Val. So that's a mutation (Val instead of His). But that's not a stop codon.

Wait, but perhaps the mutation introduced a stop codon elsewhere. Let's see: the DNA sequence after the HA tag is GTC CAG ATT ACG CCA AAT GAC TCT GGA AGA AGT CCG CGG CCA GGA CAC AGT TCC GGA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC C GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGT CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT G CTC ACT GCC GGC GT CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGT CTT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGC GTG AGG AGG AC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG AAG CAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC C TGC ACT GCA TCC TCA TTT CGA ACC CCA C GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GC CTT GGA G AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTC GCC AGC ATC ACC CCC CCG AGT GAG TGA.

Wait, looking through this, is there any in-frame stop codon before the end?

Let me scan for TAA, TAG, or TGA triplets in the DNA (which would be UAA, UAG, UGA in mRNA).

Looking for triplets:

- ...TAC CCATACG ATG TTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for any TGA in the DNA. I see it only at the very end.

So the only stop codon is at the end.

So why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, another possibility: the codon usage in the construct is not optimal for CHO cells. Perhaps the codons are not preferred, leading to low expression. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid lacks an origin of replication or other necessary elements for expression in CHO cells. But the question says they transfected with Lipofectamine and selected for colonies, implying that the plasmid has an antibiotic resistance gene.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is B: the ribosome terminated early. But I don't see an early stop codon. Unless I'm missing one.

Wait, perhaps the plus strand has a stop codon earlier. Let me double-check.

Looking through the DNA again for any TGA, TAG, TAA triplets.

Hmm, perhaps I missed one earlier. Let me look.

Wait, the sequence includes 'TCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'.

Hmm, I don't see any TGA, TAG, or TAA triplets except at the end. So the ribosome shouldn't terminate early.

Another thought: the given DNA sequence is for the plus strand, but perhaps the correct coding sequence should be on the other strand. Wait, no, the plus strand is the coding strand.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the stop codon is in the wrong reading frame. For example, if the DNA has a frameshift, causing the stop codon to appear earlier. But the question states that the construct was modified by introducing the HA tag, so perhaps the reading frame is correct.

Wait, but the given DNA has the HA tag, then GADD45G, then a stop codon. So if the HA tag is in frame, then GADD45G should be as well.

So, going back, the only thing I can find is that the HA tag has a missense mutation (Val instead of His). So option A says that. But would that prevent overexpression?

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate. But why would a single amino acid substitution do that?

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is part of a signal peptide. If the HA tag is part of a signal sequence that directs the protein to the secretory pathway, but without the correct sequence, the protein might not be properly targeted, leading to degradation. But that's more about localization, not expression levels.

Wait, the question is about overexpression. If the HA tag is mutated, perhaps the protein is not being secreted and thus isn't detected in the cell. But the question says the issue is that the protein can't be overexpressed, implying that it's not being made in the first place.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's mutation introduces a premature stop codon in the mRNA. But looking at the DNA, the HA tag's codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTC (V), etc. None of those are stop codons. So the only stop codon is at the end.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the HA tag's mutation causes the ribosome to stall, leading to the mRNA being degraded. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid doesn't have a promoter, but the question says they transfected it into cells, implying that the construct has a promoter.

Wait, another angle: the construct includes the HA tag followed by GADD45G, but perhaps the GADD45G sequence has a premature stop codon. Looking through the DNA sequence, perhaps I missed one.

Wait, looking at the DNA after the HA tag, the first part is GTC CAG ATT... Let me translate that into amino acids:

GTC is Val, CAG is Gln, ATT is Ile, etc. So that's part of the GADD45G sequence. Do any of these codons form a stop codon? No, because the mRNA would have GUC, CAG, AUC, etc., none of which are stop codons.

Wait, perhaps the entire construct is in the wrong reading frame. Let me check the initial ATG. The first codon is ATG, which is correct. The next codons are TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTC, etc. So the reading frame is correct.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option D says the tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, but the stop codon is UGA, not UAA. So that wouldn't apply.

Option C: The lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. If the HA tag is directly fused to GADD45G, perhaps the linker is missing, making the protein susceptible to proteolysis. But why would that prevent overexpression? If the protein is made but rapidly degraded, it wouldn't accumulate enough to be detected. But the question says the protein isn't overexpressed, implying it's not being made.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing the protein to be recognized as foreign and leading to degradation. But that's more about immunogenicity, not expression.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early. But as per the mRNA, the stop codon is at the end.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag is placed in the wrong orientation. But the question says it's at the N-terminus, so the coding sequence is correct.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the HA tag's mutation introduces a stop codon when considering the mRNA's reading frame. Let me think: The DNA has GTC, which is Val. In mRNA, it's GUC. So no stop codon. The fifth codon after ATG is GUC (Val), but it should have been CAT (His). So that's a missense mutation but not a stop codon.

Wait, maybe the HA tag's mutation creates a cryptic splice site or something, but that's more about mRNA processing.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in the HA tag introduces a stop codon in the reverse complement. Let me think: the DNA has GTC. The reverse complement would be GAC, which is Asp in DNA. Not a stop codon.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me think about each option again.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. That's true, but how does that prevent overexpression? It would lead to a mutated HA tag but shouldn't prevent the protein from being expressed.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. But the mRNA doesn't have any stop codons before the end, so this shouldn't happen.

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. If the HA is directly fused, perhaps the protein is getting degraded. But that would lead to low levels, not a complete lack of expression.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. But the stop codon is UGA, so D is irrelevant.

So the only possible option left is A, but I'm not completely convinced. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early. But looking at the mRNA, the only stop codon is at the end.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's mutation causes a frameshift, introducing an early stop codon. How would that happen? Let me see: the HA tag is supposed to be 6xHis or similar, but in this case, it's a different HA tag.

Wait, the HA tag's correct DNA is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT CAT CAT GGT CCA GAT TAC GCA CCA TTA GCT AGA GAA GAA GAA GCT GCG GCC AGA CAC AGT TCC GGA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGG AGT TGC TGC TGC TCG GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC TCA CTC ACT GCC GGC GTG CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGT CTT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AAA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGC GTG AGG AGG AC CAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG AAG CAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GCG GCC GCG GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GCG GAC C TGC ACT GCA TCC TCA TTT CGA ACC CCA C GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GC CTT GGA G AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTC GCC AGC ATC ACC CCC CCG AGT GAG TGA.

Wait, in the given DNA, the HA tag is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT... So after the initial ATG, the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTC (V), CAG (Q), ATT (I), etc. So the fifth codon is GTC (Val) instead of CAT (His). So that's a substitution from His to Val. So the HA tag has a mutation, but the rest of the sequence continues as GADD45G.

So the HA tag is still in frame, and the GADD45G is correctly expressed. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the HA tag's coding sequence was not correctly included, leading to a frameshift. But the given sequence doesn't show any frameshift; the reading frame remains correct.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is not followed by the correct start codon for GADD45G. But the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the start codon is at the beginning.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's mutation creates a stop codon in the wrong reading frame. Let me think: the HA tag's DNA is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT... which is in the correct reading frame. The corresponding mRNA would be TAC CCA TAC GAT GUC CAG ATT... which doesn't include a stop codon.

I'm really stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The fact that the HA tag's DNA has a missense mutation (option A) is correct. But does that explain the lack of overexpression? I'm not sure, but it's the only option that directly relates to the DNA sequence problem I noticed.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's mutation causes the ribosome to terminate early because the Val is a stop codon in some contexts. No, because Val's codon is GUC or GUA or GUG. UGA is a stop codon, but that's not the same as the Val codon.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's mutation introduces a stop codon when considering the DNA's complementary strand. Let me check: the DNA has GTC, which is Val. The complementary strand would be CAG, which is Gln. Not a stop codon.

Wait, maybe the person forgot to include the stop codon after the HA tag, but the given DNA ends with UGA, so that's included.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the HA tag is in the wrong phase, causing the GADD45G sequence to be out of frame. But the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so it's in the same frame.

I think the only plausible option is A: the HA sequence has a missense mutation. So the correct answer is A.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein is not working as expected. The construct includes the coding sequence for GADD45G with an N-terminal HA tag and a stop codon at the end. The provided DNA sequence shows that the HA tag is incorrectly encoded, with a missense mutation where a Val (GTC) is substituted for the expected His (CAT). This mutation does not introduce a stop codon but alters the HA tag's sequence. The rest of the construct appears to be in frame, with no additional stop codons or frameshifts identified in the coding sequence.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.**  
   This is correct. The HA tag's DNA sequence shows a mutation where Val (GTC) replaces His (CAT), resulting in a missense mutation. While this does not introduce a stop codon, it alters the HA tag, which could affect downstream applications like affinity purification. However, this mutation alone does not explain the complete lack of protein expression.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.**  
   This is incorrect. The mRNA sequence does not contain any in-frame stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) before the end of the coding sequence. The only stop codon is at the very end (UGA), so the ribosome would not terminate early.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.**  
   This is unlikely. The absence of a linker between the HA tag and GADD45G might make the protein susceptible to proteolysis, but this would result in degradation of the protein rather than a complete lack of expression. The question specifies that the protein is not being overexpressed, implying it is not being made in sufficient quantities.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.**  
   This is irrelevant. The stop codon in the mRNA is UGA, not UAA, so the lack of a tRNA for UAA does not affect translation.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is **Option A**, as the missense mutation in the HA tag could interfere with the construct's expression or stability. While the mutation does not directly cause a stop codon or frameshift, it may indirectly affect the expression of the protein, leading to the observed lack of overexpression.

**Answer: A**
