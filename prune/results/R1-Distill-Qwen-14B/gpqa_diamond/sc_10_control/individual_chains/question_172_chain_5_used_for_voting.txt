Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the energy levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let's try to think this through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium, which is what LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) implies.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature. But wait, in this case, both stars are looking at the same energy levels, so maybe g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars? Or perhaps the ratio g_upper/g_lower is the same, so when we take the ratio of excitation for star_1 and star_2, that part cancels out.

So the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So for the same transition, the ratio n_upper/n_lower in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let me write that down.

Let’s denote the excitation ratio for star_1 as R1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1, and for star_2 as R2 = n_upper2 / n_lower2. The question says R1 = 2 * R2.

From the Boltzmann equation, R = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). But since the same transition is being considered, g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars, so their ratio is a constant. So R1/R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) + ΔE/(k T_2) ), because R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))]/[exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp(ΔE/(k)(1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )? Wait, let me make sure.

Wait, R1 = (g) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), R2 = (g) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). So R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k))(1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) because when you divide them, the exponents subtract.

So R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ). Since R1 = 2 R2, R1/R2 = 2.

So 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) 

Wait, but let me rearrange that. Let me write it as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Hmm, that's interesting. So the equation becomes ln(2) equals (ΔE/(k)) multiplied by (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

But wait, the question gives us ΔE as 1.38e-23 J, but I don't think ΔE is needed because the answer options don't have any terms with actual numbers except for the ln(2) term.

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Wait, but our equation has (ΔE/k) times that fraction. However, the options don't show any ΔE or k terms. So I must have made a mistake in my approach. Wait, wait—maybe I should have thought about it differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the ratio of excitation temperatures or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relation without considering the energy, but somehow assuming that the energy difference is the same. Hmm.

Wait another approach. The excitation depends on the ratio of populations in two energy levels. If the ratio R1/R2 is 2, then from the Boltzmann equation:

R1 = (g) exp(−ΔE/(k T1))

R2 = (g) exp(−ΔE/(k T2))

So R1/R2 = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) 

Wait that's correct. So ln(R1/R2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)

But R1/R2 is 2, so ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, let me rearrange the terms inside the parenthesis:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But the answer options don't have any other terms except ln(2) equal to some expression. So the problem must have simplified this equation in some way.

Wait, maybe the question assumes that the energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars, so it's a constant. But that doesn't directly help unless we can factor it out.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be written as:

(ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But the options don't have ΔE or k. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the ratio of the populations in a way that allows me to ignore the ΔE and k terms.

Wait, maybe I should consider the ratio of the excitation temperatures. Let me think. The excitation temperature is such that for a given level, the ratio depends on exp(-ΔE/(kTexc)), but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the energy difference is given, but the options don't have any numerical values, only T1 and T2. So I must have made a mistake in my approach because the options don't include the ΔE term.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. Wait, the excitation is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2 for the same energy level. So maybe the ratio is different. Let's re-express.

Let’s denote the excitation ratio as R = n_upper / n_lower. For star 1, R1 = 2 R2.

From Boltzmann: R = (g) exp(−ΔE/(k T))

So R1 = (g) exp(−ΔE/(k T1))
R2 = (g) exp(−ΔE/(k T2))

Taking the ratio R1/R2 = exp[ (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ]

So 2 = exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]

Taking natural log:
ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be rewritten as:
ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

But none of the options have the ΔE/(k) factor. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, but the problem says that the energy difference between the considered levels is 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that's exactly the value of k, the Boltzmann constant. Because k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait! ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k (Boltzmann constant).

So ΔE = k. So substituting that into the equation:

ln(2) = (k/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

Simplifies to:
ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, that's option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Yes, that makes sense because when ΔE equals k, it cancels out the k in the denominator, leaving just the ratio with T1 and T2.

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation governs the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels, given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratio is given as \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \), where \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) are the excitation ratios for star_1 and star_2, respectively.

Taking the ratio of the Boltzmann equations for the two stars:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since \( R_1 / R_2 = 2 \), we have:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting the terms inside the parentheses:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The problem states that \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which is equal to the Boltzmann constant \( k \). Substituting \( \Delta E = k \) into the equation simplifies it to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options do not align with the derived equation. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**

Or perhaps the ratio g_upper/g_lower is the same, so when we take the ratio of excitation for star_1 and star_2, that part cancels out.

So the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So for the same transition, the ratio n_upper/n_lower in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let me write that down.

Let’s denote the excitation ratio for star_1 as R1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1, and for star_2 as R2 = n_upper2 / n_lower2. The question says R1 = 2 * R2.

From the Boltzmann equation, R = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). But since the same transition is being considered, g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars, so their ratio is a constant. So R1/R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) + ΔE/(k T_2) ), because R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))]/[exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp(ΔE/(k)(1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )? Wait, let me make sure.

Wait, R1 = (g) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), R2 = (g) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). So R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k))(1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) because when you divide them, the exponents subtract.

So R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ). Since R1 = 2 R2, R1/R2 = 2.

So 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) 

Wait, but let me rearrange that. Let me write it as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Hmm, that's interesting. So the equation becomes ln(2) equals (ΔE/(k)) multiplied by (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait that's correct. So ln(R1/R2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)

But R1/R2 is 2, so ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, let me rearrange the terms inside the parenthesis:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )
