Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that an atom has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it has decayed. That means the probability of it not decaying, the survival probability, is 100% - 32% = 68%. 

Wait, but radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? So the decay process is memoryless, which means the probability of decaying in the next interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So if 50 minutes have gone by and it hasn't decayed yet, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes... Hmm, wait, no, no. Wait, let me read the question again.

Oh wait, the question says that we start monitoring right away, and 50 minutes have passed without decay. Now, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. So the total time from now would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, no, the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed. So the time in consideration is 150 minutes from now, after 50 minutes have already gone by. So the total possible time is 200 minutes.

But wait, the initial data is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. I need to find the decay probability in 150 minutes, but given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Or wait, that's the same as considering the probability from time 0 to time 200, but given that it hasn't decayed until time 50. Because of the memoryless property, the probability is the same as if it had just started, but the time considered is 150 minutes. Hmm, no, wait.

Wait, the decay probability is given for 100 minutes. So I should probably model this using the decay constant.

Let me recall the decay formula. The survival probability after time t is given by P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. The decay probability is 1 - P(t).

We know that in 100 minutes, the decay probability is 32%, so P(100) = 0.68. So 0.68 = e^(-λ * 100). Taking natural log on both sides: ln(0.68) = -λ *100. So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Let me calculate that. ln(0.68) is approximately what? Well, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7, so ln(0.68) would be about -0.3857. So λ ≈ 0.3857 / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Now, the question is, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So the probability that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is P(50) = e^(-λ *50). But we don't need to calculate that, because the process is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval, regardless of prior time.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. So the time considered is 150 minutes. So the decay probability in that time would be 1 - e^(-λ *150).

So let's calculate that. First, compute λ *150 = (0.003857) *150 ≈ 0.57855.

So e^(-0.57855) ≈ approximately? Let's think. e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488. 0.57855 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me approximate it. The value at 0.57855 would be about e^-0.57855 ≈ approximately 0.561.

So 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or about 44%. Looking at the options, option A is 44%. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the probabilities. Because the initial given probability is 32% in 100 minutes, so maybe I should calculate based on that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this using the fact that the decay probability in time t is 1 - e^(-λt) = 32% when t=100. So let's get λ correctly.

We have 1 - e^(-λ *100) = 0.32 → e^(-100λ) = 0.68 → -100λ = ln(0.68) → λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Compute ln(0.68) numerically: ln(0.68) ≈ -0.385662. So λ ≈ (0.385662)/100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

Now, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Compute λ *150 = 0.00385662 *150 ≈ 0.578493.

So e^(-0.578493) ≈ let me compute. Using a calculator if I had one, but roughly, e^-0.5 is 0.6065, e^-0.6 is 0.5488. Since 0.578 is 0.078 above 0.5. Let's approximate the value.

We can use a linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6.

The difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1 in x, and the change in e^-x is from 0.6065 to 0.5488, a decrease of about 0.0577 over 0.1 x.

So 0.578 is 0.078 above 0.5. So the change from x=0.5 is 0.078. The slope is -0.577 per 0.1 x. So slope is -5.77 per unit x.

Wait, that's probably not the best way. Alternatively, perhaps use the Taylor expansion around x=0.5.

Let me think. Let me let x =0.5, and we want to find e^-(0.5 + 0.078) = e^-0.5 * e^-0.078.

We know e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065.

e^-0.078 ≈ 1 -0.078 + (0.078)^2/2 -... Approximately, 0.078 is small. So 1 -0.078 + (0.00608)/2 ≈ 1-0.078 + 0.00304 ≈ 0.92504.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, e^-a ≈ 1 -a + a²/2, for small a.

So a is 0.078. So e^-0.078 ≈ 1 -0.078 + (0.078)^2 / 2.

(0.078)^2 = 0.006084. Divided by 2 is 0.003042.

So 1 -0.078 = 0.922 + 0.003042 = 0.925042.

So e^-0.578 ≈ e^-0.5 * e^-0.078 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.925042 ≈ 

Let me calculate that. 0.6 * 0.925 is 0.555. 0.0065 *0.925 is approx 0.006. So total ≈ 0.555 +0.006 = 0.561.

So e^-0.578 is about 0.561. So 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, so 43.9% approximately, which is about 44%. So the answer would be option A.

But wait the options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%. So option A is 44%, which is our calculation.

Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct?

Another approach: the decay is exponential, so the number of decays is independent of previous time. So the 50 minutes that have passed without decay don't affect the probability because the decay is memoryless. So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute period starting from now. So I can compute it directly.

Another way: the initial given probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So the decay constant λ is such that 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. So we can find the probability for 150 minutes as 1 - e^(-λ*150).

We can compute λ from the first equation:

λ = ( - ln (1 - 0.32) ) / 100 = (ln(0.68)) / 100. Wait, wait, no: 1 - e^{-100λ} =0.32 → e^{-100λ}=0.68 → -100λ= ln(0.68) → λ = (- ln(0.68))/100.

So λ is positive. So λ ≈ 0.00385662 per minute, as computed earlier.

So yes, the calculation I did earlier holds.

So the correct answer is 44%, which is option A.

The problem involves determining the probability that a radioactive atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. Radioactive decay follows an exponential law, which is memoryless, meaning the probability of decay in a future interval depends only on the time remaining, not on how much time has already passed.

The decay probability within 100 minutes is given as 32%, so the survival probability after 100 minutes is:

\[
P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Using the survival probability formula \( P(t) = e^{-\lambda t} \), we can solve for the decay constant \( \lambda \):

\[
0.68 = e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} \implies \ln(0.68) = -\lambda \cdot 100 \implies \lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Approximating \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3857 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3857}{100} \approx 0.003857 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. The survival probability for 150 minutes is:

\[
P(150) = e^{-\lambda \cdot 150} \implies e^{-0.003857 \cdot 150} \approx e^{-0.57855}
\]

Using approximations for \( e^{-0.57855} \), we find:

\[
e^{-0.57855} \approx 0.561
\]

Thus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:

\[
1 - P(150) = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439 \, \text{or approximately 44%.}
\]

Since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the 50 minutes that have already passed. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**

Now, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Compute λ *150 = 0.00385662 *150 ≈ 0.578493.

So e^(-0.578493) ≈ let me compute. Using a calculator if I had one, but roughly, e^-0.5 is 0.6065, e^-0.6 is 0.5488. Since 0.578 is 0.078 above 0.5. Let's approximate the value.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, e^-a ≈ 1 -a + a²/2, for small a.

So a is 0.078. So e^-0.078 ≈ 1 -0.078 + (0.078)^2 / 2.

(0.078)^2 = 0.006084. Divided by 2 is 0.003042.

So 1 -0.078 = 0.922 + 0.003042 = 0.925042.

So e^-0.578 ≈ e^-0.5 * e^-0.078 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.925042 ≈

Radioactive decay follows an exponential law, which is memoryless, meaning the probability of decay in a future interval depends only on the time remaining, not on how much time has already passed.

The decay probability within 100 minutes is given as 32%, so the survival probability after 100 minutes is:

\[
P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Using the survival probability formula \( P(t) = e^{-\lambda t} \), we can solve for the decay constant \( \lambda \):

\[
0.68 = e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} \implies \ln(0.68) = -\lambda \cdot 100 \implies \lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Approximating \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3857 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3857}{100} \approx 0.003857 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. The survival probability for 150 minutes is:

\[
P(150) = e^{-\lambda \cdot 150} \implies e^{-0.003857 \cdot 150} \approx e^{-0.57855}
\]

Using approximations for \( e^{-0.57855} \), we find:

\[
e^{-0.57855} \approx 0.561
\]

Thus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:

\[
1 - P(150) = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439 \, \text{or approximately 44%.}
\]

Since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the 50 minutes that have already passed. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
