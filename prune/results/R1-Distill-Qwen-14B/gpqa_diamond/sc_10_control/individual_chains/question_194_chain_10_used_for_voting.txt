Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the partition function Z for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3]. Hmm, I remember that the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). 

Wait, each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. But maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8. I think I can group the states by their energies to make it easier.

The energy expression is -J times the sum of the products of each pair. Let's denote each term S_i S_j as their product. Since each S can be ±1, each product is ±1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can vary. I need to find all possible values of this sum and how many states have each value.

Let me think about the possible values. Let's denote the sum as H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Each term is ±1, so H can be something like 3 (if all products are +1), 1, -1, or -3? Let me check.

Wait, for three spins, what combinations are possible?

Let me try to find all possible H values and the number of states for each.

Case 1: All three pairs are +1. So S1=S2, S2=S3, so all three spins are the same. So either all are +1 or all are -1. Then H = 1 +1 +1 =3. How many states here? For all +1, there's 1 state. For all -1, another state. So two states with H=3.

Case 2: Two pairs are +1, one pair is -1. Wait, is that possible? Let's see. Suppose S1 and S2 are same, S1 and S3 are same, but S2 and S3 are different. Wait, that can't happen because if S1=S2 and S1=S3, then S2=S3, so their product is +1. So maybe this case can't happen. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find all possible H for each state and count them.

Each spin configuration (S1, S2, S3) can be any combination of +1 and -1. Let's list all 8 possibilities and compute H for each.

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   H = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3. So E = -J * 3.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   H = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   H = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   H = (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 -1 +1 = 1. E = -J*(1) = -J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1. E = J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   H = (1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 -1 -1 = -3? Wait, wait, let's compute each term.

Wait, for state S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:

H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3
= (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)
= 1 + (-1) + (-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Wait that's H = -1. So E = J? Then E would be J, but wait, let me compute again.

Wait S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:

S1S2 is (-1)(-1) = 1.

S1S3 is (-1)(+1) = -1.

S2S3 is (-1)(+1) = -1.

So sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

So H = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, but that's the same as earlier cases. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check another case.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   H = (1) + (1) + (1) = 3. So E = -3J.

Wait, so let's see all 8 cases:

1. H=3 → E = -3J → occurs in cases 1 and 8. So 2 states.

2. H = -1 → E = J → occurs in cases 2,3,4,5,6,7. Hmm, how many? Let me count:

Case 2: yes, H=-1.

Case 3: yes.

Case4: yes.

Case5: yes.

Case6: yes.

Case7: yes.

So 6 states where H=-1.

Wait, but wait, what about case 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:

H = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1. So yes, H=-1.

So in total, 6 states with H=-1 and 2 states with H=3.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me tally:

Number of states with H=3: 2.

Number with H=-1: 6.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about case 4, I thought H=1. Did I make a mistake?

Wait in case 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1*-1) + (1*-1) + (-1*-1) = (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.

So H=-1.

So yeah, all 6 states have H=-1, and 2 have H=3.

Wait, but wait another thought—did I miss any other possible H values? Like, are there any cases where H is +1 or -3?

Wait, for H=3, it's when all three pairs are +1, which only happens when all spins are the same. So that gives two states.

H=-3 would be when all three pairs are -1. Let's see if that's possible.

Suppose S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

H = (1*-1) + (1*1) + (-1*1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1. So that's H=-1.

Wait, what if all pairs are -1? Let's see: S1S2 = -1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.

So S1S2 = -1 → S1 = -S2.

S1S3 = -1 → S1 = -S3.

S2S3 = -1 → S2 = -S3.

So from S1 = -S2 and S1 = -S3, we get S2 = S3.

Then S2 = -S3 → S2 = -S2 → which implies S2=0, but the spins are ±1. So this is impossible.

So H cannot be -3. Therefore, the possible H values are 3 and -1. So each state has either H=3 (2 states) or H=-1 (6 states).

So the energies for each state are:

E = -J * H.

So for H=3: E = -3J.

For H=-1: E = J.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E).

But I can group them by their energy:

Z = (number of states with E=-3J) * exp(3J β) + (number of states with E=J) * exp(-J β).

Wait, because -β E for E=-3J is -β*(-3J) = 3 J β.

Similarly, E=J → -β J → exponent is exp(-β J).

So number of states with E=-3J is 2, and each contributes exp(3 J β).

Number of states with E=J is 6, each contributes exp(-J β).

Wait, wait, no: wait E=J comes from H=-1, and each such state contributes exp(-β E) = exp(-β * J).

Wait, so Z = 2 exp(3 J β) + 6 exp(-J β).

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^(-3Jβ) + 6 e^{Jβ} → No, because our terms are 3Jβ and -Jβ.

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-J β} → Yes, that's what I have.

Option B is Z = 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-J β}, which matches.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A: Z= 2 e^(-3J\beta)+6e^(J\beta)

Option B: 2 e^(3Jβ) +6e^(-Jβ)

So I think B is correct.

To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Expression**: The energy depends on the sum \( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \). Since each \( S_i \) is \( \pm 1 \), each term \( S_iS_j \) is also \( \pm 1 \), so \( H \) can take values \( 3, -1 \), or \( -3 \). However, \( H = -3 \) is impossible because it would require all pairs \( S_iS_j \) to be \( -1 \), which is not possible for three spins.

2. **Possible States**:
   - **Case 1: \( H = 3 \)**  
     This occurs when all spins are the same, i.e., either \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = +1 \) or \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = -1 \). There are 2 such states.
   - **Case 2: \( H = -1 \)**  
     This occurs when two spins are the same and one is different. There are 6 such states.

3. **Energy Values**:
   - For \( H = 3 \), \( E = -J \cdot 3 = -3J \).
   - For \( H = -1 \), \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

4. **Partition Function**:  
   The partition function is given by \( Z = \sum_{\text{states}} e^{-\beta E} \). Grouping states by their energy:
   - For \( H = 3 \) (2 states): Each contributes \( e^{-\beta (-3J)} = e^{3J\beta} \).
   - For \( H = -1 \) (6 states): Each contributes \( e^{-\beta J} \).

   Thus,  
   \[
   Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
   \]

### Matching with Options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \)  
  Incorrect, as the exponents are reversed.
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \)  
  Correct, matches the derived expression.
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \)  
  Incorrect, as the exponents are incorrect.
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \)  
  Incorrect, as the coefficients and exponents are wrong.

### Final Answer:
The correct partition function is \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the partition function Z for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3]. Hmm, I remember that the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). 

Wait, each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. But maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8. I think I can group the states by their energies to make it easier.

The energy expression is -J times the sum of the products of each pair. Let's denote each term S_i S_j as their product. Since each S can be ±1, each product is ±1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can vary. I need to find all possible values of this sum and how many states have each value.

Let me think about the possible values. Let's denote the sum as H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Each term is ±1, so H can be something like 3 (if all products are +1), 1, -1, or -3? Let me check.

Wait, for three spins, what combinations are possible?

Let me try to find all possible H values and the number of states for each.

Case 1: All three pairs are +1. So S1=S2, S2=S3, so all three spins are the same. So either all are +1 or all are -1. Then H = 1 +1 +1 =3. How many states here? For all +1, there's 1 state. For all -1, another state. So two states with H=3.

Case 2: Two pairs are +1, one pair is -1. Wait, is that possible? Let's see. Suppose S1 and S2 are same, S1 and S3 are same, but S2 and S3 are different. Wait, that can't happen because if S1=S2 and S1=S3, then S2=S3, so their product is +1. So maybe this case can't happen. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find all possible H for each state and count them.

Each spin configuration (S1, S2, S3) can be any combination of +1 and -1. Let's list all 8 possibilities and compute H for each.

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   H = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3. So E = -J * 3.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   H = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   H = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   H = (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 -1 +1 = 1. E = -J*(1) = -J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1. E = J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   H = (1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 -1 -1 = -3? Wait, wait, let's compute each term.

Wait, for state S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:

H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3
= (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)
= 1 + (-1) + (-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Wait that's H = -1. So E = J? Then E would be J, but wait, let me compute again.

Wait S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:

S1S2 is (-1)(-1) = 1.

S1S3 is (-1)(+1) = -1.

S2S3 is (-1)(+1) = -1.

So sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

So H = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, but that's the same as earlier cases. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check another case.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   H = (1) + (1) + (1) = 3. So E = -3J.

Wait, so let's see all 8 cases:

1. H=3 → E = -3J → occurs in cases 1 and 8. So 2 states.

2. H = -1 → E = J → occurs in cases 2,3,4,5,6,7. Hmm, how many? Let me count:

Case 2: yes, H=-1.

Case 3: yes.

Case4: yes.

Case5: yes.

Case6: yes.

Case7: yes.

So 6 states where H=-1.

Wait, but wait, what about case 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:

H = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1. So yes, H=-1.

So in total, 6 states with H=-1 and 2 states with H=3.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me tally:

Number of states with H=3: 2.

Number with H=-1: 6.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about case 4, I thought H=1. Did I make a mistake?

Wait in case 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1*-1) + (1*-1) + (-1*-1) = (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.

So H=-1.

So yeah, all 6 states have H=-1, and 2 have H=3.

Wait, but wait another thought—did I miss any other possible H values? Like, are there any cases where H is +1 or -3?

Wait, for H=3, it's when all three pairs are +1, which only happens when all spins are the same. So that gives two states.

H=-3 would be when all three pairs are -1. Let's see if that's possible.

Suppose S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

H = (1*-1) + (1*1) + (-1*1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1. So that's H=-1.

Wait, what if all pairs are -1? Let's see: S1S2 = -1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.

So S1S2 = -1 → S1 = -S2.

S1S3 = -1 → S1 = -S3.

S2S3 = -1 → S2 = -S3.

So from S1 = -S2 and S1 = -S3, we get S2 = S3.

Then S2 = -S3 → S2 = -S2 → which implies S2=0, but the spins are ±1. So this is impossible.

So H cannot be -3. Therefore, the possible H values are 3 and -1. So each state has either H=3 (2 states) or H=-1 (6 states).

So the energies for each state are:

E = -J * H.

So for H=3: E = -3J.

For H=-1: E = J.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E).

But I can group them by their energy:

Z = (number of states with E=-3J) * exp(3J β) + (number of states with E=J) * exp(-J β).

Wait, because -β E for E=-3J is -β*(-3J) = 3 J β.

Similarly, E=J → -β J → exponent is exp(-β J).

So number of states with E=-3J is 2, and each contributes exp(3 J β).

Number of states with E=J is 6, each contributes exp(-J β).

Wait, wait, no: wait E=J comes from H=-1, and each such state contributes exp(-β E) = exp(-β * J).

Wait, so Z = 2 exp(3 J β) + 6 exp(-J β).

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^(-3Jβ) + 6 e^{Jβ} → No, because our terms are 3Jβ and -Jβ.

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-J β} → Yes, that's what I have.

Option B is Z = 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-J β}, which matches.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A: Z= 2 e^(-3J\beta)+6e^(J\beta)

Option B: 2 e^(3Jβ) +6e^(-Jβ)

So I think B is correct.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Expression**: The energy depends on the sum \( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \). Since each \( S_i \) is \( \pm 1 \), each term \( S_iS_j \) is also \( \pm 1 \), so \( H \) can take values \( 3, -1 \), or \( -3 \). However, \( H = -3 \) is impossible because it would require all pairs \( S_iS_j \) to be \( -1 \), which is not possible for three spins.

2. **Possible States**:
   - **Case 1: \( H = 3 \)**  
     This occurs when all spins are the same, i.e., either \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = +1 \) or \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = -1 \). There are 2 such states.
   - **Case 2: \( H = -1 \)**  
     This occurs when two spins are the same and one is different. There are 6 such states.

3. **Energy Values**:
   - For \( H = 3 \), \( E = -J \cdot 3 = -3J \).
   - For \( H = -1 \), \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

4. **Partition Function**:  
   The partition function is given by \( Z = \sum_{\text{states}} e^{-\beta E} \). Grouping states by their energy:
   - For \( H = 3 \) (2 states): Each contributes \( e^{-\beta (-3J)} = e^{3J\beta} \).
   - For \( H = -1 \) (6 states): Each contributes \( e^{-\beta J} \).

   Thus,  
   \[
   Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
   \]

### Matching with Options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \)  
  Incorrect, as the exponents are reversed.
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \)  
  Correct, matches the derived expression.
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \)  
  Incorrect, as the exponents are incorrect.
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \)  
  Incorrect, as the coefficients and exponents are wrong.

### Final Answer:
The correct partition function is \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
