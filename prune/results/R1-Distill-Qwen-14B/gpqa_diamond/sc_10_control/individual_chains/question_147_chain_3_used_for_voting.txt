Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Okay, the problem says:

p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻

So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles of type A⁺ and two of A⁻. I'm told that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Hmm, okay, so first, let's recall what I know about annihilation and particle physics. Annihilation typically involves matter and antimatter particles (like protons and antiprotons here) converting into other forms of energy and matter. In this case, they're producing these A particles.

Wait, but the mass given is for A. So each A has a mass of 300 MeV/c². But wait, the initial particles are protons and antiprotons. So the rest mass energy for a proton is about 938 MeV/c², I think. So each proton and antiproton has that energy when at rest.

But the antiproton in this case is moving slowly. Hmm, "slowly" probably means that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So I can approximate that the antiproton is at rest, or maybe that the proton is at rest? Wait, no, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some low velocity. But wait, the initial setup isn't clear on that. Hmm.

Wait, no, the problem statement says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a small velocity. Or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton's speed is low compared to the speed of light.

Alternatively, perhaps in this scenario, the initial momentum is low because the antiproton is moving slow, so the total momentum after the annihilation must be zero? Wait, no, because the products are four particles, two A⁺ and two A⁻. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe the system is symmetric. Let me think: when a proton and antiproton annihilate, they produce other particles. The charges must balance. So in this case, 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. So net charge is zero, which matches the initial state (proton + antiproton is zero charge). So that's good.

Now, considering conservation of energy and momentum. Let's model this as a collision between a proton and an antiproton, resulting in four particles. But wait, that's four particles, but that's a lot to handle. Alternatively, maybe the process is considered as producing two particles each of opposite charge, but perhaps I can model it as two pairs or something else. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can model it as two pairs of A particles, but perhaps moving in opposite directions, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but maybe I can think about the center-of-momentum frame. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum isn't that high. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving at a slow speed. So in that case, the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton.

Wait, but if the initial momentum is non-zero, then the products must carry that momentum. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the initial particles are at rest relative to each other, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key here is that in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. So if the initial particles are at rest in that frame, then the products must also have zero momentum in that frame. But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, which might suggest that we're in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving at a low speed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the initial particles are moving so that their combined momentum is zero, i.e., they're moving towards each other with equal and opposite momenta. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, which implies that perhaps the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving with low speed.

Wait, but in the case where the antiproton is moving slowly, the initial momentum is mostly due to the antiproton. So perhaps in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some small velocity v. Then, the products (the A particles) must carry away momentum such that the total momentum is conserved.

But perhaps I can model this using conservation of energy and momentum. Let me think.

Let me model the initial state: proton at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton is moving with velocity v, so its energy is gamma m_p c². The total initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

After the annihilation, we have four particles: 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. But perhaps they are moving symmetrically to conserve momentum. Alternatively, maybe they are produced in pairs moving in opposite directions, so that their momenta cancel out. But wait, four particles complicates things, but perhaps we can model it as two pairs of particles moving in opposite directions, each pair having some velocity.

Alternatively, maybe the four particles are moving in such a way that their combined momentum is zero. Wait, but that would be in the center-of-momentum frame. If the initial particles have some net momentum (like the antiproton is moving, so the initial momentum is not zero), then the products must have the same net momentum.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can make some approximations.

Wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps v is much less than c. So gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2c²), but maybe I can approximate gamma as 1, since v is small. Alternatively, perhaps the kinetic energy is much less than the rest energy, so the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c². Hmm.

Wait, but let me think. If the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass, which is about 938 MeV. So the total energy of the system would be approximately m_p c² (proton at rest) plus m_p c² (antiproton at rest) plus a small kinetic energy. So the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the momentum is approximately the momentum of the antiproton.

Wait, but let's think in terms of conservation of energy and momentum.

In the initial state: proton is at rest (so momentum p_initial = p_antiproton). Let me call the proton's momentum zero, and the antiproton's momentum as p. So total initial momentum is p.

In the final state: the four particles must have a total momentum of p. But how? Well, perhaps the four particles are moving symmetrically. For example, two A⁺ and two A⁻ might be moving in such a way that their momenta add up to p.

Alternatively, perhaps the product particles are moving in pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions, but with some velocity. Wait, but four particles is a bit complex. Alternatively, perhaps the system is symmetric in such a way that each pair of particles has opposite momentum, so their total momentum cancels out, except for any net momentum.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the momentum part. Maybe I should think in terms of energy first.

The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² (proton) + gamma m_p c² (antiproton). Assuming the antiproton is moving with velocity v, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is small, gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2 c²). But maybe for the sake of this problem, I can approximate gamma as 1, since the antiproton is moving slowly. So E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

The final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles. Each A has rest mass energy m_A c² = 300 MeV. So each A has energy E_A = gamma_A m_A c², where gamma_A is the Lorentz factor for their velocity.

But with four particles, it's a bit tricky. Maybe I can model this by assuming that all four particles are moving in the same direction, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the particles are moving in pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Alternatively, perhaps each pair is moving in opposite directions.

Wait, but perhaps an alternative approach. If the products are all moving with the same speed, but in different directions, perhaps there's some symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the products move in a way that their momenta sum to the initial momentum p. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the products are moving in such a way that their velocities are the same, but for the purpose of calculation, perhaps we can consider just the magnitude of the velocity, assuming that all A particles are moving in the same direction, but that might not be the case. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the case where all the A particles are moving in the same direction, each with velocity u. Then, their momenta would each be gamma_A m_A u. But since there are four of them, the total momentum would be 4 gamma_A m_A u. But that would have to equal the initial momentum, which is p = gamma_p m_p v, where gamma_p is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton (which I approximated as 1 since v is small). So p ≈ m_p v.

So 4 gamma_A m_A u = m_p v.

But wait, I don't know u or gamma_A yet. So maybe I can make some other assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are all moving with the same velocity, and the directions are such that their momenta sum to the initial momentum. But I'm not making progress here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is symmetric and the products are moving in such a way that the total momentum is the same as the initial. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can think about the scenario where the products are moving in pairs. For example, two A⁺ particles moving in one direction and two A⁻ moving in the opposite direction. But that might complicate the momentum calculation, as each pair would have their own momentum.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's assume that each A particle has the same velocity magnitude, and that their momenta are arranged symmetrically to give a net momentum equal to the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving in pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions with the same speed. Hmm, but that might not add up to the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) is moving in opposite directions, so their momenta cancel each other. But if that's the case, then the other pair would have to carry the initial momentum.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead consider the case where all four A particles are moving in the same direction. Then their total momentum would be 4 gamma_A m_A u, which should equal the initial momentum p = m_p v (since v is small, gamma_p ≈1).

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta sum to p, but each has a different direction.

Wait, perhaps another approach: let's consider that in the center-of-momentum frame, the initial total momentum is zero. So the products would also have zero total momentum in that frame. But since the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we're in the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with velocity v, small compared to c.

Wait, but in that case, the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v. And in the final state, the four A particles must have a total momentum equal to this p_initial. So maybe each A particle has the same velocity, and they're all moving in the same direction, but that would be four times their momentum. Maybe that's possible.

But perhaps, given that the problem is multiple-choice, there's a simpler way. Maybe I can use conservation of energy and momentum, and then find the velocity of the A particles.

Wait, let's outline the steps:

1. Compute the total initial energy.
2. Compute the total final energy (sum of energies of all A particles).
3. Since energy is conserved, set them equal.
4. Similarly, compute the initial momentum and set it equal to the sum of the final momenta.
5. Solve the resulting equations for the velocity of A.

But with four particles, this could get complicated. So maybe I can make some simplifying assumptions.

Wait, the problem gives the mass of A as 300 MeV/c², and the proton is about 938 MeV/c². So each A is lighter than the proton.

Wait, but considering that four A's are produced, maybe each A is moving with the same speed, and perhaps their directions are such that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair of A's is moving in opposite directions, making their momenta cancel, except for some net momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to assume that all four A's are moving in the same direction, so their total momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A u, and their total energy is 4 gamma_A m_A c².

But then, the initial energy is m_p c² (proton at rest) plus gamma_p m_p c² (antiproton's energy). Since the antiproton's velocity is small, gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²), but maybe for the sake of approximation, let's consider gamma_p ≈ 1.

So initial energy E_initial ≈ m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c².

So 2 m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Wait, but that would imply gamma_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) = (m_p)/(2 m_A).

Given m_p = 938 MeV/c², m_A = 300 MeV/c².

So gamma_A = 938 / (2 * 300) ≈ 938 / 600 ≈ 1.563.

Hmm, that's a gamma factor of about 1.563. So the velocity would be v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_A)^2).

Calculating that:

1/gamma_A ≈ 0.64.

So 1 - (0.64)^2 = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

sqrt(0.5904) ≈ 0.7683.

So v ≈ 0.7683 c.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c, which is close. But wait, this is under the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction, which might not be the case. Also, this approach ignores the initial momentum, which we need to account for.

Wait, because momentum is conserved, I can't ignore it. So perhaps I should approach this using both energy and momentum conservation.

Let me try that.

Let me denote:

m_p = mass of proton (and antiproton), since they're same except charge.

m_A = mass of A particle.

Let me assume that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v, which is small, so gamma_p ≈ 1.

So, initial momentum p_initial = gamma_p m_p v ≈ m_p v.

Initial energy E_initial = m_p c² (proton) + gamma_p m_p c² (antiproton) ≈ m_p c² + m_p c² (1 + (v²)/(2 c²)) ) ≈ 2 m_p c² + (m_p v²)/(2 c²) * c² = 2 m_p c² + (m_p v²)/2.

But since v is small, the (m_p v²)/2 term is negligible compared to 2 m_p c², so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

In the final state, we have four A particles. Let me assume that each A is moving with velocity u in some direction. But perhaps, for simplicity, all are moving in the same direction. So their momenta would add up to 4 gamma_A m_A u. And their energies would sum to 4 gamma_A m_A c².

But the problem is that we have to satisfy both energy and momentum conservation.

So, setting up the equations:

Energy conservation:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² + (m_p v²)/2.

Momentum conservation:

4 gamma_A m_A u = m_p v.

Now, since v is small, perhaps we can make some approximations.

Assuming that gamma_A is approximately 1 + (u²)/(2 c²), since u is not extremely close to c, but let's see.

But wait, let me think: if the four A particles are moving in the same direction, each with velocity u, then their energies and momenta would be as above.

But then, because the momentum conservation equation relates u and v, perhaps I can express v in terms of u, or vice versa, and substitute.

But let's see the energy equation:

4 (1 + (u²)/(2 c²)) m_A c² = 2 m_p c².

Wait, but wait, if u is a significant fraction of c, then gamma_A isn't 1. So perhaps that's a better approximation.

Wait, but let's write gamma_A as 1 + (u²)/(2 c²) for small u, but I don't know if u is small. Alternatively, perhaps we can write gamma_A =1 + (u²)/(2 c²). But I'm not sure if that's valid. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write gamma_A = (1 - (u²/c²))^{-1/2}.

Hmm, but without knowing u, this seems difficult. So perhaps I should express u in terms of v from the momentum equation.

From the momentum equation:

4 gamma_A m_A u = m_p v.

So, u = (m_p v) / (4 gamma_A m_A).

But v is small, so perhaps I can approximate gamma_A as 1, leading to u ≈ (m_p v)/(4 m_A).

But then, substituting u into the energy equation.

Wait, but the energy equation is:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c².

If gamma_A is about 1.56 (as before), then perhaps this can be handled.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps they are moving in pairs, such that two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, which would cancel each other's momentum, leaving only the initial momentum to be carried by one pair. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps each A⁺ and A⁻ pair is moving in opposite directions, but that might complicate the momentum.

Wait, perhaps another approach: considering that the products are two A⁺ and two A⁻, maybe the two A⁺ are moving in one direction and the two A⁻ in the opposite, each pair having the same velocity magnitude but opposite directions, so their momenta cancel each other. Then, the total momentum would be zero, which can't be the case because the initial momentum is not zero. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) are moving as a unit, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the four A particles are moving in such a way that two are moving in one direction and two in another, such that their momenta sum to p_initial. But without knowing the angles, this is difficult.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as each A particle having the same speed u, and all moving in the same direction, so that their momenta add up to 4 gamma_A m_A u. Then, momentum conservation gives 4 gamma_A m_A u = m_p v.

Energy conservation gives 4 gamma_A m_A c² = E_initial = 2 m_p c² + (m_p v²)/2.

But since v is small, the term (m_p v²)/2 is much smaller than 2 m_p c², so perhaps we can approximate E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c². Then, 4 gamma_A m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c².

So gamma_A ≈ (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) )= (m_p)/(2 m_A) ≈ 938/(2*300) ≈ 1.563.

So gamma_A ≈1.563. Then, using gamma_A =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), where beta = u/c.

So, 1.563 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Squaring both sides: (1.563)^2 ≈ 2.443 ≈ 1/(1 - beta^2).

So, 1 - beta^2 ≈ 1/2.443 ≈ 0.4096.

So beta^2 ≈ 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

So beta ≈ sqrt(0.5904) ≈ 0.7683.

So u ≈ 0.7683 c.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c.

But wait, this is under the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction, and the initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c². But we also have to consider momentum conservation. Let's plug this into the momentum equation to see if it holds.

From the momentum equation:

4 gamma_A m_A u = m_p v.

With gamma_A =1.563, u ≈ 0.7683 c.

So, 4 * 1.563 * m_A * 0.7683 c = m_p v.

Compute the left side:

4 * 1.563 * 300 MeV/c² * 0.7683 c = ?

Wait, units: m_A is 300 MeV/c², so 4 * 1.563 * 300 * 0.7683 * c.

But m_p is 938 MeV/c².

So:

Left side: 4 * 1.563 * 300 * 0.7683 * c = (4 * 1.563 *300 * 0.7683) * c.

Calculate the numerical factor:

4 *1.563=6.252.

6.252 * 300 = 1875.6.

1875.6 * 0.7683 ≈ 1875.6 * 0.7683 ≈ Let me compute that. 1875.6 *0.7=1312.92, 1875.6 *0.06=112.536, 1875.6 *0.0083≈15.587. Adding up: 1312.92 +112.536=1425.456 +15.587≈1441.043.

So left side ≈ 1441.043 * c.

Right side: m_p v =938 * v (in units where c=1, v is a fraction).

So, 1441.043 =938 v → v ≈ 1441.043 /938 ≈ 1.536.

Wait, but v is a fraction of c, so 1.536 would be v in terms of c? That can't be, since v can't exceed c. So this suggests that the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is invalid because it leads to v greater than c, which is impossible.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is incorrect. So maybe the four A's are not all moving in the same direction. So, perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving in such a way that their momenta sum up to the initial momentum, but their energy is higher than what I calculated before.

Wait, perhaps I should include the initial kinetic energy of the antiproton, which I've neglected so far. Because earlier, I approximated E_initial as 2 m_p c², but if the antiproton is moving, its energy is higher than m_p c².

So perhaps I can't neglect the kinetic energy. Let me think: the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c², and the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small, so gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), but let's model it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can model this with the following approach:

1. Use conservation of energy: E_initial = E_final.
2. Use conservation of momentum: p_initial = p_final.

Let me write these equations.

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

E_final = sum of energies of four A particles: 4 gamma_A m_A c².

p_final = sum of momenta of four A particles: 4 gamma_A m_A u, assuming all move in the same direction.

Wait, but this leads to the same problem as before, which was that the momentum equation gives v >c when using the gamma_A from energy conservation. So perhaps the assumption that all four A's are moving in the same direction is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps two A's are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but that complicates the momentum equation.

Wait, perhaps each A is moving in the same direction, but their velocities are such that the momentum sum is possible. Alternatively, perhaps the A's are moving with a velocity that's a significant fraction of c, making gamma_A larger, which would make the energy equation require a higher initial energy, which would mean the antiproton's kinetic energy isn't negligible.

Wait, perhaps I should not neglect the initial kinetic energy. Let me include it.

So, E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

The energy of the A's is 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

And for momentum:

4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma_p m_p v.

Hmm, but I have two equations with two variables: gamma_A and u (since v is linked to gamma_p).

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express gamma_p in terms of v, and then express gamma_A and u in terms of gamma_p.

Wait, maybe it's better to assume that the initial velocity v is such that gamma_p is close to 1, but not exactly 1. But perhaps without knowing v, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption about gamma_p. Let me think: since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²). Let's let beta_p = v/c; then gamma_p = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_p²).

But beta_p is small, so gamma_p ≈ 1 + (beta_p^2)/2.

But maybe I can write beta_p in terms of gamma_p.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write gamma_p as approximately 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe let's consider that the initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c² plus some small kinetic energy. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the initial kinetic energy of the antiproton is small compared to the rest mass. So, E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v^2.

But perhaps another approach: since the problem asks for the velocity of A, perhaps I can find u in terms of m_p and m_A.

Wait, considering that the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can model this as an inelastic collision where the products are moving at a certain velocity. But with four particles, this is challenging.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the total rest mass energy after the annihilation is 4 m_A c². So, the available energy is much larger than this? Let me compute 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, and the initial rest mass is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. So the initial rest mass is about 1876 MeV, and the products have a rest mass of 1200 MeV. So, there's kinetic energy available.

Hmm, perhaps the products are moving with some velocity determined by the available energy.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of invariant mass. The invariant mass squared s is given by (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

In the initial state, E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c², and p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

So s_initial = (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2.

Which is s_initial = [m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c²]^2 - [gamma_p m_p v c]^2.

Let me compute this:

= [ m_p c² (1 + gamma_p) ]^2 - [ gamma_p m_p v c ]^2.

= m_p² c^4 (1 + gamma_p)^2 - gamma_p² m_p² v^2 c².

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate s_initial as (sum of 4-momenta)^2.

Wait, but perhaps in the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero, so s_initial would be (sum of energies)^2.

Wait, s_initial is the same in all frames, so perhaps I can compute it in the center-of-mass frame, where the initial momentum is zero.

In that frame, the initial energy is E_cm = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

But the initial momentum is zero, so s_initial = (E_cm)^2.

But in the center-of-mass frame, the products must have zero total momentum. So the four A particles must arrange themselves such that their total momentum is zero.

In that case, the products' rest mass would be sqrt(s_initial) / c².

Wait, but the products have a rest mass of 4 m_A c². So, 4 m_A c² = sqrt(s_initial) → s_initial = (4 m_A c²)^2.

But wait, s_initial is also equal to (E_cm)^2 = (m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c² )^2.

So:

(4 m_A c²)^2 = (m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c² )^2.

Take square roots:

4 m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma_p).

Divide both sides by c²:

4 m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p).

So,

1 + gamma_p = 4 m_A / m_p.

m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So 4 *300 = 1200.

1200 / 938 ≈ 1.28.

So 1 + gamma_p = 1.28 → gamma_p ≈ 0.28.

Wait, but that's impossible because gamma_p is always ≥1. Gamma_p is the Lorentz factor of the antiproton, which must be ≥1. So this suggests that 4 m_A < m_p (1 + gamma_p) is impossible, unless gamma_p is ≥ something. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the invariant mass approach. Let me re-examine.

The invariant mass s is given by (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2.

So in the initial state, sum E = E_p + E_pbar.

sum p = p_pbar (since proton is at rest).

In the center-of-mass frame, sum p is zero, so s = (E_cm)^2 = (sum E)^2.

But in the lab frame (proton at rest, antiproton moving), s = (E_p + E_pbar)^2 - (p_pbar c)^2.

Which is s = [m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c²]^2 - [gamma_p m_p v c]^2.

Which can be written as s = [m_p c² (1 + gamma_p)]^2 - [gamma_p m_p v c]^2.

But s is also equal to (sum E_products)^2 - (sum p_products c)^2.

In the products, since it's four A particles, their invariant mass would be s = (4 m_A c²)^2, assuming they are all at rest relative to each other. But that's not correct because in reality, they have kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the invariant mass. The invariant mass of the system is the same, regardless of the frame. So s is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame, which is (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2.

So, in the initial state, s_initial = (m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c²)^2 - (gamma_p m_p v c)^2.

Expanding this, we get:

s_initial = m_p² c^4 (1 + gamma_p)^2 - gamma_p^2 m_p² v² c².

Hmm, not so helpful.

Wait, but in the center-of-mass frame, s_initial = (sum E_cm)^2, which is (E_p + E_pbar)^2.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the threshold condition.

The threshold condition for producing particles is when the kinetic energy is just enough to produce the rest mass of the products. But in this case, the products have rest mass 4 m_A c², which is 1200 MeV. The initial rest mass is 2 m_p c², which is 1876 MeV. So the initial rest mass is larger than the product's rest mass, so the reaction is possible even without any kinetic energy, but in reality, the antiproton is moving, so there's some kinetic energy available.

Wait, but perhaps the velocity of the A particles can be found using the conservation of energy and momentum in the center-of-mass frame.

In the center-of-mass frame, the initial total momentum is zero. So the products must have zero total momentum. So the four A particles must arrange themselves such that their momenta cancel out.

Assuming that all four A particles are moving with the same speed u, but in opposite directions, perhaps in pairs. For example, two moving in the +x direction and two in the -x direction. Then, their momenta would cancel each other, leading to zero total momentum.

If that's the case, then each A particle has the same speed u, and their directions are arranged symmetrically. So the total momentum would be zero, which fits the center-of-mass frame.

Then, the energy in the center-of-mass frame would be 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So, in the center-of-mass frame:

E_cm = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

But E_cm is also equal to the sum of the initial energies in the center-of-mass frame.

Wait, but how to relate this to the lab frame where the antiproton is moving slowly.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should focus on the fact that the velocity we're looking for is for each A particle, assuming they all move with the same speed.

Another approach: use the relation between energy and momentum for each A particle.

Each A has energy E_A = gamma_A m_A c², and momentum p_A = gamma_A m_A u.

So for each A, (E_A)^2 = (p_A c)^2 + (m_A c²)^2.

Now, considering four A particles, each with momentum p_A. But their directions are such that the total momentum is equal to the initial momentum p_initial = m_p v.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as two A⁺ and two A⁻ moving in pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the velocity of the center of mass. Let me denote u as the velocity of each A particle in the lab frame.

Wait, maybe using the fact that in the center-of-mass frame, each A particle has the same speed, and then transforming their velocities to the lab frame, where the antiproton is moving.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the velocity addition formula.

But this is getting too involved, and I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of another approach.

Wait, considering that the options are specific velocities, maybe I can compute gamma for each option and see which one fits the energy and momentum conservation.

Let me compute gamma for each option:

Option A: 0.77c → beta=0.77.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.77)^2) → 1/sqrt(1 - 0.5929) → 1/sqrt(0.4071) ≈ 1/0.638 ≈1.568.

Option B: 0.96c → beta=0.96.

gamma ≈ 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) ≈1/0.28→3.57.

Option C: 0.91c → beta=0.91.

gamma ≈1/sqrt(1 - 0.8281)=1/sqrt(0.1719)=1/0.4146≈2.41.

Option D: 0.86c → beta=0.86.

gamma ≈1/sqrt(1 - 0.7396)=1/sqrt(0.2604)=1/0.5103≈1.96.

Now, let's consider energy conservation.

Assuming that the four A particles share the available energy.

Wait, but without knowing the initial momentum, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the initial energy is roughly 2 m_p c² plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton.

But wait, perhaps I can model the system as the initial energy being 2 m_p c², and the four A's each having gamma_A m_A c². So 4 gamma_A m_A c² =2 m_p c² → gamma_A = (2 m_p c²)/(4 m_A c²) )= m_p/(2 m_A) =938/(2*300)=1.563.

Which matches option A's gamma of ~1.568.

So, if the four A's are moving in the same direction, their gamma would be about 1.563, leading to a velocity of ~0.77c.

But earlier, this led to a problem with the momentum equation, producing v >c.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the momentum equation.

Earlier, I had:

4 gamma_A m_A u = m_p v.

With gamma_A=1.563, u=0.77c.

So,

4 *1.563 *300 MeV/c² *0.77c = m_p v.

Calculate the left side: 4 *1.563 *300 *0.77 *c ≈ 4 *1.563 ≈6.252; 6.252 *300=1875.6; 1875.6 *0.77≈1443.912.

So left side ≈1443.912 c MeV/c² → 1443.912 MeV/c.

Right side: m_p v=938 MeV/c² *v.

So,

1443.912 MeV/c =938 MeV/c² *v.

Multiply both sides by c:

1443.912 MeV =938 MeV *v.

So v=1443.912/938 ≈1.538 c.

Which is greater than c, which is impossible.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, this suggests that our initial assumption is wrong. So, perhaps the four A particles are not all moving in the same direction, leading to a lower total momentum.

Wait, perhaps some of the A's are moving in the opposite direction. Let's say that two are moving in the +x direction, and two in the -x direction, each with speed u. Then, the total momentum would be 2 gamma_A m_A u - 2 gamma_A m_A u =0. That can't be right because the initial momentum isn't zero.

Alternatively, perhaps three are moving in +x and one in -x, but that wouldn't balance it either.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) are moving in opposite directions, but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps the A's are moving in such a way that their momentum cancels each other except for a net momentum equal to the initial. For example, two A's moving in +x and two in -x, but with their velocities such that the total momentum is m_p v.

Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps each A has speed u, but in different directions such that the total momentum is m_p v.

Hmm, without knowing the exact angles, this is difficult.

Wait, perhaps each A is moving at velocity u with respect to the center-of-mass frame, and the center-of-mass frame is moving with velocity U relative to the lab frame.

Wait, let me think about the velocity of the center-of-mass frame.

The velocity U of the center-of-mass frame (cm frame) relative to the lab frame can be found using the total momentum.

In the lab frame, the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

The total energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

The velocity of the cm frame is U = (p_initial c²) / E_initial.

So,

U = [gamma_p m_p v c² ] / [m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c² ].

Simplify:

U = [gamma_p v c² ] / [c² (1 + gamma_p) ].

Cancel c²:

U = gamma_p v / (1 + gamma_p).

Hmm, interesting.

Now, in the cm frame, the four A particles are moving with some velocity u_cm. But I'm not sure how to relate u_cm to the lab frame's u.

But perhaps I can use the velocity addition formula.

In the cm frame, each A has velocity u_cm. Then, in the lab frame, their velocity would be:

u = (u_cm + U) / (1 + (u_cm U)/c² ).

Hmm, but without knowing u_cm, this is not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps in the cm frame, the A's are at rest. But that can't be the case because their rest mass is less than the initial rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the A's are produced at rest in the cm frame, but that's not possible because the initial rest mass is higher than the product's rest mass. So the A's must have some kinetic energy.

Wait, but earlier, the invariant mass approach may have led to a mistake, so perhaps I should re-express it.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the velocity of the center-of-mass frame first, then find out the velocity of the A's in that frame, then transform it to the lab frame.

But this requires knowing the velocity of the A's in the cm frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the A's are all moving in the same direction in the cm frame, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the A's are produced with some velocity in the cm frame, and then their velocities in the lab frame can be found using the velocity addition formula.

But without more information, this seems difficult.

Wait, given the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps the correct answer is option A (0.77c), based on the earlier energy calculation, even though the momentum conservation gives an impossible v, but perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that all four A's are moving in the same direction is incorrect, and the correct velocity is lower, perhaps option D (0.86c).

Wait, but option D has a gamma of ~1.96.

Let me see: if gamma_A=1.96, then u=0.86c.

So, let me compute the energy and momentum.

Energy equation: 4 *1.96 *300 = 4 * 588 = 2352 MeV.

Initial energy E_initial = 2 m_p c² + kinetic energy of antiproton.

2 m_p c² is 2 *938 =1876 MeV.

So, 2352 MeV = 1876 MeV + KE_antiproton.

So KE_antiproton = 2352 -1876 = 476 MeV.

Which is possible, because the antiproton's rest energy is 938 MeV, so 476 MeV is about half of that, which would imply that the antiproton is moving at a significant speed, not slow.

But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so the kinetic energy should be small compared to the rest energy.

So, option D's gamma would require the antiproton to have significant KE, which contradicts the problem statement.

So perhaps option A is correct, but the problem is with the momentum equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that all four A's are moving in the same direction. If they are not, then the momentum equation would not lead to v> c.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the A's are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum, but their energy is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the four A's are moving in pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions, but with some velocity such that their momenta sum to the initial momentum.

But this is getting too time-consuming, and perhaps I should proceed to the step-by-step solution.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process:

### Key Information:
- The reaction is \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \).
- The antiproton is moving slowly, implying its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest energy.
- The rest energy of each \( A \)-particle is \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \).
- The proton and antiproton have rest energy \( m_p c^2 \approx 938 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Conservation Laws:
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total initial energy equals the total final energy.
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{proton}} + E_{\text{antiproton}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma_p m_p c^2
   \]
   where \( \gamma_p \) is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, \( \gamma_p \approx 1 + \frac{v^2}{2c^2} \), and the kinetic energy is small compared to the rest energy.

   The final energy is the sum of the energies of the four \( A \)-particles:
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2
   \]
   where \( \gamma_A \) is the Lorentz factor for the \( A \)-particles.

2. **Momentum Conservation**: The total initial momentum equals the total final momentum. The initial momentum is due to the antiproton:
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_p m_p v
   \]
   The final momentum is the sum of the momenta of the four \( A \)-particles:
   \[
   p_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A u
   \]
   where \( u \) is the velocity of the \( A \)-particles.

### Simplifying Assumptions:
- The antiproton is moving slowly, so \( \gamma_p \approx 1 \), and the initial momentum is approximately \( p_{\text{initial}} \approx m_p v \).
- The \( A \)-particles are assumed to move with the same velocity \( u \) in the same direction.

### Solving for \( \gamma_A \) and \( u \):
From energy conservation:
\[
4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 = 2 m_p c^2
\]
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}
\]
Substituting \( m_p = 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{938}{2 \cdot 300} \approx 1.563
\]

From momentum conservation:
\[
4 \gamma_A m_A u = m_p v
\]
Substituting \( \gamma_A \approx 1.563 \), \( m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), and \( m_p = 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
\[
4 (1.563)(300) u = 938 v
\]
\[
1875.6 u = 938 v
\]
\[
v = \frac{1875.6}{938} u \approx 2.0 u
\]

Using the relation \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}} \), solve for \( u \):
\[
1.563 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}
\]
\[
1 - u^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1.563)^2} \approx 0.4096
\]
\[
u^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904
\]
\[
u/c = \sqrt{0.5904} \approx 0.768
\]
Thus, \( u \approx 0.768c \), which corresponds to option **A (0.77c)**.

### Momentum Check:
Substitute \( u \approx 0.768c \) into \( v = 2.0u \):
\[
v \approx 2.0 (0.768c) = 1.536c
\]
This result is unphysical, as \( v > c \). This discrepancy suggests the assumption that all \( A \)-particles move in the same direction is invalid. However, based on the energy calculation, the velocity of the \( A \)-particles is closest to **0.77c**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Okay, the problem says:

p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻

So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles of type A⁺ and two of A⁻. I'm told that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Hmm, okay, so first, let's recall what I know about annihilation and particle physics. Annihilation typically involves matter and antimatter particles (like protons and antiprotons here) converting into other forms of energy and matter. In this case, they're producing these A particles.

Wait, but the mass given is for A. So each A has a mass of 300 MeV/c². But wait, the initial particles are protons and antiprotons. So the rest mass energy for a proton is about 938 MeV/c², I think. So each proton and antiproton has that energy when at rest.

But the antiproton in this case is moving slowly. Hmm, "slowly" probably means that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So I can approximate that the antiproton is at rest, or maybe that the proton is at rest? Wait, no, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some low velocity. But wait, the initial setup isn't clear on that. Hmm.

Wait, no, the problem statement says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a small velocity. Or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton's speed is low compared to the speed of light.

Alternatively, perhaps in this scenario, the initial momentum is low because the antiproton is moving slow, so the total momentum after the annihilation must be zero? Wait, no, because the products are four particles, two A⁺ and two A⁻. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe the system is symmetric. Let me think: when a proton and antiproton annihilate, they produce other particles. The charges must balance. So in this case, 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. So net charge is zero, which matches the initial state (proton + antiproton is zero charge). So that's good.

Now, considering conservation of energy and momentum. Let's model this as a collision between a proton and an antiproton, resulting in four particles. But wait, that's four particles, but that's a lot to handle. Alternatively, maybe the process is considered as producing two particles each of opposite charge, but perhaps I can model it as two pairs or something else. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can model it as two pairs of A particles, but perhaps moving in opposite directions, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but maybe I can think about the center-of-momentum frame. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum isn't that high. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving at a slow speed. So in that case, the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton.

Wait, but if the initial momentum is non-zero, then the products must carry that momentum. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the initial particles are at rest relative to each other, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key here is that in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. So if the initial particles are at rest in that frame, then the products must also have zero momentum in that frame. But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, which might suggest that we're in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving at a low speed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the initial particles are moving so that their combined momentum is zero, i.e., they're moving towards each other with equal and opposite momenta. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, which implies that perhaps the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving with low speed.

Wait, but in the case where the antiproton is moving slowly, the initial momentum is mostly due to the antiproton. So perhaps in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some small velocity v. Then, the products (the A particles) must carry away momentum such that the total momentum is conserved.

But perhaps I can model this using conservation of energy and momentum. Let me think.

Let me model the initial state: proton at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton is moving with velocity v, so its energy is gamma m_p c². The total initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

After the annihilation, we have four particles: 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. But perhaps they are moving symmetrically to conserve momentum. Alternatively, maybe they are produced in pairs moving in opposite directions, so that their momenta cancel out. But wait, four particles complicates things, but perhaps we can model it as two pairs of particles moving in opposite directions, each pair having some velocity.

Alternatively, maybe the four particles are moving in such a way that their combined momentum is zero. Wait, but that would be in the center-of-momentum frame. If the initial particles have some net momentum (like the antiproton is moving, so the initial momentum is not zero), then the products must have the same net momentum.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can make some approximations.

Wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps v is much less than c. So gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2c²), but maybe I can approximate gamma as 1, since v is small. Alternatively, perhaps the kinetic energy is much less than the rest energy, so the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c². Hmm.

Wait, but let me think. If the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass, which is about 938 MeV. So the total energy of the system would be approximately m_p c² (proton at rest) plus m_p c² (antiproton at rest) plus a small kinetic energy. So the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the momentum is approximately the momentum of the antiproton.

Wait, but let's think in terms of conservation of energy and momentum.

In the initial state: proton is at rest (so momentum p_initial = p_antiproton). Let me call the proton's momentum zero, and the antiproton's momentum as p. So total initial momentum is p.

In the final state: the four particles must have a total momentum of p. But how? Well, perhaps the four particles are moving symmetrically. For example, two A⁺ and two A⁻ might be moving in such a way that their momenta add up to p.

Alternatively, perhaps the product particles are moving in pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions, but with some velocity. Wait, but four particles is a bit complex. Alternatively, perhaps the system is symmetric in such a way that each pair of particles has opposite momentum, so their total momentum cancels out, except for any net momentum.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the momentum part. Maybe I should think in terms of energy first.

The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² (proton) + gamma m_p c² (antiproton). Assuming the antiproton is moving with velocity v, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is small, gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2 c²). But maybe for the sake of this problem, I can approximate gamma as 1, since the antiproton is moving slowly. So E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

The final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles. Each A has rest mass energy m_A c² = 300 MeV. So each A has energy E_A = gamma_A m_A c², where gamma_A is the Lorentz factor for their velocity.

But with four particles, it's a bit tricky. Maybe I can model this by assuming that all four particles are moving in the same direction, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the particles are moving in pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Alternatively, perhaps each pair is moving in opposite directions.

Wait, but perhaps an alternative approach. If the products are all moving with the same speed, but in different directions, perhaps there's some symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the products move in a way that their momenta sum to the initial momentum p. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the products are moving in such a way that their velocities are the same, but for the purpose of calculation, perhaps we can consider just the magnitude of the velocity, assuming that all A particles are moving in the same direction, but that might not be the case. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the case where all the A particles are moving in the same direction, each with velocity u. Then, their momenta would each be gamma_A m_A u. But since there are four of them, the total momentum would be 4 gamma_A m_A u. But that would have to equal the initial momentum, which is p = gamma_p m_p v, where gamma_p is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton (which I approximated as 1 since v is small). So p ≈ m_p v.

So 4 gamma_A m_A u = m_p v.

But wait, I don't know u or gamma_A yet. So maybe I can make some other assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are all moving with the same velocity, and the directions are such that their momenta sum to the initial momentum. But I'm not making progress here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is symmetric and the products are moving in such a way that the total momentum is the same as the initial. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can think about the scenario where the products are moving in pairs. For example, two A⁺ particles moving in one direction and two A⁻ moving in the opposite direction. But that might complicate the momentum calculation, as each pair would have their own momentum.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's assume that each A particle has the same velocity magnitude, and that their momenta are arranged symmetrically to give a net momentum equal to the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving in pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions with the same speed. Hmm, but that might not add up to the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) is moving in opposite directions, so their momenta cancel each other. But if that's the case, then the other pair would have to carry the initial momentum.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead consider the case where all four A particles are moving in the same direction. Then their total momentum would be 4 gamma_A m_A u, which should equal the initial momentum p = m_p v (since v is small, gamma_p ≈1).

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta sum to p, but each has a different direction.

Wait, perhaps another approach: let's consider that in the center-of-momentum frame, the initial total momentum is zero. So the products would also have zero total momentum in that frame. But since the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we're in the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with velocity v, small compared to c.

Wait, but in that case, the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v. And in the final state, the four A particles must have a total momentum equal to this p_initial. So maybe each A particle has the same velocity, and they're all moving in the same direction, but that would be four times their momentum. Maybe that's possible.

But perhaps, given that the problem is multiple-choice, there's a simpler way. Maybe I can use conservation of energy and momentum, and then find the velocity of the A particles.

Wait, let's outline the steps:

1. Compute the total initial energy.
2. Compute the total final energy (sum of energies of all A particles).
3. Since energy is conserved, set them equal.
4. Similarly, compute the initial momentum and set it equal to the sum of the final momenta.
5. Solve the resulting equations for the velocity of A.

But with four particles, this could get complicated. So maybe I can make some simplifying assumptions.

Wait, the problem gives the mass of A as 300 MeV/c², and the proton is about 938 MeV/c². So each A is lighter than the proton.

Wait, but considering that four A's are produced, maybe each A is moving with the same speed, and perhaps their directions are such that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair of A's is moving in opposite directions, making their momenta cancel, except for some net momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to assume that all four A's are moving in the same direction, so their total momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A u, and their total energy is 4 gamma_A m_A c².

But then, the initial energy is m_p c² (proton at rest) plus gamma_p m_p c² (antiproton's energy). Since the antiproton's velocity is small, gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²), but maybe for the sake of approximation, let's consider gamma_p ≈ 1.

So initial energy E_initial ≈ m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c².

So 2 m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Wait, but that would imply gamma_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) = (m_p)/(2 m_A).

Given m_p = 938 MeV/c², m_A = 300 MeV/c².

So gamma_A = 938 / (2 * 300) ≈ 938 / 600 ≈ 1.563.

Hmm, that's a gamma factor of about 1.563. So the velocity would be v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_A)^2).

Calculating that:

1/gamma_A ≈ 0.64.

So 1 - (0.64)^2 = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

sqrt(0.5904) ≈ 0.7683.

So v ≈ 0.7683 c.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c, which is close. But wait, this is under the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction, which might not be the case. Also, this approach ignores the initial momentum, which we need to account for.

Wait, because momentum is conserved, I can't ignore it. So perhaps I should approach this using both energy and momentum conservation.

Let me try that.

Let me denote:

m_p = mass of proton (and antiproton), since they're same except charge.

m_A = mass of A particle.

Let me assume that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v, which is small, so gamma_p ≈ 1.

So, initial momentum p_initial = gamma_p m_p v ≈ m_p v.

Initial energy E_initial = m_p c² (proton) + gamma_p m_p c² (antiproton) ≈ m_p c² + m_p c² (1 + (v²)/(2 c²)) ) ≈ 2 m_p c² + (m_p v²)/(2 c²) * c² = 2 m_p c² + (m_p v²)/2.

But since v is small, the (m_p v²)/2 term is negligible compared to 2 m_p c², so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

In the final state, we have four A particles. Let me assume that each A is moving with velocity u in some direction. But perhaps, for simplicity, all are moving in the same direction. So their momenta would add up to 4 gamma_A m_A u. And their energies would sum to 4 gamma_A m_A c².

But the problem is that we have to satisfy both energy and momentum conservation.

So, setting up the equations:

Energy conservation:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² + (m_p v²)/2.

Momentum conservation:

4 gamma_A m_A u = m_p v.

Now, since v is small, perhaps we can make some approximations.

Assuming that gamma_A is approximately 1 + (u²)/(2 c²), since u is not extremely close to c, but let's see.

But wait, let me think: if the four A particles are moving in the same direction, each with velocity u, then their energies and momenta would be as above.

But then, because the momentum conservation equation relates u and v, perhaps I can express v in terms of u, or vice versa, and substitute.

But let's see the energy equation:

4 (1 + (u²)/(2 c²)) m_A c² = 2 m_p c².

Wait, but wait, if u is a significant fraction of c, then gamma_A isn't 1. So perhaps that's a better approximation.

Wait, but let's write gamma_A as 1 + (u²)/(2 c²) for small u, but I don't know if u is small. Alternatively, perhaps we can write gamma_A =1 + (u²)/(2 c²). But I'm not sure if that's valid. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write gamma_A = (1 - (u²/c²))^{-1/2}.

Hmm, but without knowing u, this seems difficult. So perhaps I should express u in terms of v from the momentum equation.

From the momentum equation:

4 gamma_A m_A u = m_p v.

So, u = (m_p v) / (4 gamma_A m_A).

But v is small, so perhaps I can approximate gamma_A as 1, leading to u ≈ (m_p v)/(4 m_A).

But then, substituting u into the energy equation.

Wait, but the energy equation is:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c².

If gamma_A is about 1.56 (as before), then perhaps this can be handled.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps they are moving in pairs, such that two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, which would cancel each other's momentum, leaving only the initial momentum to be carried by one pair. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps each A⁺ and A⁻ pair is moving in opposite directions, but that might complicate the momentum.

Wait, perhaps another approach: considering that the products are two A⁺ and two A⁻, maybe the two A⁺ are moving in one direction and the two A⁻ in the opposite, each pair having the same velocity magnitude but opposite directions, so their momenta cancel each other. Then, the total momentum would be zero, which can't be the case because the initial momentum is not zero. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) are moving as a unit, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the four A particles are moving in such a way that two are moving in one direction and two in another, such that their momenta sum to p_initial. But without knowing the angles, this is difficult.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as each A particle having the same speed u, and all moving in the same direction, so that their momenta add up to 4 gamma_A m_A u. Then, momentum conservation gives 4 gamma_A m_A u = m_p v.

Energy conservation gives 4 gamma_A m_A c² = E_initial = 2 m_p c² + (m_p v²)/2.

But since v is small, the term (m_p v²)/2 is much smaller than 2 m_p c², so perhaps we can approximate E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c². Then, 4 gamma_A m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c².

So gamma_A ≈ (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) )= (m_p)/(2 m_A) ≈ 938/(2*300) ≈ 1.563.

So gamma_A ≈1.563. Then, using gamma_A =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), where beta = u/c.

So, 1.563 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Squaring both sides: (1.563)^2 ≈ 2.443 ≈ 1/(1 - beta^2).

So, 1 - beta^2 ≈ 1/2.443 ≈ 0.4096.

So beta^2 ≈ 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

So beta ≈ sqrt(0.5904) ≈ 0.7683.

So u ≈ 0.7683 c.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c.

But wait, this is under the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction, and the initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c². But we also have to consider momentum conservation. Let's plug this into the momentum equation to see if it holds.

From the momentum equation:

4 gamma_A m_A u = m_p v.

With gamma_A =1.563, u ≈ 0.7683 c.

So, 4 * 1.563 * m_A * 0.7683 c = m_p v.

Compute the left side:

4 * 1.563 * 300 MeV/c² * 0.7683 c = ?

Wait, units: m_A is 300 MeV/c², so 4 * 1.563 * 300 * 0.7683 * c.

But m_p is 938 MeV/c².

So:

Left side: 4 * 1.563 * 300 * 0.7683 * c = (4 * 1.563 *300 * 0.7683) * c.

Calculate the numerical factor:

4 *1.563=6.252.

6.252 * 300 = 1875.6.

1875.6 * 0.7683 ≈ 1875.6 * 0.7683 ≈ Let me compute that. 1875.6 *0.7=1312.92, 1875.6 *0.06=112.536, 1875.6 *0.0083≈15.587. Adding up: 1312.92 +112.536=1425.456 +15.587≈1441.043.

So left side ≈ 1441.043 * c.

Right side: m_p v =938 * v (in units where c=1, v is a fraction).

So, 1441.043 =938 v → v ≈ 1441.043 /938 ≈ 1.536.

Wait, but v is a fraction of c, so 1.536 would be v in terms of c? That can't be, since v can't exceed c. So this suggests that the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is invalid because it leads to v greater than c, which is impossible.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is incorrect. So maybe the four A's are not all moving in the same direction. So, perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving in such a way that their momenta sum up to the initial momentum, but their energy is higher than what I calculated before.

Wait, perhaps I should include the initial kinetic energy of the antiproton, which I've neglected so far. Because earlier, I approximated E_initial as 2 m_p c², but if the antiproton is moving, its energy is higher than m_p c².

So perhaps I can't neglect the kinetic energy. Let me think: the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c², and the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small, so gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), but let's model it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can model this with the following approach:

1. Use conservation of energy: E_initial = E_final.
2. Use conservation of momentum: p_initial = p_final.

Let me write these equations.

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

E_final = sum of energies of four A particles: 4 gamma_A m_A c².

p_final = sum of momenta of four A particles: 4 gamma_A m_A u, assuming all move in the same direction.

Wait, but this leads to the same problem as before, which was that the momentum equation gives v >c when using the gamma_A from energy conservation. So perhaps the assumption that all four A's are moving in the same direction is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps two A's are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but that complicates the momentum equation.

Wait, perhaps each A is moving in the same direction, but their velocities are such that the momentum sum is possible. Alternatively, perhaps the A's are moving with a velocity that's a significant fraction of c, making gamma_A larger, which would make the energy equation require a higher initial energy, which would mean the antiproton's kinetic energy isn't negligible.

Wait, perhaps I should not neglect the initial kinetic energy. Let me include it.

So, E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

The energy of the A's is 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

And for momentum:

4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma_p m_p v.

Hmm, but I have two equations with two variables: gamma_A and u (since v is linked to gamma_p).

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express gamma_p in terms of v, and then express gamma_A and u in terms of gamma_p.

Wait, maybe it's better to assume that the initial velocity v is such that gamma_p is close to 1, but not exactly 1. But perhaps without knowing v, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption about gamma_p. Let me think: since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²). Let's let beta_p = v/c; then gamma_p = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_p²).

But beta_p is small, so gamma_p ≈ 1 + (beta_p^2)/2.

But maybe I can write beta_p in terms of gamma_p.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write gamma_p as approximately 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe let's consider that the initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c² plus some small kinetic energy. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the initial kinetic energy of the antiproton is small compared to the rest mass. So, E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v^2.

But perhaps another approach: since the problem asks for the velocity of A, perhaps I can find u in terms of m_p and m_A.

Wait, considering that the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can model this as an inelastic collision where the products are moving at a certain velocity. But with four particles, this is challenging.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the total rest mass energy after the annihilation is 4 m_A c². So, the available energy is much larger than this? Let me compute 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, and the initial rest mass is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. So the initial rest mass is about 1876 MeV, and the products have a rest mass of 1200 MeV. So, there's kinetic energy available.

Hmm, perhaps the products are moving with some velocity determined by the available energy.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of invariant mass. The invariant mass squared s is given by (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

In the initial state, E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c², and p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

So s_initial = (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2.

Which is s_initial = [m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c²]^2 - [gamma_p m_p v c]^2.

Let me compute this:

= [ m_p c² (1 + gamma_p) ]^2 - [ gamma_p m_p v c ]^2.

= m_p² c^4 (1 + gamma_p)^2 - gamma_p² m_p² v^2 c².

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate s_initial as (sum of 4-momenta)^2.

Wait, but perhaps in the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero, so s_initial would be (sum of energies)^2.

Wait, s_initial is the same in all frames, so perhaps I can compute it in the center-of-mass frame, where the initial momentum is zero.

In that frame, the initial energy is E_cm = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

But the initial momentum is zero, so s_initial = (E_cm)^2.

But in the center-of-mass frame, the products must have zero total momentum. So the four A particles must arrange themselves such that their total momentum is zero.

In that case, the products' rest mass would be sqrt(s_initial) / c².

Wait, but the products have a rest mass of 4 m_A c². So, 4 m_A c² = sqrt(s_initial) → s_initial = (4 m_A c²)^2.

But wait, s_initial is also equal to (E_cm)^2 = (m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c² )^2.

So:

(4 m_A c²)^2 = (m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c² )^2.

Take square roots:

4 m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma_p).

Divide both sides by c²:

4 m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p).

So,

1 + gamma_p = 4 m_A / m_p.

m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So 4 *300 = 1200.

1200 / 938 ≈ 1.28.

So 1 + gamma_p = 1.28 → gamma_p ≈ 0.28.

Wait, but that's impossible because gamma_p is always ≥1. Gamma_p is the Lorentz factor of the antiproton, which must be ≥1. So this suggests that 4 m_A < m_p (1 + gamma_p) is impossible, unless gamma_p is ≥ something. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the invariant mass approach. Let me re-examine.

The invariant mass s is given by (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2.

So in the initial state, sum E = E_p + E_pbar.

sum p = p_pbar (since proton is at rest).

In the center-of-mass frame, sum p is zero, so s = (E_cm)^2 = (sum E)^2.

But in the lab frame (proton at rest, antiproton moving), s = (E_p + E_pbar)^2 - (p_pbar c)^2.

Which is s = [m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c²]^2 - [gamma_p m_p v c]^2.

Which can be written as s = [m_p c² (1 + gamma_p)]^2 - [gamma_p m_p v c]^2.

But s is also equal to (sum E_products)^2 - (sum p_products c)^2.

In the products, since it's four A particles, their invariant mass would be s = (4 m_A c²)^2, assuming they are all at rest relative to each other. But that's not correct because in reality, they have kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the invariant mass. The invariant mass of the system is the same, regardless of the frame. So s is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame, which is (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2.

So, in the initial state, s_initial = (m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c²)^2 - (gamma_p m_p v c)^2.

Expanding this, we get:

s_initial = m_p² c^4 (1 + gamma_p)^2 - gamma_p^2 m_p² v² c².

Hmm, not so helpful.

Wait, but in the center-of-mass frame, s_initial = (sum E_cm)^2, which is (E_p + E_pbar)^2.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the threshold condition.

The threshold condition for producing particles is when the kinetic energy is just enough to produce the rest mass of the products. But in this case, the products have rest mass 4 m_A c², which is 1200 MeV. The initial rest mass is 2 m_p c², which is 1876 MeV. So the initial rest mass is larger than the product's rest mass, so the reaction is possible even without any kinetic energy, but in reality, the antiproton is moving, so there's some kinetic energy available.

Wait, but perhaps the velocity of the A particles can be found using the conservation of energy and momentum in the center-of-mass frame.

In the center-of-mass frame, the initial total momentum is zero. So the products must have zero total momentum. So the four A particles must arrange themselves such that their momenta cancel out.

Assuming that all four A particles are moving with the same speed u, but in opposite directions, perhaps in pairs. For example, two moving in the +x direction and two in the -x direction. Then, their momenta would cancel each other, leading to zero total momentum.

If that's the case, then each A particle has the same speed u, and their directions are arranged symmetrically. So the total momentum would be zero, which fits the center-of-mass frame.

Then, the energy in the center-of-mass frame would be 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So, in the center-of-mass frame:

E_cm = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

But E_cm is also equal to the sum of the initial energies in the center-of-mass frame.

Wait, but how to relate this to the lab frame where the antiproton is moving slowly.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should focus on the fact that the velocity we're looking for is for each A particle, assuming they all move with the same speed.

Another approach: use the relation between energy and momentum for each A particle.

Each A has energy E_A = gamma_A m_A c², and momentum p_A = gamma_A m_A u.

So for each A, (E_A)^2 = (p_A c)^2 + (m_A c²)^2.

Now, considering four A particles, each with momentum p_A. But their directions are such that the total momentum is equal to the initial momentum p_initial = m_p v.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as two A⁺ and two A⁻ moving in pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the velocity of the center of mass. Let me denote u as the velocity of each A particle in the lab frame.

Wait, maybe using the fact that in the center-of-mass frame, each A particle has the same speed, and then transforming their velocities to the lab frame, where the antiproton is moving.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the velocity addition formula.

But this is getting too involved, and I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of another approach.

Wait, considering that the options are specific velocities, maybe I can compute gamma for each option and see which one fits the energy and momentum conservation.

Let me compute gamma for each option:

Option A: 0.77c → beta=0.77.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.77)^2) → 1/sqrt(1 - 0.5929) → 1/sqrt(0.4071) ≈ 1/0.638 ≈1.568.

Option B: 0.96c → beta=0.96.

gamma ≈ 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) ≈1/0.28→3.57.

Option C: 0.91c → beta=0.91.

gamma ≈1/sqrt(1 - 0.8281)=1/sqrt(0.1719)=1/0.4146≈2.41.

Option D: 0.86c → beta=0.86.

gamma ≈1/sqrt(1 - 0.7396)=1/sqrt(0.2604)=1/0.5103≈1.96.

Now, let's consider energy conservation.

Assuming that the four A particles share the available energy.

Wait, but without knowing the initial momentum, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the initial energy is roughly 2 m_p c² plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton.

But wait, perhaps I can model the system as the initial energy being 2 m_p c², and the four A's each having gamma_A m_A c². So 4 gamma_A m_A c² =2 m_p c² → gamma_A = (2 m_p c²)/(4 m_A c²) )= m_p/(2 m_A) =938/(2*300)=1.563.

Which matches option A's gamma of ~1.568.

So, if the four A's are moving in the same direction, their gamma would be about 1.563, leading to a velocity of ~0.77c.

But earlier, this led to a problem with the momentum equation, producing v >c.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the momentum equation.

Earlier, I had:

4 gamma_A m_A u = m_p v.

With gamma_A=1.563, u=0.77c.

So,

4 *1.563 *300 MeV/c² *0.77c = m_p v.

Calculate the left side: 4 *1.563 *300 *0.77 *c ≈ 4 *1.563 ≈6.252; 6.252 *300=1875.6; 1875.6 *0.77≈1443.912.

So left side ≈1443.912 c MeV/c² → 1443.912 MeV/c.

Right side: m_p v=938 MeV/c² *v.

So,

1443.912 MeV/c =938 MeV/c² *v.

Multiply both sides by c:

1443.912 MeV =938 MeV *v.

So v=1443.912/938 ≈1.538 c.

Which is greater than c, which is impossible.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, this suggests that our initial assumption is wrong. So, perhaps the four A particles are not all moving in the same direction, leading to a lower total momentum.

Wait, perhaps some of the A's are moving in the opposite direction. Let's say that two are moving in the +x direction, and two in the -x direction, each with speed u. Then, the total momentum would be 2 gamma_A m_A u - 2 gamma_A m_A u =0. That can't be right because the initial momentum isn't zero.

Alternatively, perhaps three are moving in +x and one in -x, but that wouldn't balance it either.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) are moving in opposite directions, but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps the A's are moving in such a way that their momentum cancels each other except for a net momentum equal to the initial. For example, two A's moving in +x and two in -x, but with their velocities such that the total momentum is m_p v.

Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps each A has speed u, but in different directions such that the total momentum is m_p v.

Hmm, without knowing the exact angles, this is difficult.

Wait, perhaps each A is moving at velocity u with respect to the center-of-mass frame, and the center-of-mass frame is moving with velocity U relative to the lab frame.

Wait, let me think about the velocity of the center-of-mass frame.

The velocity U of the center-of-mass frame (cm frame) relative to the lab frame can be found using the total momentum.

In the lab frame, the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

The total energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

The velocity of the cm frame is U = (p_initial c²) / E_initial.

So,

U = [gamma_p m_p v c² ] / [m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c² ].

Simplify:

U = [gamma_p v c² ] / [c² (1 + gamma_p) ].

Cancel c²:

U = gamma_p v / (1 + gamma_p).

Hmm, interesting.

Now, in the cm frame, the four A particles are moving with some velocity u_cm. But I'm not sure how to relate u_cm to the lab frame's u.

But perhaps I can use the velocity addition formula.

In the cm frame, each A has velocity u_cm. Then, in the lab frame, their velocity would be:

u = (u_cm + U) / (1 + (u_cm U)/c² ).

Hmm, but without knowing u_cm, this is not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps in the cm frame, the A's are at rest. But that can't be the case because their rest mass is less than the initial rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the A's are produced at rest in the cm frame, but that's not possible because the initial rest mass is higher than the product's rest mass. So the A's must have some kinetic energy.

Wait, but earlier, the invariant mass approach may have led to a mistake, so perhaps I should re-express it.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the velocity of the center-of-mass frame first, then find out the velocity of the A's in that frame, then transform it to the lab frame.

But this requires knowing the velocity of the A's in the cm frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the A's are all moving in the same direction in the cm frame, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the A's are produced with some velocity in the cm frame, and then their velocities in the lab frame can be found using the velocity addition formula.

But without more information, this seems difficult.

Wait, given the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps the correct answer is option A (0.77c), based on the earlier energy calculation, even though the momentum conservation gives an impossible v, but perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that all four A's are moving in the same direction is incorrect, and the correct velocity is lower, perhaps option D (0.86c).

Wait, but option D has a gamma of ~1.96.

Let me see: if gamma_A=1.96, then u=0.86c.

So, let me compute the energy and momentum.

Energy equation: 4 *1.96 *300 = 4 * 588 = 2352 MeV.

Initial energy E_initial = 2 m_p c² + kinetic energy of antiproton.

2 m_p c² is 2 *938 =1876 MeV.

So, 2352 MeV = 1876 MeV + KE_antiproton.

So KE_antiproton = 2352 -1876 = 476 MeV.

Which is possible, because the antiproton's rest energy is 938 MeV, so 476 MeV is about half of that, which would imply that the antiproton is moving at a significant speed, not slow.

But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so the kinetic energy should be small compared to the rest energy.

So, option D's gamma would require the antiproton to have significant KE, which contradicts the problem statement.

So perhaps option A is correct, but the problem is with the momentum equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that all four A's are moving in the same direction. If they are not, then the momentum equation would not lead to v> c.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the A's are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum, but their energy is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the four A's are moving in pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions, but with some velocity such that their momenta sum to the initial momentum.

But this is getting too time-consuming, and perhaps I should proceed to the step-by-step solution.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process:

### Key Information:
- The reaction is \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \).
- The antiproton is moving slowly, implying its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest energy.
- The rest energy of each \( A \)-particle is \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \).
- The proton and antiproton have rest energy \( m_p c^2 \approx 938 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Conservation Laws:
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total initial energy equals the total final energy.
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{proton}} + E_{\text{antiproton}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma_p m_p c^2
   \]
   where \( \gamma_p \) is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, \( \gamma_p \approx 1 + \frac{v^2}{2c^2} \), and the kinetic energy is small compared to the rest energy.

   The final energy is the sum of the energies of the four \( A \)-particles:
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2
   \]
   where \( \gamma_A \) is the Lorentz factor for the \( A \)-particles.

2. **Momentum Conservation**: The total initial momentum equals the total final momentum. The initial momentum is due to the antiproton:
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_p m_p v
   \]
   The final momentum is the sum of the momenta of the four \( A \)-particles:
   \[
   p_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A u
   \]
   where \( u \) is the velocity of the \( A \)-particles.

### Simplifying Assumptions:
- The antiproton is moving slowly, so \( \gamma_p \approx 1 \), and the initial momentum is approximately \( p_{\text{initial}} \approx m_p v \).
- The \( A \)-particles are assumed to move with the same velocity \( u \) in the same direction.

### Solving for \( \gamma_A \) and \( u \):
From energy conservation:
\[
4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 = 2 m_p c^2
\]
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}
\]
Substituting \( m_p = 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{938}{2 \cdot 300} \approx 1.563
\]

From momentum conservation:
\[
4 \gamma_A m_A u = m_p v
\]
Substituting \( \gamma_A \approx 1.563 \), \( m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), and \( m_p = 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
\[
4 (1.563)(300) u = 938 v
\]
\[
1875.6 u = 938 v
\]
\[
v = \frac{1875.6}{938} u \approx 2.0 u
\]

Using the relation \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}} \), solve for \( u \):
\[
1.563 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}
\]
\[
1 - u^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1.563)^2} \approx 0.4096
\]
\[
u^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904
\]
\[
u/c = \sqrt{0.5904} \approx 0.768
\]
Thus, \( u \approx 0.768c \), which corresponds to option **A (0.77c)**.

### Momentum Check:
Substitute \( u \approx 0.768c \) into \( v = 2.0u \):
\[
v \approx 2.0 (0.768c) = 1.536c
\]
This result is unphysical, as \( v > c \). This discrepancy suggests the assumption that all \( A \)-particles move in the same direction is invalid. However, based on the energy calculation, the velocity of the \( A \)-particles is closest to **0.77c**.
