Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. Okay, the problem is about finding the expectation value of an operator involving sigma_z and sigma_x for a spin-half particle. Hmm, okay.

The particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of sigma_z. The operator we're looking at is 10σ_z +5σ_x. I need to find the expectation value of this operator.

Wait, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. And for a given state, it's calculated as ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

So, breaking it down, the operator is 10σ_z +5σ_x. So the expectation value would be the sum of the expectations of each term. So, E = ⟨10σ_z +5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩.

Right, so I can compute each expectation separately and then combine them.

First, let's find ⟨σ_z⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues are known: σ_z |↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩, and σ_z |↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩.

So, the expectation value ⟨σ_z⟩ is the probability of measuring +1 times (+1) plus the probability of measuring -1 times (-1).

Looking at the state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let me compute the coefficients squared for the probabilities.

The coefficient of |↑⟩ is 0.5, so the probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The coefficient of |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so probability is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75.

So, ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

So that part is -0.5. Then, 10⟨σ_z⟩ would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.0.

Now, onto ⟨σ_x⟩. Hmm, σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Its expectation value is a bit trickier because the state isn't an eigenstate of σ_x, I think.

Wait, the eigenstates of σ_x are (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) and (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. But my state is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let's see.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute ⟨σ_x⟩ directly using the expectation formula. Since σ_x is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], then the expectation value is ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩.

Let me write ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0;1]. So the state ψ is 0.5 [1;0] + (sqrt(3)/2) [0;1] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Now, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, to compute ψ† σ_x ψ, that's [0.5*0 + (sqrt(3)/2)*1 , 0.5*1 + (sqrt(3)/2)*0 ]^T multiplied by ψ.

Wait, maybe I should write it out step by step.

Compute σ_x |ψ⟩ first.

σ_x |ψ⟩ = σ_x [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [ sqrt(3)/2 ; 0.5 ].

Then, ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩ is the inner product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

So, 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.

Calculating each term: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (sqrt(3)/4), and the second term is the same. So adding them gives (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σ_x⟩ is sqrt(3)/2. Let me compute that numerically. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 1.732 /2 = 0.866.

So, 5⟨σ_x⟩ is 5 * 0.866 = 4.33.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check that calculation because sometimes signs can trick me. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the inner product is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

So 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (0.5 *1.732)/2 ≈ (0.866)/2 ≈ 0.433.

And sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 is (1.732/2)*0.5 ≈ (0.866)*0.5 ≈ 0.433.

Adding them gives 0.433 + 0.433 ≈ 0.866, which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. So yes, correct.

So putting it all together, the expectation value E = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, wait, earlier, I had 10⟨σ_z⟩ = -5.0, and 5⟨σ_x⟩ is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5*(0.866) = 4.33.

So, E = (-5.0) + 4.33 ≈ (-5 +4.33) = -0.67.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 5*(sqrt(3)/2) more accurately. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205080757. So 1.73205080757 / 2 = 0.866025403785. Multiply by 5: 0.866025403785 *5 =4.330127018925.

So E = (-5.0) +4.330127018925 ≈ -0.669872981075.

So approximately -0.67, but let me check the options.

The options are A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D) 0.85.

So, -0.67 is close to -0.7. So option C is -0.7.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of the σ_x expectation. Let me double-check it.

Another approach: the expectation value of σ_x is (ψ_x†) σ_x (ψ_x).

Wait, another way to compute it is to realize that for a spin-1/2 system, the expectation value of σ_x for a state |θ, φ⟩ is sinθ cosφ.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps using the Bloch sphere approach.

The given state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let's write this in terms of the Bloch sphere. The state can be written as (a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩), where a = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2.

In the Bloch vector representation, the vector is (2a*, 2b*), but wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, the Bloch vector components are (x, y, z) = (2 Re(b), 2 Im(b), 2 Re(a) - 1?) Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the state can be written as |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓⟩.

Wait, in this case, the state is (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So, since the coefficients are real and positive, the phase φ is 0. So, cos(θ/2) = 0.5, sin(θ/2) = sqrt(3)/2.

So, θ/2 = 60 degrees, because cos(60)=0.5, sin(60)=sqrt(3)/2. So θ = 120 degrees, or 2π/3 radians.

The Bloch vector components would then be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). Since φ=0, this becomes (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So, sinθ = sin(2π/3) = sqrt(3)/2, cosθ = cos(2π/3) = -0.5.

So the Bloch vector is (sqrt(3)/2, 0, -0.5).

The expectation value of σ_x is the x-component of the Bloch vector. So ⟨σ_x⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, same as before.

So, the calculation was correct.

So, the expectation value of the operator is E = 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866) = (-5) +4.33 = -0.67.

Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So the answer is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me see the options again. Option C is -0.7, which is exactly what I got. So yes, that's the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to \( \sigma_z \) with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The probabilities of measuring \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) are given by the squared coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in \( \psi \), respectively.

- Coefficient of \( |\uparrow\rangle \): \( 0.5 \), so probability \( = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \).
- Coefficient of \( |\downarrow\rangle \): \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), so probability \( = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75 \).

Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) swaps \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \). To compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \), we write \( \psi \) as a column vector:
\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The matrix representation of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
First, compute \( \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \):
\[
\sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Next, compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \), which is the inner product of \( \psi \) and \( \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \):
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix} = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866).
\]
Simplify:
\[
\langle O \rangle = -5.0 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounded to one decimal place, \( \langle O \rangle \approx -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is closest to **-0.7**, which corresponds to option **C**.

Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. Okay, the problem is about finding the expectation value of an operator involving sigma_z and sigma_x for a spin-half particle. Hmm, okay.

The particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of sigma_z. The operator we're looking at is 10σ_z +5σ_x. I need to find the expectation value of this operator.

Wait, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. And for a given state, it's calculated as ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

So, breaking it down, the operator is 10σ_z +5σ_x. So the expectation value would be the sum of the expectations of each term. So, E = ⟨10σ_z +5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩.

Right, so I can compute each expectation separately and then combine them.

First, let's find ⟨σ_z⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues are known: σ_z |↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩, and σ_z |↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩.

So, the expectation value ⟨σ_z⟩ is the probability of measuring +1 times (+1) plus the probability of measuring -1 times (-1).

Looking at the state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let me compute the coefficients squared for the probabilities.

The coefficient of |↑⟩ is 0.5, so the probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The coefficient of |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so probability is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75.

So, ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

So that part is -0.5. Then, 10⟨σ_z⟩ would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.0.

Now, onto ⟨σ_x⟩. Hmm, σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Its expectation value is a bit trickier because the state isn't an eigenstate of σ_x, I think.

Wait, the eigenstates of σ_x are (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) and (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. But my state is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let's see.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute ⟨σ_x⟩ directly using the expectation formula. Since σ_x is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], then the expectation value is ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩.

Let me write ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0;1]. So the state ψ is 0.5 [1;0] + (sqrt(3)/2) [0;1] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Now, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, to compute ψ† σ_x ψ, that's [0.5*0 + (sqrt(3)/2)*1 , 0.5*1 + (sqrt(3)/2)*0 ]^T multiplied by ψ.

Wait, maybe I should write it out step by step.

Compute σ_x |ψ⟩ first.

σ_x |ψ⟩ = σ_x [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [ sqrt(3)/2 ; 0.5 ].

Then, ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩ is the inner product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

So, 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.

Calculating each term: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (sqrt(3)/4), and the second term is the same. So adding them gives (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σ_x⟩ is sqrt(3)/2. Let me compute that numerically. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 1.732 /2 = 0.866.

So, 5⟨σ_x⟩ is 5 * 0.866 = 4.33.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check that calculation because sometimes signs can trick me. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the inner product is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

So 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (0.5 *1.732)/2 ≈ (0.866)/2 ≈ 0.433.

And sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 is (1.732/2)*0.5 ≈ (0.866)*0.5 ≈ 0.433.

Adding them gives 0.433 + 0.433 ≈ 0.866, which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. So yes, correct.

So putting it all together, the expectation value E = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, wait, earlier, I had 10⟨σ_z⟩ = -5.0, and 5⟨σ_x⟩ is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5*(0.866) = 4.33.

So, E = (-5.0) + 4.33 ≈ (-5 +4.33) = -0.67.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 5*(sqrt(3)/2) more accurately. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205080757. So 1.73205080757 / 2 = 0.866025403785. Multiply by 5: 0.866025403785 *5 =4.330127018925.

So E = (-5.0) +4.330127018925 ≈ -0.669872981075.

So approximately -0.67, but let me check the options.

The options are A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D) 0.85.

So, -0.67 is close to -0.7. So option C is -0.7.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of the σ_x expectation. Let me double-check it.

Another approach: the expectation value of σ_x is (ψ_x†) σ_x (ψ_x).

Wait, another way to compute it is to realize that for a spin-1/2 system, the expectation value of σ_x for a state |θ, φ⟩ is sinθ cosφ.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps using the Bloch sphere approach.

The given state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let's write this in terms of the Bloch sphere. The state can be written as (a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩), where a = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2.

In the Bloch vector representation, the vector is (2a*, 2b*), but wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, the Bloch vector components are (x, y, z) = (2 Re(b), 2 Im(b), 2 Re(a) - 1?) Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the state can be written as |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓⟩.

Wait, in this case, the state is (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So, since the coefficients are real and positive, the phase φ is 0. So, cos(θ/2) = 0.5, sin(θ/2) = sqrt(3)/2.

So, θ/2 = 60 degrees, because cos(60)=0.5, sin(60)=sqrt(3)/2. So θ = 120 degrees, or 2π/3 radians.

The Bloch vector components would then be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). Since φ=0, this becomes (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So, sinθ = sin(2π/3) = sqrt(3)/2, cosθ = cos(2π/3) = -0.5.

So the Bloch vector is (sqrt(3)/2, 0, -0.5).

The expectation value of σ_x is the x-component of the Bloch vector. So ⟨σ_x⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, same as before.

So, the calculation was correct.

So, the expectation value of the operator is E = 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866) = (-5) +4.33 = -0.67.

Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So the answer is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me see the options again. Option C is -0.7, which is exactly what I got. So yes, that's the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to \( \sigma_z \) with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The probabilities of measuring \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) are given by the squared coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in \( \psi \), respectively.

- Coefficient of \( |\uparrow\rangle \): \( 0.5 \), so probability \( = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \).
- Coefficient of \( |\downarrow\rangle \): \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), so probability \( = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75 \).

Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) swaps \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \). To compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \), we write \( \psi \) as a column vector:
\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The matrix representation of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
First, compute \( \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \):
\[
\sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Next, compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \), which is the inner product of \( \psi \) and \( \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \):
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix} = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866).
\]
Simplify:
\[
\langle O \rangle = -5.0 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounded to one decimal place, \( \langle O \rangle \approx -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is closest to **-0.7**, which corresponds to option **C**.

Answer: C
