Okay, so I have this electrochemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me think through what I remember from my studies.

The question is about the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in different solutions—basic versus acidic. The statement is incomplete, and I need to fill in the blanks with the right terms. The options are combinations of "weaker/stronger" and "faster/slower" for the two parts.

First, I remember that in electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidant relates to its standard electrode potential. The higher the potential, the stronger the oxidizing agent. For oxygen, I think its standard reduction potential depends on the solution's pH.

Wait, I recall that oxygen's reduction reaction is O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^- in basic solution. The standard potential for this reaction is about +0.40 V (or maybe 0.36 V? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact value). In acidic solution, the reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O, and the standard potential is around +1.23 V. Oh right, so in acidic conditions, the E° is higher, meaning oxygen is a stronger oxidant there.

So thermodynamically, in basic solution, oxygen has a lower E°, making it a weaker oxidant compared to acidic conditions. So the first blank should be "weaker" in basic solutions.

Now the kinetic part. Kinetics is about how fast the reaction proceeds. I think that in acidic solutions, the reaction is faster because of the presence of H+ ions. The reaction in acidic solution (O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O) might proceed more quickly because H+ can help in the reaction mechanism, perhaps by stabilizing intermediates or facilitating electron transfer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Could it be the other way around? Maybe the reaction in basic solution is faster because OH- is a better proton source or something? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction in acidic solution is faster because the reaction quotient is more favorable. Or perhaps the activation energy is lower in acidic conditions because the necessary protons are more available.

Wait, another angle: the rate of an electrochemical reaction can depend on the concentration of ions. In acidic solutions, the H+ concentration is high, which could increase the reaction rate. Alternatively, higher ionic strength might affect the reaction rate. I'm a bit stuck here, but I think that in acidic solutions, oxygen's reaction is faster because the E° is higher, making the reaction more spontaneous and thus kinetically favorable.

Wait, no, wait. Kinetics and thermodynamics are different. Thermodynamics tells about the feasibility (ΔG), and kinetics about the rate (activation energy, etc.). So even if a reaction is thermodynamically favorable (like in acidic solution, where E° is higher), it doesn't necessarily mean it's faster.

But wait, perhaps in acidic solution, the reaction is faster because the ions involved (like H+) are present in higher concentrations, which can increase the reaction rate. Or maybe the reaction in acidic solution is more likely to proceed due to lower activation energy because of the environment.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction in basic solution is slower because the OH- ions make the solution less conductive, but that might not be the main factor. Or perhaps the reaction is more kinetically favorable in acidic because it's a more concentrated environment for the necessary ions.

Wait, I think I remember something about the rate of oxygen reduction. In acidic solutions, the reaction is faster because the reaction involves H+ ions which can increase the ionic interactions, making the electron transfer more efficient. Or perhaps in basic solutions, the reaction is slower because the OH- ions might hinder the approach of the reacting species, increasing activation energy.

Alternatively, I've heard that in acidic conditions, the O2 reduction proceeds faster due to the higher concentration of H+ ions, which are part of the reaction mechanism. So the reaction is kinetically faster in acidic solutions.

So putting it together: Thermodynamically, in basic solution, O2 is a weaker oxidant. Kinetically, in acidic solutions, the reaction is faster.

Wait, but let me double-check the standard potentials. Yes, in acidic (E°=+1.23 V) and basic (E°=+0.40 V). So O2 is a stronger oxidant in acidic. So thermodynamically, in basic it's weaker.

The kinetic part: the question says "kinetically, oxygen reacts … in acidic solutions." So it's faster in acidic.

So the first blank is weaker, the second is faster.

Wait the first part is "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." So it's a weaker oxidant in basic, correct.

The second part is "Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions." So in acidic, the reaction is faster.

So the options are looking for the combination of 'weaker' and 'faster'.

Looking at the options:

A) stronger – faster → No, first part is weaker.

B) stronger – slower → No.

C) weaker – faster → Yes, this matches.

D) weaker - slower → No.

So the correct option is option C, weaker and faster.

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions, considering both thermodynamic and kinetic factors.

1. **Thermodynamic Analysis**:  
   The standard reduction potential of oxygen depends on the solution's pH. In basic solutions, the reduction reaction is:  
   \[
   \text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4e^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^-
   \]  
   with a standard electrode potential \( E^\circ \approx +0.40 \, \text{V} \). In acidic solutions, the reaction is:  
   \[
   \text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}
   \]  
   with \( E^\circ \approx +1.23 \, \text{V} \). Since the standard potential is higher in acidic solutions, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions. Therefore, in basic solutions, oxygen is a **weaker oxidant**.

2. **Kinetic Analysis**:  
   Kinetics refers to the rate of the reaction. In acidic solutions, the reaction involves \( \text{H}^+ \) ions, which can facilitate the reaction mechanism by stabilizing intermediates or lowering the activation energy. Additionally, the higher concentration of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions in acidic solutions can increase ionic interactions, making the reaction proceed faster. Thus, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.

3. **Combining the Results**:  
   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker oxidant** in basic solutions, and kinetically, it reacts **faster** in acidic solutions. This matches the combination described in option **C**.

The second part is "Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions." So in acidic, the reaction is faster.

So the options are looking for the combination of 'weaker' and 'faster'.

Looking at the options:

A) stronger – faster → No, first part is weaker.

So the correct option is option C, weaker and faster.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions, considering both thermodynamic and kinetic factors.

1. **Thermodynamic Analysis**:  
   The standard reduction potential of oxygen depends on the solution's pH. In basic solutions, the reduction reaction is:
