Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. It's about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Right, so the nucleophile adds to the beta carbon, forming an enolate, which then can attack another electrophilic site.

The problem has three parts, labeled A, B, and C, each giving a reaction and asking for the products. The options give possible products for each, so I need to work through each reaction step by step.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. So, in this case, NaOEt is a base, and EtOH is the solvent. The Michael reaction typically involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile here because it's a diester, and in basic conditions, it can form an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the other carbonyl compound.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the substituents in the E configuration. Alternatively, the structure is more like CH2CH2 with the substituents on the opposite side, but maybe I should draw it. Wait, it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with a p-tolyl group on carbon 3 and a methyl ester on carbon 2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but in this case, substituting at the 3-position. So maybe it's CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl) group, with the ester on the adjacent carbon?

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like (E)-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or wait, no. Let's think about the numbering. Acrylate is propenoate, so positions 1, 2, 3. The (E) configuration would mean that the higher priority groups are opposite. So for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the p-tolyl group on C3 and the ester on C1.

So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 and a p-tolyl group at C3, but wait, that doesn't make sense because acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or perhaps the substituent is on the double bond. Let me clarify.

Wait, the correct structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. No, wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Or perhaps it's (E)-CH2CH(p-tolyl)COOCH3? I'm a bit confused, but maybe it's best to proceed.

In any case, the Michael donor is dimethyl malonate. When it forms the enolate, the enolate (which is strong) attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate).

So, in the reaction, the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 part, since the acrylate is CH2=CH-p-tolyl-CO-OCH3). So, the enolate would attack the CH2 part, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, the structure should be: the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the CH2? Or maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(C6H4-4-CH3)-CO-OCH3? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the product.

When the enolate attacks the beta position, you get a new addition product. The product would be an addition of the malonate to the acrylate.

After the attack, the two carbonyl groups (from the malonate and the acrylate) would be connected. Let me think. So, the dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. The enolate would be the conjugate base, so when it attacks the acrylate, the attack is at the beta carbon of the acrylate.

Wait, so the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl substituent on the central carbon (the one adjacent to the double bond). So, the structure is more like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So, when the enolate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 part), the addition would lead to the formation of a new carbon chain.

Wait, maybe I should write the structures more clearly.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH2. So, it's CH2(CO2Me)2. The enolate would form at the central carbon, making it a strong nucleophile.

The acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. The enolate from the malonate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2) of the acrylate. So, the attack would be on the CH2, breaking the double bond, adding the malonate's carbon to that position.

So, the product would be a new molecule where the malonate is attached to the acrylate.

Let me try to draw this mentally. The acrylate has the structure:

CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3.

The enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the CH2 group, so the CH2 becomes CH- attached to the malonate.

Wait, perhaps the product would be a four-carbon chain. The attack would be:

The enolate's carbon (from CH2(CO2Me)2) adds to the CH2 group of the acrylate.

Wait, perhaps the product would be CH2(CO2Me)2-CH2-CH(C6H4-4-CH3)-COOCH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism is:

The enolate (CH(-)CO2Me)2 attacks the beta carbon (CH2) of the acrylate (CH2=CH-p-tolyl-CO-OCH3). So, the CH2+ would be the site of attack.

Wait, actually, the Michael addition would form a new bond between the enolate's carbon and the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

So, the product would have the structure where the malonate's carbon is attached to the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So, the product would be something like CH2(CO2Me)2-CH2-CH(C6H4-4-CH3)-COOCH3. Wait, that can't be because the initial structure has a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So, the enolate attacks the CH2, leading to addition.

Wait, but when the enolate attacks the CH2, the double bond breaks, and the product is a single bond between the two.

Wait, perhaps the product is a new compound where the two carbonyls are connected. So, the malonate’s two COOCH3 groups would be at the ends, and the acrylate's p-tolyl group would be in the middle.

Wait, maybe the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. That would make sense because the malonate is adding two carbons, and the acrylate has one more, with the p-tolyl group in between.

So, the product A would be trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Looking at the options, both options A and B for A have that structure.

Now moving to reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile, with MeOH and H3O+.

Hmm, so the starting materials are 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The conditions are MeOH and H3O+, which are acidic conditions.

Wait, but wait, the Michael reaction typically occurs under basic conditions, but maybe in this case, it's a different setup. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate addition (Michael addition) but in acidic conditions.

Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine – let's think about this structure. Piperidine is a six-membered amine ring. The cyclohexene group is attached to the piperidine's nitrogen at position 1. So, the structure is a piperidine ring with a cyclohexene substituent on the nitrogen.

The other component is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is CH2=CH-C≡N, with the E configuration. Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN, but the E configuration would be CH2=CHCN because the nitrile is on one end and the CH2 on the other. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CN, with the substituents on opposite sides.

In the reaction, perhaps the piperidine is acting as a nucleophile. But wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine has a conjugate system. The cyclohexene is conjugated with the piperidine's lone pair, making it more nucleophilic.

So, the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile. The piperidine's enamine (since the cyclohexene is conjugated to the amine) would attack the beta position of the nitrile.

Wait, but in acidic conditions, maybe the piperidine is protonated, making it less nucleophilic. Hmm, that's conflicting. Alternatively, in the presence of acid, perhaps the enamine is formed, which is a strong nucleophile.

Wait, but 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine already. Enamines are known to be good nucleophiles in Michael additions. So, in this case, the enamine (the piperidine with the conjugated cyclohexene) would attack the beta position of the (E)-but-2-enenitrile.

So, the nitrile is the electrophilic part, and the enamine's nucleophilic carbon (the one adjacent to the nitrogen) attacks the beta carbon of the nitrile.

Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2-CH-CN. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CN. The enamine would attack the CH2 group (the beta position) of the nitrile.

So, the addition would be the enamine's carbon adding to the CH2, resulting in a new carbon chain.

So, the product would have the cyclohexenyl-piperidine connected to the CH2 group of the nitrile.

Wait, but in the product, the nitrile would be converted into an amine or something else? No, nitrile is a good electrophile, but in this case, the attack is just adding a new group.

Wait, the product after the Michael addition would be a new carbon-carbon bond between the enamine's carbon and the nitrile's beta carbon.

So, the product would be 3-(2-cyclohexenylpiperidinyl)butanenitrile? Or perhaps more accurately, the structure would have the cyclohexenylpiperidine attached to the CH2 next to the nitrile.

Wait, perhaps the product is 3-(2-cyclohex-1-enylpiperidinyl)butanenitrile. But looking at the options, they have something like 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile for product B in options A and B.

Wait, but wait, the product after the addition would have a ketone? No, perhaps during the reaction, the enamine is formed, the cyclohexene may open up.

Alternatively, maybe the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think again.

Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine has a structure where the piperidine is attached to a cyclohexene ring. When the enamine attacks the nitrile, the addition would form a new bond, and the double bond in the cyclohexene would become a single bond, perhaps moving the double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but after the addition, the cyclohexene part would become cyclohexane. So, the product would have a cyclohexane ring attached to the piperidine and the new carbon chain.

Wait, the product would have a cyclohexane ring connected via the piperidine to the butenitrile part. But I'm confused about the exact structure.

Wait, the options for B are either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

Hmm, 2-oxocyclohexyl would be a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 2.

Alternatively, 2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl would be a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group at position 2.

Wait, but the reaction is under acidic conditions (H3O+). So, maybe the enamine adds to the nitrile, and then under acidic work-up, the ring is hydrogenated or something else happens.

Wait, perhaps after the addition, the cyclohexene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the addition could form a new ring.

Alternatively, maybe the product has a cyclohexenyl group attached via a single bond. For instance, the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the possible options for B. The options A and B for B are 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, while C and D have 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

So, considering the reaction, I think that the product after the addition would have the cyclohexane ring connected to the carbon chain. The nitrile would remain as the substituent. But wait, the product would have a ketone if the cyclohexenyl group opens up.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the formation of a new six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the product involves the formation of a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. So, looking at the options, if the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, that would mean there's a ketone at position 2 of the cyclohexane ring, attached to the butanenitrile at position 3.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the reaction again.

The enamine (the piperidine with the cyclohexene) attacks the beta position of the nitrile (the CH2 part of CH2=CH-CN). So, the addition would form a new carbon chain, and the cyclohexene would become a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but the enamine attack would form a new bond, and perhaps the double bond in the cyclohexene would be broken, resulting in a single bond. So, the product would have a cyclohexyl group attached to the piperidine and the butenitrile.

Wait, but butenitrile is CH2CH2CN, so after attack, it becomes CH2-CH(CN)-CH2-cyclohexyl-piperidine or something like that. Hmm, but I'm not exactly certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary amine or something else. But given the options, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Moving on to reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, what's the starting material C? The question says "C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione." So, C is a reactant, and the product is given.

We need to find out what C is. The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the product has two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3, and a substituent at position 2 which is a 3-oxobutyl group.

But-3-en-2-one is CH2=C(H)C(O)CH3. So, it's a ketone with a double bond between C3 and C4.

In the presence of KOH and H2O, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of addition. Wait, but but-3-en-2-one is an alpha-beta unsaturated ketone. So, the Michael reaction could be happening here.

In the Michael reaction, a nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position. So, in this case, perhaps the enolate from C attacks the beta position of but-3-en-2-one.

The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. That suggests that the nucleophile (C) is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione that adds to the but-3-en-2-one.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3-dione has two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3. The attack would be from the enolate of the dione.

So, when the enolate from the dione attacks the beta position of the enone (but-3-en-2-one), the product would have the substituent added to the dione.

But the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the 3-oxobutyl group is attached to position 2 of the dione.

The 3-oxobutyl group is CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2. Wait, but but-3-en-2-one is CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2C(O)CH2, but with a double bond, so structure is CH2=C(H)-CH2-C(O)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-one is CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, but-3-en-2-one has the structure CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4: CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2C(O)CH2, but the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

But-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2C(O)CH2, but the double bond is between the third and fourth carbons. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-C(O)CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C-CH2-C(O)CH3? No, that's but-2-en-2-one.

Wait, the correct structure is CH2=C(CH2)COCH3? No, wait, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is CH2CH2C(O)CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2CH2C(O)CH2, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's best to think of it as CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, so CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3.

Wait, but that would be but-2-en-2-one, not but-3-en-2-one. Hmm. Alternatively, but-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2C=OCH2? I'm not sure, but perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CO-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-C(O)CH2 but with the double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3. No, that's but-2-en-2-one.

Wait, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is CH2=CH-CH2-C(O)R? No, perhaps it's not possible. Alternatively, maybe but-3-en-2-one is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3. That would be but-2-en-2-one, which is different. So, perhaps the starting material is correct as but-3-en-2-one.

In any case, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the substituent is a butyl group with a ketone at position 3 (3-oxobutyl).

So, the reaction is the enolate of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione (C) attacking the beta position of but-3-en-2-one.

The enolate would add to the beta carbon (the CH2 part) of the enone. The product would have the cyclohexane-1,3-dione connected to the added substituent.

So, the product would have the structure where the dione is connected to a CH2-CH2-C(O)- group.

Wait, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so the substituent is a 3-oxobutyl group attached to position 2 of the dione.

So, the 3-oxobutyl group is (CH2)2-C(O)-. So, the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(O)-, making the group -(CH2)2-C(O)-.

Wait, but butyl is four carbons. 3-oxobutyl is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-? No, but the substituent in the product is 3-oxobutyl, which is (CH2)2-C(O)-.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The substituent is -(CH2)2-C(O)-, attached to the cyclohexane at position 2.

So, the reaction is a Michael addition where the enolate from the dione attacks the beta carbon of the enone.

So, the product is cyclohexane-1,3-dione with a substituent at position 2, which is a 3-oxobutyl group.

So, what's the starting material C? The product is formed from the reaction of C + but-3-en-2-one with KOH and H2O. So, C is the enolate donor, which would be the cyclohexane-1,3-dione, but perhaps in its enolate form.

Wait, in the presence of KOH, the cyclohexane-1,3-dione would form an enolate, which would attack the beta position of the enone.

So, in the product, the dione is at positions 1 and 3, and the substituent is at position 2. So, the starting material C must be the enolate of the dione, but perhaps in the product, the dione is the same as the starting material.

Wait, but the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the starting material C must be the dione itself, which upon reaction with but-3-en-2-one, forms the product.

So, when the enolate of the dione attacks the but-3-en-2-one, the dione's position 2 would get the substituent. So, the product is the same dione but with the substituent added.

So, the starting material C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. When it reacts with but-3-en-2-one under basic conditions (KOH), the enolate forms and attacks the enone, leading to the addition product.

Now, looking at the options for C. The options are:

Option A: C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione

Option B: C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione

Option C: C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione

Option D: C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, in the reaction, the starting material is C, which is then consumed to form the product. So, in the reaction, C would be the enolate donor, which is the same as the dione.

So, the correct option for C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, looking at the options, options B and C have C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione. But I need to check the other parts.

Now, putting it all together:

For reaction A, the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. So, options A and B have this for A.

Reaction B has product either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (options A and B) or another structure (options C and D).

Reaction C's starting material is cyclohexane-1,3-dione (options B and C), leading to the product as given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = correct, B = correct, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

But in our analysis, C should be cyclohexane-1,3-dione, not the 2-hydroxy version. So, options B and C have C correct.

Looking at options:

Option B: A correct, B correct, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option C: A is trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)... which I thought was incorrect, so probably not.

Wait, the options for A have either trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl) or 3-(p-tolyl). Earlier, I thought the product A was trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

So, for option B, A is correct, B is correct, C is correct.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option B says:

A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate,

B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile,

C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, all three are correct. But the options for reaction B, some have 2-oxo, others have 2-hydroxy.

Wait, but when the reaction is done under acidic conditions, perhaps the product cyclizes or undergoes some tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reaction B. Let me think again. The starting material is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, which is an enamine. Enamines are good nucleophiles. The other reactant is (E)-but-2-enenitrile.

In the Michael addition, the enamine attacks the beta carbon (CH2) of the nitrile. So, the product would have the nitrile attached to a carbon connected to the enamine.

After the addition, perhaps the enamine's double bond is hydrogenated, leading to a cyclohexane ring. So, the product would have a cyclohexane ring attached to the piperidine and connected to the nitrile via a CH2 group.

Wait, but in the options, the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. So, the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 2. How would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the formation of a new ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product after the addition is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for the correct option based on the majority of the analysis.

So, for reaction A, the product is option A's structure.

For reaction B, the product is either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or another structure. I think the correct product would have the cyclohexane ring with a ketone, as formed upon hydrogenation of the cyclohexene ring, but I'm not entirely certain.

Reaction C's starting material is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which is option B and C.

So, combining all, option B seems to have:

A = correct,

B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile,

C = correct.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option B) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate,

B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile,

C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Yes, that's correct.

Options C and D have A as trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, which I don't think is correct.

So, the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves three Michael addition reactions, and the goal is to determine the correct reactants and major products for each reaction based on the given options.

### Reaction A: Dimethyl Malonate + Methyl (E)-3-(p-Tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)
- **Dimethyl malonate** is a strong nucleophile and forms an enolate under basic conditions. This enolate attacks the β-carbon of the α-β unsaturated carbonyl compound, **methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate**.
- The product of this reaction is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**, where the malonate adds to the acrylate, forming a new carbon-carbon bond and connecting the two carbonyl groups.
- Both options A and B correctly identify this product for reaction A.

### Reaction B: 1-(Cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-But-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) → (B)
- **1-(Cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine** is an enamine and acts as a nucleophile. The **(E)-but-2-enenitrile** is the α-β unsaturated electrophile.
- The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. Under acidic conditions, the cyclohexene ring in the enamine is likely hydrogenated to a cyclohexane ring.
- The product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**, where the cyclohexane ring has a ketone group at position 2.
- Options A and B correctly identify this product for reaction B.

### Reaction C: C + But-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) → 2-(3-Oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione
- The product is **2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**, where the enolate of **cyclohexane-1,3-dione** (C) attacks the β-carbon of **but-3-en-2-one**.
- The starting material C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**, as it is the enolate donor in this reaction.
- Options B and C correctly identify this starting material for reaction C.

### Final Answer
Combining the correct products and reactants for all three reactions:
- **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**
- **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**
- **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**

This matches **Option B**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. It's about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Right, so the nucleophile adds to the beta carbon, forming an enolate, which then can attack another electrophilic site.

The problem has three parts, labeled A, B, and C, each giving a reaction and asking for the products. The options give possible products for each, so I need to work through each reaction step by step.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. So, in this case, NaOEt is a base, and EtOH is the solvent. The Michael reaction typically involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile here because it's a diester, and in basic conditions, it can form an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the other carbonyl compound.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the substituents in the E configuration. Alternatively, the structure is more like CH2CH2 with the substituents on the opposite side, but maybe I should draw it. Wait, it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with a p-tolyl group on carbon 3 and a methyl ester on carbon 2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but in this case, substituting at the 3-position. So maybe it's CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl) group, with the ester on the adjacent carbon?

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like (E)-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or wait, no. Let's think about the numbering. Acrylate is propenoate, so positions 1, 2, 3. The (E) configuration would mean that the higher priority groups are opposite. So for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the p-tolyl group on C3 and the ester on C1.

So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 and a p-tolyl group at C3, but wait, that doesn't make sense because acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or perhaps the substituent is on the double bond. Let me clarify.

Wait, the correct structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. No, wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Or perhaps it's (E)-CH2CH(p-tolyl)COOCH3? I'm a bit confused, but maybe it's best to proceed.

In any case, the Michael donor is dimethyl malonate. When it forms the enolate, the enolate (which is strong) attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate).

So, in the reaction, the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 part, since the acrylate is CH2=CH-p-tolyl-CO-OCH3). So, the enolate would attack the CH2 part, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, the structure should be: the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the CH2? Or maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(C6H4-4-CH3)-CO-OCH3? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the product.

When the enolate attacks the beta position, you get a new addition product. The product would be an addition of the malonate to the acrylate.

After the attack, the two carbonyl groups (from the malonate and the acrylate) would be connected. Let me think. So, the dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. The enolate would be the conjugate base, so when it attacks the acrylate, the attack is at the beta carbon of the acrylate.

Wait, so the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl substituent on the central carbon (the one adjacent to the double bond). So, the structure is more like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So, when the enolate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 part), the addition would lead to the formation of a new carbon chain.

Wait, maybe I should write the structures more clearly.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH2. So, it's CH2(CO2Me)2. The enolate would form at the central carbon, making it a strong nucleophile.

The acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. The enolate from the malonate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2) of the acrylate. So, the attack would be on the CH2, breaking the double bond, adding the malonate's carbon to that position.

So, the product would be a new molecule where the malonate is attached to the acrylate.

Let me try to draw this mentally. The acrylate has the structure:

CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3.

The enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the CH2 group, so the CH2 becomes CH- attached to the malonate.

Wait, perhaps the product would be a four-carbon chain. The attack would be:

The enolate's carbon (from CH2(CO2Me)2) adds to the CH2 group of the acrylate.

Wait, perhaps the product would be CH2(CO2Me)2-CH2-CH(C6H4-4-CH3)-COOCH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism is:

The enolate (CH(-)CO2Me)2 attacks the beta carbon (CH2) of the acrylate (CH2=CH-p-tolyl-CO-OCH3). So, the CH2+ would be the site of attack.

Wait, actually, the Michael addition would form a new bond between the enolate's carbon and the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

So, the product would have the structure where the malonate's carbon is attached to the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So, the product would be something like CH2(CO2Me)2-CH2-CH(C6H4-4-CH3)-COOCH3. Wait, that can't be because the initial structure has a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So, the enolate attacks the CH2, leading to addition.

Wait, but when the enolate attacks the CH2, the double bond breaks, and the product is a single bond between the two.

Wait, perhaps the product is a new compound where the two carbonyls are connected. So, the malonate’s two COOCH3 groups would be at the ends, and the acrylate's p-tolyl group would be in the middle.

Wait, maybe the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. That would make sense because the malonate is adding two carbons, and the acrylate has one more, with the p-tolyl group in between.

So, the product A would be trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Looking at the options, both options A and B for A have that structure.

Now moving to reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile, with MeOH and H3O+.

Hmm, so the starting materials are 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The conditions are MeOH and H3O+, which are acidic conditions.

Wait, but wait, the Michael reaction typically occurs under basic conditions, but maybe in this case, it's a different setup. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate addition (Michael addition) but in acidic conditions.

Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine – let's think about this structure. Piperidine is a six-membered amine ring. The cyclohexene group is attached to the piperidine's nitrogen at position 1. So, the structure is a piperidine ring with a cyclohexene substituent on the nitrogen.

The other component is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is CH2=CH-C≡N, with the E configuration. Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN, but the E configuration would be CH2=CHCN because the nitrile is on one end and the CH2 on the other. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CN, with the substituents on opposite sides.

In the reaction, perhaps the piperidine is acting as a nucleophile. But wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine has a conjugate system. The cyclohexene is conjugated with the piperidine's lone pair, making it more nucleophilic.

So, the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile. The piperidine's enamine (since the cyclohexene is conjugated to the amine) would attack the beta position of the nitrile.

Wait, but in acidic conditions, maybe the piperidine is protonated, making it less nucleophilic. Hmm, that's conflicting. Alternatively, in the presence of acid, perhaps the enamine is formed, which is a strong nucleophile.

Wait, but 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine already. Enamines are known to be good nucleophiles in Michael additions. So, in this case, the enamine (the piperidine with the conjugated cyclohexene) would attack the beta position of the (E)-but-2-enenitrile.

So, the nitrile is the electrophilic part, and the enamine's nucleophilic carbon (the one adjacent to the nitrogen) attacks the beta carbon of the nitrile.

Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2-CH-CN. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CN. The enamine would attack the CH2 group (the beta position) of the nitrile.

So, the addition would be the enamine's carbon adding to the CH2, resulting in a new carbon chain.

So, the product would have the cyclohexenyl-piperidine connected to the CH2 group of the nitrile.

Wait, but in the product, the nitrile would be converted into an amine or something else? No, nitrile is a good electrophile, but in this case, the attack is just adding a new group.

Wait, the product after the Michael addition would be a new carbon-carbon bond between the enamine's carbon and the nitrile's beta carbon.

So, the product would be 3-(2-cyclohexenylpiperidinyl)butanenitrile? Or perhaps more accurately, the structure would have the cyclohexenylpiperidine attached to the CH2 next to the nitrile.

Wait, perhaps the product is 3-(2-cyclohex-1-enylpiperidinyl)butanenitrile. But looking at the options, they have something like 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile for product B in options A and B.

Wait, but wait, the product after the addition would have a ketone? No, perhaps during the reaction, the enamine is formed, the cyclohexene may open up.

Alternatively, maybe the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think again.

Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine has a structure where the piperidine is attached to a cyclohexene ring. When the enamine attacks the nitrile, the addition would form a new bond, and the double bond in the cyclohexene would become a single bond, perhaps moving the double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but after the addition, the cyclohexene part would become cyclohexane. So, the product would have a cyclohexane ring attached to the piperidine and the new carbon chain.

Wait, the product would have a cyclohexane ring connected via the piperidine to the butenitrile part. But I'm confused about the exact structure.

Wait, the options for B are either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

Hmm, 2-oxocyclohexyl would be a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 2.

Alternatively, 2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl would be a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group at position 2.

Wait, but the reaction is under acidic conditions (H3O+). So, maybe the enamine adds to the nitrile, and then under acidic work-up, the ring is hydrogenated or something else happens.

Wait, perhaps after the addition, the cyclohexene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the addition could form a new ring.

Alternatively, maybe the product has a cyclohexenyl group attached via a single bond. For instance, the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the possible options for B. The options A and B for B are 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, while C and D have 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

So, considering the reaction, I think that the product after the addition would have the cyclohexane ring connected to the carbon chain. The nitrile would remain as the substituent. But wait, the product would have a ketone if the cyclohexenyl group opens up.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the formation of a new six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the product involves the formation of a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. So, looking at the options, if the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, that would mean there's a ketone at position 2 of the cyclohexane ring, attached to the butanenitrile at position 3.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the reaction again.

The enamine (the piperidine with the cyclohexene) attacks the beta position of the nitrile (the CH2 part of CH2=CH-CN). So, the addition would form a new carbon chain, and the cyclohexene would become a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but the enamine attack would form a new bond, and perhaps the double bond in the cyclohexene would be broken, resulting in a single bond. So, the product would have a cyclohexyl group attached to the piperidine and the butenitrile.

Wait, but butenitrile is CH2CH2CN, so after attack, it becomes CH2-CH(CN)-CH2-cyclohexyl-piperidine or something like that. Hmm, but I'm not exactly certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary amine or something else. But given the options, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Moving on to reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, what's the starting material C? The question says "C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione." So, C is a reactant, and the product is given.

We need to find out what C is. The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the product has two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3, and a substituent at position 2 which is a 3-oxobutyl group.

But-3-en-2-one is CH2=C(H)C(O)CH3. So, it's a ketone with a double bond between C3 and C4.

In the presence of KOH and H2O, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of addition. Wait, but but-3-en-2-one is an alpha-beta unsaturated ketone. So, the Michael reaction could be happening here.

In the Michael reaction, a nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position. So, in this case, perhaps the enolate from C attacks the beta position of but-3-en-2-one.

The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. That suggests that the nucleophile (C) is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione that adds to the but-3-en-2-one.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3-dione has two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3. The attack would be from the enolate of the dione.

So, when the enolate from the dione attacks the beta position of the enone (but-3-en-2-one), the product would have the substituent added to the dione.

But the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the 3-oxobutyl group is attached to position 2 of the dione.

The 3-oxobutyl group is CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2. Wait, but but-3-en-2-one is CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2C(O)CH2, but with a double bond, so structure is CH2=C(H)-CH2-C(O)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-one is CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, but-3-en-2-one has the structure CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4: CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2C(O)CH2, but the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

But-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2C(O)CH2, but the double bond is between the third and fourth carbons. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-C(O)CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C-CH2-C(O)CH3? No, that's but-2-en-2-one.

Wait, the correct structure is CH2=C(CH2)COCH3? No, wait, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is CH2CH2C(O)CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2CH2C(O)CH2, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's best to think of it as CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, so CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3.

Wait, but that would be but-2-en-2-one, not but-3-en-2-one. Hmm. Alternatively, but-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2C=OCH2? I'm not sure, but perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CO-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-C(O)CH2 but with the double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3. No, that's but-2-en-2-one.

Wait, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is CH2=CH-CH2-C(O)R? No, perhaps it's not possible. Alternatively, maybe but-3-en-2-one is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3. That would be but-2-en-2-one, which is different. So, perhaps the starting material is correct as but-3-en-2-one.

In any case, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the substituent is a butyl group with a ketone at position 3 (3-oxobutyl).

So, the reaction is the enolate of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione (C) attacking the beta position of but-3-en-2-one.

The enolate would add to the beta carbon (the CH2 part) of the enone. The product would have the cyclohexane-1,3-dione connected to the added substituent.

So, the product would have the structure where the dione is connected to a CH2-CH2-C(O)- group.

Wait, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so the substituent is a 3-oxobutyl group attached to position 2 of the dione.

So, the 3-oxobutyl group is (CH2)2-C(O)-. So, the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(O)-, making the group -(CH2)2-C(O)-.

Wait, but butyl is four carbons. 3-oxobutyl is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-? No, but the substituent in the product is 3-oxobutyl, which is (CH2)2-C(O)-.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The substituent is -(CH2)2-C(O)-, attached to the cyclohexane at position 2.

So, the reaction is a Michael addition where the enolate from the dione attacks the beta carbon of the enone.

So, the product is cyclohexane-1,3-dione with a substituent at position 2, which is a 3-oxobutyl group.

So, what's the starting material C? The product is formed from the reaction of C + but-3-en-2-one with KOH and H2O. So, C is the enolate donor, which would be the cyclohexane-1,3-dione, but perhaps in its enolate form.

Wait, in the presence of KOH, the cyclohexane-1,3-dione would form an enolate, which would attack the beta position of the enone.

So, in the product, the dione is at positions 1 and 3, and the substituent is at position 2. So, the starting material C must be the enolate of the dione, but perhaps in the product, the dione is the same as the starting material.

Wait, but the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the starting material C must be the dione itself, which upon reaction with but-3-en-2-one, forms the product.

So, when the enolate of the dione attacks the but-3-en-2-one, the dione's position 2 would get the substituent. So, the product is the same dione but with the substituent added.

So, the starting material C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. When it reacts with but-3-en-2-one under basic conditions (KOH), the enolate forms and attacks the enone, leading to the addition product.

Now, looking at the options for C. The options are:

Option A: C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione

Option B: C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione

Option C: C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione

Option D: C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, in the reaction, the starting material is C, which is then consumed to form the product. So, in the reaction, C would be the enolate donor, which is the same as the dione.

So, the correct option for C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, looking at the options, options B and C have C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione. But I need to check the other parts.

Now, putting it all together:

For reaction A, the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. So, options A and B have this for A.

Reaction B has product either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (options A and B) or another structure (options C and D).

Reaction C's starting material is cyclohexane-1,3-dione (options B and C), leading to the product as given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = correct, B = correct, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

But in our analysis, C should be cyclohexane-1,3-dione, not the 2-hydroxy version. So, options B and C have C correct.

Looking at options:

Option B: A correct, B correct, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option C: A is trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)... which I thought was incorrect, so probably not.

Wait, the options for A have either trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl) or 3-(p-tolyl). Earlier, I thought the product A was trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

So, for option B, A is correct, B is correct, C is correct.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option B says:

A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate,

B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile,

C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, all three are correct. But the options for reaction B, some have 2-oxo, others have 2-hydroxy.

Wait, but when the reaction is done under acidic conditions, perhaps the product cyclizes or undergoes some tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reaction B. Let me think again. The starting material is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, which is an enamine. Enamines are good nucleophiles. The other reactant is (E)-but-2-enenitrile.

In the Michael addition, the enamine attacks the beta carbon (CH2) of the nitrile. So, the product would have the nitrile attached to a carbon connected to the enamine.

After the addition, perhaps the enamine's double bond is hydrogenated, leading to a cyclohexane ring. So, the product would have a cyclohexane ring attached to the piperidine and connected to the nitrile via a CH2 group.

Wait, but in the options, the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. So, the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 2. How would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the formation of a new ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product after the addition is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for the correct option based on the majority of the analysis.

So, for reaction A, the product is option A's structure.

For reaction B, the product is either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or another structure. I think the correct product would have the cyclohexane ring with a ketone, as formed upon hydrogenation of the cyclohexene ring, but I'm not entirely certain.

Reaction C's starting material is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which is option B and C.

So, combining all, option B seems to have:

A = correct,

B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile,

C = correct.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option B) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate,

B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile,

C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Yes, that's correct.

Options C and D have A as trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, which I don't think is correct.

So, the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves three Michael addition reactions, and the goal is to determine the correct reactants and major products for each reaction based on the given options.

### Reaction A: Dimethyl Malonate + Methyl (E)-3-(p-Tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)
- **Dimethyl malonate** is a strong nucleophile and forms an enolate under basic conditions. This enolate attacks the β-carbon of the α-β unsaturated carbonyl compound, **methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate**.
- The product of this reaction is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**, where the malonate adds to the acrylate, forming a new carbon-carbon bond and connecting the two carbonyl groups.
- Both options A and B correctly identify this product for reaction A.

### Reaction B: 1-(Cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-But-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) → (B)
- **1-(Cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine** is an enamine and acts as a nucleophile. The **(E)-but-2-enenitrile** is the α-β unsaturated electrophile.
- The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. Under acidic conditions, the cyclohexene ring in the enamine is likely hydrogenated to a cyclohexane ring.
- The product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**, where the cyclohexane ring has a ketone group at position 2.
- Options A and B correctly identify this product for reaction B.

### Reaction C: C + But-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) → 2-(3-Oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione
- The product is **2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**, where the enolate of **cyclohexane-1,3-dione** (C) attacks the β-carbon of **but-3-en-2-one**.
- The starting material C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**, as it is the enolate donor in this reaction.
- Options B and C correctly identify this starting material for reaction C.

### Final Answer
Combining the correct products and reactants for all three reactions:
- **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**
- **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**
- **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**

This matches **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
