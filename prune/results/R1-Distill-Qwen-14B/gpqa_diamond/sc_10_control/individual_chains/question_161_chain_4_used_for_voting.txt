Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Let me see what I remember from my studies.

Alright, the setup: Mike is using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a vacuum pump to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr in the sample compartment. The idea is to remove as many gas molecules as possible because having gas around can mess up the electron microscopy by causing scattering.

But even with that ultra-high vacuum, some gas particles remain. Mike measures the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path—oh right, that's the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure.

Wait, but then Mike starts the electron beam and notices something odd. The mean free path changes to λ2. The question is why λ2 is different from λ1.

Hmm, so what changes when the electron beam is on? Well, the electron beam has a high energy, right? At 1000 kV, those electrons are moving really fast. I remember that electrons can interact with the gas molecules in the vacuum. Oh, right! When the electron beam is active, the gas molecules can get ionized. Because the electrons from the beam can knock electrons off the gas molecules, turning them into ions.

Ionized gas molecules—how does that affect their mean free path? Well, ions have a charge, so they might interact differently. But wait, the mean free path is about how often they collide. If the gas molecules are ionized, they might have different properties. Or maybe the presence of the electron beam causes other effects.

Wait, another angle. In a vacuum, the mean free path is based on the gas density. But when the electron beam is on, maybe it heats the gas molecules. Oh, but the question says the temperature remains the same, so that's not it.

Wait, maybe the electron beam causes the gas to become conducting. Or perhaps the gas is being excited in some way. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam creates a current or some sort of electric field that affects the gas.

Wait, but another thought: when the electron beam is on, the electrons can cause secondary electron emission. Or perhaps the gas molecules are being bombarded by the electrons, leading to more collisions. That would decrease the mean free path. Because if the gas molecules are colliding more often due to the beam, λ would decrease.

Wait, but the mean free path is typically calculated based on the pressure and temperature. So if the pressure is the same, as it is in this case, the mean free path should stay the same. Oh, but wait, when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are ionized, and that changes their effective cross-section for scattering. Or maybe the presence of the electron beam introduces other factors.

Wait another thought: the mean free path is calculated for elastic collisions between gas molecules. But when the gas is ionized (due to the electron beam), the dominant interactions might change. For instance, if the gas becomes partially ionized, the scattering might be due to Coulomb forces instead of just elastic collisions. But I'm not sure how that affects the mean free path.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas to expand or change in density. But the temperature is the same, so if the pressure is the same, density shouldn't change. Unless the beam somehow affects the pressure, but the question says the pressure is still under ultra-high vacuum, so maybe not.

Wait, but perhaps the electron beam is causing more ionization, leading to more charged particles. Charged particles might have longer mean free paths because they don't collide as often, or maybe the opposite. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle. Mean free path can also depend on the presence of other factors like electric fields. If the electron beam induces an electric field, would that affect the motion of the gas ions? For example, ions would move in the direction of the electric field, which could alter the effective pressure or cause different collision rates. But I'm not exactly sure how that would play into the mean free path.

Wait, but the mean free path formula I mentioned earlier: λ = k*T / (sqrt(2) * π * d² * P). So λ is inversely proportional to pressure and the square of the diameter, and directly proportional to temperature. If temperature is the same, and pressure is same, λ should be same. But wait, in this scenario, the pressure hasn't changed—Mike is using the same ultra-high vacuum. So why is λ changing?

Wait, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to heat up, but the question says the temperature remains the same. So that can't be it.

Wait, maybe the gas is being pumped away more efficiently when the electron beam is on? No, because the pumps are already on, and the vacuum is maintained.

Hmm, another possibility: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be more likely to be hit by electrons, leading to more ionization and thus more space charges. But how does that affect the mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam affects the mean free path calculation because the electrons from the beam can also scatter off the gas molecules. So now, the gas molecules are not just colliding with each other but also with the electrons from the beam, which are moving at relativistic speeds. That could increase the collision rate, effectively reducing the mean free path.

Wait, but the mean free path λ1 was determined without the electron beam, so it's based solely on gas-gas collisions. When the beam is on, the gas molecules are also colliding with electrons, which are much lighter and faster. So the effective cross-section for collisions would be different. The gas molecules would have more frequent collisions because they're also hitting the electrons.

But wait, the electrons have a much smaller mass. Would that significantly change the collision frequency? Or maybe the electrons are moving so fast that their contribution is negligible? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas molecules are being ionized, and the ions are moving at different velocities, which could influence the collision rates. But I'm not certain about this.

Wait, another thought. When the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might have a different effective diameter for collision. Because the electrons are so much lighter, the collision cross-section between a gas molecule and an electron could be different than gas molecule and another gas molecule.

So, in the absence of the beam (when calculating λ1), the mean free path is based on gas-gas collisions. When the beam is on, the gas molecules are also colliding with high-energy electrons (from the beam). So the total collision rate increases, meaning the mean free path decreases.

So if λ1 is the mean free path without the beam, and with the beam, the mean free path is λ2. Since the collision rate is higher, λ2 should be less than λ1. So λ2 < λ1.

Looking at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 → No, because λ2 is smaller.

B) λ2 = λ1 → No, Mike observed a change.

C) λ2 < λ1 → Yes, this seems correct.

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1 → No, because λ2 is smaller.

So the correct answer should be C.

The question involves understanding how the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a vacuum changes when an electron beam is introduced in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. Initially, Mike determines the mean free path as λ1 under ultra-high vacuum conditions, where the vacuum pumps maintain a pressure of less than 10^-9 Torr. The mean free path is calculated based on gas-gas collisions and depends on factors such as pressure, temperature, and molecular diameter.

When the electron beam is activated, Mike observes a change in the mean free path to λ2. The key to understanding this change lies in the interaction between the gas molecules and the high-energy electrons in the beam. The electron beam introduces additional factors:

1. **Ionization of Gas Molecules**: The high-energy electrons in the beam can ionize the gas molecules, turning them into charged particles. Ionized gas molecules may interact differently than neutral molecules, potentially altering the collision dynamics.

2. **Increased Collision Rate**: The electron beam introduces a new source of collisions for gas molecules. In addition to gas-gas collisions, gas molecules now collide with high-energy electrons. This increases the overall collision frequency, effectively reducing the mean free path.

3. **Impact of Collision Cross-Section**: The collision cross-section between gas molecules and electrons is different from gas-gas collisions due to the smaller size and higher velocity of electrons. This difference in cross-section further contributes to a shorter mean free path when the beam is active.

Given that the temperature remains constant and the vacuum pressure does not change, the primary reason for the change in mean free path is the increased collision rate caused by the electron beam. This results in λ2 being shorter than λ1, i.e., λ2 < λ1.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) λ2 >= 1.22λ1**: Incorrect, as λ2 is smaller than λ1, not larger.
- **B) λ2 = λ1**: Incorrect, as Mike observed a change in the mean free path.
- **C) λ2 < λ1**: Correct, as the increased collision rate reduces the mean free path.
- **D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1**: Incorrect, as λ2 is smaller than λ1, not larger.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.
