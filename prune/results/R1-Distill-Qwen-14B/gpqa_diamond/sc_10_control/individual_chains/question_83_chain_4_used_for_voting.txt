Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me try to think this through step by step.

First, the problem says that 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, it's titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. I remember that dilution affects the concentration, so I should calculate the new concentration after mixing.

Wait, when you mix two solutions, the total moles of solute remain the same, but the volume increases. The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity × Volume. Oh wait, the volume is in cm³, which is the same as mL, right? So moles = 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L). That gives me 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

Then, when you add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles divided by new volume. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Let me think about the equivalence point first. At equivalence, all the acetic acid would have reacted with NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na^+ + H2O.

So moles of CH3COOH initially is 0.001 mol. The NaOH needed at equivalence would be 0.001 mol. Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. Wait, but the question is about the pH at equivalence. At equivalence, you have the sodium acetate solution. Sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to make the solution basic.

The solution at equivalence would be a solution of acetate ions (CH3COO^-). Let's calculate the concentration of acetate. The volume at equivalence is the initial volume plus the volume of NaOH added. Initial solution after dilution was 40 cm³, and we added 10 cm³ of NaOH, so total 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

Moles of acetate = 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So I can use the Kb expression. Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb is 5.405e-10. So for the acetate solution, I can set up an ICE table.

Let’s denote the concentration of acetate as c = 0.02 M. Let x be the [OH^-] produced.

Kb = (x^2) / (c - x). Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than c, so c - x ≈ c.

So x ≈ sqrt(Kb * c) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH would be -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02. Wait, but none of the options have around 9.02. Let me check my calculations.

Wait, wait. Did I make a mistake with the dilution? Let me go back. The initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³, right? Then, at equivalence, I added 10 cm³ of NaOH, so total volume is 50 cm³. Moles of NaOH is 0.1 M * 0.01 L = 0.001 mol, which is same as moles of acetic acid. So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated Kb. Let me recalculate Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10. Yes, that's correct.

So x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 1.081e-11. So x is about 1.04e-5. Then pOH is about 4.98, so pH is 9.02. But the options don't have 9.02 for equivalence point. Hmm, looking at the options:

Option A: 4.26;8.52 → No, second is 8.52.

Option B: 3.17;6.73 → No, only 6.73 which is lower.

Option C: 4.73;7.00 → 7, which is lower than my calculation.

Option D: 4.57;6.92 → 6.92 is close to 7, but my calculation is 9.02. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake here.

Wait a second, maybe I used the wrong approach for the equivalence point. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is not just the acetate ion? Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So I think that approach is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in concentration. Let me recalculate the concentration of acetate.

Moles of acetate = 0.001 mol. Volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Kb calculation. Let me compute 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 again.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 = approximately 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps the question is not at equivalence point but something else. Wait, the initial problem says "at 25% titration and at the equivalence point." So maybe the equivalence point pH is not 9.02, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering dilution elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake when considering the solution after 25% titration. Let me tackle that part now.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 mol. So 25% of that is 0.00025 mol has reacted. So moles of acetic acid remaining are 0.00075 mol, and moles of acetate formed are 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume at 25% titration is initial solution (40 cm³) plus 25% of the NaOH volume needed to reach equivalence.

Wait, earlier, I found the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³ added. So the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³.

So the concentrations would be:

CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

CH3COO^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. 1.85e-5 is approx 2e-5. So pKa is about 4.74 (because log(2)=0.3, so 4.7 - 0.3 gives 4.4? Wait, no:

Wait, let's compute pKa accurately. 1.85e-5 → log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa = 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) ). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

So around 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH value, and 8.52 as equivalence. But earlier, my calculation for equivalence point was around 9.02, but none of the options match that.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is that when NaOH is added, the solution is not just acetate but sodium ions, but sodium is a spectator ion, so it doesn't affect pH.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the acetate concentration. Wait, I have 0.001 moles of acetate in 0.05 L, so 0.02 M. Then, Kb is 5.405e-10. So x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5 M OH-.

pOH is log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) is about 0.017, so 5 + 0.017 ≈ 5.017. So pOH ≈5.017 → pH = 14 -5.017 = 8.983 → about 9.0.

But the options don't have 9.0. Looking at the options again, option A has 8.52, option D has 6.92. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution is miscalculated. Let me go back to the initial steps.

Initially, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Moles of acetic acid = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Diluted concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when 0.001 mol of NaOH (which is 0.01 L or 10 cm³) is added. So total volume is 50 cm³.

So acetate concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb expression. Let me recheck. The Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the solution isn't just acetate, but some other factors? Or perhaps I should compute it more accurately without approximations.

Wait, in the Kb calculation, perhaps using the exact expression is better. Let me try setting up the equation without approximation.

The acetate ion concentration is 0.02 M. Let me denote x as [OH^-].

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x).

Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Then x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is about 1.04e-5, pOH ≈4.98, pH ≈9.02.

Hmm, but none of the options have 9.02. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 4.26;8.52.

Option B: 3.17;6.73.

Option D:4.57;6.92.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the equivalence point. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should be using the initial solution before any NaOH is added, but no, the question is after adding to 25% and equivalence.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point volume. Let me recalculate the volume of NaOH required.

Moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol. Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe I confused moles of NaOH with moles of acetic acid. No, at equivalence, they're the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that after adding 10 cm³ of NaOH, the solution isn't just acetate but also includes water. Wait, no, the amount of acetate is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should account for activity coefficients or temperature, but the question states it's at 25°C, so activity is considered 1. So no, that's not it.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution at equivalence is not just acetate, but maybe I'm missing something. No, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the pH at equivalence. Let me recheck:

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

Kb = 5.405e-10.

So, x² = (0.02)(5.405e-10) → x² = 1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04)=0.017, so log(1.04e-5)= log(1.04) + log(1e-5) → ~0.017 -5 → 4.983.

So pH is 14 -4.983=9.017, about 9.02.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I confused the point where 25% of the NaOH is added, not 25% of the acetic acid. Wait, the question states 25% titration. Typically, titration percentage refers to the fraction of the analyte that has reacted.

So if the equivalence point is 10 cm³, then 25% titration is adding 2.5 cm³. So what's the pH at that point?

At 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So for each mole of NaOH, it reacts with a mole of acetic acid to produce a mole of acetate.

So initial moles: 0.001 mol CH3COOH.

After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, moles reacted: 0.00025 → CH3COOH left: 0.00075 mol. Acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is initial solution (40 cm³) + 2.5 cm³ NaOH → 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Concentration of CH3COOH: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is about 4.733.

log(0.005882 / 0.017647) = log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 -0.477 ≈4.256 → ~4.26. That matches option A's first value.

But at equivalence, my calculation is 9.02, but option A says 8.52. Why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

Ka=1.85e-5 → pKa=4.733.

Kb=Kw/Ka=1e-14/1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10.

So, Kb=5.405e-10.

So for acetate in solution:

The exact equation is Kb = (x²)/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is negligible compared to 0.02, x≈sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

pOH=-log(1.04e-5)=4.98 → pH=14-4.98=9.02.

Hmm, but the options have 8.52 as the equivalence point in option A. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the initial solution isn't 0.025 M. Let me go back to the dilution step.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02=0.001 mol.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, volume is 40 cm³ → concentration is 0.001 /0.04=0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that during the titration, the solution is being diluted, but no, because the NaOH is being added, so the total volume increases. But I accounted for that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that during the 25% titration, I didn't account for the dilution correctly. Let me recheck that.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added. So total volume is 42.5 cm³.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075.

Moles of CH3COO^-:0.00025.

So concentrations are 0.00075/0.0425=0.017647 M and 0.00025/0.0425=0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH=pKa + log([A-]/[HA])=4.733 + log(0.005882/0.017647)=4.733 + log(1/3)=4.733 -0.477=4.256.

So this gives pH≈4.26, which is option A's first value. But the equivalence point doesn't match the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Maybe I should compute it without the approximation.

At equivalence, [CH3COO^-]=0.02 M.

Set up the exact Kb equation:

x² / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, but let's check:

x² =5.405e-10 * (0.02 -x).

Let me estimate x: as before, 1.04e-5.

But let me plug it in to see if it's valid.

x=1.04e-5 → 0.02 -x ≈0.01999896, which is about 0.02. So the approximation holds.

So why is the equivalence point pH in the options not matching?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not at 25°C? No, the problem states 25°C.

Wait, perhaps the Ka given is for 25°C. So that's correct.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point pH. Let me try using the exact expression.

Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

So x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Quadratic equation: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 = (2.920e-19) + (4.324e-11)= approximately 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So x= [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6]/(2). Only positive solution.

x=( -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 )/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2=3.288e-6.

So x=3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6)=5.484 → pH=14-5.484=8.516, which is approximately 8.52. Oh! So I must have made a mistake in my initial approximation. I assumed x is about 1e-5, but the correct x is about 3.288e-6. So pOH is 5.484, pH=8.516, which rounds to 8.52. That matches option A's second value.

Ah, so where did I go wrong? I think I made a mistake in the initial assumption. I thought x was around 1e-5, but the correct solution is higher, around 3.288e-6. Wait, why the discrepancy? Oh wait, no. Let me recheck.

Wait, earlier I wrote that x is approximately 1.04e-5. But when I did the quadratic correctly, x is 3.288e-6.

Wait, why? Because my initial assumption was that x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. But in reality, the solution is x=3.288e-6. 3.288e-6 is 0.000003288, which is much smaller than 0.02 (0.02 is 0.020000), so the approximation holds. Wait, but according to the quadratic solution, x is about 3.288e-6, which is indeed much smaller than 0.02.

Wait, but why did the initial approximation give me x=1.04e-5, which is larger than the more accurate 3.288e-6?

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial approximation. Let me recalculate the initial approximation.

Wait, Kb=5.405e-10, c=0.02.

x^2 = Kb * c → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 M.

But according to the quadratic solution, x is 3.288e-6. So why is there a discrepancy?

Ah, because the initial approximation assumes that x is much smaller than c, but in reality, the assumption isn't perfect. Because x is about 1.04e-5, which is about 0.05% of 0.02 (since 0.02 is 2e-2; 1e-5 is 0.05% of 0.02). So the error is negligible, but in this case, solving the quadratic gives a more accurate x.

But wait, why does the initial approximation give a larger x than quadratic? Because when you include the x in the denominator (0.02 -x), it reduces the numerator, so x is actually a bit smaller than the initial approximation.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, the initial approach was to approximate x << c, so x² = Kb * c → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5. But when solving the quadratic, we get a smaller x of 3.288e-6. So why the difference?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the quadratic equation. The equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b^2 +4ac.

b^2 = (5.405e-10)^2 ≈ 2.92e-19.

4ac=4*1*(-1.081e-11)= -4.324e-11.

Wait, no! Wait, because the equation is ax² + bx + c=0. So in our case, c is negative.

So 4ac=4 *1* (-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11.

Wait, no, wait, no. The formula is D = b² -4ac. Wait, no, in the quadratic formula, it's D = b² -4ac. Wait, I think I mixed it up earlier.

Wait, no, the equation is x² + (b)x + c =0. So in our case, it's x² + (5.405e-10)x -1.081e-11=0. So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So D = b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*1*(-1.081e-11).

So D = 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 → approximately 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

Wait, so solving x = [-b + sqrt(D)]/(2a) → [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2.

Compute numerator: 6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ≈6.576e-6 (since 5e-10 is negligible compared to 6.5e-6).

So x≈ (6.576e-6)/2=3.288e-6.

So [OH-]=3.288e-6 M.

pOH= -log(3.288e-6)=5.484.

pH=14-5.484=8.516≈8.52. That's correct.

Ah, so I see now. The initial approximation gave me a pH of ~9.02, but the more accurate calculation gives pH≈8.52.

So, at equivalence point, pH is ~8.52.

And at 25% titration, pH is ~4.26.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but earlier when I did the initial approximation, I thought the pH would be around 9.02, but when I did the quadratic, I got 8.52. So why the discrepancy?

Because the initial approximation didn't account for the 'x' in the denominator. So the initial approach overestimated x, leading to a higher pH. The correct approach is to use the quadratic equation, which gives a lower x and thus a lower pH (8.52).

So the correct pH at equivalence is 8.52, and at 25% titration, it's 4.26.

Looking at the options again, option A is (4.26;8.52), which matches.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the dilution of acetic acid. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we analyze the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid reacts with NaOH to form acetate ions. The volume of NaOH required is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At the equivalence point, the total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetate} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH at the equivalence point is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions. The reaction is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[CH_3\text{COO}^-] - [OH^-]}.
\]

Assuming \( [OH^-] \ll 0.02 \), we approximate:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{[OH^-]^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( [OH^-] \):

\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot 0.02} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[OH^-] = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, solving the quadratic equation more accurately gives:

\[
[OH^-] \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The moles of acetic acid remaining are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and the moles of acetate formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and at the equivalence point, it is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 4.26; 8.52.**

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me try to think this through step by step.

First, the problem says that 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, it's titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. I remember that dilution affects the concentration, so I should calculate the new concentration after mixing.

Wait, when you mix two solutions, the total moles of solute remain the same, but the volume increases. The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity × Volume. Oh wait, the volume is in cm³, which is the same as mL, right? So moles = 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L). That gives me 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

Then, when you add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles divided by new volume. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Let me think about the equivalence point first. At equivalence, all the acetic acid would have reacted with NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na^+ + H2O.

So moles of CH3COOH initially is 0.001 mol. The NaOH needed at equivalence would be 0.001 mol. Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. Wait, but the question is about the pH at equivalence. At equivalence, you have the sodium acetate solution. Sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to make the solution basic.

The solution at equivalence would be a solution of acetate ions (CH3COO^-). Let's calculate the concentration of acetate. The volume at equivalence is the initial volume plus the volume of NaOH added. Initial solution after dilution was 40 cm³, and we added 10 cm³ of NaOH, so total 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

Moles of acetate = 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So I can use the Kb expression. Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb is 5.405e-10. So for the acetate solution, I can set up an ICE table.

Let’s denote the concentration of acetate as c = 0.02 M. Let x be the [OH^-] produced.

Kb = (x^2) / (c - x). Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than c, so c - x ≈ c.

So x ≈ sqrt(Kb * c) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH would be -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02. Wait, but none of the options have around 9.02. Let me check my calculations.

Wait, wait. Did I make a mistake with the dilution? Let me go back. The initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³, right? Then, at equivalence, I added 10 cm³ of NaOH, so total volume is 50 cm³. Moles of NaOH is 0.1 M * 0.01 L = 0.001 mol, which is same as moles of acetic acid. So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated Kb. Let me recalculate Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10. Yes, that's correct.

So x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 1.081e-11. So x is about 1.04e-5. Then pOH is about 4.98, so pH is 9.02. But the options don't have 9.02 for equivalence point. Hmm, looking at the options:

Option A: 4.26;8.52 → No, second is 8.52.

Option B: 3.17;6.73 → No, only 6.73 which is lower.

Option C: 4.73;7.00 → 7, which is lower than my calculation.

Option D: 4.57;6.92 → 6.92 is close to 7, but my calculation is 9.02. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake here.

Wait a second, maybe I used the wrong approach for the equivalence point. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is not just the acetate ion? Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So I think that approach is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in concentration. Let me recalculate the concentration of acetate.

Moles of acetate = 0.001 mol. Volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Kb calculation. Let me compute 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 again.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 = approximately 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps the question is not at equivalence point but something else. Wait, the initial problem says "at 25% titration and at the equivalence point." So maybe the equivalence point pH is not 9.02, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering dilution elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake when considering the solution after 25% titration. Let me tackle that part now.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 mol. So 25% of that is 0.00025 mol has reacted. So moles of acetic acid remaining are 0.00075 mol, and moles of acetate formed are 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume at 25% titration is initial solution (40 cm³) plus 25% of the NaOH volume needed to reach equivalence.

Wait, earlier, I found the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³ added. So the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³.

So the concentrations would be:

CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

CH3COO^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. 1.85e-5 is approx 2e-5. So pKa is about 4.74 (because log(2)=0.3, so 4.7 - 0.3 gives 4.4? Wait, no:

Wait, let's compute pKa accurately. 1.85e-5 → log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa = 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) ). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

So around 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH value, and 8.52 as equivalence. But earlier, my calculation for equivalence point was around 9.02, but none of the options match that.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is that when NaOH is added, the solution is not just acetate but sodium ions, but sodium is a spectator ion, so it doesn't affect pH.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the acetate concentration. Wait, I have 0.001 moles of acetate in 0.05 L, so 0.02 M. Then, Kb is 5.405e-10. So x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5 M OH-.

pOH is log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) is about 0.017, so 5 + 0.017 ≈ 5.017. So pOH ≈5.017 → pH = 14 -5.017 = 8.983 → about 9.0.

But the options don't have 9.0. Looking at the options again, option A has 8.52, option D has 6.92. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution is miscalculated. Let me go back to the initial steps.

Initially, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Moles of acetic acid = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Diluted concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when 0.001 mol of NaOH (which is 0.01 L or 10 cm³) is added. So total volume is 50 cm³.

So acetate concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb expression. Let me recheck. The Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the solution isn't just acetate, but some other factors? Or perhaps I should compute it more accurately without approximations.

Wait, in the Kb calculation, perhaps using the exact expression is better. Let me try setting up the equation without approximation.

The acetate ion concentration is 0.02 M. Let me denote x as [OH^-].

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x).

Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Then x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is about 1.04e-5, pOH ≈4.98, pH ≈9.02.

Hmm, but none of the options have 9.02. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 4.26;8.52.

Option B: 3.17;6.73.

Option D:4.57;6.92.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the equivalence point. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should be using the initial solution before any NaOH is added, but no, the question is after adding to 25% and equivalence.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point volume. Let me recalculate the volume of NaOH required.

Moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol. Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe I confused moles of NaOH with moles of acetic acid. No, at equivalence, they're the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that after adding 10 cm³ of NaOH, the solution isn't just acetate but also includes water. Wait, no, the amount of acetate is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should account for activity coefficients or temperature, but the question states it's at 25°C, so activity is considered 1. So no, that's not it.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution at equivalence is not just acetate, but maybe I'm missing something. No, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the pH at equivalence. Let me recheck:

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

Kb = 5.405e-10.

So, x² = (0.02)(5.405e-10) → x² = 1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04)=0.017, so log(1.04e-5)= log(1.04) + log(1e-5) → ~0.017 -5 → 4.983.

So pH is 14 -4.983=9.017, about 9.02.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I confused the point where 25% of the NaOH is added, not 25% of the acetic acid. Wait, the question states 25% titration. Typically, titration percentage refers to the fraction of the analyte that has reacted.

So if the equivalence point is 10 cm³, then 25% titration is adding 2.5 cm³. So what's the pH at that point?

At 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So for each mole of NaOH, it reacts with a mole of acetic acid to produce a mole of acetate.

So initial moles: 0.001 mol CH3COOH.

After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, moles reacted: 0.00025 → CH3COOH left: 0.00075 mol. Acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is initial solution (40 cm³) + 2.5 cm³ NaOH → 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Concentration of CH3COOH: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is about 4.733.

log(0.005882 / 0.017647) = log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 -0.477 ≈4.256 → ~4.26. That matches option A's first value.

But at equivalence, my calculation is 9.02, but option A says 8.52. Why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

Ka=1.85e-5 → pKa=4.733.

Kb=Kw/Ka=1e-14/1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10.

So, Kb=5.405e-10.

So for acetate in solution:

The exact equation is Kb = (x²)/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is negligible compared to 0.02, x≈sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

pOH=-log(1.04e-5)=4.98 → pH=14-4.98=9.02.

Hmm, but the options have 8.52 as the equivalence point in option A. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the initial solution isn't 0.025 M. Let me go back to the dilution step.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02=0.001 mol.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, volume is 40 cm³ → concentration is 0.001 /0.04=0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that during the titration, the solution is being diluted, but no, because the NaOH is being added, so the total volume increases. But I accounted for that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that during the 25% titration, I didn't account for the dilution correctly. Let me recheck that.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added. So total volume is 42.5 cm³.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075.

Moles of CH3COO^-:0.00025.

So concentrations are 0.00075/0.0425=0.017647 M and 0.00025/0.0425=0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH=pKa + log([A-]/[HA])=4.733 + log(0.005882/0.017647)=4.733 + log(1/3)=4.733 -0.477=4.256.

So this gives pH≈4.26, which is option A's first value. But the equivalence point doesn't match the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Maybe I should compute it without the approximation.

At equivalence, [CH3COO^-]=0.02 M.

Set up the exact Kb equation:

x² / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, but let's check:

x² =5.405e-10 * (0.02 -x).

Let me estimate x: as before, 1.04e-5.

But let me plug it in to see if it's valid.

x=1.04e-5 → 0.02 -x ≈0.01999896, which is about 0.02. So the approximation holds.

So why is the equivalence point pH in the options not matching?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not at 25°C? No, the problem states 25°C.

Wait, perhaps the Ka given is for 25°C. So that's correct.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point pH. Let me try using the exact expression.

Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

So x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Quadratic equation: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 = (2.920e-19) + (4.324e-11)= approximately 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So x= [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6]/(2). Only positive solution.

x=( -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 )/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2=3.288e-6.

So x=3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6)=5.484 → pH=14-5.484=8.516, which is approximately 8.52. Oh! So I must have made a mistake in my initial approximation. I assumed x is about 1e-5, but the correct x is about 3.288e-6. So pOH is 5.484, pH=8.516, which rounds to 8.52. That matches option A's second value.

Ah, so where did I go wrong? I think I made a mistake in the initial assumption. I thought x was around 1e-5, but the correct solution is higher, around 3.288e-6. Wait, why the discrepancy? Oh wait, no. Let me recheck.

Wait, earlier I wrote that x is approximately 1.04e-5. But when I did the quadratic correctly, x is 3.288e-6.

Wait, why? Because my initial assumption was that x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. But in reality, the solution is x=3.288e-6. 3.288e-6 is 0.000003288, which is much smaller than 0.02 (0.02 is 0.020000), so the approximation holds. Wait, but according to the quadratic solution, x is about 3.288e-6, which is indeed much smaller than 0.02.

Wait, but why did the initial approximation give me x=1.04e-5, which is larger than the more accurate 3.288e-6?

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial approximation. Let me recalculate the initial approximation.

Wait, Kb=5.405e-10, c=0.02.

x^2 = Kb * c → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 M.

But according to the quadratic solution, x is 3.288e-6. So why is there a discrepancy?

Ah, because the initial approximation assumes that x is much smaller than c, but in reality, the assumption isn't perfect. Because x is about 1.04e-5, which is about 0.05% of 0.02 (since 0.02 is 2e-2; 1e-5 is 0.05% of 0.02). So the error is negligible, but in this case, solving the quadratic gives a more accurate x.

But wait, why does the initial approximation give a larger x than quadratic? Because when you include the x in the denominator (0.02 -x), it reduces the numerator, so x is actually a bit smaller than the initial approximation.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, the initial approach was to approximate x << c, so x² = Kb * c → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5. But when solving the quadratic, we get a smaller x of 3.288e-6. So why the difference?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the quadratic equation. The equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b^2 +4ac.

b^2 = (5.405e-10)^2 ≈ 2.92e-19.

4ac=4*1*(-1.081e-11)= -4.324e-11.

Wait, no! Wait, because the equation is ax² + bx + c=0. So in our case, c is negative.

So 4ac=4 *1* (-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11.

Wait, no, wait, no. The formula is D = b² -4ac. Wait, no, in the quadratic formula, it's D = b² -4ac. Wait, I think I mixed it up earlier.

Wait, no, the equation is x² + (b)x + c =0. So in our case, it's x² + (5.405e-10)x -1.081e-11=0. So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So D = b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*1*(-1.081e-11).

So D = 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 → approximately 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

Wait, so solving x = [-b + sqrt(D)]/(2a) → [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2.

Compute numerator: 6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ≈6.576e-6 (since 5e-10 is negligible compared to 6.5e-6).

So x≈ (6.576e-6)/2=3.288e-6.

So [OH-]=3.288e-6 M.

pOH= -log(3.288e-6)=5.484.

pH=14-5.484=8.516≈8.52. That's correct.

Ah, so I see now. The initial approximation gave me a pH of ~9.02, but the more accurate calculation gives pH≈8.52.

So, at equivalence point, pH is ~8.52.

And at 25% titration, pH is ~4.26.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but earlier when I did the initial approximation, I thought the pH would be around 9.02, but when I did the quadratic, I got 8.52. So why the discrepancy?

Because the initial approximation didn't account for the 'x' in the denominator. So the initial approach overestimated x, leading to a higher pH. The correct approach is to use the quadratic equation, which gives a lower x and thus a lower pH (8.52).

So the correct pH at equivalence is 8.52, and at 25% titration, it's 4.26.

Looking at the options again, option A is (4.26;8.52), which matches.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the dilution of acetic acid. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we analyze the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid reacts with NaOH to form acetate ions. The volume of NaOH required is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At the equivalence point, the total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetate} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH at the equivalence point is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions. The reaction is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[CH_3\text{COO}^-] - [OH^-]}.
\]

Assuming \( [OH^-] \ll 0.02 \), we approximate:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{[OH^-]^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( [OH^-] \):

\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot 0.02} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[OH^-] = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, solving the quadratic equation more accurately gives:

\[
[OH^-] \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The moles of acetic acid remaining are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and the moles of acetate formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and at the equivalence point, it is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 4.26; 8.52.**
