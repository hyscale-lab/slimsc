Okay, so I've got this genetics question in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is about an experiment with white lupine plants and their resistance to anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. The researchers did a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knock-out mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). They know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor that's upstream of others. The question is about figuring out how these genes interact based on their resistance levels.

The results are given as percentages of resistance compared to the wild-type control, which is 100%. So:

- g1: 75% (so less resistance than wild type)
- g2: 0% (no resistance)
- g3: 50% (half as resistant)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0% (no resistance)
- g1g2: 0% (no resistance)

Hmm. So I need to figure out the gene interactions. Let's think about what these results imply.

First, let's recall what a transcription factor does. A transcription factor is a protein that helps turn specific genes on or off by binding to nearby DNA. If a gene is a transcription factor, knocking it out would prevent the activation of other genes it regulates. So, if a gene is upstream (like a transcription factor), its knockout would have a more significant effect, perhaps making the plant more susceptible.

Looking at the individual knockouts:
- g1 has 75% resistance. So it's less than wild type but not completely susceptible.
- g2 has 0% resistance. That's a big drop. So maybe G2 is the transcription factor because without it, all resistance is lost. But wait, let me check the double mutants too.
- g3 has 50% resistance. So it's halfway.

Now the double mutants:
- g1g2: 0% resistance.
- g1g3: 10% resistance.
- g2g3: 0% resistance.

So let's think, if G2 is a transcription factor, then in the g2 mutants, you can't activate other genes downstream, so all the resistance is gone. That would fit with g2 being 0% resistance.

But wait, for the double mutant g1g2: 0% too. So if G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would already give 0% resistance. So knocking out G1 in addition to G2 doesn't change the result. So the phenotype of g1g2 is the same as g2. That suggests that G1's function is perhaps downstream of G2, or that G1 is epistatic to G2. Wait, no. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. If knocking out G2 makes resistance zero, then knocking out G1 along with G2 doesn't change it, which suggests that G1 isn't doing anything in the absence of G2, or that G2 is upstream.

Similarly, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. Both g1 and g3 are knocked out, but the resistance is lower than either individual mutant (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So combining them makes it worse, but still not zero.

Wait, but what about g2g3? That's 0%. So when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is the same as when only G2 is knocked out. Hmm. So knocking out G3 along with G2 doesn't change the resistance compared to just G2. That suggests that G3's function is redundant or perhaps it's downstream of G2. Or maybe G3 is epistatic to G2? No, because in g2g3, the resistance is 0% same as g2. So maybe G2's function is the main factor here.

So let me try to model this.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then its knockout would disable any downstream genes it activates. So maybe G2 activates G1 and/or G3.

Looking at the individual knockouts:
- g2 can't produce any resistance, so all downstream targets are not active.
- g1 is 75%, so maybe G1 contributes part of the resistance, but not all. So perhaps G1 is downstream of G2, and maybe it's involved in the resistance pathway.
- g3 is 50%, so maybe G3 is another gene downstream of G2 or maybe it's part of a separate pathway.

Wait, but in the double mutants:
- g1g2 is 0%: So when G2 is knocked out, G1 doesn't matter because G2 is upstream. So G2 is required for G1's function. Or G1's function is downstream of G2. So when G2 is knocked out, you can't have any function of G1. Hence, the double mutant is same as g2.

- g1g3 is 10%: So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is lower than either alone. So G1 and G3 might be in separate pathways that contribute to resistance. Or maybe they are additive. Because without G1, you have 75% (so 25% loss), without G3, 50% (50% loss). Without both, it's 10% (90% loss). So perhaps each contributes some part.

Wait, but 75% and 50% are the individual knockouts. So perhaps G1 and G3 each contribute to resistance, and their effects are additive. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is much lower.

But when G2 is present, as in double mutants like g1g2, you can't have any function because G2 is upstream. So, in the absence of G2, the downstream genes (like G1 and G3) can't function.

Now, considering the double mutant g2g3: 0% resistance. But g2 is already 0%, so adding g3 doesn't change that. So this suggests that G3 doesn't contribute anything when G2 is knocked out. So maybe G3 is downstream of G2. Or maybe G3 is part of a pathway that is only active when G2 is present.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, you get 10% resistance. So when only G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present, you still get some resistance. That suggests that G2 is active, but without G1 and G3, the resistance is reduced.

Hmm, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So without G2 (g2), neither G1 nor G3 is active, leading to 0% resistance.

In the g1 mutant, G2 is active, so G3 is still active, contributing 50% resistance. Wait, but in the g1 mutant, the resistance is 75%—so higher than g3. Hmm, so that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm not modeling this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates G3, and G3 activates G1. Or another arrangement.

Wait, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates another gene, say G4, which is involved in resistance. But that's not one of the given genes. Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates G3, and G3 in turn activates another gene.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of epistasis. Epistasis is when the expression of one gene is dependent on another gene. So if Gene A is epistatic over Gene B, the phenotype of Gene B's mutation is observed only when Gene A is functional.

Alternatively, if you have a pathway where Gene A activates Gene B, which activates Gene C. Then, if Gene A is knocked out, neither B nor C would function. So in such cases, the double mutant of A and B would be the same as the A mutant.

So in our case, the g1g2 mutant is 0% resistance, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1, perhaps. Because knocking out G2 (which is upstream) already makes the resistance zero, so knocking out G1 doesn't change anything. So that suggests that G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, g1g3 is 10% resistance. So knocking out G1 and G3, but G2 is present?

Wait, but in the g1g3 double mutant, G2 is functional because the mutant is only g1 and g3. So in that case, maybe G2 is active, but G1 and G3 are knocked out.

But what if G2 is a transcription factor for both G1 and G3. Then, without G2 (g2), both G1 and G3 are inactive, leading to 0% resistance. But if only G1 is inactive (g1), then G3 is active, leading to 50% resistance. Similarly, if only G3 is inactive (g3), then G1 is active, leading to 75% resistance.

Wait, that would fit the data. Because g3 has 50% resistance, which would mean that G3 alone contributes 50%, and G1 contributes the additional 25% (since g1 is 75%). So, G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.

So, if G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 is active, so resistance drops to 0%. If only G1 is knocked out, G3 is active, giving 50% resistance. But wait, the data says that g1 is 75% resistance. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So that model might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I have the roles reversed. Let's think again. Let's make a table.

Wild type: 100% resistance.

g1: 75% → so without G1, 25% loss. So G1 contributes 25% of the resistance.

g2: 0% → without G2, all resistance is lost.

g3: 50% → without G3, 50% loss.

Double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

g1g3: 10% → so 90% loss.

g2g3: 0% → same as g2.

So, let's think about the possible hierarchy.

Since g2 is 0%, perhaps G2 is necessary for any resistance. So, all resistance is downstream of G2.

If that's the case, then g1g2 and g2g3 would be 0%, which they are. So the presence of G2 is necessary.

Now, when only g1 is knocked out, resistance is 75%, which is 25% less than wild type. So G1 contributes 25% of the resistance.

When only g3 is knocked out, resistance is 50%, so G3 contributes 50% of the resistance.

So, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, which are each contributing to the resistance.

Wait, but if G2 activates both, then knocking out G2 would make both G1 and G3 inactive, leading to 0% resistance. Which aligns with the data.

But then, in the double mutant g1g3, why is the resistance 10%?

If both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is active, but that's not possible because in g1g3, G2 is present. Wait, no, because the double mutant g1g3 means only G1 and G3 are knocked out. So G2 is still functional.

Wait, perhaps G2 is not the transcription factor. Or maybe the hierarchy is different.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor, and it activates G3. G3 in turn activates G1. So, in that case:

- G2 is necessary for G3, which is needed for G1.

So, in the g2 mutant, G3 and G1 are not active. So resistance is 0%.

In the g3 mutant, G2 is active, so G3 is knocked out. Since G3 is not active, G1 isn't either. So resistance would be 0%? But the data says g3 is 50% resistance. So that can't be the case.

Hmm, perhaps I need to model it differently. Let's consider each gene's contribution.

In the wild type, all three genes are functional. Let's say resistance is the sum of contributions from G1, G2, and G3.

But that's unlikely because in the double mutants, the sum might not add up. Alternatively, perhaps the resistance is a combination of the functions of these genes.

Wait, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates a gene that's required for the resistance. So, without G2 (g2), the downstream gene isn't expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

In that case, g2 is 0%, and any double mutant with g2 would also be 0%.

But what about g1 and g3? Let's think: perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So, the total resistance is the sum of the contributions from G1 and G3.

If G1 contributes 25% (since without G1, resistance is 75%—so 25% less than wild type) and G3 contributes 50% (since without G3, resistance is 50%—50% less than wild type), then when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, resistance would be 25% +50% subtracted from 100%. Wait, but that's not how it works. Because if they're additive, when you lose both, the resistance would be 100% - (25% +50%) = 25%, but the data shows g1g3 is 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe they are in a redundant pathway, meaning that either can contribute to the resistance. So if both are knocked out, resistance is much lower.

Wait, but in the case where the genes are redundant, each contributes equally. So the resistance would be additive when both are present, and when one is knocked out, the other compensates. But that doesn't seem to fit here.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor for G3, and G3 is a transcription factor for G1.

Wait, but that would create a hierarchy where G2 → G3 → G1. So, without G2, G3 isn't expressed, so G1 isn't either. So g2 would be 0%, which is correct. Without G3, G1 isn't expressed, so resistance would depend on G2. Hmm, but in g3, resistance is 50%, which is less than wild type. So perhaps G3 has another function independent of G2?

This is getting a bit tangled. Let's try another approach: looking at the double mutants and how they compare to the single mutants.

Looking at g1g3: 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is much lower than either single knockout. That suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway. Or perhaps they function in parallel pathways that add to the resistance.

But if they were in the same pathway, then knocking out both would have the same effect as knocking out one. But here, their combined knockout is worse than either alone. So that suggests that they function in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. So each contributes something, and without either, the resistance is lower.

Wait, but in the presence of G2, the g1g3 mutant has 10% resistance. So maybe G2 is involved in a separate pathway. Or perhaps G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates G3, and G3 activates G1. But I'm not sure.

Wait, when we have g2, the resistance is 0%. So G2 is essential for any resistance. So, any resistance must be downstream of G2.

In the single mutants:

- g1: 75% → so G1 contributes 25% of the resistance when G2 is present.
- g3: 50% → so G3 contributes 50% of the resistance when G2 is present.

So, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. When G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are expressed. Without G2, none are expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

But when G1 is knocked out (g1), G3 is still expressed. So the resistance is 50% (since G3 contributes 50%). Wait, but in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. That implies that G1 contributes more than G3. Hmm, that doesn't fit with this model.

Wait, perhaps I have the contributions reversed. Maybe G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%. So when G1 is knocked out, you lose 25%, so resistance is 75%. When G3 is knocked out, you lose 50%, so resistance is 50%. Then, when both are knocked out, you lose 75% (25+50), so resistance is 25%. But the data shows that g1g3 is 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the contributions are in a multiplicative way. Like, each gene's product is needed for the other. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe G2 is the transcription factor that activates G3, which in turn activates G1. So, without G2, G3 is not expressed → without G3, G1 isn't either. So in the g2 mutant, resistance is 0%.

In the g3 mutant, G3 is knocked out, so G1 isn't expressed either. So g3 would have 0% resistance, but the data says g3 is 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's look at the epistatic relationships.

Epistasis occurs when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. If Gene A is epistatic to Gene B, then the phenotype of Gene B's mutation is only seen when Gene A is functional.

In the g1g2 mutant, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So, the presence of G1 doesn't matter when G2 is knocked out. So, G2 is epistatic to G1. That is, G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, in the g2g3 mutant, resistance is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3. So G2 is upstream of G3 as well.

So, G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. So, G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.

Now, how do G1 and G3 interact? Let's look at the double mutant g1g3, which is 10% resistance. So, when both are knocked out, resistance is worse than either alone. So, their effects are additive in the presence of G2.

So, if G2 is present, and both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10% (so 90% loss). But when only G1 is knocked out, resistance is 75% (25% loss), and when only G3 is knocked out, 50% loss. So, G1 contributes more than G3 in the presence of G2.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, both contributing to resistance, but G1 contributes more.

So, the model would be:

G2 (transcription factor) activates both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 each contribute to resistance. G1's contribution is larger than G3's.

So, when G2 is knocked out (g2), neither G1 nor G3 is active → 0% resistance.

When G1 is knocked out (g1), G3 is active → contributes 50% resistance, but wait, in the data, g1 is 75%. Hmm, that's a problem because if G3 contributes 50%, then without G1, you'd have 50%, but the data says g1 is 75%.

Wait, perhaps I have it reversed. Maybe G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%. So, when G1 is knocked out, you have 75% resistance (100 -25) and when G3 is knocked out, you have 50% (100-50).

In the double mutant g1g3, you lose both contributions → 100 - 25 -50 =25% resistance. But the data says it's 10%, which doesn't match. So perhaps their contributions are not additive but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is necessary for G3's function. So, without G1, G3 can't contribute either. But that doesn't fit because in the g3 mutant, the resistance is 50%, which would imply that G3 can function without G1.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think about the options given.

The question asks which conclusion can be drawn regarding the genes' interactions. The options are A to D. Let's look at the options.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but the question says that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. So perhaps G2 is the transcription factor.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm, same promoter would mean they're co-regulated, perhaps. But I'm not sure. Also, G3 being epistatic towards G1 would mean that G3 is downstream of G1.

Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure how that applies here.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Gene redundancy means that either gene can perform the same function. So if both are knocked out, the effect is worse.

Wait, but redundancy would mean that if one is knocked out, the other can compensate. So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out one would lead to a phenotype, but knocking out both would be worse.

In our data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So, in that case, they're not redundant because their individual knockouts have different effects. So, perhaps D isn't correct.

Wait, but the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is much worse than either. So that suggests that they are additive, not redundant. So maybe D is not correct.

Looking back at the options, let's reevaluate.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy. Wait, but in the data, G2's knockout leads to 0%, so G2 is likely the transcription factor upstream. So A might not be correct.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so co-regulated), G3 epistatic to G1. So G3 is downstream of G1. So if G3 is knocked out, it would mask the effect of G1. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is lower than when G1 is knocked out. That doesn't fit with G3 being epistatic to G1. Because if G3 is epistatic, then in the absence of G3, the effect of G1 would not be seen. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g3, but the data says 10%. So maybe not.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure, but if G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean G1 is upstream. So the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. But in the data, g3 is 50%, which is lower than g1's 75%. So if G1 is upstream, knocking out G3 would still have some effect even if G1 is present. Hmm, maybe.

Alternatively, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of G3's mutation is only seen when G1 is present. So, in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be same as g1. But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). So that doesn't fit. So perhaps C isn't correct.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Gene redundancy would mean that either can compensate, so knocking out both would have a worse effect. But in the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So in the double mutant, it's 10%, which is additive. So perhaps this isn't redundancy. Instead, it's additive, meaning they contribute independently. So D's redundancy might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct model is that G2 is the transcription factor, and it activates both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that contribute to resistance. So each contributes a portion, and together they add up. So, without G2, no G1 or G3 → 0% resistance.

In the g1 mutant, G3 is active, giving 50% resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the model is that G2 is a transcription factor that activates G3, which in turn activates G1. So, G2 → G3 → G1. Then:

- Without G2 (g2), G3 and G1 are not expressed → 0% resistance.
- Without G3 (g3), G1 isn't expressed either → resistance would be 0%, but data says 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the TF, and it activates both G1 and G3, which are both involved in the same pathway. So, each contributes some part of the resistance, but their functions are additive.

So, without G2, 0% resistance.

Without G1, resistance is 75% (so G1 contributes 25%).
Without G3, resistance is 50% (so G3 contributes 50%).
Without both, 75-25 +50-50 → 25% +50% =75%? No, but the data shows 10%, which doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway. So, G2 activates G3, which activates G1. So, without G2, no G3 or G1 → resistance 0%. Without G3, G1 isn't active → resistance 0%, but data says g3 is 50%, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about each option's details.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1.

But the data suggests G2 is the TF because knocking it out leads to 0% resistance. So A can't be correct.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would mean they're co-regulated. If G3 is epistatic to G1, then G3's function is downstream. So in the double mutant g1g3, you would see the same as g3. But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse. So this might not fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure how that applies here. Also, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance should be same as g1, but data says 10%.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy means they can compensate for each other. So, knocking out one would have a phenotype, but knocking out both would be worse. But our data for g1g3 is 10%, which is much worse than either single mutant. So this fits with redundancy. Wait, but if they were redundant, knocking out both would have the same effect as knocking out one, but here it's worse. So perhaps it's not redundancy but additive.

Wait, but if they are redundant, then the double mutant would be same as either single. So perhaps D is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are not redundant but additive. So their effects add up. So G2 is TF, activating both, which add to the resistance.

In that case, G1 and G3 are epistatic to each other in some way.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. So, 10% is much less than either single mutant. So, when both G1 and G3 are not functional, the resistance drops much more. So, G1 and G3 must be contributing to the same pathway, and their functions are additive.

Wait, but how does that fit with the rest of the data?

Let me think about the options again. The correct answer is likely that G2 is the transcription factor, and perhaps G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options, option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But as I thought earlier, redundancy would mean that the double mutant would have the same as the single mutants, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. So, without G2, you get 0% because both are off. Without G1, G3 is active, giving 50% (wait, but data says g1 is 75%). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another possibility: G2 is a TF, and G3 is its target. G3 in turn is necessary for G1's function. So, G2 → G3 → G1.

In this case:

- g2 (no G2) → no G3 → no G1 → 0% resistance.
- g3 (no G3) → no G1 → resistance depends on something else. But in the data, g3 is 50%, so maybe there's another pathway.
- g1 (no G1) → but G3 is active → resistance comes from G3. So, if G3 contributes 50% when active, then g1 would be 50% resistance. But the data says g1 is 75%, which doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should look for which option fits the data.

The correct answer is likely option A, B, C, or D.

Wait, let's look at the epistatic relationships.

We know that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because in the double mutants with G2 knocked out, the resistance is the same as G2 alone. So G2 is upstream of both.

Now, looking at the g1g3 double mutant: 10% resistance. Since G2 is functional, the resistance is lower than either single mutant. So, the presence of both G1 and G3 is necessary for higher resistance. So, their functions are additive.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So, G1 contributes 25%, G3 contributes 50%, and together they contribute 75%. But wait, in the wild type, all are functional, so 100% resistance. So perhaps, in addition to G1 and G3, there's another factor contributing 25% (maybe G2 itself? Or another gene). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

In any case, the correct option must state that G2 is the transcription factor, and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, option A says G1 is TF, which is unlikely. Option B says G2 is TF. Option C says G2 is TF. Option D says G2 is TF.

The correct option must have G2 as the TF.

Now, the second part of the options deals with the relationship between G1 and G3.

Option B: G1 and G3 have the same promoter. If they have the same promoter, then knocking out G2 would affect both. But the data shows g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, which are different. So perhaps they have different promoters, meaning they are not co-regulated. So option B might not be correct.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here.

Option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. If they were redundant, the double mutant would have the same as the more severe single mutant. But the double is 10%, which is worse than either, so redundancy is unlikely.

Hmm. Another possibility is that G1 and G3 are in a synthetic lethal pathway. But I don't think that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway, but the data doesn't fit.

Maybe the correct option is option A, but that says G1 is the TF. No. I think I should think that G2 is the TF.

Looking at the options, the only ones where G2 is the TF are B, C, D.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, what is pleiotropy? It's when a gene affects multiple traits. So, perhaps G1 is involved in multiple aspects of the resistance pathway. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G1 is epistatic to G3. So, the pathway is G2 → G3 → G1.

Wait, but in that case, if G3 is knocked out, G1 wouldn't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance, but data says g3 is 50%. So that can't be.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the data.

The data shows that G2 is necessary for any resistance (0% when G2 is knocked out). So G2 is the transcription factor.

In the g1 mutant, resistance is 75%, so it's 25% less than wild type. In g3, 50% less. So G1 and G3 each contribute to the resistance, but G1 contributes less than G3.

In the double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10%—so 90% loss. So their contributions are additive. So, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that add to the resistance.

So, the model is: G2 activates both G1 and G3, which each contribute to resistance. G3 contributes more than G1.

So, when G2 is present, both contribute. When G2 is absent, no resistance.

Now, looking at the options, which option fits this?

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But redundancy doesn't fit because the double mutant is worse than either single.

So perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but let me look again.

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because G2 is the TF. So A is wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would mean that G1 and G3 are co-regulated. But their individual knockouts have different effects, so perhaps they have separate promoters. So B may not be correct.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure, but perhaps G1 affects more traits than G3. Not sure if this applies.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3. But redundancy doesn't fit the data, so D is wrong.

Hmm. Maybe option C is correct. Let me think: G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, the function of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. But in the data, g3 is 50% resistance, which is lower than g1's 75%.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then when G1 is knocked out, the function of G3 doesn't matter. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1, which is 75%. But the data shows 10%, so that doesn't fit.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think about the epistatic relationships.

The data shows that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So the correct option must have G2 as the TF.

Looking at the options, only options B, C, D have G2 as the TF.

Now, which of these options fit the other data.

Option B: G1 and G3 have same promoter. So they are co-regulated. But in the data, their individual knockouts have different effects, so perhaps they are co-regulated but have different functions.

Option B also says G3 is epistatic towards G1. So G3 is downstream. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be the same as g3, which is 50%, but the data shows 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1, which is 75%, but data says 10%. Doesn't fit.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Same issue as C.

Wait, perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but I should pick the best option based on the data.

Wait, going back to the data, in the double mutant g1g2, resistance is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, so G2 is epistatic to G3.

So, in the options, the correct conclusion is that G2 is a TF and is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, option B says G3 is epistatic towards G1. That would be the opposite of what we see.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. That would mean G1 is upstream of G3, but our data shows G2 is upstream.

So, the correct option must have G2 as the TF and G2 being epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, option A has G1 as TF, so wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF. G3 is epistatic towards G1. But our data shows G2 is epistatic to both.

Option C: G2 is TF. G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1 is upstream of G3. But our data shows that knocking out G2 makes everything zero, so G2 is upstream.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But redundancy doesn't fit, as the double mutant is worse.

Wait, perhaps I've been missing something. Let me think about the epistasis again.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. So if G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's knockout is not seen. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1. But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%.

So that doesn't fit. Therefore, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. So, the function of G1 is only seen when G3 is present. That would mean that in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is same as g3. But the data shows 10%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1, but in this case, the phenotypes don't align.

I think I've spent enough time. Based on the data, the correct answer must involve G2 as the TF, and the other genes in a way that their combined knockout leads to an additive effect. So, looking at the options, option A is out because it says G1 is TF. Option B says G3 is epistatic to G1, but I'm not sure. Option C and D involve G2 as TF.

Wait, another thought: the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. Since G2 is present, but both G1 and G3 are knocked out, perhaps each contributes a part, and their absence leads to a much lower resistance. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway, each contributing a part. So, G2 → G3 → G1.

But without G3, G1 can't be expressed. So, if G3 is knocked out, G1 would not be expressed, leading to 0% resistance, but the data says g3 is 50%. So that model doesn't fit.

Hmm.

At this point, I think the best option is option A is wrong, and among the others, option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not fully confident.

Wait, another approach: considering that knocking out G2 leads to all resistance lost, G2 is the upstream TF. Then, the single mutants g1 and g3 have partial resistance, meaning they are downstream of G2.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than either single, so their effects are additive. So, G1 and G3 are in separate downstream pathways. So, when both are knocked out, the resistance is additive.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream and additive.

Looking at the options, which one aligns with this.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. No, because redundancy would mean the double mutant is same as the worse single mutant.

So, perhaps the correct option is none of them perfectly fit, but given the options, the best fit is option D, which says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Another angle: the fact that the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance suggests that each contributes 50% and 25% respectively. So, their combined knockout leads to 75% + 50% loss = 25% resistance. But data shows 10%, which doesn't fit. So perhaps they contribute non-additively.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the TF, and the resistance is controlled by a threshold model. For example, you need a certain level of G1 and G3 activity to reach the threshold for resistance. So, each contributes, but their combined loss drops resistance below the threshold.

But I'm not sure.

I think I've thought this through as much as I can. I'll have to make a choice based on the data and the options.

The question involves determining the interaction of three genes (G1, G2, and G3) in white lupine plants contributing to resistance against anthracnose. The experiment includes single and double mutants, and the resistance levels are measured as percentages of the wild-type control (100%). The key results are:

- **g1**: 75% resistance  
- **g2**: 0% resistance  
- **g3**: 50% resistance  
- **g1g3**: 10% resistance  
- **g2g3**: 0% resistance  
- **g1g2**: 0% resistance  

### Analysis of the Data
1. **Role of G2**:  
   - The **g2 mutant** shows 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is essential for resistance. This suggests that G2 is likely a transcription factor acting upstream of other genes, as its knockout eliminates all resistance.

2. **Epistasis Relationships**:  
   - In the double mutants **g1g2** and **g2g3**, the resistance is 0%, the same as the **g2 mutant**. This indicates that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning G2 is upstream and its function is necessary for G1 and G3 to contribute to resistance.

3. **Interactions Between G1 and G3**:  
   - The **g1 mutant** has 75% resistance, while the **g3 mutant** has 50% resistance. This suggests that G1 contributes more to resistance than G3 when G2 is functional.  
   - The double mutant **g1g3** has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. This implies that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance, and their combined loss leads to an additive or synergistic reduction in resistance.

### Evaluation of the Options
- **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1.  
  - This is inconsistent with the data, as G2 is clearly the transcription factor (g2 mutant has 0% resistance), not G1.  

- **Option B**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic to G1.  
  - While G2 being the transcription factor aligns with the data, the claim that G1 and G3 have the same promoter is unlikely, as their single mutants have different resistance levels (75% for g1 and 50% for g3). Additionally, G3 being epistatic to G1 is not supported, as the double mutant g1g3 shows 10% resistance, worse than either single mutant.

- **Option C**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.  
  - G2 being the transcription factor is correct. However, pleiotropy (where a gene affects multiple traits) is not clearly demonstrated here. The claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is also inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant.

- **Option D**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.  
  - Gene redundancy implies that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other, but the double mutant g1g3 shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. This contradicts the idea of redundancy. Additionally, G1 being epistatic to G3 is not supported, as the resistance levels of the mutants do not align with this relationship.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, **Option D** is the most plausible choice, as it correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and partially aligns with the idea that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance. However, the claim of gene redundancy and epistasis relationships do not fully fit the data. Despite its imperfections, Option D is the closest match to the experimental results.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this genetics question in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is about an experiment with white lupine plants and their resistance to anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. The researchers did a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knock-out mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). They know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor that's upstream of others. The question is about figuring out how these genes interact based on their resistance levels.

The results are given as percentages of resistance compared to the wild-type control, which is 100%. So:

- g1: 75% (so less resistance than wild type)
- g2: 0% (no resistance)
- g3: 50% (half as resistant)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0% (no resistance)
- g1g2: 0% (no resistance)

Hmm. So I need to figure out the gene interactions. Let's think about what these results imply.

First, let's recall what a transcription factor does. A transcription factor is a protein that helps turn specific genes on or off by binding to nearby DNA. If a gene is a transcription factor, knocking it out would prevent the activation of other genes it regulates. So, if a gene is upstream (like a transcription factor), its knockout would have a more significant effect, perhaps making the plant more susceptible.

Looking at the individual knockouts:
- g1 has 75% resistance. So it's less than wild type but not completely susceptible.
- g2 has 0% resistance. That's a big drop. So maybe G2 is the transcription factor because without it, all resistance is lost. But wait, let me check the double mutants too.
- g3 has 50% resistance. So it's halfway.

Now the double mutants:
- g1g2: 0% resistance.
- g1g3: 10% resistance.
- g2g3: 0% resistance.

So let's think, if G2 is a transcription factor, then in the g2 mutants, you can't activate other genes downstream, so all the resistance is gone. That would fit with g2 being 0% resistance.

But wait, for the double mutant g1g2: 0% too. So if G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would already give 0% resistance. So knocking out G1 in addition to G2 doesn't change the result. So the phenotype of g1g2 is the same as g2. That suggests that G1's function is perhaps downstream of G2, or that G1 is epistatic to G2. Wait, no. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. If knocking out G2 makes resistance zero, then knocking out G1 along with G2 doesn't change it, which suggests that G1 isn't doing anything in the absence of G2, or that G2 is upstream.

Similarly, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. Both g1 and g3 are knocked out, but the resistance is lower than either individual mutant (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So combining them makes it worse, but still not zero.

Wait, but what about g2g3? That's 0%. So when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is the same as when only G2 is knocked out. Hmm. So knocking out G3 along with G2 doesn't change the resistance compared to just G2. That suggests that G3's function is redundant or perhaps it's downstream of G2. Or maybe G3 is epistatic to G2? No, because in g2g3, the resistance is 0% same as g2. So maybe G2's function is the main factor here.

So let me try to model this.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then its knockout would disable any downstream genes it activates. So maybe G2 activates G1 and/or G3.

Looking at the individual knockouts:
- g2 can't produce any resistance, so all downstream targets are not active.
- g1 is 75%, so maybe G1 contributes part of the resistance, but not all. So perhaps G1 is downstream of G2, and maybe it's involved in the resistance pathway.
- g3 is 50%, so maybe G3 is another gene downstream of G2 or maybe it's part of a separate pathway.

Wait, but in the double mutants:
- g1g2 is 0%: So when G2 is knocked out, G1 doesn't matter because G2 is upstream. So G2 is required for G1's function. Or G1's function is downstream of G2. So when G2 is knocked out, you can't have any function of G1. Hence, the double mutant is same as g2.

- g1g3 is 10%: So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is lower than either alone. So G1 and G3 might be in separate pathways that contribute to resistance. Or maybe they are additive. Because without G1, you have 75% (so 25% loss), without G3, 50% (50% loss). Without both, it's 10% (90% loss). So perhaps each contributes some part.

Wait, but 75% and 50% are the individual knockouts. So perhaps G1 and G3 each contribute to resistance, and their effects are additive. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is much lower.

But when G2 is present, as in double mutants like g1g2, you can't have any function because G2 is upstream. So, in the absence of G2, the downstream genes (like G1 and G3) can't function.

Now, considering the double mutant g2g3: 0% resistance. But g2 is already 0%, so adding g3 doesn't change that. So this suggests that G3 doesn't contribute anything when G2 is knocked out. So maybe G3 is downstream of G2. Or maybe G3 is part of a pathway that is only active when G2 is present.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, you get 10% resistance. So when only G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present, you still get some resistance. That suggests that G2 is active, but without G1 and G3, the resistance is reduced.

Hmm, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So without G2 (g2), neither G1 nor G3 is active, leading to 0% resistance.

In the g1 mutant, G2 is active, so G3 is still active, contributing 50% resistance. Wait, but in the g1 mutant, the resistance is 75%—so higher than g3. Hmm, so that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm not modeling this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates G3, and G3 activates G1. Or another arrangement.

Wait, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates another gene, say G4, which is involved in resistance. But that's not one of the given genes. Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates G3, and G3 in turn activates another gene.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of epistasis. Epistasis is when the expression of one gene is dependent on another gene. So if Gene A is epistatic over Gene B, the phenotype of Gene B's mutation is observed only when Gene A is functional.

Alternatively, if you have a pathway where Gene A activates Gene B, which activates Gene C. Then, if Gene A is knocked out, neither B nor C would function. So in such cases, the double mutant of A and B would be the same as the A mutant.

So in our case, the g1g2 mutant is 0% resistance, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1, perhaps. Because knocking out G2 (which is upstream) already makes the resistance zero, so knocking out G1 doesn't change anything. So that suggests that G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, g1g3 is 10% resistance. So knocking out G1 and G3, but G2 is present?

Wait, but in the g1g3 double mutant, G2 is functional because the mutant is only g1 and g3. So in that case, maybe G2 is active, but G1 and G3 are knocked out.

But what if G2 is a transcription factor for both G1 and G3. Then, without G2 (g2), both G1 and G3 are inactive, leading to 0% resistance. But if only G1 is inactive (g1), then G3 is active, leading to 50% resistance. Similarly, if only G3 is inactive (g3), then G1 is active, leading to 75% resistance.

Wait, that would fit the data. Because g3 has 50% resistance, which would mean that G3 alone contributes 50%, and G1 contributes the additional 25% (since g1 is 75%). So, G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.

So, if G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 is active, so resistance drops to 0%. If only G1 is knocked out, G3 is active, giving 50% resistance. But wait, the data says that g1 is 75% resistance. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So that model might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I have the roles reversed. Let's think again. Let's make a table.

Wild type: 100% resistance.

g1: 75% → so without G1, 25% loss. So G1 contributes 25% of the resistance.

g2: 0% → without G2, all resistance is lost.

g3: 50% → without G3, 50% loss.

Double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

g1g3: 10% → so 90% loss.

g2g3: 0% → same as g2.

So, let's think about the possible hierarchy.

Since g2 is 0%, perhaps G2 is necessary for any resistance. So, all resistance is downstream of G2.

If that's the case, then g1g2 and g2g3 would be 0%, which they are. So the presence of G2 is necessary.

Now, when only g1 is knocked out, resistance is 75%, which is 25% less than wild type. So G1 contributes 25% of the resistance.

When only g3 is knocked out, resistance is 50%, so G3 contributes 50% of the resistance.

So, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, which are each contributing to the resistance.

Wait, but if G2 activates both, then knocking out G2 would make both G1 and G3 inactive, leading to 0% resistance. Which aligns with the data.

But then, in the double mutant g1g3, why is the resistance 10%?

If both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is active, but that's not possible because in g1g3, G2 is present. Wait, no, because the double mutant g1g3 means only G1 and G3 are knocked out. So G2 is still functional.

Wait, perhaps G2 is not the transcription factor. Or maybe the hierarchy is different.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor, and it activates G3. G3 in turn activates G1. So, in that case:

- G2 is necessary for G3, which is needed for G1.

So, in the g2 mutant, G3 and G1 are not active. So resistance is 0%.

In the g3 mutant, G2 is active, so G3 is knocked out. Since G3 is not active, G1 isn't either. So resistance would be 0%? But the data says g3 is 50% resistance. So that can't be the case.

Hmm, perhaps I need to model it differently. Let's consider each gene's contribution.

In the wild type, all three genes are functional. Let's say resistance is the sum of contributions from G1, G2, and G3.

But that's unlikely because in the double mutants, the sum might not add up. Alternatively, perhaps the resistance is a combination of the functions of these genes.

Wait, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates a gene that's required for the resistance. So, without G2 (g2), the downstream gene isn't expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

In that case, g2 is 0%, and any double mutant with g2 would also be 0%.

But what about g1 and g3? Let's think: perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So, the total resistance is the sum of the contributions from G1 and G3.

If G1 contributes 25% (since without G1, resistance is 75%—so 25% less than wild type) and G3 contributes 50% (since without G3, resistance is 50%—50% less than wild type), then when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, resistance would be 25% +50% subtracted from 100%. Wait, but that's not how it works. Because if they're additive, when you lose both, the resistance would be 100% - (25% +50%) = 25%, but the data shows g1g3 is 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe they are in a redundant pathway, meaning that either can contribute to the resistance. So if both are knocked out, resistance is much lower.

Wait, but in the case where the genes are redundant, each contributes equally. So the resistance would be additive when both are present, and when one is knocked out, the other compensates. But that doesn't seem to fit here.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor for G3, and G3 is a transcription factor for G1.

Wait, but that would create a hierarchy where G2 → G3 → G1. So, without G2, G3 isn't expressed, so G1 isn't either. So g2 would be 0%, which is correct. Without G3, G1 isn't expressed, so resistance would depend on G2. Hmm, but in g3, resistance is 50%, which is less than wild type. So perhaps G3 has another function independent of G2?

This is getting a bit tangled. Let's try another approach: looking at the double mutants and how they compare to the single mutants.

Looking at g1g3: 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is much lower than either single knockout. That suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway. Or perhaps they function in parallel pathways that add to the resistance.

But if they were in the same pathway, then knocking out both would have the same effect as knocking out one. But here, their combined knockout is worse than either alone. So that suggests that they function in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. So each contributes something, and without either, the resistance is lower.

Wait, but in the presence of G2, the g1g3 mutant has 10% resistance. So maybe G2 is involved in a separate pathway. Or perhaps G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates G3, and G3 activates G1. But I'm not sure.

Wait, when we have g2, the resistance is 0%. So G2 is essential for any resistance. So, any resistance must be downstream of G2.

In the single mutants:

- g1: 75% → so G1 contributes 25% of the resistance when G2 is present.
- g3: 50% → so G3 contributes 50% of the resistance when G2 is present.

So, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. When G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are expressed. Without G2, none are expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

But when G1 is knocked out (g1), G3 is still expressed. So the resistance is 50% (since G3 contributes 50%). Wait, but in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. That implies that G1 contributes more than G3. Hmm, that doesn't fit with this model.

Wait, perhaps I have the contributions reversed. Maybe G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%. So when G1 is knocked out, you lose 25%, so resistance is 75%. When G3 is knocked out, you lose 50%, so resistance is 50%. Then, when both are knocked out, you lose 75% (25+50), so resistance is 25%. But the data shows that g1g3 is 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the contributions are in a multiplicative way. Like, each gene's product is needed for the other. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe G2 is the transcription factor that activates G3, which in turn activates G1. So, without G2, G3 is not expressed → without G3, G1 isn't either. So in the g2 mutant, resistance is 0%.

In the g3 mutant, G3 is knocked out, so G1 isn't expressed either. So g3 would have 0% resistance, but the data says g3 is 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's look at the epistatic relationships.

Epistasis occurs when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. If Gene A is epistatic to Gene B, then the phenotype of Gene B's mutation is only seen when Gene A is functional.

In the g1g2 mutant, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So, the presence of G1 doesn't matter when G2 is knocked out. So, G2 is epistatic to G1. That is, G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, in the g2g3 mutant, resistance is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3. So G2 is upstream of G3 as well.

So, G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. So, G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.

Now, how do G1 and G3 interact? Let's look at the double mutant g1g3, which is 10% resistance. So, when both are knocked out, resistance is worse than either alone. So, their effects are additive in the presence of G2.

So, if G2 is present, and both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10% (so 90% loss). But when only G1 is knocked out, resistance is 75% (25% loss), and when only G3 is knocked out, 50% loss. So, G1 contributes more than G3 in the presence of G2.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, both contributing to resistance, but G1 contributes more.

So, the model would be:

G2 (transcription factor) activates both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 each contribute to resistance. G1's contribution is larger than G3's.

So, when G2 is knocked out (g2), neither G1 nor G3 is active → 0% resistance.

When G1 is knocked out (g1), G3 is active → contributes 50% resistance, but wait, in the data, g1 is 75%. Hmm, that's a problem because if G3 contributes 50%, then without G1, you'd have 50%, but the data says g1 is 75%.

Wait, perhaps I have it reversed. Maybe G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%. So, when G1 is knocked out, you have 75% resistance (100 -25) and when G3 is knocked out, you have 50% (100-50).

In the double mutant g1g3, you lose both contributions → 100 - 25 -50 =25% resistance. But the data says it's 10%, which doesn't match. So perhaps their contributions are not additive but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is necessary for G3's function. So, without G1, G3 can't contribute either. But that doesn't fit because in the g3 mutant, the resistance is 50%, which would imply that G3 can function without G1.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think about the options given.

The question asks which conclusion can be drawn regarding the genes' interactions. The options are A to D. Let's look at the options.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but the question says that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. So perhaps G2 is the transcription factor.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm, same promoter would mean they're co-regulated, perhaps. But I'm not sure. Also, G3 being epistatic towards G1 would mean that G3 is downstream of G1.

Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure how that applies here.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Gene redundancy means that either gene can perform the same function. So if both are knocked out, the effect is worse.

Wait, but redundancy would mean that if one is knocked out, the other can compensate. So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out one would lead to a phenotype, but knocking out both would be worse.

In our data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So, in that case, they're not redundant because their individual knockouts have different effects. So, perhaps D isn't correct.

Wait, but the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is much worse than either. So that suggests that they are additive, not redundant. So maybe D is not correct.

Looking back at the options, let's reevaluate.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy. Wait, but in the data, G2's knockout leads to 0%, so G2 is likely the transcription factor upstream. So A might not be correct.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so co-regulated), G3 epistatic to G1. So G3 is downstream of G1. So if G3 is knocked out, it would mask the effect of G1. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is lower than when G1 is knocked out. That doesn't fit with G3 being epistatic to G1. Because if G3 is epistatic, then in the absence of G3, the effect of G1 would not be seen. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g3, but the data says 10%. So maybe not.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure, but if G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean G1 is upstream. So the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. But in the data, g3 is 50%, which is lower than g1's 75%. So if G1 is upstream, knocking out G3 would still have some effect even if G1 is present. Hmm, maybe.

Alternatively, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of G3's mutation is only seen when G1 is present. So, in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be same as g1. But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). So that doesn't fit. So perhaps C isn't correct.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Gene redundancy would mean that either can compensate, so knocking out both would have a worse effect. But in the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So in the double mutant, it's 10%, which is additive. So perhaps this isn't redundancy. Instead, it's additive, meaning they contribute independently. So D's redundancy might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct model is that G2 is the transcription factor, and it activates both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that contribute to resistance. So each contributes a portion, and together they add up. So, without G2, no G1 or G3 → 0% resistance.

In the g1 mutant, G3 is active, giving 50% resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the model is that G2 is a transcription factor that activates G3, which in turn activates G1. So, G2 → G3 → G1. Then:

- Without G2 (g2), G3 and G1 are not expressed → 0% resistance.
- Without G3 (g3), G1 isn't expressed either → resistance would be 0%, but data says 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the TF, and it activates both G1 and G3, which are both involved in the same pathway. So, each contributes some part of the resistance, but their functions are additive.

So, without G2, 0% resistance.

Without G1, resistance is 75% (so G1 contributes 25%).
Without G3, resistance is 50% (so G3 contributes 50%).
Without both, 75-25 +50-50 → 25% +50% =75%? No, but the data shows 10%, which doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway. So, G2 activates G3, which activates G1. So, without G2, no G3 or G1 → resistance 0%. Without G3, G1 isn't active → resistance 0%, but data says g3 is 50%, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about each option's details.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1.

But the data suggests G2 is the TF because knocking it out leads to 0% resistance. So A can't be correct.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would mean they're co-regulated. If G3 is epistatic to G1, then G3's function is downstream. So in the double mutant g1g3, you would see the same as g3. But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse. So this might not fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure how that applies here. Also, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance should be same as g1, but data says 10%.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy means they can compensate for each other. So, knocking out one would have a phenotype, but knocking out both would be worse. But our data for g1g3 is 10%, which is much worse than either single mutant. So this fits with redundancy. Wait, but if they were redundant, knocking out both would have the same effect as knocking out one, but here it's worse. So perhaps it's not redundancy but additive.

Wait, but if they are redundant, then the double mutant would be same as either single. So perhaps D is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are not redundant but additive. So their effects add up. So G2 is TF, activating both, which add to the resistance.

In that case, G1 and G3 are epistatic to each other in some way.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. So, 10% is much less than either single mutant. So, when both G1 and G3 are not functional, the resistance drops much more. So, G1 and G3 must be contributing to the same pathway, and their functions are additive.

Wait, but how does that fit with the rest of the data?

Let me think about the options again. The correct answer is likely that G2 is the transcription factor, and perhaps G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options, option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But as I thought earlier, redundancy would mean that the double mutant would have the same as the single mutants, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. So, without G2, you get 0% because both are off. Without G1, G3 is active, giving 50% (wait, but data says g1 is 75%). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another possibility: G2 is a TF, and G3 is its target. G3 in turn is necessary for G1's function. So, G2 → G3 → G1.

In this case:

- g2 (no G2) → no G3 → no G1 → 0% resistance.
- g3 (no G3) → no G1 → resistance depends on something else. But in the data, g3 is 50%, so maybe there's another pathway.
- g1 (no G1) → but G3 is active → resistance comes from G3. So, if G3 contributes 50% when active, then g1 would be 50% resistance. But the data says g1 is 75%, which doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should look for which option fits the data.

The correct answer is likely option A, B, C, or D.

Wait, let's look at the epistatic relationships.

We know that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because in the double mutants with G2 knocked out, the resistance is the same as G2 alone. So G2 is upstream of both.

Now, looking at the g1g3 double mutant: 10% resistance. Since G2 is functional, the resistance is lower than either single mutant. So, the presence of both G1 and G3 is necessary for higher resistance. So, their functions are additive.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So, G1 contributes 25%, G3 contributes 50%, and together they contribute 75%. But wait, in the wild type, all are functional, so 100% resistance. So perhaps, in addition to G1 and G3, there's another factor contributing 25% (maybe G2 itself? Or another gene). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

In any case, the correct option must state that G2 is the transcription factor, and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, option A says G1 is TF, which is unlikely. Option B says G2 is TF. Option C says G2 is TF. Option D says G2 is TF.

The correct option must have G2 as the TF.

Now, the second part of the options deals with the relationship between G1 and G3.

Option B: G1 and G3 have the same promoter. If they have the same promoter, then knocking out G2 would affect both. But the data shows g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, which are different. So perhaps they have different promoters, meaning they are not co-regulated. So option B might not be correct.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here.

Option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. If they were redundant, the double mutant would have the same as the more severe single mutant. But the double is 10%, which is worse than either, so redundancy is unlikely.

Hmm. Another possibility is that G1 and G3 are in a synthetic lethal pathway. But I don't think that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway, but the data doesn't fit.

Maybe the correct option is option A, but that says G1 is the TF. No. I think I should think that G2 is the TF.

Looking at the options, the only ones where G2 is the TF are B, C, D.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, what is pleiotropy? It's when a gene affects multiple traits. So, perhaps G1 is involved in multiple aspects of the resistance pathway. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G1 is epistatic to G3. So, the pathway is G2 → G3 → G1.

Wait, but in that case, if G3 is knocked out, G1 wouldn't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance, but data says g3 is 50%. So that can't be.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the data.

The data shows that G2 is necessary for any resistance (0% when G2 is knocked out). So G2 is the transcription factor.

In the g1 mutant, resistance is 75%, so it's 25% less than wild type. In g3, 50% less. So G1 and G3 each contribute to the resistance, but G1 contributes less than G3.

In the double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10%—so 90% loss. So their contributions are additive. So, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that add to the resistance.

So, the model is: G2 activates both G1 and G3, which each contribute to resistance. G3 contributes more than G1.

So, when G2 is present, both contribute. When G2 is absent, no resistance.

Now, looking at the options, which option fits this?

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But redundancy doesn't fit because the double mutant is worse than either single.

So perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but let me look again.

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because G2 is the TF. So A is wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would mean that G1 and G3 are co-regulated. But their individual knockouts have different effects, so perhaps they have separate promoters. So B may not be correct.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure, but perhaps G1 affects more traits than G3. Not sure if this applies.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3. But redundancy doesn't fit the data, so D is wrong.

Hmm. Maybe option C is correct. Let me think: G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, the function of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. But in the data, g3 is 50% resistance, which is lower than g1's 75%.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then when G1 is knocked out, the function of G3 doesn't matter. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1, which is 75%. But the data shows 10%, so that doesn't fit.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think about the epistatic relationships.

The data shows that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So the correct option must have G2 as the TF.

Looking at the options, only options B, C, D have G2 as the TF.

Now, which of these options fit the other data.

Option B: G1 and G3 have same promoter. So they are co-regulated. But in the data, their individual knockouts have different effects, so perhaps they are co-regulated but have different functions.

Option B also says G3 is epistatic towards G1. So G3 is downstream. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be the same as g3, which is 50%, but the data shows 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1, which is 75%, but data says 10%. Doesn't fit.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Same issue as C.

Wait, perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but I should pick the best option based on the data.

Wait, going back to the data, in the double mutant g1g2, resistance is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, so G2 is epistatic to G3.

So, in the options, the correct conclusion is that G2 is a TF and is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, option B says G3 is epistatic towards G1. That would be the opposite of what we see.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. That would mean G1 is upstream of G3, but our data shows G2 is upstream.

So, the correct option must have G2 as the TF and G2 being epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, option A has G1 as TF, so wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF. G3 is epistatic towards G1. But our data shows G2 is epistatic to both.

Option C: G2 is TF. G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1 is upstream of G3. But our data shows that knocking out G2 makes everything zero, so G2 is upstream.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But redundancy doesn't fit, as the double mutant is worse.

Wait, perhaps I've been missing something. Let me think about the epistasis again.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. So if G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's knockout is not seen. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1. But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%.

So that doesn't fit. Therefore, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. So, the function of G1 is only seen when G3 is present. That would mean that in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is same as g3. But the data shows 10%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1, but in this case, the phenotypes don't align.

I think I've spent enough time. Based on the data, the correct answer must involve G2 as the TF, and the other genes in a way that their combined knockout leads to an additive effect. So, looking at the options, option A is out because it says G1 is TF. Option B says G3 is epistatic to G1, but I'm not sure. Option C and D involve G2 as TF.

Wait, another thought: the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. Since G2 is present, but both G1 and G3 are knocked out, perhaps each contributes a part, and their absence leads to a much lower resistance. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway, each contributing a part. So, G2 → G3 → G1.

But without G3, G1 can't be expressed. So, if G3 is knocked out, G1 would not be expressed, leading to 0% resistance, but the data says g3 is 50%. So that model doesn't fit.

Hmm.

At this point, I think the best option is option A is wrong, and among the others, option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not fully confident.

Wait, another approach: considering that knocking out G2 leads to all resistance lost, G2 is the upstream TF. Then, the single mutants g1 and g3 have partial resistance, meaning they are downstream of G2.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than either single, so their effects are additive. So, G1 and G3 are in separate downstream pathways. So, when both are knocked out, the resistance is additive.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream and additive.

Looking at the options, which one aligns with this.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. No, because redundancy would mean the double mutant is same as the worse single mutant.

So, perhaps the correct option is none of them perfectly fit, but given the options, the best fit is option D, which says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Another angle: the fact that the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance suggests that each contributes 50% and 25% respectively. So, their combined knockout leads to 75% + 50% loss = 25% resistance. But data shows 10%, which doesn't fit. So perhaps they contribute non-additively.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the TF, and the resistance is controlled by a threshold model. For example, you need a certain level of G1 and G3 activity to reach the threshold for resistance. So, each contributes, but their combined loss drops resistance below the threshold.

But I'm not sure.

I think I've thought this through as much as I can. I'll have to make a choice based on the data and the options.


The question involves determining the interaction of three genes (G1, G2, and G3) in white lupine plants contributing to resistance against anthracnose. The experiment includes single and double mutants, and the resistance levels are measured as percentages of the wild-type control (100%). The key results are:

- **g1**: 75% resistance  
- **g2**: 0% resistance  
- **g3**: 50% resistance  
- **g1g3**: 10% resistance  
- **g2g3**: 0% resistance  
- **g1g2**: 0% resistance  

### Analysis of the Data
1. **Role of G2**:  
   - The **g2 mutant** shows 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is essential for resistance. This suggests that G2 is likely a transcription factor acting upstream of other genes, as its knockout eliminates all resistance.

2. **Epistasis Relationships**:  
   - In the double mutants **g1g2** and **g2g3**, the resistance is 0%, the same as the **g2 mutant**. This indicates that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning G2 is upstream and its function is necessary for G1 and G3 to contribute to resistance.

3. **Interactions Between G1 and G3**:  
   - The **g1 mutant** has 75% resistance, while the **g3 mutant** has 50% resistance. This suggests that G1 contributes more to resistance than G3 when G2 is functional.  
   - The double mutant **g1g3** has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. This implies that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance, and their combined loss leads to an additive or synergistic reduction in resistance.

### Evaluation of the Options
- **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1.  
  - This is inconsistent with the data, as G2 is clearly the transcription factor (g2 mutant has 0% resistance), not G1.  

- **Option B**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic to G1.  
  - While G2 being the transcription factor aligns with the data, the claim that G1 and G3 have the same promoter is unlikely, as their single mutants have different resistance levels (75% for g1 and 50% for g3). Additionally, G3 being epistatic to G1 is not supported, as the double mutant g1g3 shows 10% resistance, worse than either single mutant.

- **Option C**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.  
  - G2 being the transcription factor is correct. However, pleiotropy (where a gene affects multiple traits) is not clearly demonstrated here. The claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is also inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant.

- **Option D**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.  
  - Gene redundancy implies that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other, but the double mutant g1g3 shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. This contradicts the idea of redundancy. Additionally, G1 being epistatic to G3 is not supported, as the resistance levels of the mutants do not align with this relationship.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, **Option D** is the most plausible choice, as it correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and partially aligns with the idea that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance. However, the claim of gene redundancy and epistasis relationships do not fully fit the data. Despite its imperfections, Option D is the closest match to the experimental results.

**Answer: D**
