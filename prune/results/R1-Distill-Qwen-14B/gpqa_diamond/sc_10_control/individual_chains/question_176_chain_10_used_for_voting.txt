Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh, right, quantum states are usually represented by unit vectors. So I probably need to normalize this vector first. Let me calculate the norm. The vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. I should keep this in mind because the probabilities depend on this normalization.

Next, the operators for observables P and Q are given. Operator P has a matrix where the first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, I'm not sure about the structure here. Maybe it's a diagonalizing matrix or something else. Wait, for an observable, the matrix should be Hermitian because observables are represented by Hermitian operators. Let me check if P is Hermitian. Each element a_ij must equal a_ji* (the complex conjugate). Looking at the elements, all entries are real, so the transpose should equal the original matrix. Let me see: the (1,2) entry is 1/sqrt(2), and the (2,1) entry is same. The (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2), and (3,2) is same. So yes, P is symmetric, so it's Hermitian. Good.

Operator Q is given as a diagonal matrix with elements [1, 0, -1] on the diagonal. So Q is diagonal, which makes it easy to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors, I suppose. Like, for eigenvalue 1, it's [1,0,0], for 0, it's [0,1,0], and for -1, [0,0,1].

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no. The question says: "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So first, measure P and get 0, then measure Q and get -1. So the order is P first, then Q.

Wait, no, the wording says, "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the sequence is P, then Q. So the measurement of Q happens after the state has been changed by the measurement of P.

So, the process is: initial state is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T / sqrt(6). First, measure P. If the outcome is 0, the state collapses to the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, in this new state, measure Q, and find the probability of getting -1.

So the steps are:

1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.
2. Find the projection of the initial state onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.
3. If the outcome is 0 for P, the state becomes the normalized eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0.
4. Then, compute the probability of measuring -1 for Q in this new state.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the state after the first measurement is the eigenstate of P corresponding to 0, and then we compute the expectation with Q.

But to proceed, I need to find the eigenvectors of P.

So let's find the eigenvalues of P first. The matrix P is:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]

Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Wait, let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

To find the eigenvalues, I can compute the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) =0.

Calculating the determinant of (P - λ I) might be a bit involved, but perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's consider the matrix structure.

Looking at P, it's a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues. The matrix seems to have a particular structure. Let me think about its possible eigenvectors.

Wait, maybe it's easier to note that P is a circulant matrix? Or perhaps it's block diagonal or has some symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors or have some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps I can guess the eigenvalues. Let me try to compute the trace. The trace of P is 0+0+0=0. So the sum of eigenvalues is 0.

Let me compute the determinant of P. Hmm, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps looking for eigenvectors.

Let me look for eigenvectors. Let me consider a vector like [1, a, 1]^T. Wait, let me try to find if such a vector is an eigenvector.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard basis vectors are eigenvectors.

Let me test. Let me compute P*e_i, where e_i is the i-th standard basis vector.

For e1 = [1, 0, 0]^T:

P*e1 = [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]^T. So (P - λ I) e1 = [ -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]^T. For e1 to be an eigenvector, the resulting vector should be a multiple of e1, so -λ = something, but the second component is 1/sqrt(2), which can't be zero unless λ is such that 1/sqrt(2) is zero, which it isn't. So e1 is not an eigenvector.

Similarly, let's test e2 = [0,1,0]^T.

P*e2 = [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]^T. For this to be an eigenvector, each component must be λ times the original. So [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)] = λ [0,1,0]. But the first component is 1/sqrt(2), which would imply λ=0 in the second component, but then the third component would have to be zero, which it's not. So e2 is not an eigenvector.

Testing e3 = [0,0,1]^T:

P*e3 = [0,1/sqrt(2), 0]^T. For this to be λ e3, we would need [0,1/sqrt(2),0] = [0,0, λ]. But the second component is 1/sqrt(2) ≠0, so e3 is not an eigenvector.

Hmm, maybe the eigenvectors are symmetric in a certain way. Let me try to look for eigenvectors in a more structured approach.

Let me consider the equations (P - λ I) v = 0.

v is a 3-component vector [v1, v2, v3]^T.

So the equations are:

1) 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = λ v1

2) (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = λ v2

3) 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = λ v3

Equation 1: (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = λ v1 → v2 = λ sqrt(2) v1.

Equation 3: (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = λ v3 → v3 = (v2)/(sqrt(2) λ) ) = (λ sqrt(2) v1 ) / (sqrt(2) λ ) ) = v1.

So v3 = v1.

Equation 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = λ v2.

But v3 = v1, and v2 = λ sqrt(2) v1.

So equation 2 becomes:

(1/sqrt(2))(v1 + v1) ) = λ (λ sqrt(2) v1 )

Simplify left side: (2 v1)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) v1.

Right side: λ^2 sqrt(2) v1.

So equation: sqrt(2) v1 = λ^2 sqrt(2) v1.

Assuming v1 ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by sqrt(2) v1:

1 = λ^2 → λ = 1 or λ = -1.

So possible eigenvalues are 1 and -1. Wait, but earlier I thought the trace is zero, so sum of eigenvalues is zero. So if we have eigenvalues 1, -1, and another one, their sum must be zero. Let me see: suppose the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. Then sum is zero, which fits the trace.

So perhaps the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0.

Wait, but according to this, for each case:

Case 1: λ =1.

Then, v2 = sqrt(2) v1.

v3 =v1.

So the eigenvectors are [v1, sqrt(2) v1, v1]^T.

Let me pick v1=1, then the eigenvector is [1, sqrt(2), 1]^T.

Case 2: λ=-1.

v2 = (-1) * sqrt(2) v1.

v3 = v1.

So eigenvector is [v1, -sqrt(2) v1, v1]^T.

Case 3: λ=0.

Wait, let's see what happens when λ=0.

From equation 1: (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

Equation 3: (1/sqrt(2)) v2 =0 → v3 can be anything? Wait, equation 3 becomes (1/sqrt(2)) *0 =0 * v3 → 0=0, so v3 is free.

Equation 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0.

So, (v1 + v3)/sqrt(2) =0 → v1 = -v3.

So for λ=0, the eigenvectors satisfy v2=0, and v1 = -v3.

Thus, the eigenvectors are [v1, 0, -v1]^T, where v1 is a scalar.

So, for example, choosing v1=1, the eigenvector is [1,0,-1]^T.

Wait, but does this vector satisfy (P - 0 I) v =0?

Let me check.

v = [1,0,-1]^T.

Compute P v:

= [0*1 + (1/√2)(0) +0*(-1), (1/√2)(1) +0*0 + (1/√2)(-1), 0*(1) + (1/√2)(0) +0*(-1) ].

Wait, calculating each component:

First component: (0)(1) + (1/sqrt(2)) (0) + 0 (-1) → 0.

Second component: (1/sqrt(2))(1) + 0 *0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) → (1 -1)/sqrt(2) =0.

Third component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) →0.

So P v = [0,0,0]^T = 0 *v → yes, it is an eigenvector for λ=0.

So the eigenvalues of P are 1, -1, and 0.

The eigenvectors for λ=0 is [1,0,-1]^T, up to scaling.

Wait, but in the case of λ=0, the eigenvectors are vectors where v2=0, and v1 = -v3. So any scalar multiple of [1,0,-1]^T is an eigenvector.

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by [1,0,-1]^T.

Therefore, the state after measuring P and getting 0 is the projection of the initial state onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So, first, find the initial state |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

We need to find the component of |ψ> in the direction of the eigenvector [1,0,-1]^T.

Because the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is given by the inner product of |ψ> with the eigenvector (divided by the norm of the eigenvector squared) multiplied by the eigenvector.

Wait, but the eigenvector [1,0,-1]^T has its own norm. Let me compute it. The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2)=sqrt(2).

So the unit eigenvector is [1,0,-1]^T / sqrt(2).

Compute the inner product of |ψ> with this unit eigenvector.

Inner product:

[ -1, 2, 1 ] * (1/sqrt(6)) * [1; 0; -1 ] * (1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, the inner product is ψ† * (eigenvector).

Which is ( (-1)/sqrt(6) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6)) * (0) ) + (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ).

Wait, let me compute each term:

First term: (-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) → -1 / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) = -1/(sqrt(12)) = -1/(2 sqrt(3)).

Second term: 2/sqrt(6) * 0 → 0.

Third term: (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) → -1/(sqrt(12)) → -1/(2 sqrt(3)).

So summing the terms: (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) + 0 + (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) ) = -2/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = -1/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared of this is (1/ sqrt(3)) )^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring 0 for P is the square of the absolute value of this inner product. So the probability is 1/3.

But wait, the problem says we have to get 0 for P and then -1 for Q. So after measuring P and getting 0, the state becomes the normalized eigenvector of P corresponding to 0.

So the new state is the unit eigenvector [1,0,-1]^T / sqrt(2).

Now, we need to measure Q, which has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The matrix Q is diagonal, so its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

The state after P measurement is |φ> = [1, 0, -1]^T / sqrt(2).

To find the probability of measuring -1 for Q, we compute the inner product between |φ> and the eigenvector of Q with eigenvalue -1, which is [0,0,1]^T.

The inner product is < [0,0,1] | φ >.

So compute the third component of |φ>, which is (-1)/sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is (1/2).

So the probability for Q being -1 is 1/2.

But wait, the overall probability is the product of the probabilities of each step, given that each measurement affects the state. So the overall probability is (probability of P=0) multiplied by (probability of Q=-1 given P=0).

Which is (1/3) * (1/2) ) = 1/6.

Wait, no. No, because the state after P measurement is |φ>, and the Q measurement is done on |φ>. So the probability is 1/3 (for P=0) times 1/2 (for Q=-1 in that state). So the combined probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

But wait, another thought: the initial state is |ψ>, and P measurement gives 0 with probability 1/3. Then, in that case, the state becomes |φ>. Then, measuring Q gives -1 with probability 1/2. So the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Looking back at the options, option D is 1/6.

So the answer should be option D.

The problem involves a quantum system with an initial state vector \( |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), and two observables \( P \) and \( Q \). The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix},
\]

and \( Q \) is represented by the diagonal matrix:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The task is to find the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) followed by \( Q = -1 \).

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found to be \( \lambda_P = 1, -1, 0 \). The corresponding eigenvectors are:
- For \( \lambda_P = 0 \): \( |0\rangle_P = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

The eigenspace for \( \lambda_P = 0 \) is one-dimensional, spanned by \( |0\rangle_P \).

### Step 2: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The initial state \( |\psi\rangle \) is projected onto \( |0\rangle_P \). The projection is:

\[
\langle 0|_P \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = -\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of this projection:

\[
P(P=0) = \left| \langle 0|_P \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: State after measuring \( P = 0 \)
If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the state collapses to the normalized eigenvector \( |0\rangle_P \):

\[
|\phi\rangle = |0\rangle_P = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \)
The observable \( Q \) has eigenvalues \( 1, 0, -1 \), with eigenvectors being the standard basis vectors. The eigenvector for \( Q = -1 \) is \( |-\rangle_Q = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) in the state \( |\phi\rangle \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product:

\[
\langle -|_Q \phi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

\[
P(Q=-1) = \left| \langle -|_Q \phi \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Combined probability
The combined probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) followed by \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) in sequence is \( \frac{1}{6} \).

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh, right, quantum states are usually represented by unit vectors. So I probably need to normalize this vector first. Let me calculate the norm. The vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. I should keep this in mind because the probabilities depend on this normalization.

Next, the operators for observables P and Q are given. Operator P has a matrix where the first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, I'm not sure about the structure here. Maybe it's a diagonalizing matrix or something else.

Operator Q is given as a diagonal matrix with elements [1, 0, -1] on the diagonal. So Q is diagonal, which makes it easy to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors, I suppose. Like, for eigenvalue 1, it's [1,0,0], for 0, it's [0,1,0], and for -1, [0,0,1].

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no. The question says: "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So first, measure P and get 0, then measure Q and get -1. So the order is P first, then Q.

Wait, no, the wording says, "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the sequence is P, then Q. So the measurement of Q happens after the state has been changed by the measurement of P.

So the steps are:

1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.
2. Find the projection of the initial state onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.
3. If the outcome is 0 for P, the state becomes the normalized eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0.
4. Then, compute the probability of measuring -1 for Q in this new state.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the state after the first measurement is the eigenstate of P corresponding to 0, and then we compute the expectation with Q.

But to proceed, I need to find the eigenvectors of P.

So let's find the eigenvalues of P first. The matrix P is:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]

Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Wait, let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

To find the eigenvalues, I can compute the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) =0.

Calculating the determinant of (P - λ I) might be a bit involved, but perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's consider the matrix structure.

Looking at P, it's a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues. The matrix seems to have a particular structure. Let me think about its possible eigenvectors.

Wait, maybe it's easier to note that P is a circulant matrix? Or perhaps it's block diagonal or has some symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors or have some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps I can guess the eigenvalues. Let me try to compute the trace. The trace of P is 0+0+0=0. So the sum of eigenvalues is 0.

Let me compute the determinant of P. Hmm, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps looking for eigenvectors.

Let me look for eigenvectors. Let me consider a vector like [1, a, 1]^T. Wait, let me try to find if such a vector is an eigenvector.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard basis vectors are eigenvectors.

Let me test. Let me compute P*e_i, where e_i is the i-th standard basis vector.

For e1 = [1, 0, 0]^T:

P*e1 = [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]^T. So (P - λ I) e1 = [ -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]^T. For e1 to be an eigenvector, the resulting vector should be a multiple of e1, so -λ = something, but the second component is 1/sqrt(2), which can't be zero unless λ is such that 1/sqrt(2) is zero, which it isn't. So e1 is not an eigenvector.

Similarly, let's test e2 = [0,1,0]^T.

P*e2 = [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]^T. For this to be an eigenvector, each component must be λ times the original. So [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)] = λ [0,1,0]. But the first component is 1/sqrt(2), which would imply λ=0 in the second component, but then the third component would have to be zero, which it's not. So e2 is not an eigenvector.

Testing e3 = [0,0,1]^T:

P*e3 = [0,1/sqrt(2), 0]^T. For this to be λ e3, we would need [0,1/sqrt(2),0] = [0,0, λ]. But the second component is 1/sqrt(2) ≠0, so e3 is not an eigenvector.

Hmm, maybe the eigenvectors are symmetric in a certain way. Let me try to look for eigenvectors in a more structured approach.

Let me consider the equations (P - λ I) v = 0.

v is a 3-component vector [v1, v2, v3]^T.

So the equations are:

1) 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = λ v1

2) (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = λ v2

3) 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = λ v3

Equation 1: (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = λ v1 → v2 = λ sqrt(2) v1.

Equation 3: (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = λ v3 → v3 = (v2)/(sqrt(2) λ) ) = (λ sqrt(2) v1 ) / (sqrt(2) λ ) ) = v1.

So v3 = v1.

Equation 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = λ v2.

But v3 = v1, and v2 = λ sqrt(2) v1.

So equation 2 becomes:

(1/sqrt(2))(v1 + v1) ) = λ (λ sqrt(2) v1 )

Simplify left side: (2 v1)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) v1.

Right side: λ^2 sqrt(2) v1.

So equation: sqrt(2) v1 = λ^2 sqrt(2) v1.

Assuming v1 ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by sqrt(2) v1:

1 = λ^2 → λ = 1 or λ = -1.

So possible eigenvalues are 1 and -1. Wait, but earlier I thought the trace is zero, so sum of eigenvalues is zero. So if we have eigenvalues 1, -1, and another one, their sum must be zero. Let me see: suppose the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. Then sum is zero, which fits the trace.

So perhaps the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0.

Wait, but according to this, for each case:

Case 1: λ =1.

Then, v2 = sqrt(2) v1.

v3 =v1.

So the eigenvectors are [v1, sqrt(2) v1, v1]^T.

Let me pick v1=1, then the eigenvector is [1, sqrt(2), 1]^T.

Case 2: λ=-1.

v2 = (-1) * sqrt(2) v1.

v3 = v1.

So eigenvector is [v1, -sqrt(2) v1, v1]^T.

Case 3: λ=0.

Wait, let's see what happens when λ=0.

From equation 1: (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

Equation 3: (1/sqrt(2)) v2 =0 → v3 can be anything? Wait, equation 3 becomes (1/sqrt(2)) *0 =0 * v3 → 0=0, so v3 is free.

Equation 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0.

So, (v1 + v3)/sqrt(2) =0 → v1 = -v3.

So for λ=0, the eigenvectors satisfy v2=0, and v1 = -v3.

Thus, the eigenvectors are [v1, 0, -v1]^T, where v1 is a scalar.

So, for example, choosing v1=1, the eigenvector is [1,0,-1]^T.

Wait, but does this vector satisfy (P - 0 I) v =0?

Let me check.

v = [1,0,-1]^T.

Compute P v:

= [0*1 + (1/√2)(0) +0*(-1), (1/√2)(1) +0*0 + (1/√2)(-1), 0*(1) + (1/√2)(0) +0*(-1) ].

Wait, calculating each component:

First component: (0)(1) + (1/sqrt(2)) (0) + 0 (-1) → 0.

Second component: (1/sqrt(2))(1) + 0 *0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) → (1 -1)/sqrt(2) =0.

Third component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) →0.

So P v = [0,0,0]^T = 0 *v → yes, it is an eigenvector for λ=0.

So the eigenvalues of P are 1, -1, and 0.

The eigenvectors for λ=0 is [1,0,-1]^T, up to scaling.

Wait, but in the case of λ=0, the eigenvectors are vectors where v2=0, and v1 = -v3. So any scalar multiple of [1,0,-1]^T is an eigenvector.

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by [1,0,-1]^T.

Therefore, the state after measuring P and getting 0 is the projection of the initial state onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So, first, find the initial state |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

We need to find the component of |ψ> in the direction of the eigenvector [1,0,-1]^T.

Because the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is given by the inner product of |ψ> with the eigenvector (divided by the norm of the eigenvector squared) multiplied by the eigenvector.

Wait, but the eigenvector [1,0,-1]^T has its own norm. Let me compute it. The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2)=sqrt(2).

So the unit eigenvector is [1,0,-1]^T / sqrt(2).

Compute the inner product of |ψ> with this unit eigenvector.

Inner product:

[ -1, 2, 1 ] * (1/sqrt(6)) * [1; 0; -1 ] * (1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, the inner product is ψ† * (eigenvector).

Which is ( (-1)/sqrt(6) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6)) * (0) ) + (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ).

Wait, let me compute each term:

First term: (-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) → -1 / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) = -1/(sqrt(12)) = -1/(2 sqrt(3)).

Second term: 2/sqrt(6) * 0 → 0.

Third term: (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) → -1/(sqrt(12)) → -1/(2 sqrt(3)).

So summing the terms: (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) + 0 + (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) ) = -2/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = -1/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared of this is (1/ sqrt(3)) )^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring 0 for P is the square of the absolute value of this inner product. So the probability is 1/3.

But wait, the problem says we have to get 0 for P and then -1 for Q. So after measuring P and getting 0, the state becomes the normalized eigenvector of P corresponding to 0.

So the new state is the unit eigenvector [1,0,-1]^T / sqrt(2).

Now, we need to measure Q, which has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The matrix Q is diagonal, so its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

The state after P measurement is |φ> = [1, 0, -1]^T / sqrt(2).

To find the probability of measuring -1 for Q, we compute the inner product between |φ> and the eigenvector of Q with eigenvalue -1, which is [0,0,1]^T.

The inner product is < [0,0,1] | φ >.

So compute the third component of |φ>, which is (-1)/sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is (1/2).

So the probability for Q being -1 is 1/2.

But wait, the overall probability is the product of the probabilities of each step, given that each measurement affects the state. So the overall probability is (probability of P=0) multiplied by (probability of Q=-1 given P=0).

Which is (1/3) * (1/2) ) = 1/6.

Wait, no. No, because the state after P measurement is |φ>, and the Q measurement is done on |φ>. So the probability is 1/3 (for P=0) times 1/2 (for Q=-1 in that state). So the combined probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

But wait, another thought: the initial state is |ψ>, and P measurement gives 0 with probability 1/3. Then, in that case, the state becomes |φ>. Then, measuring Q gives -1 with probability 1/2. So the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Looking back at the options, option D is 1/6.

So the answer should be option D.


The problem involves a quantum system with an initial state vector \( |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), and two observables \( P \) and \( Q \). The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix},
\]

and \( Q \) is represented by the diagonal matrix:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The task is to find the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) followed by \( Q = -1 \).

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found to be \( \lambda_P = 1, -1, 0 \). The corresponding eigenvectors are:
- For \( \lambda_P = 0 \): \( |0\rangle_P = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

The eigenspace for \( \lambda_P = 0 \) is one-dimensional, spanned by \( |0\rangle_P \).

### Step 2: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The initial state \( |\psi\rangle \) is projected onto \( |0\rangle_P \). The projection is:

\[
\langle 0|_P \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = -\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of this projection:

\[
P(P=0) = \left| \langle 0|_P \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: State after measuring \( P = 0 \)
If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the state collapses to the normalized eigenvector \( |0\rangle_P \):

\[
|\phi\rangle = |0\rangle_P = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \)
The observable \( Q \) has eigenvalues \( 1, 0, -1 \), with eigenvectors being the standard basis vectors. The eigenvector for \( Q = -1 \) is \( |-\rangle_Q = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) in the state \( |\phi\rangle \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product:

\[
\langle -|_Q \phi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

\[
P(Q=-1) = \left| \langle -|_Q \phi \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Combined probability
The combined probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) followed by \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) in sequence is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
