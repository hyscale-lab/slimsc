Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about nuclear decay and how the energy spectrum of emitted particles changes under certain conditions. Hmm, I need to think about what I remember from my studies.

Alright, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So two particles A decay into two B, and emit two E and two V. It's given that the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q. 

Wait, I remember that in beta decay, which is a type of nuclear decay, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum. But wait, that's because in beta decay, a neutron turns into a proton, emitting an electron and an antineutrino. The total energy is shared between them, so the electron has a range of energies, hence a continuous spectrum. So in that case, the maximum energy (endpoint) is determined by the Q value of the decay. 

So in this problem, the decay is similar but involves two E particles and two V particles. The total energy available (Q) would be shared among all the emitted particles. So the E particles' energy would vary, giving a continuous spectrum up to Q. 

Now, the variant in question emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the two V. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Hmm, M is massless, so it's like a photon or a neutrino, which travels at the speed of light and has negligible mass. 

Wait, in the original decay, we have 2V. So if V is a particle with some mass, then each V would carry away some energy and momentum. But when they're replaced by M, which is massless, perhaps the dynamics change. 

In the first case, when you have two Vs, they carry away some energy each. But since M is massless, perhaps it's like having more particles with different properties. Wait, but in the original decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum. That suggests that in the original case, the E's energy can vary, implying that the total energy isn't fixed for each E. 

Wait, but in the original case, perhaps each E has a maximum energy Q, but their energies can vary because of the varying distribution of energy among the emitted particles. But when you change the number or type of emitted particles, how does this affect the E particles' spectrum?

Wait, considering that in the original decay, the E's have a continuous spectrum. So that's because the energy isn't fixed for each E—each E can have a range of energies depending on the distribution. 

Now, when you change the decay products, specifically replacing two V's with one M, which is massless, how does that affect the E's? Let's think about energy and momentum conservation. 

In the original case, you emit 2E and 2V. Let's say each V has some mass, but when you replace them with a single M (massless), the system changes. I think when you have more particles emitted, the energy and momentum distribution can become more varied. But wait, in the original decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum because the other particles (V's) take away some of the energy. 

Wait, when you have more particles emitted, the available energy is divided among more particles. So each E's maximum energy would decrease, right? Because more particles share the same Q. Hmm, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, another approach: think about what determines the endpoint of the E's. The endpoint is the maximum energy any E can have. That happens when as much energy as possible is given to one E, and the others get the minimum. But wait, in the original case, when you have two E's and two V's, the maximum energy for each E would depend on how the other particles are distributed. 

Wait, but in the first case, the E's have a continuous spectrum up to Q. So the maximum energy any E can have is Q. Because if all the energy goes into one E, then the others (the other E and the V's) would have zero energy, which isn't possible because they must have some momentum too. Wait, no, because particles can't have negative energy, but in reality, energy is conserved so the maximum energy would be when the other particles carry away as little as possible. 

Alternatively, perhaps the endpoint Q is the maximum possible energy for the E particles. 

Now, when we change the decay products to include an M instead of two V's, how does this affect the maximum energy E can have? 

In the new decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So we're emitting two E's and one M. M is massless, so it's like a photon. Since M is massless, it's emitted with energy equal to its momentum. 

In the original decay, two V's are emitted, which have mass, so they carry away some energy and momentum. Now, in the new case, we have one M, which is massless, so perhaps it's easier for the E's to carry more energy because M doesn't contribute as much to the momentum. Wait, no, I think I'm getting this mixed up. 

Wait, maybe we should model this using conservation of energy and momentum. Let's imagine the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before decay is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after decay must be zero. 

In the original decay: 2E's and 2V's. So the vector sum of their momenta must be zero. Each E and V has momentum p_i. So p_E1 + p_E2 + p_V1 + p_V2 = 0. 

In the new decay: 2E's and 1M. So p_E1 + p_E2 + p_M = 0. 

Because M is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum (since E = pc for massless particles). 

Hmm, but how does this affect the energy available for the E's? 

In the original case, since V's had mass, their rest mass would take away some energy. For instance, the energy of each V would be the sum of their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So for each V, E_V = m_V c^2 + K_V. 

In the new case, M is massless, so its energy is all kinetic (since its rest mass is zero). 

Wait, but in the original decay, the E's have a continuous spectrum. So the maximum energy Q is when as much energy as possible goes into the E's, but the other particles (V's) carry away some energy. 

In the new decay, with one M, perhaps the maximum energy for the E's could be higher or lower. Let me think about the endpoint. 

The endpoint Q is the maximum energy any E can have. So when one E has energy Q, the rest of the system must have zero net momentum. 

In the original case, with two V's, when one E has maximum energy, the other E and the two V's would have to have their momenta balanced such that the total is zero. 

In the new case, when one E has maximum energy, the other E and the M must balance that. 

But since M is massless, it can carry momentum without requiring much energy beyond its momentum. 

Wait, perhaps the maximum energy of the E's can be higher when the number of other particles is less. Because in the original case, two V's take some energy, but in the new case, one M might take less energy, allowing E's to have higher energy. 

Alternatively, maybe it's the opposite. Let me think about the Q value. 

The total Q is the same in both cases? Or is it different? Wait, the question says it's the same decay but with a different product. So the total energy Q is the same? Or perhaps the Q is the same? Or is Q the maximum energy for E in the first case. 

Wait, the original decay's E has a maximum energy Q. So when the decay emits 2E and 2V, the E's can go up to Q. 

In the variant decay, you're emitting 2E and 1M. So the E's can have higher maximum energy because M doesn't require as much energy for its rest mass. Because in the original case, two V's each have a rest mass, so their presence would take away some energy, limiting the E's maximum. 

Wait, but in this new decay, the M is massless, so the energy available for the E's and M is the same as before. So perhaps the E's can have higher maximum energies because there's no rest mass energy being taken by the V's. 

Wait, in the original case, the total energy released is Q. So 2E + 2V = Q. But if V has a rest mass, then each V contributes some energy just from their rest mass. So the E's can't get all the Q. 

In the new case, M is massless, so all the energy can go into the E's and M. So the E's can have more energy because there's no rest mass for M. So the maximum energy for each E could be higher. 

Wait, but wait. The total energy released in the decay is fixed as Q. So in the original case, some energy went into the rest mass of the V's. In the new case, since M is massless, all of the energy can be used for kinetic energy of the E's and M. 

Ah, so in the original case, the maximum energy any E could have is less than Q because some energy is used to create the V's (their rest mass). In the new case, because M is massless, the E's can take more energy. So the endpoint of the E's spectrum would be higher than Q. 

Wait, but the original case's E's have a maximum of Q. So in the new case, with M, the E's can have a higher maximum energy than Q? That doesn't make sense because the total Q is the same. Wait, perhaps I've confused the situation.

Wait, perhaps the Q value is the total energy available. So in the original decay, the total energy is Q, which is shared among 2E and 2V. In the new decay, the same Q is shared among 2E and 1M. Because M is massless, the energy available for the E's could be higher because M doesn't require any rest mass energy. 

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the total energy Q must be the same for both decay processes. So if in the original decay, some energy went into the rest mass of the V's, then in the new decay, that same energy isn't needed because M is massless. So the E's can have more of the Q energy. So the endpoint Q for the E's would increase.

Wait, but the original E's have a maximum of Q. So in the new case, their maximum would be higher than Q? That can't happen because the total energy is fixed. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the maximum energy of E is determined by how much energy can be given to E without violating conservation of energy and momentum. Let's model this. 

When you have a decay at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of all the decay products must sum to zero. 

In the original case, the decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. Let's say each E has energy E1 and E2, and each V has energy V1 and V2. Since the total energy is Q, which is the sum of all these energies. But also, their momenta must sum to zero. 

In the new case, the decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So the sum of the momenta of the two E's and M must be zero. 

The maximum energy for an E would occur when the other particles (E and M) have as little energy as possible. 

Wait, for the maximum energy of one E, say E1_max. Then, the other E (E2) and M must have enough energy and momentum to balance E1's momentum. 

But M is massless, so its momentum is equal to its energy (since E = pc). 

So to maximize E1's energy, we can set E2 and M's momenta to cancel E1's momentum.

But E2 is another E, which has energy E2 and momentum p2 = E2 (since for E, if it's a beta particle, it's relativistic, so E ≈ pc; but actually, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. But if E is a beta particle, m is small, so E ≈ pc. So for simplicity, let's approximate that E ≈ pc for E's.

So, assuming E's are non-relativistic? Wait, no, wait, beta particles are usually relativistic. So their energy is much larger than their rest mass, so E ≈ pc. 

Similarly, M is massless, so E_M = p_M c. 

So, for the original case:

The total momentum is zero, so p1 (from E1) + p2 (from E2) + p3 (from V1) + p4 (from V2) = 0.

In the new case:

p1 (E1) + p2 (E2) + p_M = 0.

So, in the new case, when you want to maximize E1's energy, you would have E2 and M balancing it. Let's model this.

Maximizing E1 means that E2 and M have the least possible energy consistent with momentum conservation.

Assuming E1 is moving along the positive x-axis, then E2 and M must have momentum in the opposite direction. 

The momentum vectors must sum to zero. So:

p1 (E1) = magnitude p1 along +x.

p2 (E2) = magnitude p2 along -x.

p_M = magnitude p_M along -x.

So, p1 = p2 + p_M.

But E1 ≈ p1 c.

E2 ≈ p2 c.

E_M = p_M c.

The total energy is E1 + E2 + E_M = Q.

But since we're trying to maximize E1, we can set E2 and E_M to their minimum possible values. What's the minimum? Well, E2 must be at least some value to make the momentum balance.

Wait, but maybe the minimal E2 and E_M would be when E2 and M are emitted in the same direction as E1. No, that can't be because their momenta would add up, which would not balance E1's. So E2 and M must be in the opposite direction.

Wait, perhaps to maximize E1, E2 and M must be as small as possible, but their momenta must cancel E1's.

So, we have p1 = p2 + p_M. 

But we also have E1 + E2 + E_M = Q.

Since E1 ≈ p1 c, E2 ≈ p2 c, and E_M = p_M c.

So substituting, p1 = p2 + p_M.

E1 = p1 c.

E2 = p2 c.

E_M = p_M c.

So, E1 + E2 + E_M = (p1 + p2 + p_M) c = (p1 + p1) c, because p2 + p_M = p1. So that's 2 p1 c = Q.

Wait, that would imply E1 = p1 c = (Q/(2 c)) * c) = Q/2. 

Wait, but that's not correct. Let me think again. 

Wait, E1 + E2 + E_M = (p1 + p2 + p_M) c = (p1 + (p2 + p_M)) c = (p1 + p1) c = 2 p1 c = Q.

So, p1 = Q/(2 c).

Therefore, E1 = p1 c = Q/(2 c) * c = Q/2. 

Wait, so the maximum E1 in the new case would be Q/2? But in the original case, the maximum E's were up to Q. That can't be right. 

Wait, maybe I messed up the setup. Because in the original case, with 2E and 2V, the maximum E could be up to Q. But according to this calculation, in the new case, the maximum E is Q/2. Which would mean the endpoint decreases. But that contradicts what I thought earlier.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that p2 and p_M can be as small as possible. Because when you have M, it's massless, so its energy is all momentum. So when you try to maximize E1, you need to have E2 and E_M sum up to provide the momentum opposite to E1.

Wait, perhaps the maximum E1 occurs when E2 and M are emitted in the same direction as E1 but with opposite momentum. No, that wouldn't make sense because their momenta would add up, making the total larger. 

Wait, perhaps in the scenario where E1 is maximum, E2 and M are emitted in the opposite direction, but how much energy do they need to take so that their momentum cancels E1's.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model it mathematically.

Let’s denote the momenta of E1, E2, and M as vectors. Let’s assume E1 is moving along +x, and E2 and M are moving along -x.

So, the momentum conservation equation is:

p_E1 (in +x) = p_E2 (in -x) + p_M (in -x).

So, p_E1 = p_E2 + p_M.

But since E1 ≈ p_E1 c, and E2 ≈ p_E2 c, and E_M = p_M c.

The total energy is E1 + E2 + E_M = Q.

Substituting:

p_E1 c + p_E2 c + p_M c = Q.

But from momentum conservation, p_E1 = p_E2 + p_M.

Let’s denote p_E2 = a, p_M = b.

So, p_E1 = a + b.

So the energy equation becomes:

(a + b) c + a c + b c = Q.

Which simplifies to:

a c + b c + a c + b c = Q.

Which is 2a c + 2b c = Q.

So, 2c (a + b) = Q.

But from momentum conservation, p_E1 = a + b. So a + b = p_E1.

So, 2c p_E1 = Q → p_E1 = Q/(2c).

Therefore, E1 = p_E1 c = (Q/(2c)) * c = Q/2.

So the maximum energy E1 can have is Q/2. 

Wait, that's interesting. So in the new case, the maximum energy for E is Q/2, which is lower than the original case where the maximum was Q. 

But wait, in the original case, the E's could go up to Q. So that doesn't make sense because according to this, the endpoint decreases. 

But wait, in the original case, the E's can go up to Q only if all the energy goes into E and the other particles (V) take away zero energy. But that's not possible because V's have rest mass.

Ah, I see. So in the original decay, the maximum energy for E is less than Q because the V's have rest mass. But according to our calculation in the new decay, the E's can go up to Q/2.

Wait, but wait. The original case has two E's and two V's. Let me think about that.

In the original case, each V has some rest mass energy. So the total energy available for E's is Q minus the energy required for the V's. So the maximum E for each E would be less than Q. 

But according to our calculation, the new case's E's maximum is Q/2, which is lower than Q. But in the original case, the E's maximum was lower than Q as well. So which one is higher? 

Wait, the original problem states that in the original decay, the E's have a continuous spectrum with endpoint Q. So in that case, the maximum E is Q. So perhaps the initial assumption was that the V's are either massless or moving in such a way that all the energy is available for E. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the maximum E for the new case is Q/2. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps when you have more particles, it's easier for the E's to carry more energy. Because with more particles, you can balance the momentum more efficiently.

Wait, in the original case, you have two E's and two V's. Let's say each V has a rest mass m. The energy for each V is m c^2 plus their kinetic energy. So in the original case, the maximum energy an E can have is when the other E and the two V's take the minimal possible energy and momentum. 

But in the new case, you have two E's and one M. M is massless, so it doesn't require any rest mass energy. So perhaps the E's can take more energy because the energy isn't being used to create the rest mass of the V's.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, the maximum E in the new case is Q/2. But in the original case, the E's can reach up to Q. But according to that, the new case has lower endpoint. But the problem says that in the original case, the E's have a maximum of Q.

Wait, perhaps my calculation was wrong because I assumed all the E's and M's momenta are along the same line, but in reality, they could be emitted in any direction, which might allow for higher energy.

Wait, in reality, particles can be emitted in any direction, so the maximum energy can be higher because you can have other particles emitted in such a way that their momenta cancel each other, allowing one E to take more energy.

But perhaps I should think about it differently. In the original decay, the maximum energy for E is determined by the condition where the other particles (V's) carry the least possible energy. But because V's have mass, they require a certain rest energy. 

In the new case, M is massless, so the other particles (E and M) can carry away less energy, allowing the E's to have more energy. 

Wait, perhaps in the original case, E's can have up to Q, but in the new case, with fewer particles, the E's can have higher energy. So the endpoint would increase.

But according to my earlier calculation, the maximum E in the new case was Q/2, which is lower. But perhaps that was under the assumption that all particles are emitted along the same line. 

In reality, the configuration with maximum E for one E would involve the other particles being emitted in a way that their momenta cancel each other, allowing that E to have as much energy as possible.

Wait, perhaps considering that M is massless and emitted in the opposite direction of E1, so that E2 and M have opposite momentum to E1.

Wait, maybe the maximum occurs when E2 and M are emitted in such a way that their total momentum cancels E1's. Let's model this.

Let’s denote E1 is emitted along +x with momentum p. 

E2 and M are emitted in any direction, but their vector sum of momenta must be -p.

The energy of E1 is E1 = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 ) ≈ pc for relativistic electrons.

Similarly, E2 ≈ p2 c, and M's energy is p_M c.

The total energy is E1 + E2 + E_M = Q.

We want to maximize E1. So, we need to minimize E2 + E_M. 

But E2 + E_M = Q - E1.

To minimize E2 + E_M, given that their momentum vectors must sum to -p.

The minimal sum of their energies occurs when their momenta are aligned in the same direction, so that their combined momentum is maximum for a given energy. Wait, no, because their energies are E2 = p2 c and E_M = p_M c. So to have their momenta sum to -p, the minimal sum of energies occurs when they are emitted in the same direction as each other but opposite to E1.

Wait, let's think about their momenta. Let's say E2 is emitted at some angle θ, and M is emitted at another angle φ. Their vector sum must be -p.

To minimize E2 + E_M, given that their vectors add up to -p, the minimal sum occurs when E2 and M are emitted in the same direction, i.e., along -x direction. Because if both are emitted at 180 degrees, their momenta add up, giving a larger momentum for the same energy. 

Wait, no. Wait, because E2 and M can't be emitted in the same direction as each other and opposite to E1. If they are emitted in the same direction, their momenta add up, making their total larger. But we need their vector sum to be -p. 

So perhaps the minimal energy occurs when E2 and M are emitted in the same direction, opposite to E1. So their momenta add up to -p.

In that case, p_E2 + p_M = p.

But E2 = p_E2 c, E_M = p_M c.

So E2 + E_M = (p_E2 + p_M) c = p c.

But E1 = p c.

So total energy E1 + E2 + E_M = p c + p c = 2 p c = Q.

So p = Q/(2c).

Thus, E1 = p c = Q/(2c) * c = Q/2.

Hmm, again, that would mean the maximum E is Q/2. 

But in the original case, the E's can go up to Q, which would imply that the new case has a lower endpoint. But according to the problem statement, the original E's have a continuous spectrum with endpoint Q. So that would suggest that the new case's E's have a lower maximum.

Wait, but that can't be right because in the original case, the E's have maximum Q, but the calculation here suggests that the new case's E's have maximum Q/2, which is lower. So the endpoint would decrease.

But wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong because the original case has more particles. Let me think again.

In the original decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. Each V has some rest mass. So when you emit two E's and two V's, the energy is distributed among all four particles. 

So the maximum energy E can have is when the other E and the two V's take as little energy as possible. But the V's have rest masses, so each must have at least their rest mass energy. 

So the maximum E energy would be Q minus the sum of the rest mass energies of the other particles. But if the V's have non-zero rest mass, their rest energy would take away from the E's maximum.

In the new decay, the V's are replaced by one massless M. So the rest mass energy isn't an issue. So the maximum E energy can be higher.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, the maximum E in the new case is Q/2, which is less than Q. That's confusing because the problem says the original E's have maximum Q.

Ah, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that the total energy is the same in both cases. Because the problem says that in the original decay, the E's have a maximum of Q. So in the new decay, the maximum could be higher.

Wait, perhaps the key is the number of particles emitted. In the original case, with four particles (two E, two V), the E's have a continuous spectrum up to Q. In the new case, with three particles (two E, one M), the E's can have a different spectrum.

Wait, let's consider the case where the decay emits two E's and two massless particles instead of two V's. In that scenario, the calculation would be different. But in our problem, it's a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps I should think about phase space. In the original decay, with four particles, the phase space is such that the E's have a continuous distribution. When we change to three particles, the phase space changes, possibly altering the shape of the spectrum.

Wait, the original decay has 2E and 2V. The E's have a continuous spectrum because the V's can take away varying amounts of energy and momentum. In the new decay, with 2E and 1M, the M can take away varying amounts, leading to a similar continuous spectrum for E's. 

But the question is whether the endpoint increases, decreases, or remains the same. 

Earlier, the calculation suggested that the maximum E in the new case is Q/2, which is lower than Q. But the problem states that in the original case, E's go up to Q. So according to that, the new case would have a lower endpoint, implying the endpoint decreases.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the new case has fewer particles to carry away energy. So the E's could have more energy.

Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the initial model. Let's consider that in the original case, the maximum energy for E is Q, which occurs when the other particles take minimal energy. But if in the new case, the other particles (E and M) can take less energy, allowing E's to have higher maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum energy in the new case is higher than Q. But that can't be because the total energy is fixed as Q. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the maximum energy in the new case is the same as the original case. But that seems unlikely.

Another approach: think about neutrino emission. In beta decay, a neutron decays into a proton, electron, and antineutrino. The electron has a continuous spectrum up to the maximum energy Q. But if instead of emitting an antineutrino, the decay emits a photon, would that change the electron's maximum energy?

Wait, in beta decay, the electron's maximum energy is when the neutrino has negligible energy. But if you replace the neutrino with a photon, which is massless, the photon can carry away more energy, allowing the electron to have a lower maximum. 

Wait, so in that case, the endpoint would decrease. Because the photon's energy is higher, so the electron's energy is lower.

Wait, but in our case, the original decay emits two V's, and the new decay emits one M. So perhaps the maximum energy for E decreases.

But according to the problem, the original decay has E's up to Q. So when you change to emitting one M, the E's maximum would be lower than Q, so the endpoint decreases.

So, in the original case, E's have a maximum of Q. In the new case, E's have a maximum lower than Q. So the endpoint decreases.

Additionally, what about the continuity of the spectrum? In the original decay, it's continuous because the energy can vary. In the new case, would the spectrum remain continuous?

Yes, because even with one M, the E's can still have a range of energies as M takes away varying amounts of energy and momentum. So the E's spectrum would remain continuous, but the maximum (endpoint) would decrease.

Looking back at the options:

Option D says the spectrum remains continuous with adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases. That matches our conclusion.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves analyzing how the energy spectrum of the outgoing particles E changes in a nuclear decay when the number or type of emitted particles is altered. The original decay is given as:

\[
2A \to 2B + 2E + 2V,
\]

where the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint \( Q \). In the variant decay, the two particles \( V \) are replaced by a single massless particle \( M \), resulting in:

\[
2A \to 2B + 2E + M.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Original Decay (2A → 2B + 2E + 2V):**
   - The E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with a maximum energy (endpoint) \( Q \). This occurs because the total energy \( Q \) is shared among the two E particles and the two V particles. The V particles, which have rest mass, take away some energy, leaving the E particles with a continuous range of energies up to \( Q \).

2. **Variant Decay (2A → 2B + 2E + M):**
   - Here, the two V particles are replaced by a single massless particle \( M \). Since \( M \) is massless, it does not contribute to the rest mass energy and can carry away energy solely as momentum. This changes the energy distribution among the particles.
   - The total energy \( Q \) is now shared among the two E particles and the single \( M \). Because \( M \) is massless, the energy and momentum conservation laws allow for a different distribution of energy compared to the original decay.

3. **Energy and Momentum Conservation:**
   - In the original decay, the presence of two V particles with rest mass limits the maximum energy that the E particles can have. In the variant decay, the absence of rest mass for \( M \) alters this balance. The calculation shows that the maximum energy for the E particles in the variant decay is lower than \( Q \), as the energy is distributed differently among the three particles (two E and one \( M \)).

4. **Continuity of the Spectrum:**
   - In both decays, the energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous because the energy and momentum can still vary among the emitted particles. However, the shape of the spectrum will adjust due to the change in the number and type of emitted particles.

5. **Endpoint Comparison:**
   - The endpoint (maximum energy) of the E particles decreases in the variant decay compared to the original decay. This is because the energy is distributed differently, and the presence of the massless \( M \) allows for a lower maximum energy for the E particles.

### Evaluation of Options:

- **Option A:** Incorrect. The spectrum does not become discrete; it remains continuous.
- **Option B:** Incorrect. While the spectrum remains continuous, the endpoint decreases, not increases.
- **Option C:** Incorrect. The spectrum does not become discrete.
- **Option D:** Correct. The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.

### Conclusion:

The total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles remains continuous in the variant decay but with an adjusted shape due to the change in the emitted particles. The endpoint (maximum energy) of the E particles decreases compared to the original decay.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about nuclear decay and how the energy spectrum of emitted particles changes under certain conditions. Hmm, I need to think about what I remember from my studies.

Alright, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So two particles A decay into two B, and emit two E and two V. It's given that the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q. 

Wait, I remember that in beta decay, which is a type of nuclear decay, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum. But wait, that's because in beta decay, a neutron turns into a proton, emitting an electron and an antineutrino. The total energy is shared between them, so the electron has a range of energies, hence a continuous spectrum. So in that case, the maximum energy (endpoint) is determined by the Q value of the decay. 

So in this problem, the decay is similar but involves two E particles and two V particles. The total energy available (Q) would be shared among all the emitted particles. So the E particles' energy would vary, giving a continuous spectrum up to Q. 

Now, the variant in question emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the two V. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Hmm, M is massless, so it's like a photon or a neutrino, which travels at the speed of light and has negligible mass. 

Wait, in the original decay, we have 2V. So if V is a particle with some mass, then each V would carry away some energy and momentum. But when they're replaced by M, which is massless, perhaps the dynamics change. 

In the first case, when you have two Vs, they carry away some energy each. But since M is massless, perhaps it's like having more particles with different properties. Wait, but in the original decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum. That suggests that in the original case, the E's energy can vary, implying that the total energy isn't fixed for each E. 

Wait, but in the original case, perhaps each E has a maximum energy Q, but their energies can vary because of the varying distribution of energy among the emitted particles. But when you change the number or type of emitted particles, how does this affect the E particles' spectrum?

Wait, considering that in the original decay, the E's have a continuous spectrum. So that's because the energy isn't fixed for each E—each E can have a range of energies depending on the distribution. 

Now, when you change the decay products, specifically replacing two V's with one M, which is massless, how does that affect the E's? Let's think about energy and momentum conservation. 

In the original case, you emit 2E and 2V. Let's say each V has some mass, but when you replace them with a single M (massless), the system changes. I think when you have more particles emitted, the energy and momentum distribution can become more varied. But wait, in the original decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum because the other particles (V's) take away some of the energy. 

Wait, when you have more particles emitted, the available energy is divided among more particles. So each E's maximum energy would decrease, right? Because more particles share the same Q. Hmm, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, another approach: think about what determines the endpoint of the E's. The endpoint is the maximum energy any E can have. That happens when as much energy as possible is given to one E, and the others get the minimum. But wait, in the original case, when you have two E's and two V's, the maximum energy for each E would depend on how the other particles are distributed. 

Wait, but in the first case, the E's have a continuous spectrum up to Q. So the maximum energy any E can have is Q. Because if all the energy goes into one E, then the others (the other E and the V's) would have zero energy, which isn't possible because they must have some momentum too. Wait, no, because particles can't have negative energy, but in reality, energy is conserved so the maximum energy would be when the other particles carry away as little as possible. 

Alternatively, perhaps the endpoint Q is the maximum possible energy for the E particles. 

Now, when we change the decay products to include an M instead of two V's, how does this affect the maximum energy E can have? 

In the new decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So we're emitting two E's and one M. M is massless, so it's like a photon. Since M is massless, it's emitted with energy equal to its momentum. 

In the original decay, two V's are emitted, which have mass, so they carry away some energy and momentum. Now, in the new case, we have one M, which is massless, so perhaps it's easier for the E's to carry more energy because M doesn't contribute as much to the momentum. Wait, no, I think I'm getting this mixed up. 

Wait, maybe we should model this using conservation of energy and momentum. Let's imagine the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before decay is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after decay must be zero. 

In the original decay: 2E's and 2V's. So the vector sum of their momenta must be zero. Each E and V has momentum p_i. So p_E1 + p_E2 + p_V1 + p_V2 = 0. 

In the new decay: 2E's and 1M. So p_E1 + p_E2 + p_M = 0. 

Because M is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum (since E = pc for massless particles). 

Hmm, but how does this affect the energy available for the E's? 

In the original case, since V's had mass, their rest mass would take away some energy. For instance, the energy of each V would be the sum of their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So for each V, E_V = m_V c^2 + K_V. 

In the new case, M is massless, so its energy is all kinetic (since its rest mass is zero). 

Wait, but in the original decay, the E's have a continuous spectrum. So the maximum energy Q is when as much energy as possible goes into the E's, but the other particles (V's) carry away some energy. 

In the new decay, with one M, perhaps the maximum energy for the E's could be higher or lower. Let me think about the endpoint. 

The endpoint Q is the maximum energy any E can have. So when one E has energy Q, the rest of the system must have zero net momentum. 

In the original case, with two V's, when one E has maximum energy, the other E and the two V's would have to have their momenta balanced such that the total is zero. 

In the new case, when one E has maximum energy, the other E and the M must balance that. 

But since M is massless, it can carry momentum without requiring much energy beyond its momentum. 

Wait, perhaps the maximum energy of the E's can be higher when the number of other particles is less. Because in the original case, two V's take some energy, but in the new case, one M might take less energy, allowing E's to have higher energy. 

Alternatively, maybe it's the opposite. Let me think about the Q value. 

The total Q is the same in both cases? Or is it different? Wait, the question says it's the same decay but with a different product. So the total energy Q is the same? Or perhaps the Q is the same? Or is Q the maximum energy for E in the first case. 

Wait, the original decay's E has a maximum energy Q. So when the decay emits 2E and 2V, the E's can go up to Q. 

In the variant decay, you're emitting 2E and 1M. So the E's can have higher maximum energy because M doesn't require as much energy for its rest mass. Because in the original case, two V's each have a rest mass, so their presence would take away some energy, limiting the E's maximum. 

Wait, but in this new decay, the M is massless, so the energy available for the E's and M is the same as before. So perhaps the E's can have higher maximum energies because there's no rest mass energy being taken by the V's. 

Wait, in the original case, the total energy released is Q. So 2E + 2V = Q. But if V has a rest mass, then each V contributes some energy just from their rest mass. So the E's can't get all the Q. 

In the new case, M is massless, so all the energy can go into the E's and M. So the E's can have more energy because there's no rest mass for M. So the maximum energy for each E could be higher. 

Wait, but wait. The total energy released in the decay is fixed as Q. So in the original case, some energy went into the rest mass of the V's. In the new case, since M is massless, all of the energy can be used for kinetic energy of the E's and M. 

Ah, so in the original case, the maximum energy any E could have is less than Q because some energy is used to create the V's (their rest mass). In the new case, because M is massless, the E's can take more energy. So the endpoint of the E's spectrum would be higher than Q. 

Wait, but the original case's E's have a maximum of Q. So in the new case, with M, the E's can have a higher maximum energy than Q? That doesn't make sense because the total Q is the same. Wait, perhaps I've confused the situation.

Wait, perhaps the Q value is the total energy available. So in the original decay, the total energy is Q, which is shared among 2E and 2V. In the new decay, the same Q is shared among 2E and 1M. Because M is massless, the energy available for the E's could be higher because M doesn't require any rest mass energy. 

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the total energy Q must be the same for both decay processes. So if in the original decay, some energy went into the rest mass of the V's, then in the new decay, that same energy isn't needed because M is massless. So the E's can have more of the Q energy. So the endpoint Q for the E's would increase.

Wait, but the original E's have a maximum of Q. So in the new case, their maximum would be higher than Q? That can't happen because the total energy is fixed. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the maximum energy of E is determined by how much energy can be given to E without violating conservation of energy and momentum. Let's model this. 

When you have a decay at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of all the decay products must sum to zero. 

In the original case, the decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. Let's say each E has energy E1 and E2, and each V has energy V1 and V2. Since the total energy is Q, which is the sum of all these energies. But also, their momenta must sum to zero. 

In the new case, the decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So the sum of the momenta of the two E's and M must be zero. 

The maximum energy for an E would occur when the other particles (E and M) have as little energy as possible. 

Wait, for the maximum energy of one E, say E1_max. Then, the other E (E2) and M must have enough energy and momentum to balance E1's momentum. 

But M is massless, so its momentum is equal to its energy (since E = pc). 

So to maximize E1's energy, we can set E2 and M's momenta to cancel E1's momentum.

But E2 is another E, which has energy E2 and momentum p2 = E2 (since for E, if it's a beta particle, it's relativistic, so E ≈ pc; but actually, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. But if E is a beta particle, m is small, so E ≈ pc. So for simplicity, let's approximate that E ≈ pc for E's.

So, assuming E's are non-relativistic? Wait, no, wait, beta particles are usually relativistic. So their energy is much larger than their rest mass, so E ≈ pc. 

Similarly, M is massless, so E_M = p_M c. 

So, for the original case:

The total momentum is zero, so p1 (from E1) + p2 (from E2) + p3 (from V1) + p4 (from V2) = 0.

In the new case:

p1 (E1) + p2 (E2) + p_M = 0.

So, in the new case, when you want to maximize E1's energy, you would have E2 and M balancing it. Let's model this.

Maximizing E1 means that E2 and M have the least possible energy consistent with momentum conservation.

Assuming E1 is moving along the positive x-axis, then E2 and M must have momentum in the opposite direction. 

The momentum vectors must sum to zero. So:

p1 (E1) = magnitude p1 along +x.

p2 (E2) = magnitude p2 along -x.

p_M = magnitude p_M along -x.

So, p1 = p2 + p_M.

But E1 ≈ p1 c.

E2 ≈ p2 c.

E_M = p_M c.

The total energy is E1 + E2 + E_M = Q.

But since we're trying to maximize E1, we can set E2 and E_M to their minimum possible values. What's the minimum? Well, E2 must be at least some value to make the momentum balance.

Wait, but maybe the minimal E2 and E_M would be when E2 and M are emitted in the same direction as E1. No, that can't be because their momenta would add up, which would not balance E1's. So E2 and M must be in the opposite direction.

Wait, perhaps to maximize E1, E2 and M must be as small as possible, but their momenta must cancel E1's.

So, we have p1 = p2 + p_M. 

But we also have E1 + E2 + E_M = Q.

Since E1 ≈ p1 c, E2 ≈ p2 c, and E_M = p_M c.

So substituting, p1 = p2 + p_M.

E1 = p1 c.

E2 = p2 c.

E_M = p_M c.

So, E1 + E2 + E_M = (p1 + p2 + p_M) c = (p1 + p1) c, because p2 + p_M = p1. So that's 2 p1 c = Q.

Wait, that would imply E1 = p1 c = (Q/(2 c)) * c) = Q/2. 

Wait, but that's not correct. Let me think again. 

Wait, E1 + E2 + E_M = (p1 + p2 + p_M) c = (p1 + (p2 + p_M)) c = (p1 + p1) c = 2 p1 c = Q.

So, p1 = Q/(2 c).

Therefore, E1 = p1 c = Q/(2 c) * c = Q/2. 

Wait, so the maximum E1 in the new case would be Q/2? But in the original case, the maximum E's were up to Q. That can't be right. 

Wait, maybe I messed up the setup. Because in the original case, with 2E and 2V, the maximum E could be up to Q. But according to this calculation, in the new case, the maximum E is Q/2. Which would mean the endpoint decreases. But that contradicts what I thought earlier.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that p2 and p_M can be as small as possible. Because when you have M, it's massless, so its energy is all momentum. So when you try to maximize E1, you need to have E2 and E_M sum up to provide the momentum opposite to E1.

Wait, perhaps the maximum E1 occurs when E2 and M are emitted in the same direction as E1 but with opposite momentum. No, that wouldn't make sense because their momenta would add up, making the total larger. 

Wait, perhaps in the scenario where E1 is maximum, E2 and M are emitted in the opposite direction, but how much energy do they need to take so that their momentum cancels E1's.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model it mathematically.

Let’s denote the momenta of E1, E2, and M as vectors. Let’s assume E1 is moving along +x, and E2 and M are moving along -x.

So, the momentum conservation equation is:

p_E1 (in +x) = p_E2 (in -x) + p_M (in -x).

So, p_E1 = p_E2 + p_M.

But since E1 ≈ p_E1 c, and E2 ≈ p_E2 c, and E_M = p_M c.

The total energy is E1 + E2 + E_M = Q.

Substituting:

p_E1 c + p_E2 c + p_M c = Q.

But from momentum conservation, p_E1 = p_E2 + p_M.

Let’s denote p_E2 = a, p_M = b.

So, p_E1 = a + b.

So the energy equation becomes:

(a + b) c + a c + b c = Q.

Which simplifies to:

a c + b c + a c + b c = Q.

Which is 2a c + 2b c = Q.

So, 2c (a + b) = Q.

But from momentum conservation, p_E1 = a + b. So a + b = p_E1.

So, 2c p_E1 = Q → p_E1 = Q/(2c).

Therefore, E1 = p_E1 c = (Q/(2c)) * c = Q/2.

So the maximum energy E1 can have is Q/2. 

Wait, that's interesting. So in the new case, the maximum energy for E is Q/2, which is lower than the original case where the maximum was Q. 

But wait, in the original case, the E's could go up to Q. So that doesn't make sense because according to this, the endpoint decreases. 

But wait, in the original case, the E's can go up to Q only if all the energy goes into E and the other particles (V) take away zero energy. But that's not possible because V's have rest mass.

Ah, I see. So in the original decay, the maximum energy for E is less than Q because the V's have rest mass. But according to our calculation in the new decay, the E's can go up to Q/2.

Wait, but wait. The original case has two E's and two V's. Let me think about that.

In the original case, each V has some rest mass energy. So the total energy available for E's is Q minus the energy required for the V's. So the maximum E for each E would be less than Q. 

But according to our calculation, the new case's E's maximum is Q/2, which is lower than Q. But in the original case, the E's maximum was lower than Q as well. So which one is higher? 

Wait, the original problem states that in the original decay, the E's have a continuous spectrum with endpoint Q. So in that case, the maximum E is Q. So perhaps the initial assumption was that the V's are either massless or moving in such a way that all the energy is available for E. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the maximum E for the new case is Q/2. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps when you have more particles, it's easier for the E's to carry more energy. Because with more particles, you can balance the momentum more efficiently.

Wait, in the original case, you have two E's and two V's. Let's say each V has a rest mass m. The energy for each V is m c^2 plus their kinetic energy. So in the original case, the maximum energy an E can have is when the other E and the two V's take the minimal possible energy and momentum. 

But in the new case, you have two E's and one M. M is massless, so it doesn't require any rest mass energy. So perhaps the E's can take more energy because the energy isn't being used to create the rest mass of the V's.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, the maximum E in the new case is Q/2. But in the original case, the E's can reach up to Q. But according to that, the new case has lower endpoint. But the problem says that in the original case, the E's have a maximum of Q.

Wait, perhaps my calculation was wrong because I assumed all the E's and M's momenta are along the same line, but in reality, they could be emitted in any direction, which might allow for higher energy.

Wait, in reality, particles can be emitted in any direction, so the maximum energy can be higher because you can have other particles emitted in such a way that their momenta cancel each other, allowing one E to take more energy.

But perhaps I should think about it differently. In the original decay, the maximum energy for E is determined by the condition where the other particles (V's) carry the least possible energy. But because V's have mass, they require a certain rest energy. 

In the new case, M is massless, so the other particles (E and M) can carry away less energy, allowing the E's to have more energy. 

Wait, perhaps in the original case, E's can have up to Q, but in the new case, with fewer particles, the E's can have higher energy. So the endpoint would increase.

But according to my earlier calculation, the maximum E in the new case was Q/2, which is lower. But perhaps that was under the assumption that all particles are emitted along the same line. 

In reality, the configuration with maximum E for one E would involve the other particles being emitted in a way that their momenta cancel each other, allowing that E to have as much energy as possible.

Wait, perhaps considering that M is massless and emitted in the opposite direction of E1, so that E2 and M have opposite momentum to E1.

Wait, maybe the maximum occurs when E2 and M are emitted in such a way that their total momentum cancels E1's. Let's model this.

Let’s denote E1 is emitted along +x with momentum p. 

E2 and M are emitted in any direction, but their vector sum of momenta must be -p.

The energy of E1 is E1 = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 ) ≈ pc for relativistic electrons.

Similarly, E2 ≈ p2 c, and M's energy is p_M c.

The total energy is E1 + E2 + E_M = Q.

We want to maximize E1. So, we need to minimize E2 + E_M. 

But E2 + E_M = Q - E1.

To minimize E2 + E_M, given that their momentum vectors must sum to -p.

The minimal sum of their energies occurs when their momenta are aligned in the same direction, so that their combined momentum is maximum for a given energy. Wait, no, because their energies are E2 = p2 c and E_M = p_M c. So to have their momenta sum to -p, the minimal sum of energies occurs when they are emitted in the same direction as each other but opposite to E1.

Wait, let's think about their momenta. Let's say E2 is emitted at some angle θ, and M is emitted at another angle φ. Their vector sum must be -p.

To minimize E2 + E_M, given that their vectors add up to -p, the minimal sum occurs when E2 and M are emitted in the same direction, i.e., along -x direction. Because if both are emitted at 180 degrees, their momenta add up, giving a larger momentum for the same energy. 

Wait, no. Wait, because E2 and M can't be emitted in the same direction as each other and opposite to E1. If they are emitted in the same direction, their momenta add up, making their total larger. But we need their vector sum to be -p. 

So perhaps the minimal energy occurs when E2 and M are emitted in the same direction, opposite to E1. So their momenta add up to -p.

In that case, p_E2 + p_M = p.

But E2 = p_E2 c, E_M = p_M c.

So E2 + E_M = (p_E2 + p_M) c = p c.

But E1 = p c.

So total energy E1 + E2 + E_M = p c + p c = 2 p c = Q.

So p = Q/(2c).

Thus, E1 = p c = Q/(2c) * c = Q/2.

Hmm, again, that would mean the maximum E is Q/2. 

But in the original case, the E's can go up to Q, which would imply that the new case has a lower endpoint. But according to the problem statement, the original E's have a continuous spectrum with endpoint Q. So that would suggest that the new case's E's have a lower maximum.

Wait, but that can't be right because in the original case, the E's have maximum Q, but the calculation here suggests that the new case's E's have maximum Q/2, which is lower. So the endpoint would decrease.

But wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong because the original case has more particles. Let me think again.

In the original decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. Each V has some rest mass. So when you emit two E's and two V's, the energy is distributed among all four particles. 

So the maximum energy E can have is when the other E and the two V's take as little energy as possible. But the V's have rest masses, so each must have at least their rest mass energy. 

So the maximum E energy would be Q minus the sum of the rest mass energies of the other particles. But if the V's have non-zero rest mass, their rest energy would take away from the E's maximum.

In the new decay, the V's are replaced by one massless M. So the rest mass energy isn't an issue. So the maximum E energy can be higher.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, the maximum E in the new case is Q/2, which is less than Q. That's confusing because the problem says the original E's have maximum Q.

Ah, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that the total energy is the same in both cases. Because the problem says that in the original decay, the E's have a maximum of Q. So in the new decay, the maximum could be higher.

Wait, perhaps the key is the number of particles emitted. In the original case, with four particles (two E, two V), the E's have a continuous spectrum up to Q. In the new case, with three particles (two E, one M), the E's can have a different spectrum.

Wait, let's consider the case where the decay emits two E's and two massless particles instead of two V's. In that scenario, the calculation would be different. But in our problem, it's a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps I should think about phase space. In the original decay, with four particles, the phase space is such that the E's have a continuous distribution. When we change to three particles, the phase space changes, possibly altering the shape of the spectrum.

Wait, the original decay has 2E and 2V. The E's have a continuous spectrum because the V's can take away varying amounts of energy and momentum. In the new decay, with 2E and 1M, the M can take away varying amounts, leading to a similar continuous spectrum for E's. 

But the question is whether the endpoint increases, decreases, or remains the same. 

Earlier, the calculation suggested that the maximum E in the new case is Q/2, which is lower than Q. But the problem states that in the original case, E's go up to Q. So according to that, the new case would have a lower endpoint, implying the endpoint decreases.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the new case has fewer particles to carry away energy. So the E's could have more energy.

Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the initial model. Let's consider that in the original case, the maximum energy for E is Q, which occurs when the other particles take minimal energy. But if in the new case, the other particles (E and M) can take less energy, allowing E's to have higher maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum energy in the new case is higher than Q. But that can't be because the total energy is fixed as Q. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the maximum energy in the new case is the same as the original case. But that seems unlikely.

Another approach: think about neutrino emission. In beta decay, a neutron decays into a proton, electron, and antineutrino. The electron has a continuous spectrum up to the maximum energy Q. But if instead of emitting an antineutrino, the decay emits a photon, would that change the electron's maximum energy?

Wait, in beta decay, the electron's maximum energy is when the neutrino has negligible energy. But if you replace the neutrino with a photon, which is massless, the photon can carry away more energy, allowing the electron to have a lower maximum. 

Wait, so in that case, the endpoint would decrease. Because the photon's energy is higher, so the electron's energy is lower.

Wait, but in our case, the original decay emits two V's, and the new decay emits one M. So perhaps the maximum energy for E decreases.

But according to the problem, the original decay has E's up to Q. So when you change to emitting one M, the E's maximum would be lower than Q, so the endpoint decreases.

So, in the original case, E's have a maximum of Q. In the new case, E's have a maximum lower than Q. So the endpoint decreases.

Additionally, what about the continuity of the spectrum? In the original decay, it's continuous because the energy can vary. In the new case, would the spectrum remain continuous?

Yes, because even with one M, the E's can still have a range of energies as M takes away varying amounts of energy and momentum. So the E's spectrum would remain continuous, but the maximum (endpoint) would decrease.

Looking back at the options:

Option D says the spectrum remains continuous with adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases. That matches our conclusion.


The problem involves analyzing how the energy spectrum of the outgoing particles E changes in a nuclear decay when the number or type of emitted particles is altered. The original decay is given as:

\[
2A \to 2B + 2E + 2V,
\]

where the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint \( Q \). In the variant decay, the two particles \( V \) are replaced by a single massless particle \( M \), resulting in:

\[
2A \to 2B + 2E + M.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Original Decay (2A → 2B + 2E + 2V):**
   - The E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with a maximum energy (endpoint) \( Q \). This occurs because the total energy \( Q \) is shared among the two E particles and the two V particles. The V particles, which have rest mass, take away some energy, leaving the E particles with a continuous range of energies up to \( Q \).

2. **Variant Decay (2A → 2B + 2E + M):**
   - Here, the two V particles are replaced by a single massless particle \( M \). Since \( M \) is massless, it does not contribute to the rest mass energy and can carry away energy solely as momentum. This changes the energy distribution among the particles.
   - The total energy \( Q \) is now shared among the two E particles and the single \( M \). Because \( M \) is massless, the energy and momentum conservation laws allow for a different distribution of energy compared to the original decay.

3. **Energy and Momentum Conservation:**
   - In the original decay, the presence of two V particles with rest mass limits the maximum energy that the E particles can have. In the variant decay, the absence of rest mass for \( M \) alters this balance. The calculation shows that the maximum energy for the E particles in the variant decay is lower than \( Q \), as the energy is distributed differently among the three particles (two E and one \( M \)).

4. **Continuity of the Spectrum:**
   - In both decays, the energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous because the energy and momentum can still vary among the emitted particles. However, the shape of the spectrum will adjust due to the change in the number and type of emitted particles.

5. **Endpoint Comparison:**
   - The endpoint (maximum energy) of the E particles decreases in the variant decay compared to the original decay. This is because the energy is distributed differently, and the presence of the massless \( M \) allows for a lower maximum energy for the E particles.

### Evaluation of Options:

- **Option A:** Incorrect. The spectrum does not become discrete; it remains continuous.
- **Option B:** Incorrect. While the spectrum remains continuous, the endpoint decreases, not increases.
- **Option C:** Incorrect. The spectrum does not become discrete.
- **Option D:** Correct. The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.

### Conclusion:

The total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles remains continuous in the variant decay but with an adjusted shape due to the change in the emitted particles. The endpoint (maximum energy) of the E particles decreases compared to the original decay.
