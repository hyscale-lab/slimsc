Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that there are five exoplanets in a system, all with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But more importantly, the planets are in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, so that shouldn't affect the calculation.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The formula is something like T = T_earth * (L / L_sun)^(1/4) * (d / a_earth)^(-0.5), but wait, since all these planets are around the same star, the luminosity part might be the same for all. So maybe I can ignore the star's luminosity since it's the same for all planets.

Wait, equilibrium temperature also depends on the planet's distance from the star. The formula is T = T_eq = (L * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * d²))^(1/4). Since A (albedo) is the same for all, and L and σ are constants for the star, the temperature ratio would depend on the inverse square root of the distance ratio.

But in this case, the planets' periods are given in a ratio. So I need to relate the orbital period to the distance. I remember Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star). So P² ∝ a³.

So, for each planet, the distance a is proportional to P^(2/3). Because a = k * P^(2/3), where k is some constant that includes the star's mass and gravitational constant. Since all planets are around the same star, k is the same for all, so the distances are proportional to P^(2/3).

So, the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets would be the inverse square root of the ratio of their distances. Since temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of distance.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for T_eq is proportional to (L/(d²))^(1/4). So T is proportional to (1/d)^(1/2). So, T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(d). But since d is proportional to P^(2/3), then T is proportional to (P)^( -1/3 ). Because d ~ P^(2/3) → 1/d ~ P^(-2/3), but T ~ (1/d)^(1/2) → T ~ P^(-1/3).

Wait, let me get the exponents straight. Let me represent each planet's period as P_i. So, for Planet_2, P2 and Planet_4, P4.

But according to the question, the orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has P1, Planet_2 has P2 = 2*P1, Planet_3 has P3=2.5*P1, Planet_4 has P4=3.5*P1, Planet_5 has P5=5*P1.

So, for Planet_2, P2 = 2 P1. For Planet_4, P4 =3.5 P1.

So, the ratio of their periods is P4/P2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75.

Now, T is proportional to P^(-1/3). So the ratio of T4 to T2 would be (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Wait, because T4 is proportional to (P4)^(-1/3), and T2 is proportional to (P2)^(-1/3). So T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Let me compute P2/P4: 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So, (0.5714)^(1/3) → cube root of 0.5714. What's the cube root of 0.5714?

Well, cube of 0.8 is 0.512, cube of 0.82 is 0.82^3 = 0.82*0.82=0.6724, *0.82≈0.551. Hmm, 0.83^3 is about 0.83 *0.83=0.6889, *0.83 ≈ 0.571.

Wait, wait, 0.83^3: 0.83*0.83=0.6889, multiplied by 0.83 again.

0.6889 * 0.83 → let me compute that. 0.6889 * 0.8 is 0.55112. 0.6889 * 0.03 is 0.020667. So sum is 0.571787. So approximately 0.5718. That's very close to 0.5714.

So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83. So T4/T2 = 0.83.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, because the ratio is cube root of 0.5714, which is about 0.83. So T4 is about 0.83 times T2.

Wait, but the question is asking for the ratio of Planet_4's equilibrium temperature to Planet_2's. So T4/T2 is approximately 0.83.

So looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me go through the steps again.

Planetary distances are proportional to P^(2/3). So d4/d2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (7/4)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3).

Then, the ratio of temperatures is (d2/d4)^(1/2) because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(d). So T4/T2 = (d2/d4)^(1/2) = [ (4/7) ]^(1/3) → because (3.5 is 7/2, so 3.5/2=7/4, so (7/4)^(2/3) is d4/d2. Then d2/d4 = (4/7)^(1), so when we take (d2/d4)^(1/2) = (4/7)^(1/2) = sqrt(4/7) = 2/sqrt(7) ≈ 2/2.6458 ≈ 0.756. Then the square root of (4/7) is about 0.7559.

Wait, but wait, I thought earlier that T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d), so T4/T2 = (d2/d4)^(1/2) → that's correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought in terms of P^( -1/3 ), and that approach gave me 0.83, but this other approach is giving me approximately 0.756. Hmm, which is correct?

I think I made a mistake earlier because I confused the exponents when substituting Kepler's law into the temperature formula.

Let me approach this more carefully.

The equilibrium temperature formula is:

T_eq = [ (L (1 - A)) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4)

Assuming L and (1 - A) are the same for all planets, the ratio of temperatures T4/T2 is (a2/a4)^(1/2).

So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2 / a4)

But from Kepler's third law, a³ ∝ P² → a ∝ P^(2/3)

So a2 = k * P2^(2/3), a4 = k * P4^(2/3)

So a2 /a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3) = (4^(2/3)) / (7^(2/3)).

But, 4^(2/3) is (2²)^(2/3) = 2^(4/3) ≈ 2.5198.

7^(2/3) is (7^(1/3))^2 ≈ (1.913)^2 ≈ 3.659.

So (4/7)^(2/3) ≈ (2.5198)/(3.659) ≈ 0.688.

So a2/a4 ≈ 0.688. Then T4/T2 = sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829, which is approximately 0.83. So option C.

Wait, but when I did the second approach earlier, I thought of it as (d2/d4)^(1/2) which gave me 0.756, but now this method gives me 0.83. Clearly, I'm getting conflicting results. So where did I go wrong?

Ah, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let's re-examine.

From Kepler's third law: a³ = (G M * P²)/(4 π²)

So, a ∝ P^(2/3)

Thus, a2 = (P2)^(2/3), a4=(P4)^(2/3)

So, a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3) = ( (4/7)^(1/3) )^2.

What is (4/7)^(1/3)? 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. Cube root of 0.5714 is about 0.83, as we calculated before. Then square that: 0.83^2 ≈ 0.6889.

So a2/a4 ≈ 0.6889.

So T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt(0.6889) ≈ 0.83.

Yes, that's correct. So the ratio is approximately 0.83. So option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when I calculated P2/P4 as 2/3.5=4/7≈0.5714, and then cube root is ≈0.83, and that's T4/T2 because T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Wait, but that approach may have been incorrect.

Wait, because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), and a is proportional to P^(2/3), so sqrt(a) is proportional to P^(1/3). So T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3) → (2/3.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.5714^(1/3) → which is about 0.83.

So that approach also gives 0.83. So both methods agree.

But wait, earlier when I thought of the ratio as (d2/d4)^(1/2), which is sqrt(a2/a4), and a2/a4 is (2/3.5)^(2/3), that also leads to T4/T2 = sqrt( (2/3.5)^(2/3) ) = (2/3.5)^(1/3) → same as 0.83.

So both methods give the same result. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 0.83, which is option C.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature \( T_{\text{eq}} \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star (\( T_{\text{eq}} \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \)). Using Kepler's third law (\( a^3 \propto P^2 \)), the distance \( a \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \). Thus, the ratio of distances \( a_2/a_4 \) is proportional to \( (P_2/P_4)^{2/3} \).

The orbital periods of the planets are given in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). For Planet_2 and Planet_4, their periods are \( P_2 = 2P_1 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \). The ratio of their periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7}.
\]

The ratio of distances is then:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

To calculate this, note that \( \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{4^{1/3}}{7^{1/3}}\right)^2 \). Approximating:

\[
4^{1/3} \approx 1.5874, \quad 7^{1/3} \approx 1.913, \quad \text{so } \frac{4^{1/3}}{7^{1/3}} \approx 0.829.
\]

Squaring this gives:

\[
\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3} \approx 0.6889.
\]

The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance ratio:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{0.6889} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \).

Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that there are five exoplanets in a system, all with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But more importantly, the planets are in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, so that shouldn't affect the calculation.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The formula is something like T = T_earth * (L / L_sun)^(1/4) * (d / a_earth)^(-0.5), but wait, since all these planets are around the same star, the luminosity part might be the same for all. So maybe I can ignore the star's luminosity since it's the same for all planets.

Wait, equilibrium temperature also depends on the planet's distance from the star. The formula is T = T_eq = (L * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * d²))^(1/4). Since A (albedo) is the same for all, and L and σ are constants for the star, the temperature ratio would depend on the inverse square root of the distance ratio.

But in this case, the planets' periods are given in a ratio. So I need to relate the orbital period to the distance. I remember Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star). So P² ∝ a³.

So, for each planet, the distance a is proportional to P^(2/3). Because a = k * P^(2/3), where k is some constant that includes the star's mass and gravitational constant. Since all planets are around the same star, k is the same for all, so the distances are proportional to P^(2/3).

So, the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets would be the inverse square root of the ratio of their distances. Since temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of distance.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for T_eq is proportional to (L/(d²))^(1/4). So T is proportional to (1/d)^(1/2). So, T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(d). But since d is proportional to P^(2/3), then T is proportional to (P)^( -1/3 ). Because d ~ P^(2/3) → 1/d ~ P^(-2/3), but T ~ (1/d)^(1/2) → T ~ P^(-1/3).

Wait, let me get the exponents straight. Let me represent each planet's period as P_i. So, for Planet_2, P2 and Planet_4, P4.

But according to the question, the orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has P1, Planet_2 has P2 = 2*P1, Planet_3 has P3=2.5*P1, Planet_4 has P4=3.5*P1, Planet_5 has P5=5*P1.

So, for Planet_2, P2 = 2 P1. For Planet_4, P4 =3.5 P1.

So, the ratio of their periods is P4/P2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75.

Now, T is proportional to P^(-1/3). So the ratio of T4 to T2 would be (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Wait, because T4 is proportional to (P4)^(-1/3), and T2 is proportional to (P2)^(-1/3). So T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Let me compute P2/P4: 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So, (0.5714)^(1/3) → cube root of 0.5714. What's the cube root of 0.5714?

Well, cube of 0.8 is 0.512, cube of 0.82 is 0.82^3 = 0.82*0.82=0.6724, *0.82≈0.551. Hmm, 0.83^3 is about 0.83 *0.83=0.6889, *0.83 ≈ 0.571.

Wait, wait, 0.83^3: 0.83*0.83=0.6889, multiplied by 0.83 again.

0.6889 * 0.83 → let me compute that. 0.6889 * 0.8 is 0.55112. 0.6889 * 0.03 is 0.020667. So sum is 0.571787. So approximately 0.5718. That's very close to 0.5714.

So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83. So T4/T2 = 0.83.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, because the ratio is cube root of 0.5714, which is about 0.83. So T4 is about 0.83 times T2.

Wait, but the question is asking for the ratio of Planet_4's equilibrium temperature to Planet_2's. So T4/T2 is approximately 0.83.

So looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me go through the steps again.

Planetary distances are proportional to P^(2/3). So d4/d2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (7/4)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3).

Then, the ratio of temperatures is (d2/d4)^(1/2) because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(d). So T4/T2 = (d2/d4)^(1/2) = [ (4/7) ]^(1/3) → because (3.5 is 7/2, so 3.5/2=7/4, so (7/4)^(2/3) is d4/d2. Then d2/d4 = (4/7)^(1), so when we take (d2/d4)^(1/2) = (4/7)^(1/2) = sqrt(4/7) = 2/sqrt(7) ≈ 2/2.6458 ≈ 0.756. Then the square root of (4/7) is about 0.7559.

Wait, but wait, I thought earlier that T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d), so T4/T2 = (d2/d4)^(1/2) → that's correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought in terms of P^( -1/3 ), and that approach gave me 0.83, but this other approach is giving me approximately 0.756. Hmm, which is correct?

I think I made a mistake earlier because I confused the exponents when substituting Kepler's law into the temperature formula.

Let me approach this more carefully.

The equilibrium temperature formula is:

T_eq = [ (L (1 - A)) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4)

Assuming L and (1 - A) are the same for all planets, the ratio of temperatures T4/T2 is (a2/a4)^(1/2).

So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2 / a4)

But from Kepler's third law, a³ ∝ P² → a ∝ P^(2/3)

So a2 = k * P2^(2/3), a4 = k * P4^(2/3)

So a2 /a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3) = (4^(2/3)) / (7^(2/3)).

But, 4^(2/3) is (2²)^(2/3) = 2^(4/3) ≈ 2.5198.

7^(2/3) is (7^(1/3))^2 ≈ (1.913)^2 ≈ 3.659.

So (4/7)^(2/3) ≈ (2.5198)/(3.659) ≈ 0.688.

So a2/a4 ≈ 0.688. Then T4/T2 = sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829, which is approximately 0.83. So option C.

Wait, but when I did the second approach earlier, I thought of it as (d2/d4)^(1/2) which gave me 0.756, but now this method gives me 0.83. Clearly, I'm getting conflicting results. So where did I go wrong?

Ah, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let's re-examine.

From Kepler's third law: a³ = (G M * P²)/(4 π²)

So, a ∝ P^(2/3)

Thus, a2 = (P2)^(2/3), a4=(P4)^(2/3)

So, a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3) = ( (4/7)^(1/3) )^2.

What is (4/7)^(1/3)? 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. Cube root of 0.5714 is about 0.83, as we calculated before. Then square that: 0.83^2 ≈ 0.6889.

So a2/a4 ≈ 0.6889.

So T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt(0.6889) ≈ 0.83.

Yes, that's correct. So the ratio is approximately 0.83. So option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when I calculated P2/P4 as 2/3.5=4/7≈0.5714, and then cube root is ≈0.83, and that's T4/T2 because T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Wait, but that approach may have been incorrect.

Wait, because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), and a is proportional to P^(2/3), so sqrt(a) is proportional to P^(1/3). So T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3) → (2/3.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.5714^(1/3) → which is about 0.83.

So that approach also gives 0.83. So both methods agree.

But wait, earlier when I thought of the ratio as (d2/d4)^(1/2), which is sqrt(a2/a4), and a2/a4 is (2/3.5)^(2/3), that also leads to T4/T2 = sqrt( (2/3.5)^(2/3) ) = (2/3.5)^(1/3) → same as 0.83.

So both methods give the same result. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 0.83, which is option C.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature \( T_{\text{eq}} \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star (\( T_{\text{eq}} \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \)). Using Kepler's third law (\( a^3 \propto P^2 \)), the distance \( a \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \). Thus, the ratio of distances \( a_2/a_4 \) is proportional to \( (P_2/P_4)^{2/3} \).

The orbital periods of the planets are given in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). For Planet_2 and Planet_4, their periods are \( P_2 = 2P_1 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \). The ratio of their periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7}.
\]

The ratio of distances is then:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

To calculate this, note that \( \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{4^{1/3}}{7^{1/3}}\right)^2 \). Approximating:

\[
4^{1/3} \approx 1.5874, \quad 7^{1/3} \approx 1.913, \quad \text{so } \frac{4^{1/3}}{7^{1/3}} \approx 0.829.
\]

Squaring this gives:

\[
\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3} \approx 0.6889.
\]

The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance ratio:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{0.6889} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \).

Answer: C
