Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB has these photons with very low energy, right? The average energy given here is 1e-3 eV. 

The process in question is gamma-gamma annihilation into electron-positron pairs: γγ → e+ e-. So, high-energy gamma-rays are annihilating with CMB photons. The question is asking at what energy the lifetime of these gamma-rays is limited by this process. So, I think this is about the photon's lifetime being determined by the probability of this interaction happening.

Wait, I think the key here is the concept of photon-photon interactions and how their cross-section affects the mean free path. The mean free time would be the time it takes for a photon to interact, given the density of CMB photons. If the mean free time is much less than the age of the universe, then the photon would have a limited lifetime because it would annihilate quickly.

So, I remember that the cross-section for this process (γγ → e+e-) is a function of the center-of-mass energy. The threshold energy for producing electron-positron pairs is when the center-of-mass energy is at least twice the electron mass (since each electron has a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV, so double that is about 1.022 MeV). But wait, in this case, the gamma-rays are high energy, so maybe the CMB photon is much lower energy. So, the center-of-mass energy would be sqrt(s) = sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ), but since the CMB photons are low energy, their momentum is much lower than the gamma's. Hmm, perhaps we can approximate that sqrt(s) ≈ 2 E_gamma, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, when one photon is much lower energy than the other, the center-of-mass energy is roughly 2 E_gamma * sqrt( (E_photon)/(E_gamma) ) ? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, let me think again. The CMB photon has energy E_photon = 1e-3 eV, which is way lower than the gamma-ray energy E_gamma. So, the center-of-mass energy would be approximately sqrt(s) ≈ 2 E_gamma * (1 + (E_photon)/(E_gamma)). But if E_photon << E_gamma, then that term is negligible, so sqrt(s) ≈ 2 E_gamma. But wait, wait, I think the threshold condition is when the center-of-mass energy is at least 2*m_e*c^2, which is about 1.022 MeV. So, the minimal E_gamma needed for this process to occur would be when 2 E_gamma * E_photon ≥ (m_e c^2)^2, because the cross-section becomes non-zero when the product of the energies is sufficient.

Wait, let me think about the cross-section formula. The cross-section for this annihilation process (gamma + gamma → e+ e-) is given by something like σ ≈ (alpha^2 * m_e^2) / (4 E_gamma^2 E_CMB), where alpha is the fine-structure constant (~1/137). But I'm not entirely sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, the cross-section might scale with 1/s, where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Wait, for high energies, the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation increases as the energy increases beyond the threshold.

But I think the general approach is to calculate the optical depth, which is the product of the cross-section and the number density of CMB photons, times the distance (or time). The optical depth tau is the probability that a photon will annihilate. When tau is about 1, the mean free time is comparable to the age of the universe, so the photon's lifetime is limited.

So, the mean free time τ is given by τ ≈ 1/(n σ v), where n is the number density of CMB photons, σ is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity (which, for photons, is c, but since they are moving in opposite directions, perhaps their relative speed is 2c? Or maybe in terms of energy, it's better to use the center-of-mass frame.)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model this step by step.

1. The cross-section for γγ → e+e- is given by σ ≈ (α² m_e²)/(4 E_cm²), where E_cm is the center-of-mass energy. But wait, since E_photon is much less than E_gamma, E_cm ≈ sqrt( (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (E_gamma/c)(E_photon/c) [since photons have E=pc] ). Hmm, but E_photon is much smaller than E_gamma, so E_cm ≈ sqrt( (E_gamma)^2 + (E_photon)^2 + 2 E_gamma E_photon ... ) but since E_photon << E_gamma, this approximates to E_cm ≈ E_gamma (1 + E_photon/(2 E_gamma)) ), but perhaps I should just take E_cm ≈ E_gamma (since E_photon is negligible). Wait, that can't be right for the threshold. The threshold occurs when E_cm is 2 m_e c². So, when E_gamma * E_photon ≈ (m_e c²)^2, the process becomes possible. So, E_gamma ≈ (m_e c²)^2 / E_photon.

Wait, that makes sense because the product of the two photon energies must be greater than or equal to (m_e c²)^2 for the process to occur. So, E_gamma * E_photon ≥ (m_e c²)^2 → E_gamma ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / E_photon.

Wait, let's compute that.

m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV. E_photon is 1e-3 eV. So, (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 (eV)^2.

E_photon is 1e-3 eV. So, (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3 = (0.511^2 * 1e12) / 1e-3 = 0.261 * 1e15 → 2.61e14 eV. Wait, that's 261e12 eV → 261 TeV. Hmm, but that's not one of the options. The options are in the order of 1e5 GeV, which is 1e8 eV, so 1e5 GeV is 1e8 eV; 1e5 GeV is 1e5 * 1e9 eV = 1e14 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 1e5 GeV is 1e14 eV. So, 261 TeV is 261e12 eV, which is 2.61e14 eV → 261e12 eV = 2.61e14 eV. So, according to this, the threshold is around 2.6e14 eV, which is 260 TeV or 2.6e5 GeV. Wait, 2.6e5 GeV is option C, which is 2.6e5 GeV. Oh, so that must be the answer. Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation is more precise. Let me do the exact math.

m_e c² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

E_photon = 1e-3 eV.

So, (m_e c²)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV² = (0.511^2) * 1e12 eV² = 0.261121e12 eV² ≈ 2.61121e11 eV².

So, E_gamma = (m_e c²)^2 / E_photon = (2.61121e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 2.61121e14 eV.

Convert to GeV: 2.61121e14 eV = 2.61121e5 GeV (since 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, so 2.61121e14 / 1e9 = 2.61121e5 GeV). So, that's approximately 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C.

Wait, but the question is about the energy for which the lifetime is limited by this process. So, the cross-section is non-zero only when E_gamma is above this threshold. But wait, the lifetime is determined by the mean free time, which depends on the cross-section multiplied by the number density of target photons.

So, perhaps the lifetime τ is given by τ ≈ 1 / (n σ v), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, considering that the number density of CMB photons is about n ≈ 400 cm^-3, or about 4e8 m^-3. Wait, but let me get it more accurately.

The CMB has a temperature of about 2.7 K. The number density of photons can be found using the formula for a blackbody: n = (2ζ(3)/h^3 c^3) k_B T^3 * 2, where ζ is the Riemann zeta function. ζ(3) ≈ 1.202. So, the number density is approximately 410 photons per cm³. Converting to m^-3: 410 / (1 cm³) = 410 * 1e6 / (1 m^3) → 4.1e8 m^-3.

But wait, that's number per cubic meter. So, n ≈ 4e8 m^-3.

But photons are moving, so the cross-section σ and the relative velocity (which for photons is c, but given they're moving opposite to each other, their relative speed is 2c. Hmm, but wait, the cross-section formula for photon-photon interactions is a bit tricky. Alternatively, the interaction rate is given by the photon's cross-section multiplied by the number of target photons, and the photon's speed. So, the rate Γ (inverse time) would be Γ ≈ n σ v.

Wait, but in this case, the photons are moving in opposite directions, so the relative speed is 2c. So, the rate would be Γ ≈ n σ (2c). Therefore, the mean lifetime τ is 1/Γ = 1/(2 c n σ).

So, putting it all together:

E_gamma must be such that the cross-section σ is such that the mean lifetime τ is comparable to the age of the universe. Wait, but the question is not directly about the age, but what energy E_gamma would have their lifetime limited by this process. So, perhaps when the mean free time τ is comparable to the age of the universe, that's when the process becomes significant.

But let's think about the formula for the cross-section σ. For γγ → e+ e-, the cross-section is given by:

σ ≈ (4 π α² m_e² ) / (s),

where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But when E_photon << E_gamma, s ≈ (2 E_gamma)^2, so σ ≈ (4 π α² m_e² )/(4 E_gamma^2) ) → (π α² m_e² )/(E_gamma^2).

So, σ ≈ (π α² m_e² ) / E_gamma^2.

Now, putting it into the expression for Γ:

Γ = n σ (2 c),

since n is the number density, σ is the cross-section, and 2c is the relative speed.

So, Γ ≈ n * (π α² m_e²) / E_gamma^2 * 2 c.

Then, the mean lifetime τ is 1 / Γ = E_gamma^2 / (2 c n π α² m_e² ).

We want τ to be comparable to the age of the universe. Let's take the age as t_universe ≈ 1e10 years. Converting that into seconds: 1e10 * 3.15e7 ≈ 3.15e17 seconds.

So, set τ ≈ t_universe:

E_gamma^2 / (2 c n π α² m_e² ) ≈ t_universe.

Solving for E_gamma:

E_gamma ≈ sqrt( 2 c n π α² m_e² t_universe )

Now, plug in the numbers:

c ≈ 3e8 m/s,

n ≈ 4e8 m^-3,

α ≈ 1/137 ≈ 0.00729,

m_e is 9.1e-31 kg,

t_universe ≈ 3e17 s.

So,

E_gamma^2 ≈ 2 * 3e8 m/s * 4e8 m^-3 * π * (0.00729)^2 * (9.1e-31 kg)^2 * 3e17 s.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute each term:

Term 1: 2 * 3e8 = 6e8.

Term 2: 4e8 m^-3 → 4e8.

Term 3: π ≈ 3.1416.

Term 4: (0.00729)^2 ≈ 5.31e-5.

Term 5: (9.1e-31 kg)^2 ≈ 8.28e-61 kg².

Term 6: 3e17 s.

Multiply all together:

6e8 * 4e8 = 2.4e17.

Multiply by π: 2.4e17 * 3.1416 ≈ 7.54e17.

Multiply by 5.31e-5: 7.54e17 * 5.31e-5 ≈ 4.01e13.

Multiply by 8.28e-61: 4.01e13 * 8.28e-61 ≈ 3.31e-47.

Multiply by 3e17: 3.31e-47 * 3e17 ≈ 9.93e-30.

So, E_gamma^2 ≈ 9.93e-30 (kg m²/s²?), wait, no, let's make sure about units.

Wait, E has units of energy, which is kg m²/s².

But since we're taking the square root, let's see what the units are.

Wait, the left side is E^2. The right side is:

(2 * c * n * π * α² * m_e^2 * t_universe )

Each term's unit:

c → m/s,

n → m^-3,

m_e^2 → (kg)^2,

t_universe → s,

so all together:

( m/s ) * (m^-3) * (kg)^2 * s → (m/s * m^-3) = 1/(s m²) * kg^2 * s → kg^2/(m² s).

Wait, but E^2 is (kg^2 m^2)/(s^4), perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, let's compute the right-hand side numerically and then take the square root.

So, from the previous calculation, E_gamma^2 ≈ 9.93e-30 (units? Let's see: the term is in (kg m/s)^2? Or perhaps in (Joules)^2? Because E is in Joules.)

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute everything in eV.

Wait, m_e is 9.1e-31 kg, which is about 0.511 MeV/c².

Wait, perhaps I should compute the right-hand side in terms of eV^2.

Let me try again, but this time in terms of eV and appropriate constants.

Wait, the cross-section formula and the rate equation may have been handled incorrectly. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the photon's lifetime due to pair production with the CMB.

The mean lifetime τ for a gamma-ray photon to annihilate via γγ → e+ e- is given by:

τ ≈ ( (m_e c^2)^2 )/( σ γ_e^2 n_{CMB} c )

Wait, another approach: the optical depth τ is the product of the cross-section, the number density of photons, and the length traveled. So, τ = n σ L, where L is the length. The mean free path is λ = 1/(n σ), so τ ≈ λ / c → time is λ/(c).

Wait, but perhaps using the more precise formula. The cross-section for pair production is σ ≈ (m_e^2 c^4)/(E1 E2), where E1 and E2 are the energies of the two photons in the center-of-mass frame. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another way: the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- when one photon is much lower energy (E_photon << E_gamma) is approximately:

σ ≈ (8 π/3) (α^2 m_e^4)/(E_gamma^2 E_photon)

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to write σ ≈ (4 π α^2 m_e^2 )/( (E1 + E2)^2 ) * (something), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I've read that the cross-section for this process is given by:

σ ≈ (3 α^2 m_e^2 )/(4 E_gamma E_photon )

Wait, that seems manageable. Let's go with that for now.

So, σ ≈ (3 α^2 m_e^2 )/(4 E_gamma E_photon )

Then, the interaction rate Γ is n σ v, where v is the relative velocity. For photons moving in opposite directions, the relative speed is 2c. So, v = 2c.

So, Γ ≈ n * (3 α^2 m_e^2 )/(4 E_gamma E_photon ) * 2c.

Simplify:

Γ ≈ (3 n α^2 m_e^2 c )/(2 E_gamma E_photon )

The mean lifetime τ is the inverse of Γ:

τ ≈ (2 E_gamma E_photon )/(3 n α^2 m_e^2 c )

We want τ to be about the age of the universe, t_universe ≈ 1e10 years = 3.15e17 seconds.

So,

(2 E_gamma E_photon )/(3 n α^2 m_e^2 c ) ≈ 3.15e17 s

Solving for E_gamma:

E_gamma ≈ [ (3 n α^2 m_e^2 c t_universe )/(2 E_photon ) ]

Now, plug in the numbers.

n is the number density of CMB photons. As mentioned earlier, n ≈ 411 photons/cm³ → 411 * 1e6 cm^-3 = 4.11e8 m^-3.

E_photon = 1e-3 eV.

α ≈ 1/137 ≈ 0.00729.

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

c = 3e8 m/s.

t_universe = 3.15e17 s.

So,

E_gamma = [ (3 * 4.11e8 m^-3 * (0.00729)^2 * (9.1e-31 kg)^2 * 3e8 m/s * 3.15e17 s ) ) / (2 * 1e-3 eV) ]

Wait, but wait a minute, the units here: Let's make sure we're getting energy in eV.

First, let's compute each part step by step.

Compute numerator:

3 * n = 3 *4.11e8 = 1.233e9 m^-3.

α² ≈ (0.00729)^2 ≈ 5.31e-5.

m_e^2 ≈ (9.1e-31)^2 ≈ 8.28e-61 kg².

c = 3e8 m/s.

t_universe =3.15e17 s.

Multiply all together:

1.233e9 * 5.31e-5 ≈ 6.54e4.

6.54e4 * 8.28e-61 ≈ 5.40e-56.

5.40e-56 * 3e8 ≈ 1.62e-47.

1.62e-47 * 3.15e17 ≈ 5.103e-30.

Denominator:

2 * E_photon = 2 * 1e-3 eV = 2e-3 eV.

So,

E_gamma ≈ (5.103e-30) / (2e-3) eV = (5.103e-30 / 2e-3 ) eV = 2.5515e-27 eV.

Wait, that can't be right. That gives E_gamma in eV, which is way too low. Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me try to compute everything in terms of eV and appropriate constants to get the right energy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute in terms of natural units where c=1 and ℏ=1. But maybe I should re-express the equation in terms of eV and seconds.

Wait, but maybe I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, the formula I have is:

E_gamma ≈ [ (3 * n * α^2 * m_e^2 * c * t_universe ) / (2 * E_photon) ]

But let me plug in the units step by step.

n is in m^-3.

α is dimensionless.

m_e is in kg.

c is m/s.

t_universe is in seconds.

E_photon is in eV.

So, let's compute the units:

n (m^-3) * m_e^2 (kg²) * c (m/s) * t_universe (s) → m^-3 * kg² * m/s * s → m^-3 * kg² * m → kg²/(m²).

Multiply by α^2 (dimensionless) and 3/2.

Then, E_gamma would be in [ (kg²/(m²)) * eV^{-1} ]? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting lost in the units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of eV and appropriate constants.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the formula where E_gamma is expressed in terms of the known constants and the given E_photon.

Wait, let's re-express the formula:

E_gamma = [ (3 n α^2 m_e^2 c t_universe ) / (2 E_photon) ]

Calculate each term numerically.

n = 4e8 m^-3.

α = 1/137 ≈ 0.00729.

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

c = 3e8 m/s.

t_universe ≈ 1e10 years → 1e10 * 3.15e7 s → 3.15e17 s.

E_photon = 1e-3 eV.

Compute numerator: 3 * n * α^2 * m_e^2 * c * t_universe.

Let me compute each part step by step.

3 * n = 3 *4e8 = 1.2e9 m^-3.

α^2 = (1/137)^2 ≈ 5.3e-5.

m_e^2 = (9.109e-31 kg)^2 ≈ 8.298e-61 kg².

c = 3e8 m/s.

t_universe = 3.15e17 s.

Now, let's compute the product:

1.2e9 [m^-3] * 5.3e-5 [dimensionless] = 1.2e9 *5.3e-5 = 6.36e4 [m^-3].

Multiply by 8.298e-61 [kg²]: 6.36e4 *8.298e-61 = 5.26e-56 [m^-3 kg²].

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s): 5.26e-56 * 3e8 = 1.578e-47 [m^-3 kg² m/s] → [kg²/(m² s)].

Multiply by t_universe (3.15e17 s): 1.578e-47 *3.15e17 = 5.0e-30 [kg²/(m²)].

So, numerator is 5.0e-30 kg²/m².

Denominator: 2 * E_photon = 2 * 1e-3 eV = 2e-3 eV.

So,

E_gamma ≈ (5.0e-30 kg²/m²) / (2e-3 eV) ) → 2.5e-27 kg²/(m² eV).

Wait, kg²/(m² eV) is not a unit of energy. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the units. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered using the relation E = mc² when converting units, but this is getting really complicated. Maybe I should switch to using the earlier approach where E_gamma ≈ (m_e c²)^2 / E_photon.

Wait, earlier, when I used that approach, I got E_gamma ≈ 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C. But maybe that's the correct one because that approach directly gives the threshold energy where the process can occur. Perhaps the calculation I did with the mean free time is missing something, possibly because the cross-section formula I used was incorrect.

Wait, another perspective: The lifetime of the gamma-ray photon is limited by the interaction time due to the process. So, when the interaction probability becomes significant (like when the optical depth is around 1), the photon's lifetime is limited. So, perhaps the correct condition is when the age of the universe is about the mean free time.

But regardless, the initial approach gave me E_gamma ≈ 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 9.5e4 GeV

B) 1.8e5 GeV

C) 2.6e5 GeV

D) 3.9e5 GeV

So, option C is 2.6e5 GeV, which matches the initial threshold approach. So, I think that's the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of high-energy gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ with CMB photons, we analyze the threshold energy required for this interaction. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Threshold Energy for Annihilation**:  
   The process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ requires the center-of-mass energy to be at least $2m_e c^2$, where $m_e$ is the electron mass ($m_e c^2 \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV}$). For a gamma-ray of energy $E_\gamma$ interacting with a low-energy CMB photon of energy $E_{\text{CMB}}$, the threshold condition is:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \cdot E_{\text{CMB}} \geq (m_e c^2)^2
   \]  
   Solving for $E_\gamma$, we find:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}
   \]

2. **Substitute Known Values**:  
   - $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$  
   - $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$  
   Substituting these values:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} = \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
   \]  
   Converting to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

3. **Interpretation**:  
   This energy corresponds to the threshold where the gamma-ray photon can annihilate with a CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair. At this energy, the lifetime of the gamma-ray is limited by the interaction process, as the optical depth becomes significant.

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   - **A) $9.5 \times 10^4 \, \text{GeV}$**: Too low, below the threshold energy.  
   - **B) $1.8 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**: Slightly below the calculated threshold.  
   - **C) $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**: Matches the calculated threshold energy.  
   - **D) $3.9 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**: Above the threshold, but unnecessary for the limiting case.

Thus, the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by the annihilation process with CMB photons is **$2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**.

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB has these photons with very low energy, right? The average energy given here is 1e-3 eV. 

The process in question is gamma-gamma annihilation into electron-positron pairs: γγ → e+ e-. So, high-energy gamma-rays are annihilating with CMB photons. The question is asking at what energy the lifetime of these gamma-rays is limited by this process. So, I think this is about the photon's lifetime being determined by the probability of this interaction happening.

Wait, I think the key here is the concept of photon-photon interactions and how their cross-section affects the mean free path. The mean free time would be the time it takes for a photon to interact, given the density of CMB photons. If the mean free time is much less than the age of the universe, then the photon would have a limited lifetime because it would annihilate quickly.

So, I remember that the cross-section for this process (γγ → e+e-) is a function of the center-of-mass energy. The threshold energy for producing electron-positron pairs is when the center-of-mass energy is at least twice the electron mass (since each electron has a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV, so double that is about 1.022 MeV). But wait, in this case, the gamma-rays are high energy, so maybe the CMB photon is much lower energy. So, the center-of-mass energy would be sqrt(s) = sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ), but since the CMB photons are low energy, their momentum is much lower than the gamma's. Hmm, perhaps we can approximate that sqrt(s) ≈ 2 E_gamma, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, when one photon is much lower energy than the other, the center-of-mass energy is roughly 2 E_gamma * sqrt( (E_photon)/(E_gamma) ) ? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, let me think again. The CMB photon has energy E_photon = 1e-3 eV, which is way lower than the gamma-ray energy E_gamma. So, the center-of-mass energy would be approximately sqrt(s) ≈ 2 E_gamma * (1 + (E_photon)/(E_gamma)). But if E_photon << E_gamma, then that term is negligible, so sqrt(s) ≈ 2 E_gamma. But wait, wait, I think the threshold condition is when the center-of-mass energy is at least 2*m_e*c^2, which is about 1.022 MeV. So, the minimal E_gamma needed for this process to occur would be when 2 E_gamma * E_photon ≥ (m_e c^2)^2, because the cross-section becomes non-zero when the product of the energies is sufficient.

Wait, let me think about the cross-section formula. The cross-section for this annihilation process (gamma + gamma → e+ e-) is given by something like σ ≈ (alpha^2 * m_e^2) / (4 E_gamma^2 E_CMB), where alpha is the fine-structure constant (~1/137). But I'm not entirely sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, the cross-section might scale with 1/s, where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Wait, for high energies, the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation increases as the energy increases beyond the threshold.

But I think the general approach is to calculate the optical depth, which is the product of the cross-section and the number density of CMB photons, times the distance (or time). The optical depth tau is the probability that a photon will annihilate. When tau is about 1, the mean free time is comparable to the age of the universe, so the photon's lifetime is limited.

So, the mean free time τ is given by τ ≈ 1/(n σ v), where n is the number density of CMB photons, σ is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity (which, for photons, is c, but since they are moving in opposite directions, perhaps their relative speed is 2c? Or maybe in terms of energy, it's better to use the center-of-mass frame.)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model this step by step.

1. The cross-section for γγ → e+e- is given by σ ≈ (α² m_e²)/(4 E_cm²), where E_cm is the center-of-mass energy. But wait, since E_photon is much less than E_gamma, E_cm ≈ sqrt( (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (E_gamma/c)(E_photon/c) [since photons have E=pc] ). Hmm, but E_photon is much smaller than E_gamma, so E_cm ≈ sqrt( (E_gamma)^2 + (E_photon)^2 + 2 E_gamma E_photon ... ) but since E_photon << E_gamma, this approximates to E_cm ≈ E_gamma (1 + E_photon/(2 E_gamma)) ), but perhaps I should just take E_cm ≈ E_gamma (since E_photon is negligible). Wait, that can't be right for the threshold. The threshold occurs when E_cm is 2 m_e c². So, when E_gamma * E_photon ≈ (m_e c²)^2, the process becomes possible. So, E_gamma ≈ (m_e c²)^2 / E_photon.

Wait, that makes sense because the product of the two photon energies must be greater than or equal to (m_e c²)^2 for the process to occur. So, E_gamma * E_photon ≥ (m_e c²)^2 → E_gamma ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / E_photon.

Wait, let's compute that.

m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV. E_photon is 1e-3 eV. So, (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 (eV)^2.

E_photon is 1e-3 eV. So, (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3 = (0.511^2 * 1e12) / 1e-3 = 0.261 * 1e15 → 2.61e14 eV. Wait, that's 261e12 eV → 261 TeV. Hmm, but that's not one of the options. The options are in the order of 1e5 GeV, which is 1e8 eV, so 1e5 GeV is 1e8 eV; 1e5 GeV is 1e5 * 1e9 eV = 1e14 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 1e5 GeV is 1e14 eV. So, 261 TeV is 261e12 eV, which is 2.61e14 eV → 261e12 eV = 2.61e14 eV. So, according to this, the threshold is around 2.6e14 eV, which is 260 TeV or 2.6e5 GeV. Wait, 2.6e5 GeV is option C, which is 2.6e5 GeV. Oh, so that must be the answer. Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation is more precise. Let me do the exact math.

m_e c² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

E_photon = 1e-3 eV.

So, (m_e c²)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV² = (0.511^2) * 1e12 eV² = 0.261121e12 eV² ≈ 2.61121e11 eV².

So, E_gamma = (m_e c²)^2 / E_photon = (2.61121e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 2.61121e14 eV.

Convert to GeV: 2.61121e14 eV = 2.61121e5 GeV (since 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, so 2.61121e14 / 1e9 = 2.61121e5 GeV). So, that's approximately 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C.

Wait, but the question is about the energy for which the lifetime is limited by this process. So, the cross-section is non-zero only when E_gamma is above this threshold. But wait, the lifetime is determined by the mean free time, which depends on the cross-section multiplied by the number density of target photons.

So, perhaps the lifetime τ is given by τ ≈ 1 / (n σ v), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, considering that the number density of CMB photons is about n ≈ 400 cm^-3, or about 4e8 m^-3. Wait, but let me get it more accurately.

The CMB has a temperature of about 2.7 K. The number density of photons can be found using the formula for a blackbody: n = (2ζ(3)/h^3 c^3) k_B T^3 * 2, where ζ is the Riemann zeta function. ζ(3) ≈ 1.202. So, the number density is approximately 410 photons per cm³. Converting to m^-3: 410 / (1 cm³) = 410 * 1e6 / (1 m^3) → 4.1e8 m^-3.

But wait, that's number per cubic meter. So, n ≈ 4e8 m^-3.

But photons are moving, so the cross-section σ and the relative velocity (which for photons is c, but given they're moving opposite to each other, their relative speed is 2c. Hmm, but wait, the cross-section formula for photon-photon interactions is a bit tricky. Alternatively, the interaction rate is given by the photon's cross-section multiplied by the number of target photons, and the photon's speed. So, the rate Γ (inverse time) would be Γ ≈ n σ v.

Wait, but in this case, the photons are moving in opposite directions, so the relative speed is 2c. So, the rate would be Γ ≈ n σ (2c). Therefore, the mean lifetime τ is 1/Γ = 1/(2 c n σ).

So, putting it all together:

E_gamma must be such that the cross-section σ is such that the mean lifetime τ is comparable to the age of the universe. Wait, but the question is not directly about the age, but what energy E_gamma would have their lifetime limited by this process. So, perhaps when the mean free time τ is comparable to the age of the universe, that's when the process becomes significant.

But let's think about the formula for the cross-section σ. For γγ → e+ e-, the cross-section is given by:

σ ≈ (4 π α² m_e² ) / (s),

where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But when E_photon << E_gamma, s ≈ (2 E_gamma)^2, so σ ≈ (4 π α² m_e² )/(4 E_gamma^2) ) → (π α² m_e² )/(E_gamma^2).

So, σ ≈ (π α² m_e² ) / E_gamma^2.

Now, putting it into the expression for Γ:

Γ = n σ (2 c),

since n is the number density, σ is the cross-section, and 2c is the relative speed.

So, Γ ≈ n * (π α² m_e²) / E_gamma^2 * 2 c.

Then, the mean lifetime τ is 1 / Γ = E_gamma^2 / (2 c n π α² m_e² ).

We want τ to be comparable to the age of the universe. Let's take the age as t_universe ≈ 1e10 years. Converting that into seconds: 1e10 * 3.15e7 ≈ 3.15e17 seconds.

So, set τ ≈ t_universe:

E_gamma^2 / (2 c n π α² m_e² ) ≈ t_universe.

Solving for E_gamma:

E_gamma ≈ sqrt( 2 c n π α² m_e² t_universe )

Now, plug in the numbers:

c ≈ 3e8 m/s,

n ≈ 4e8 m^-3,

α ≈ 1/137 ≈ 0.00729,

m_e is 9.1e-31 kg,

t_universe ≈ 3e17 s.

So,

E_gamma^2 ≈ 2 * 3e8 m/s * 4e8 m^-3 * π * (0.00729)^2 * (9.1e-31 kg)^2 * 3e17 s.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute each term:

Term 1: 2 * 3e8 = 6e8.

Term 2: 4e8 m^-3 → 4e8.

Term 3: π ≈ 3.1416.

Term 4: (0.00729)^2 ≈ 5.31e-5.

Term 5: (9.1e-31 kg)^2 ≈ 8.28e-61 kg².

Term 6: 3e17 s.

Multiply all together:

6e8 * 4e8 = 2.4e17.

Multiply by π: 2.4e17 * 3.1416 ≈ 7.54e17.

Multiply by 5.31e-5: 7.54e17 * 5.31e-5 ≈ 4.01e13.

Multiply by 8.28e-61: 4.01e13 * 8.28e-61 ≈ 3.31e-47.

Multiply by 3e17: 3.31e-47 * 3e17 ≈ 9.93e-30.

So, E_gamma^2 ≈ 9.93e-30 (kg m²/s²?), wait, no, let's make sure about units.

Wait, E has units of energy, which is kg m²/s².

But since we're taking the square root, let's see what the units are.

Wait, the left side is E^2. The right side is:

(2 * c * n * π * α² * m_e^2 * t_universe )

Each term's unit:

c → m/s,

n → m^-3,

m_e^2 → (kg)^2,

t_universe → s,

so all together:

( m/s ) * (m^-3) * (kg)^2 * s → (m/s * m^-3) = 1/(s m²) * kg^2 * s → kg^2/(m² s).

Wait, but E^2 is (kg^2 m^2)/(s^4), perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, let's compute the right-hand side numerically and then take the square root.

So, from the previous calculation, E_gamma^2 ≈ 9.93e-30 (units? Let's see: the term is in (kg m/s)^2? Or perhaps in (Joules)^2? Because E is in Joules.)

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute everything in eV.

Wait, m_e is 9.1e-31 kg, which is about 0.511 MeV/c².

Wait, perhaps I should compute the right-hand side in terms of eV^2.

Let me try again, but this time in terms of eV and appropriate constants.

Wait, the cross-section formula and the rate equation may have been handled incorrectly. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the photon's lifetime due to pair production with the CMB.

The mean lifetime τ for a gamma-ray photon to annihilate via γγ → e+ e- is given by:

τ ≈ ( (m_e c^2)^2 )/( σ γ_e^2 n_{CMB} c )

Wait, another approach: the optical depth τ is the product of the cross-section, the number density of photons, and the length traveled. So, τ = n σ L, where L is the length. The mean free path is λ = 1/(n σ), so τ ≈ λ / c → time is λ/(c).

Wait, but perhaps using the more precise formula. The cross-section for pair production is σ ≈ (m_e^2 c^4)/(E1 E2), where E1 and E2 are the energies of the two photons in the center-of-mass frame. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another way: the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- when one photon is much lower energy (E_photon << E_gamma) is approximately:

σ ≈ (8 π/3) (α^2 m_e^4)/(E_gamma^2 E_photon)

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to write σ ≈ (4 π α^2 m_e^2 )/( (E1 + E2)^2 ) * (something), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I've read that the cross-section for this process is given by:

σ ≈ (3 α^2 m_e^2 )/(4 E_gamma E_photon )

Wait, that seems manageable. Let's go with that for now.

So, σ ≈ (3 α^2 m_e^2 )/(4 E_gamma E_photon )

Then, the interaction rate Γ is n σ v, where v is the relative velocity. For photons moving in opposite directions, the relative speed is 2c. So, v = 2c.

So, Γ ≈ n * (3 α^2 m_e^2 )/(4 E_gamma E_photon ) * 2c.

Simplify:

Γ ≈ (3 n α^2 m_e^2 c )/(2 E_gamma E_photon )

The mean lifetime τ is the inverse of Γ:

τ ≈ (2 E_gamma E_photon )/(3 n α^2 m_e^2 c )

We want τ to be about the age of the universe, t_universe ≈ 1e10 years = 3.15e17 seconds.

So,

(2 E_gamma E_photon )/(3 n α^2 m_e^2 c ) ≈ 3.15e17 s

Solving for E_gamma:

E_gamma ≈ [ (3 n α^2 m_e^2 c t_universe )/(2 E_photon ) ]

Now, plug in the numbers.

n is the number density of CMB photons. As mentioned earlier, n ≈ 411 photons/cm³ → 411 * 1e6 cm^-3 = 4.11e8 m^-3.

E_photon = 1e-3 eV.

α ≈ 1/137 ≈ 0.00729.

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

c = 3e8 m/s.

t_universe = 3.15e17 s.

So,

E_gamma = [ (3 * 4.11e8 m^-3 * (0.00729)^2 * (9.1e-31 kg)^2 * 3e8 m/s * 3.15e17 s ) ) / (2 * 1e-3 eV) ]

Wait, but wait a minute, the units here: Let's make sure we're getting energy in eV.

First, let's compute each part step by step.

Compute numerator:

3 * n = 3 *4.11e8 = 1.233e9 m^-3.

α² ≈ (0.00729)^2 ≈ 5.31e-5.

m_e^2 ≈ (9.1e-31)^2 ≈ 8.28e-61 kg².

c = 3e8 m/s.

t_universe =3.15e17 s.

Multiply all together:

1.233e9 * 5.31e-5 ≈ 6.54e4.

6.54e4 * 8.28e-61 ≈ 5.40e-56.

5.40e-56 * 3e8 ≈ 1.62e-47.

1.62e-47 * 3.15e17 ≈ 5.103e-30.

Denominator:

2 * E_photon = 2 * 1e-3 eV = 2e-3 eV.

So,

E_gamma ≈ (5.103e-30) / (2e-3) eV = (5.103e-30 / 2e-3 ) eV = 2.5515e-27 eV.

Wait, that can't be right. That gives E_gamma in eV, which is way too low. Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me try to compute everything in terms of eV and appropriate constants to get the right energy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute in terms of natural units where c=1 and ℏ=1. But maybe I should re-express the equation in terms of eV and seconds.

Wait, but maybe I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, the formula I have is:

E_gamma ≈ [ (3 * n * α^2 * m_e^2 * c * t_universe ) / (2 * E_photon) ]

But let me plug in the units step by step.

n is in m^-3.

α is dimensionless.

m_e is in kg.

c is m/s.

t_universe is in seconds.

E_photon is in eV.

So, let's compute the units:

n (m^-3) * m_e^2 (kg²) * c (m/s) * t_universe (s) → m^-3 * kg² * m/s * s → m^-3 * kg² * m → kg²/(m²).

Multiply by α^2 (dimensionless) and 3/2.

Then, E_gamma would be in [ (kg²/(m²)) * eV^{-1} ]? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting lost in the units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of eV and appropriate constants.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the formula where E_gamma is expressed in terms of the known constants and the given E_photon.

Wait, let's re-express the formula:

E_gamma = [ (3 n α^2 m_e^2 c t_universe ) / (2 E_photon) ]

Calculate each term numerically.

n = 4e8 m^-3.

α = 1/137 ≈ 0.00729.

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

c = 3e8 m/s.

t_universe ≈ 1e10 years → 1e10 * 3.15e7 s → 3.15e17 s.

E_photon = 1e-3 eV.

Compute numerator: 3 * n * α^2 * m_e^2 * c * t_universe.

Let me compute each part step by step.

3 * n = 3 *4e8 = 1.2e9 m^-3.

α^2 = (1/137)^2 ≈ 5.3e-5.

m_e^2 = (9.109e-31 kg)^2 ≈ 8.298e-61 kg².

c = 3e8 m/s.

t_universe = 3.15e17 s.

Now, let's compute the product:

1.2e9 [m^-3] * 5.3e-5 [dimensionless] = 1.2e9 *5.3e-5 = 6.36e4 [m^-3].

Multiply by 8.298e-61 [kg²]: 6.36e4 *8.298e-61 = 5.26e-56 [m^-3 kg²].

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s): 5.26e-56 * 3e8 = 1.578e-47 [m^-3 kg² m/s] → [kg²/(m² s)].

Multiply by t_universe (3.15e17 s): 1.578e-47 *3.15e17 = 5.0e-30 [kg²/(m²)].

So, numerator is 5.0e-30 kg²/m².

Denominator: 2 * E_photon = 2 * 1e-3 eV = 2e-3 eV.

So,

E_gamma ≈ (5.0e-30 kg²/m²) / (2e-3 eV) ) → 2.5e-27 kg²/(m² eV).

Wait, kg²/(m² eV) is not a unit of energy. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the units. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered using the relation E = mc² when converting units, but this is getting really complicated. Maybe I should switch to using the earlier approach where E_gamma ≈ (m_e c²)^2 / E_photon.

Wait, earlier, when I used that approach, I got E_gamma ≈ 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C. But maybe that's the correct one because that approach directly gives the threshold energy where the process can occur. Perhaps the calculation I did with the mean free time is missing something, possibly because the cross-section formula I used was incorrect.

Wait, another perspective: The lifetime of the gamma-ray photon is limited by the interaction time due to the process. So, when the interaction probability becomes significant (like when the optical depth is around 1), the photon's lifetime is limited. So, perhaps the correct condition is when the age of the universe is about the mean free time.

But regardless, the initial approach gave me E_gamma ≈ 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 9.5e4 GeV

B) 1.8e5 GeV

C) 2.6e5 GeV

D) 3.9e5 GeV

So, option C is 2.6e5 GeV, which matches the initial threshold approach. So, I think that's the correct answer.


To determine the energy of high-energy gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ with CMB photons, we analyze the threshold energy required for this interaction. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Threshold Energy for Annihilation**:  
   The process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ requires the center-of-mass energy to be at least $2m_e c^2$, where $m_e$ is the electron mass ($m_e c^2 \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV}$). For a gamma-ray of energy $E_\gamma$ interacting with a low-energy CMB photon of energy $E_{\text{CMB}}$, the threshold condition is:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \cdot E_{\text{CMB}} \geq (m_e c^2)^2
   \]  
   Solving for $E_\gamma$, we find:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}
   \]

2. **Substitute Known Values**:  
   - $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$  
   - $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$  
   Substituting these values:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} = \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
   \]  
   Converting to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

3. **Interpretation**:  
   This energy corresponds to the threshold where the gamma-ray photon can annihilate with a CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair. At this energy, the lifetime of the gamma-ray is limited by the interaction process, as the optical depth becomes significant.

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   - **A) $9.5 \times 10^4 \, \text{GeV}$**: Too low, below the threshold energy.  
   - **B) $1.8 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**: Slightly below the calculated threshold.  
   - **C) $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**: Matches the calculated threshold energy.  
   - **D) $3.9 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**: Above the threshold, but unnecessary for the limiting case.

Thus, the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by the annihilation process with CMB photons is **$2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**.

Answer: C
