Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's see, it's about the decay of a boson. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives me a Lagrangian for the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that doesn't look exactly right. Oh, wait, maybe it's a typo in the question. Because the standard form for an interaction like this would probably have the field X multiplied by the fermion fields. I think the Lagrangian is meant to represent something like Yukawa coupling, where the boson X couples to fermions with a coupling λ.

But maybe the specific form doesn't matter too much for the question. The problem states that the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to find which fermions X can decay into.

Kinematically allowed means that the decay products have to have enough mass to be produced. So, for each possible fermion pair, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Additionally, the fermions must have a charge that allows the decay to conserve charge, but since X is neutral (I assume), the decay products must be a pair of particles and antiparticles with opposite charges.

So the boson X can decay into a fermion-antifermion pair. The possible fermions depend on their masses. Let's list out the known fermion masses:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~1.5 MeV (0.0015 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~3.3 MeV (0.0033 GeV)
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm quark (c): ~1.2 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV (approx 4.5 GeV)
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV

So X has a mass of 6 GeV. Let's see which fermion pairs are possible.

First, for charged leptons:
- e+ e-: mass sum 0.001 GeV. X has 6 GeV, so yes.
- μ+ μ-: sum about 0.21 GeV. Also allowed.
- τ+ τ-: sum ~3.55 GeV. 3.55 <6, so allowed.
- What about the others? Like, for neutrinos? The problem doesn't mention neutrinos, maybe because the interaction doesn't involve them. The Lagrangian has ψ_f, which are probably charged fermions.

Now, for quarks:
- u and anti-u: sum is 0.003 GeV. Allowed.
- d and anti-d: 0.0066 GeV. Allowed.
- s and anti-s: 0.19 GeV. Allowed.
- c and anti-c: 2.4 GeV. 2.4 <6, allowed.
- b and anti-b: 4.5 * 2 =9 GeV. Wait, but X is 6 GeV. So 9 GeV is more than 6, so not allowed. So X can't decay into b b-bar.

Wait, wait. The mass of the bottom quark is about 4.7 GeV? Or is it about 4.5? Let me think. Oh, around 4.5-4.7 GeV, so 2*4.5 is 9, which is way more than X's 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b-bar. So any option that includes b b-bar is not allowed. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b b-bar. So that's not possible because 2*m(b) is about 9, X is 6 GeV. So option A is invalid.

Option B: does it include b b-bar? No, I think. Let's see. Option B is c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau tau, mu mu, e e. No, no b's in B. So B is possible.

Option C includes c c-bar, etc., and t t-bar. Oh, top quarks are way too heavy, so t can't be. So option C is invalid because it includes t.

Option D includes b b-bar, so same as A, which is not allowed.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Let me recheck the options.

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u, d d, tau, e+ e-.

So A includes b b-bar, which is not allowed. So possible decays are everything except b.

So which options have only the allowed fermions?

Looking at the options again:

Option B: X→ c c, s s, u u, d d, tau, mu, e.

So B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So each pair's mass is under 6 GeV.

Wait, what about the charm quark? 2 * 1.2 GeV is 2.4 GeV. That's fine.

Tau is about 1.777 * 2 is 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6.

So option B is possible.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is 173 GeV, which is way beyond X's 6 GeV. So C is not allowed.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So only option B is possible. Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, the interaction term given in the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that seems a bit strange. Wait, maybe I should parse the Lagrangian correctly.

Wait, the term seems to be -λ f ψ_f (v + X) ψ_f. Hmm, is this a Yukawa coupling term? Usually, the Yukawa interaction is something like g ψ ψ X, where X is the boson. So, the term would be something like L = -λ X ψ ψ, perhaps. If the Lagrangian is written as (v + X) ψ ψ, then perhaps X is interacting with the fermion in a way that v is a vacuum expectation value, but that's perhaps besides the point for the decay.

But perhaps the important thing is which fermions can X interact with. Because the interaction term must have the fermion fields, the boson X, and coupling λ. So, if the fermion is ψ_f, then X can decay into ψ_f and ψ_f-bar.

But perhaps the X can interact with any fermion, regardless of mass, but kinematics will limit which decays are allowed.

Wait, but the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So, X can interact with any of the fermions present in that term. So, which fermions are present? The term is ψ_f, but I don't know the exact list. Wait, but in the Lagrangian, it's written as ψ_f, but probably ψ_f is any fermion that X can couple to.

Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is written as X ψ ψ, so X couples to all possible fermions, and the decay is possible for any fermion where 2m_fermion ≤6 GeV.

So, the main point is to find which fermion pairs have a total mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So, for each pair:

- e+ e-: 2 * 0.0005 = 0.001 GeV → allowed.
- mu+ mu-: 0.21 GeV → allowed.
- tau+ tau-: 3.55 GeV → allowed.
- u u-bar: 0.003 GeV → allowed.
- d d-bar: 0.0066 GeV → allowed.
- s s-bar: 0.19 GeV → allowed.
- c c-bar: 2.4 GeV → allowed.
- b b-bar: 9 GeV → not allowed.
- t t-bar: 346 GeV → definitely not allowed.

So, the allowed decays are all the fermion pairs except b and t.

So, the options are looking for which decay modes are allowed. So, the possible decays are c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u, d d, tau tau, mu mu, e e. So that's all the allowed ones.

Option D includes b, which we can't have.

Option A includes b, so no.

Option C includes b and t, which are not allowed.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but the key focus is on the kinematics of the decay process. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be allowed, the total mass of the fermion-antifermion pair, \( 2m_f \), must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), which is 6 GeV. Additionally, the fermions must be charged to conserve charge, as \( X \) is neutral.

The known fermion masses are:

- \( e \): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \mu \): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( u \): \( \sim 0.0015 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( d \): \( \sim 0.0033 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( s \): \( \sim 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( c \): \( \sim 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( b \): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

Using these masses, the allowed decays are determined by checking whether \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). The allowed fermion pairs are:

- \( e^+ e^- \): \( 2m_e = 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \mu^+ \mu^- \): \( 2m_\mu = 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \tau^+ \tau^- \): \( 2m_\tau = 3.55 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( u \bar{u} \): \( 2m_u = 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( d \bar{d} \): \( 2m_d = 0.0066 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( s \bar{s} \): \( 2m_s = 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( c \bar{c} \): \( 2m_c = 2.4 \, \text{GeV} \)

The decays \( b \bar{b} \) and \( t \bar{t} \) are not allowed because their total masses (\( 9 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 346 \, \text{GeV} \), respectively) exceed 6 GeV.

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Hence, this option is invalid.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. This option is valid.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Hence, this option is invalid.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Hence, this option is invalid.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
