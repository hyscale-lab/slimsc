Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it carefully.

So the question is about determining the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Both stars have different masses, but I think the mass might not directly affect the elemental ratios since we're using the equivalent width (EW) method and assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The given data includes the stellar abundances and some solar photospheric compositions.

Let me list the given data:

For Star_1:
- Mass: 1.5 solar masses.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex.

For Star_2:
- Mass: 1.2 solar masses.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

Solar photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7 - 12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5).

Wait, I should clarify what the brackets mean. The notation [X/Y]_star is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y]_star = log10(nX/nY)_star - log10(nX/nY)_sun = log10(nX/nY)_star / (nX/nY)_sun.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0 means the Fe/H ratio is the same as the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log10(nFe/nH)_star - log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 0 → so nFe/nH for Star_1 is same as Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H] = 0 → nMg/nH same as Sun.

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres, so (nSi_1 / nSi_2).

Hmm, but I don't have [Si] or [Mg] data for both stars. Wait, for Star_1, we have [Si/Fe] = 0.3. For Star_2, we have [Mg/Si] = 0.3.

I'll probably need to express nSi in terms of nFe and nMg in terms of nH, but let me think.

Let's break it down for each star.

Starting with Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(nSi_1/nFe_1) = 0.3.

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1. Wait, but in the Sun, nH_sun is the same as nH because we're using solar as a reference. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of solar ratios.

Wait, let me model this. Let me define the solar abundance ratios:

nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) → because log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5.

Similarly, nMg_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-5).

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

But wait, no. The [Fe/H] measures the ratio of Fe to H in the star compared to the Sun. So [Fe/H] = 0 means nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

But I think the H is the same in both numerator and denominator, so perhaps the H doesn't affect the ratio when considering [X/Y], but the number of H atoms is the same as in the Sun? Or maybe not. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the abundances in terms of the Sun's.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = log10( (nSi_1 / nFe_1) / (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

So,

(nSi_1 /nFe_1 ) = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) * 10^0.3.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = log10( (nFe_1 / nH_1) / (nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) = 0.

So,

nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

Wait, but since both stars have the same H as the Sun? No, probably not. Because [Fe/H] is 0, it means the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun. So the number of Fe atoms in the star is proportional to H. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I can express nSi_1 in terms of nFe_1, and nFe_1 in terms of nH_1.

So for Star_1:

nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * nFe_1 * 10^0.3.

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1 *10^0.3.

Simplify: nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * nH_1 * 10^0.3.

So,

nSi_1 / nH_1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

So the ratio of Si to H in Star_1 is solar ratio multiplied by 10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

Let's find nMg_2 and nSi_2.

First, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg_2 /nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun → nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2.

Next, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10( (nMg_2 / nSi_2) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

So,

(nMg_2 /nSi_2) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

We can rearrange this to find nSi_2.

nSi_2 = (nMg_2 / (10^0.3)) * (nSi_sun / nMg_sun).

But nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2.

Substituting:

nSi_2 = [ (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2 ) ] / (10^0.3) ) * (nSi_sun / nMg_sun).

Simplify:

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2 / (10^0.3).

So,

nSi_2 / nH_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (1/10^0.3).

Wait, let me recap:

For Star_1, (nSi_1 /nH_1) = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

For Star_2, (nSi_2 /nH_2) = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (1 /10^0.3 ).

Because Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3, which implies that Mg is more abundant than Si by 0.3 dex. So Si is less than Mg by 0.3.

Wait, but I need to get the ratios correct.

Wait, let me recompute Star_2. [Mg/Si]_2 = log10( (nMg_2/nSi_2)/(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.3.

So,

(nMg_2/nSi_2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

Rearranged,

nSi_2 = (nMg_sune/nSi_sun) * (nSi_2 = nMg_2 * (nSi_sun)/(nMg_sun * 10^0.3) )).

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me define the solar abundance ratios.

Let’s denote:

In the Sun,
nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) → nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 * nH_sun.

nMg_sun / nH_sun = 1e-5 → nMg_sun = 1e-5 * nH_sun.

nSi_sun /nH_sun = some value. Wait, but the question doesn’t give [Si/Fe] for the Sun. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I can compute [Si/Fe]_sun from the given data.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_sun would be log10( (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = log10( (nSi_sun)/(1e-4.5 *nH_sun) ) → but since nSi_sun = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *nH_sun.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, [Fe/H]_sun is log10(nFe/nH)_sun = log10(1e-4.5) = -4.5, but [Fe/H]_sun is not given. Wait, no, the Sun’s [Fe/H] is zero by definition, but the given data says for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The [X/Y] notation is such that [X/Y]_star = log10( (nX/nY)_star / (nX/nY)_sun ).

So, for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun = 0 for any X and Y, because (nX/nY)_sun / (nX/nY)_sun = 1, log10(1) =0.

But wait, [Fe/H]_sun isn't given, but in the question, the Sun's [Fe/H] is not directly given. So perhaps I need to compute [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, the question provides the Sun's composition as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =-5.

But what about nSi/nH in the Sun? The question doesn't provide that. Hmm. Maybe I can find [Si/Fe]_sun from the given data.

Wait, nFe_sun /nH_sun = 1e-4.5.

nSi_sun /nH_sun = ?

Well, I don't think the data provides nSi_sun. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier because I assumed [Si/Fe]_sun is needed, but perhaps it's not. Let me think.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So (nSi_1 /nFe_1) = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, so nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun)*nH_1.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun)*nH_2.

And [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (nMg_2/nSi_2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

So let me express nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of nH_1 and nH_2.

For Star_1:

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * nFe_1 * 10^0.3.

But nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1.

So,

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3.

Simplify:

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3.

So,

nSi_1 /nH_1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2.

From [Mg/Si]_2=0.3:

(nMg_2 /nSi_2) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun)*10^0.3.

We have nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun)*nH_2.

So,

nH_2 * (nMg_sun /nH_sun) / nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Rearranging,

nSi_2 = nH_2 * (nMg_sun) / (nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) / (nMg_sun * 10^0.3).

Simplify:

nSi_2 = nH_2 * (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * (1/(10^0.3)).

So,

nSi_2 /nH_2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * (1/10^0.3).

Therefore, the ratio of nSi_1 to nSi_2 is:

(nSi_1 /nH_1) / (nSi_2 /nH_2) = [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun *10^0.3 ) ] / [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun * 1/10^0.3 ) ] * (nH_2 /nH_1 ).

Wait, because nSi_1 /nH_1 divided by nSi_2 /nH_2 is (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2).

Wait, no, let me write it properly.

The ratio (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *10^0.3 *nH_1 ] / [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * (1/10^0.3) *nH_2 ].

Simplify the terms:

(nSi_1 /nSi_2) = [10^0.3 / (1/10^0.3)] * (nH_1 /nH_2).

Which is 10^(0.3 + 0.3) * (nH_1 /nH_2) = 10^0.6 * (nH_1 /nH_2).

Wait, 10^0.3 divided by 10^(-0.3) is 10^(0.6). Because [10^a]/[10^b] =10^{a-b}, so 0.3 - (-0.3) =0.6.

So,

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = 10^0.6 * (nH_1 /nH_2).

But wait, what's the ratio of nH_1 and nH_2? The question doesn't provide any data about the stars' overall hydrogen content. Hmm.

Wait, but the stars' masses are given. Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses, Star_2 is 1.2 solar masses. But mass isn't directly the same as the number of hydrogen atoms, because the number of atoms depends on the star's composition. Wait, but in LTE and using EW method, they determine elemental abundances, which are number densities. So perhaps the photospheric composition depends on the mass, but in this case, the mass might not directly impact the H abundance because the problem doesn't mention any variation in H content. Alternatively, maybe the H abundance is same in both stars as it is solar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think again. The [Fe/H] for Star_1 is 0, which means Fe abundance is same as the Sun relative to H. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0 for Star_2. So the H abundance in each star is the same as the Sun's. Because [X/H] is log10(nX/nH) - log10(nX_sun /nH_sun) =0 → nX = nX_sun*(nH/nH_sun) = (nX_sun /nH_sun) *nH.

Wait, if [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun)*nH_1.

But for the Sun, nH_sun is the number of H atoms, and for Star_1, nH_1 is the number of H atoms. But if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, then the ratio (nFe_1 /nH_1 ) = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun)*nH_1.

But if the star's H is same as Sun's, which is not necessarily the case. Wait, no, I think the [Fe/H] being 0 doesn't mean the H is same as the Sun, but the Fe and H are in the same ratio as the Sun. So if the star has more H, Fe would be proportionally more, but [Fe/H] is zero, so the ratio remains the same. So, for example, if the star has twice as much H as the Sun, then Fe would also be twice as much, keeping [Fe/H] the same.

But this doesn't directly tell us the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2. Hmm, so perhaps the H abundances are the same in both stars as in the Sun. Because otherwise, without knowing the H content, we can't proceed.

Wait, the problem states that we're to assume LTE and use the EW method to determine elemental abundances, but I don't think that affects the H abundance ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the stars have the same H abundance as the Sun, so nH_1 =nH_sun, and nH_2= nH_sun. But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption.

Wait, but the given [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are 0 for both stars. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun. Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2 /nH_2 =nMg_sun /nH_sun.

If both stars have the same H as the Sun, then nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun. But the problem doesn't specify that. So maybe the stars have the same H as each other, but not necessarily the same as the Sun. Hmm, this is getting tricky.

Wait, but perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars as the Sun. Because if a star's [Fe/H] is zero, then the Fe abundance is same as the Sun relative to H, but if the star's H is the same as Sun, then Fe is same. Alternatively, if the star has more H, then Fe would also be proportionally higher, but [Fe/H] remains zero.

But without knowing the H abundance in each star, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to make an assumption that the H content is the same in both stars as the Sun.

If I make that assumption, then nH_1 = nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun. So, nH_1 /nH_2 =1.

Then, the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) = 10^0.6 * (1) = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9. Option D is ~1.2, which is 10^0.1.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute 10^0.6.

10^0.6 is the same as e^(0.6 * ln10) ≈ e^(0.6*2.302585) → e^(1.38155)= about 3.981. So yes, about 3.98, so approximately 3.9. So the ratio would be around 3.9.

So the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) is approximately 3.9, so the answer should be option A.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me consider another angle. What if the H content is same for both stars, meaning nH_1 =nH_2. Because both have [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] zero, so their H is same as the Sun's. So nH_1 =nH_2 = nH_sun.

In that case, the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) is 10^0.6 = ~3.98, so the answer would be A.

But wait, let me double-check the earlier steps.

For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH_1.

So,

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3.

Simplifying,

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1 *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2,

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2 * (1/10^0.3).

So the ratio,

nSi_1/nSi_2 = [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *nH_2 *10^-0.3 ]

The (nSi_sun/nH_sun) terms cancel out.

So,

nSi_1/nSi_2 = (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * 10^(0.3 +0.3) = (nH_1 /nH_2 ) *10^0.6.

If nH_1 =nH_2, then the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

But if the stars have different H contents, how would that affect things?

Wait, but if the [Fe/H] for Star_1 is 0, that implies nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun)*nH_1.

Similarly, [Mg/H] for Star_2 is 0 → nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun)*nH_2.

But without knowing the H content of each star, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the H content (nH) is the same in both stars as the Sun, meaning nH_1 =nH_2 =nH_sun.

So, the ratio becomes 10^0.6, which is approximately 3.98. So the answer would be option A) ~3.9.

But wait, the options don't have 3.98, but option A is ~3.9. So that would make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the H content isn't the same, but since [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero for each star, that implies that the H in each star is the same as in the Sun. So nH_1 =nH_sun, nH_2 =nH_sun.

So nH_1 /nH_2 =1.

Thus, the ratio is 10^0.6≈3.98 → ~3.9, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given data and use the provided elemental abundance ratios. The key steps are as follows:

### Given Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - Mass: 1.5 times the Sun's mass.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex.
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex.
2. **Star_2**:
   - Mass: 1.2 times the Sun's mass.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex.
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.
3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:
   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5.
   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5.

### Key Relationships:
- The notation [X/Y]_star = log10(nX/nY)_star - log10(nX/nY)_sun.
- For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.
- For Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 implies nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(nSi_1/nFe_1) = 0.3.
- Substituting nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1, we get:
  \[
  nSi_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1 * 10^{0.3}.
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * 10^{0.3}.
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10(nMg_2/nSi_2) = 0.3.
- Substituting nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH_2, we get:
  \[
  nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH_2 * (nSi_sun/nMg_sun) / 10^{0.3}.
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  nSi_2/nH_2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) / 10^{0.3}.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Abundances:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{nSi_1}{nSi_2} = \frac{(nSi_sun/nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * nH_1}{(nSi_sun/nH_sun) / 10^{0.3} * nH_2}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{nSi_1}{nSi_2} = 10^{0.6} * \frac{nH_1}{nH_2}.
\]

### Assumption:
Since [Fe/H]_1 = 0 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0, the hydrogen abundance in both stars is assumed to be the same as in the Sun, i.e., \( nH_1 = nH_2 = nH_{\odot} \). Thus, \( \frac{nH_1}{nH_2} = 1 \).

### Final Calculation:
\[
\frac{nSi_1}{nSi_2} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it carefully.

So the question is about determining the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Both stars have different masses, but I think the mass might not directly affect the elemental ratios since we're using the equivalent width (EW) method and assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The given data includes the stellar abundances and some solar photospheric compositions.

Let me list the given data:

For Star_1:
- Mass: 1.5 solar masses.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex.

For Star_2:
- Mass: 1.2 solar masses.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

Solar photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7 - 12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5).

Wait, I should clarify what the brackets mean. The notation [X/Y]_star is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y]_star = log10(nX/nY)_star - log10(nX/nY)_sun = log10(nX/nY)_star / (nX/nY)_sun.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0 means the Fe/H ratio is the same as the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log10(nFe/nH)_star - log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 0 → so nFe/nH for Star_1 is same as Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H] = 0 → nMg/nH same as Sun.

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres, so (nSi_1 / nSi_2).

Hmm, but I don't have [Si] or [Mg] data for both stars. Wait, for Star_1, we have [Si/Fe] = 0.3. For Star_2, we have [Mg/Si] = 0.3.

I'll probably need to express nSi in terms of nFe and nMg in terms of nH, but let me think.

Let's break it down for each star.

Starting with Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(nSi_1/nFe_1) = 0.3.

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1. Wait, but in the Sun, nH_sun is the same as nH because we're using solar as a reference. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of solar ratios.

Wait, let me model this. Let me define the solar abundance ratios:

nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) → because log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5.

Similarly, nMg_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-5).

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

But wait, no. The [Fe/H] measures the ratio of Fe to H in the star compared to the Sun. So [Fe/H] = 0 means nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

But I think the H is the same in both numerator and denominator, so perhaps the H doesn't affect the ratio when considering [X/Y], but the number of H atoms is the same as in the Sun? Or maybe not. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the abundances in terms of the Sun's.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = log10( (nSi_1 / nFe_1) / (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

So,

(nSi_1 /nFe_1 ) = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) * 10^0.3.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = log10( (nFe_1 / nH_1) / (nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) = 0.

So,

nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

Wait, but since both stars have the same H as the Sun? No, probably not. Because [Fe/H] is 0, it means the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun. So the number of Fe atoms in the star is proportional to H. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I can express nSi_1 in terms of nFe_1, and nFe_1 in terms of nH_1.

So for Star_1:

nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * nFe_1 * 10^0.3.

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1 *10^0.3.

Simplify: nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * nH_1 * 10^0.3.

So,

nSi_1 / nH_1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

So the ratio of Si to H in Star_1 is solar ratio multiplied by 10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

Let's find nMg_2 and nSi_2.

First, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg_2 /nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun → nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2.

Next, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10( (nMg_2 / nSi_2) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

So,

(nMg_2 /nSi_2) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

We can rearrange this to find nSi_2.

nSi_2 = (nMg_2 / (10^0.3)) * (nSi_sun / nMg_sun).

But nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2.

Substituting:

nSi_2 = [ (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2 ) ] / (10^0.3) ) * (nSi_sun / nMg_sun).

Simplify:

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2 / (10^0.3).

So,

nSi_2 / nH_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (1/10^0.3).

Wait, let me recap:

For Star_1, (nSi_1 /nH_1) = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

For Star_2, (nSi_2 /nH_2) = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (1 /10^0.3 ).

Because Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3, which implies that Mg is more abundant than Si by 0.3 dex. So Si is less than Mg by 0.3.

Wait, but I need to get the ratios correct.

Wait, let me recompute Star_2. [Mg/Si]_2 = log10( (nMg_2/nSi_2)/(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.3.

So,

(nMg_2/nSi_2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

Rearranged,

nSi_2 = (nMg_sune/nSi_sun) * (nSi_2 = nMg_2 * (nSi_sun)/(nMg_sun * 10^0.3) )).

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me define the solar abundance ratios.

Let’s denote:

In the Sun,
nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) → nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 * nH_sun.

nMg_sun / nH_sun = 1e-5 → nMg_sun = 1e-5 * nH_sun.

nSi_sun /nH_sun = some value. Wait, but the question doesn’t give [Si/Fe] for the Sun. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I can compute [Si/Fe]_sun from the given data.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_sun would be log10( (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = log10( (nSi_sun)/(1e-4.5 *nH_sun) ) → but since nSi_sun = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *nH_sun.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, [Fe/H]_sun is log10(nFe/nH)_sun = log10(1e-4.5) = -4.5, but [Fe/H]_sun is not given. Wait, no, the Sun’s [Fe/H] is zero by definition, but the given data says for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The [X/Y] notation is such that [X/Y]_star = log10( (nX/nY)_star / (nX/nY)_sun ).

So, for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun = 0 for any X and Y, because (nX/nY)_sun / (nX/nY)_sun = 1, log10(1) =0.

But wait, [Fe/H]_sun isn't given, but in the question, the Sun's [Fe/H] is not directly given. So perhaps I need to compute [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, the question provides the Sun's composition as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =-5.

But what about nSi/nH in the Sun? The question doesn't provide that. Hmm. Maybe I can find [Si/Fe]_sun from the given data.

Wait, nFe_sun /nH_sun = 1e-4.5.

nSi_sun /nH_sun = ?

Well, I don't think the data provides nSi_sun. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier because I assumed [Si/Fe]_sun is needed, but perhaps it's not. Let me think.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So (nSi_1 /nFe_1) = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, so nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun)*nH_1.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun)*nH_2.

And [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (nMg_2/nSi_2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

So let me express nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of nH_1 and nH_2.

For Star_1:

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * nFe_1 * 10^0.3.

But nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1.

So,

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3.

Simplify:

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3.

So,

nSi_1 /nH_1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2.

From [Mg/Si]_2=0.3:

(nMg_2 /nSi_2) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun)*10^0.3.

We have nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun)*nH_2.

So,

nH_2 * (nMg_sun /nH_sun) / nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Rearranging,

nSi_2 = nH_2 * (nMg_sun) / (nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) / (nMg_sun * 10^0.3).

Simplify:

nSi_2 = nH_2 * (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * (1/(10^0.3)).

So,

nSi_2 /nH_2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * (1/10^0.3).

Therefore, the ratio of nSi_1 to nSi_2 is:

(nSi_1 /nH_1) / (nSi_2 /nH_2) = [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun *10^0.3 ) ] / [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun * 1/10^0.3 ) ] * (nH_2 /nH_1 ).

Wait, because nSi_1 /nH_1 divided by nSi_2 /nH_2 is (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2).

Wait, no, let me write it properly.

The ratio (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *10^0.3 *nH_1 ] / [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * (1/10^0.3) *nH_2 ].

Simplify the terms:

(nSi_1 /nSi_2) = [10^0.3 / (1/10^0.3)] * (nH_1 /nH_2).

Which is 10^(0.3 + 0.3) * (nH_1 /nH_2) = 10^0.6 * (nH_1 /nH_2).

Wait, 10^0.3 divided by 10^(-0.3) is 10^(0.6). Because [10^a]/[10^b] =10^{a-b}, so 0.3 - (-0.3) =0.6.

So,

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = 10^0.6 * (nH_1 /nH_2).

But wait, what's the ratio of nH_1 and nH_2? The question doesn't provide any data about the stars' overall hydrogen content. Hmm.

Wait, but the stars' masses are given. Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses, Star_2 is 1.2 solar masses. But mass isn't directly the same as the number of hydrogen atoms, because the number of atoms depends on the star's composition. Wait, but in LTE and using EW method, they determine elemental abundances, which are number densities. So perhaps the photospheric composition depends on the mass, but in this case, the mass might not directly impact the H abundance because the problem doesn't mention any variation in H content. Alternatively, maybe the H abundance is same in both stars as it is solar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think again. The [Fe/H] for Star_1 is 0, which means Fe abundance is same as the Sun relative to H. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0 for Star_2. So the H abundance in each star is the same as the Sun's. Because [X/H] is log10(nX/nH) - log10(nX_sun /nH_sun) =0 → nX = nX_sun*(nH/nH_sun) = (nX_sun /nH_sun) *nH.

Wait, if [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun)*nH_1.

But for the Sun, nH_sun is the number of H atoms, and for Star_1, nH_1 is the number of H atoms. But if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, then the ratio (nFe_1 /nH_1 ) = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun)*nH_1.

But if the star's H is same as Sun's, which is not necessarily the case. Wait, no, I think the [Fe/H] being 0 doesn't mean the H is same as the Sun, but the Fe and H are in the same ratio as the Sun. So if the star has more H, Fe would be proportionally more, but [Fe/H] is zero, so the ratio remains the same. So, for example, if the star has twice as much H as the Sun, then Fe would also be twice as much, keeping [Fe/H] the same.

But this doesn't directly tell us the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2. Hmm, so perhaps the H abundances are the same in both stars as in the Sun. Because otherwise, without knowing the H content, we can't proceed.

Wait, the problem states that we're to assume LTE and use the EW method to determine elemental abundances, but I don't think that affects the H abundance ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the stars have the same H abundance as the Sun, so nH_1 =nH_sun, and nH_2= nH_sun. But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption.

Wait, but the given [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are 0 for both stars. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun. Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2 /nH_2 =nMg_sun /nH_sun.

If both stars have the same H as the Sun, then nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun. But the problem doesn't specify that. So maybe the stars have the same H as each other, but not necessarily the same as the Sun. Hmm, this is getting tricky.

Wait, but perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars as the Sun. Because if a star's [Fe/H] is zero, then the Fe abundance is same as the Sun relative to H, but if the star's H is the same as Sun, then Fe is same. Alternatively, if the star has more H, then Fe would also be proportionally higher, but [Fe/H] remains zero.

But without knowing the H abundance in each star, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to make an assumption that the H content is the same in both stars as the Sun.

If I make that assumption, then nH_1 = nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun. So, nH_1 /nH_2 =1.

Then, the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) = 10^0.6 * (1) = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9. Option D is ~1.2, which is 10^0.1.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute 10^0.6.

10^0.6 is the same as e^(0.6 * ln10) ≈ e^(0.6*2.302585) → e^(1.38155)= about 3.981. So yes, about 3.98, so approximately 3.9. So the ratio would be around 3.9.

So the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) is approximately 3.9, so the answer should be option A.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me consider another angle. What if the H content is same for both stars, meaning nH_1 =nH_2. Because both have [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] zero, so their H is same as the Sun's. So nH_1 =nH_2 = nH_sun.

In that case, the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) is 10^0.6 = ~3.98, so the answer would be A.

But wait, let me double-check the earlier steps.

For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH_1.

So,

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3.

Simplifying,

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1 *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2,

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2 * (1/10^0.3).

So the ratio,

nSi_1/nSi_2 = [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *nH_2 *10^-0.3 ]

The (nSi_sun/nH_sun) terms cancel out.

So,

nSi_1/nSi_2 = (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * 10^(0.3 +0.3) = (nH_1 /nH_2 ) *10^0.6.

If nH_1 =nH_2, then the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

But if the stars have different H contents, how would that affect things?

Wait, but if the [Fe/H] for Star_1 is 0, that implies nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun)*nH_1.

Similarly, [Mg/H] for Star_2 is 0 → nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun)*nH_2.

But without knowing the H content of each star, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the H content (nH) is the same in both stars as the Sun, meaning nH_1 =nH_2 =nH_sun.

So, the ratio becomes 10^0.6, which is approximately 3.98. So the answer would be option A) ~3.9.

But wait, the options don't have 3.98, but option A is ~3.9. So that would make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the H content isn't the same, but since [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero for each star, that implies that the H in each star is the same as in the Sun. So nH_1 =nH_sun, nH_2 =nH_sun.

So nH_1 /nH_2 =1.

Thus, the ratio is 10^0.6≈3.98 → ~3.9, which is option A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given data and use the provided elemental abundance ratios. The key steps are as follows:

### Given Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - Mass: 1.5 times the Sun's mass.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex.
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex.
2. **Star_2**:
   - Mass: 1.2 times the Sun's mass.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex.
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.
3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:
   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5.
   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5.

### Key Relationships:
- The notation [X/Y]_star = log10(nX/nY)_star - log10(nX/nY)_sun.
- For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.
- For Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 implies nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(nSi_1/nFe_1) = 0.3.
- Substituting nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1, we get:
  \[
  nSi_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1 * 10^{0.3}.
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * 10^{0.3}.
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10(nMg_2/nSi_2) = 0.3.
- Substituting nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH_2, we get:
  \[
  nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH_2 * (nSi_sun/nMg_sun) / 10^{0.3}.
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  nSi_2/nH_2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) / 10^{0.3}.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Abundances:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{nSi_1}{nSi_2} = \frac{(nSi_sun/nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * nH_1}{(nSi_sun/nH_sun) / 10^{0.3} * nH_2}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{nSi_1}{nSi_2} = 10^{0.6} * \frac{nH_1}{nH_2}.
\]

### Assumption:
Since [Fe/H]_1 = 0 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0, the hydrogen abundance in both stars is assumed to be the same as in the Sun, i.e., \( nH_1 = nH_2 = nH_{\odot} \). Thus, \( \frac{nH_1}{nH_2} = 1 \).

### Final Calculation:
\[
\frac{nSi_1}{nSi_2} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
