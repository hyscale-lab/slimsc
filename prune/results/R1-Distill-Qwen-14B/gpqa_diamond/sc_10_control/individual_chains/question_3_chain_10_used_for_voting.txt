Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, which makes sense because σz is the Pauli z-matrix, and it has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for those states.

The task is to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Oh wait, expectation values. I remember that for an operator O, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. So I need to compute this for the given state.

First, let me write down what I know.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So in terms of vectors, since |↑⟩ is like [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1], ψ should be a vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. I think that's right because 0.5 squared plus (sqrt(3)/2)^2 equals 0.25 + 0.75 = 1, so it's normalized. Good.

Now, the operator is 10σz +5σx. I know σz and σx matrices. Let me write them out.

σz is [[1, 0], [0, -1]], and σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So 10σz would be [[10,0],[0,-10]], and 5σx is [[0,5],[5,0]]. Adding them together, the operator matrix O is [[10+0, 0+5], [0+5, -10+0]] → [[10,5],[5,-10]]. Wait, no. Wait, 10σz is 10 times each element, and 5σx is 5 times each element of σx. So for σz:

10σz = [[10, 0], [0, -10]]

5σx = [[0*5, 1*5], [1*5, 0*5]] → [[0,5],[5,0]]

So adding them together, O = [[10,5],[5,-10]]

Wait, no. Because O is 10σz + 5σx, so when you add the two matrices, top-left becomes 10 +0=10, top-right 0+5=5, bottom-left 0+5=5, bottom-right -10 +0= -10. So yes, O is [[10,5],[5,-10]].

Now, to find ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, which is the expectation value.

Alternatively, I could compute the expectation values of σz and σx separately, then combine them because expectation values are linear. So ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. Maybe that's easier.

Let me compute ⟨σz⟩ first.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation of σz is easy. The state ψ is a linear combination, so:

⟨σz⟩ = |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1) ?

Wait, wait. Let me think. The state is ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a is 0.5 and b is sqrt(3)/2. Since σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩, the expectation value is |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1).

So |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5.

Now for ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix, which doesn't diagonalize in the σz basis. So I think I'll have to compute it more directly.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let me compute this.

The state ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So when I apply σx to |ψ⟩, I get σx|ψ⟩ = σx [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the inner product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5], which is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Let me compute that: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (sqrt(3)/4), and the second term is the same. So together, sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, alternative way: Alternatively, I can express ψ in terms of the eigenstates of σx, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for expectation value of σx in a state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩.

The formula for ⟨σx⟩ in such a state is 2*(a b* + a* b) divided by something? Or wait, I think another approach is to express σx in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, perhaps another way is to note that the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ for a spin-½ particle in state ψ can be found using (|a|^2 + |b|^2 terms?), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, perhaps better to go back to the matrix approach.

Alternatively, maybe a different approach: for a spin-½ particle, the expectation value of σx is (ψ† σx ψ), which is the same as the inner product we computed earlier. So yes, that gives us sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me compute it again. Because ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]

So σx|ψ⟩ is [ (0 * 0.5) + (1 * sqrt(3)/2), (1 * 0.5) + (0 * sqrt(3)/2) ] → [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ]

So ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the dot product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

So that's (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) )= 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but another way to think about this: since σx is the Pauli matrix, its expectation in a state a|↑> + b|↓> is (a b* + a* b)/(something). Hmm, not sure. Let me think. Alternatively, the expectation value is ( a* (σx)_{12} b + b* (σx)_{21} a ) + ... wait, maybe that's getting more complicated.

But in any case, the calculation we did gives sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660.

So putting it all together:

⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2 )

Compute each term:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5*(0.8660) = approx 4.33.

So total expectation value is (-5) + 4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait, what's the exact value? Let me compute 5*(sqrt(3)/2):

sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So 5*(1.732/2) = 5*(0.866) = 4.33. So -5 +4.33 is indeed about -0.67.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7, which is the nearest to -0.67.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ⟨σx⟩.

Wait, another approach: The expectation value of σx is ( |a|^2 + |b|^2 )? No, that can't be right because σx has eigenvalues +/-1, and a state can't have expectation more than 1.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation.

ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] → a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

⟨σx⟩ = a b* + a* b → because σx is symmetric, so maybe it's 2 Re(a b* ), since σx in the basis has elements [[0,1],[1,0]], so the matrix element (1,2) is 1, so the expectation would be (a b* + a* b) / something? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the matrix product.

Alternatively, perhaps the expectation value of σx can be calculated as 2 Re( a b^* ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think. For a general state ψ = a|↑> + b|↓>, the expectation value of σx is (a b* + a* b). Because:

⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = (a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓| ) σx ( a |↑⟩ + b |↓⟩ )

Expanding that:

= a* a ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + a* b ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + b* a ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ +b* b ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩.

But σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ = ⟨↑|↓⟩=0

Similarly, ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩=0.

And ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = ⟨↑|↑⟩=1.

Same for ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ = ⟨↓|↓⟩=1.

So substituting, we get:

= a* a (0) + a* b (1) + b* a (1) + b* b (0) 

Which simplifies to a* b + b* a.

Which is equal to 2 Re(a b*).

So for our case, a is 0.5, and b is sqrt(3)/2.

a b* is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4.

So 2 Re(a b*) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4 )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So yes, that's correct.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So then the total expectation value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866) = -5 +4.33= -0.67.

Looking at the options, the available options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So -0.67 is approximately -0.7, so the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the operator. The operator is 10σz +5σx, so the expectation is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. Yes, that's correct.

So putting in the numbers: 10*(-0.5) = -5, 5*(0.866)≈4.33. So sum is -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So option C is the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to the \( \sigma_z \) basis, with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively.

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is calculated as:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 \cdot (+1) + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-1).
\]
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is calculated using the formula:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \, \text{Re}(a b^*),
\]
where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Substituting:
\[
a b^* = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}.
\]
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \)
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is linear and given by:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10 \langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5 \langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated expectation value is approximately \( -0.67 \), which rounds to \( -0.7 \). Comparing with the options:

- **A)** \( -1.4 \) — Too low.
- **B)** \( 1.65 \) — Positive, incorrect.
- **C)** \( -0.7 \) — Matches the rounded value.
- **D)** \( 0.85 \) — Positive, incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, which makes sense because σz is the Pauli z-matrix, and it has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for those states.

The task is to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Oh wait, expectation values. I remember that for an operator O, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. So I need to compute this for the given state.

First, let me write down what I know.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So in terms of vectors, since |↑⟩ is like [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1], ψ should be a vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. I think that's right because 0.5 squared plus (sqrt(3)/2)^2 equals 0.25 + 0.75 = 1, so it's normalized. Good.

Now, the operator is 10σz +5σx. I know σz and σx matrices. Let me write them out.

σz is [[1, 0], [0, -1]], and σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So 10σz would be [[10,0],[0,-10]], and 5σx is [[0,5],[5,0]]. Adding them together, the operator matrix O is [[10+0, 0+5], [0+5, -10+0]] → [[10,5],[5,-10]]. Wait, no. Wait, 10σz is 10 times each element, and 5σx is 5 times each element of σx. So for σz:

10σz = [[10, 0], [0, -10]]

5σx = [[0*5, 1*5], [1*5, 0*5]] → [[0,5],[5,0]]

So adding them together, O = [[10,5],[5,-10]]

Wait, no. Because O is 10σz + 5σx, so when you add the two matrices, top-left becomes 10 +0=10, top-right 0+5=5, bottom-left 0+5=5, bottom-right -10 +0= -10. So yes, O is [[10,5],[5,-10]].

Now, to find ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, which is the expectation value.

Alternatively, I could compute the expectation values of σz and σx separately, then combine them because expectation values are linear. So ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. Maybe that's easier.

Let me compute ⟨σz⟩ first.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation of σz is easy. The state ψ is a linear combination, so:

⟨σz⟩ = |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1) ?

Wait, wait. Let me think. The state is ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a is 0.5 and b is sqrt(3)/2. Since σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩, the expectation value is |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1).

So |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5.

Now for ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix, which doesn't diagonalize in the σz basis. So I think I'll have to compute it more directly.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let me compute this.

The state ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So when I apply σx to |ψ⟩, I get σx|ψ⟩ = σx [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the inner product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5], which is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Let me compute that: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (sqrt(3)/4), and the second term is the same. So together, sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, alternative way: Alternatively, I can express ψ in terms of the eigenstates of σx, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for expectation value of σx in a state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩.

The formula for ⟨σx⟩ in such a state is 2*(a b* + a* b) divided by something? Or wait, I think another approach is to express σx in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, perhaps another way is to note that the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ for a spin-½ particle in state ψ can be found using (|a|^2 + |b|^2 terms?), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, perhaps better to go back to the matrix approach.

Alternatively, maybe a different approach: for a spin-½ particle, the expectation value of σx is (ψ† σx ψ), which is the same as the inner product we computed earlier. So yes, that gives us sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me compute it again. Because ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]

So σx|ψ⟩ is [ (0 * 0.5) + (1 * sqrt(3)/2), (1 * 0.5) + (0 * sqrt(3)/2) ] → [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ]

So ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the dot product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

So that's (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) )= 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but another way to think about this: since σx is the Pauli matrix, its expectation in a state a|↑> + b|↓> is (a b* + a* b)/(something). Hmm, not sure. Let me think. Alternatively, the expectation value is ( a* (σx)_{12} b + b* (σx)_{21} a ) + ... wait, maybe that's getting more complicated.

But in any case, the calculation we did gives sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660.

So putting it all together:

⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2 )

Compute each term:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5*(0.8660) = approx 4.33.

So total expectation value is (-5) + 4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait, what's the exact value? Let me compute 5*(sqrt(3)/2):

sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So 5*(1.732/2) = 5*(0.866) = 4.33. So -5 +4.33 is indeed about -0.67.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7, which is the nearest to -0.67.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ⟨σx⟩.

Wait, another approach: The expectation value of σx is ( |a|^2 + |b|^2 )? No, that can't be right because σx has eigenvalues +/-1, and a state can't have expectation more than 1.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation.

ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] → a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

⟨σx⟩ = a b* + a* b → because σx is symmetric, so maybe it's 2 Re(a b* ), since σx in the basis has elements [[0,1],[1,0]], so the matrix element (1,2) is 1, so the expectation would be (a b* + a* b) / something? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the matrix product.

Alternatively, perhaps the expectation value of σx can be calculated as 2 Re( a b^* ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think. For a general state ψ = a|↑> + b|↓>, the expectation value of σx is (a b* + a* b). Because:

⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = (a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓| ) σx ( a |↑⟩ + b |↓⟩ )

Expanding that:

= a* a ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + a* b ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + b* a ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ +b* b ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩.

But σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ = ⟨↑|↓⟩=0

Similarly, ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩=0.

And ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = ⟨↑|↑⟩=1.

Same for ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ = ⟨↓|↓⟩=1.

So substituting, we get:

= a* a (0) + a* b (1) + b* a (1) + b* b (0) 

Which simplifies to a* b + b* a.

Which is equal to 2 Re(a b*).

So for our case, a is 0.5, and b is sqrt(3)/2.

a b* is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4.

So 2 Re(a b*) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4 )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So yes, that's correct.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So then the total expectation value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866) = -5 +4.33= -0.67.

Looking at the options, the available options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So -0.67 is approximately -0.7, so the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the operator. The operator is 10σz +5σx, so the expectation is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. Yes, that's correct.

So putting in the numbers: 10*(-0.5) = -5, 5*(0.866)≈4.33. So sum is -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So option C is the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to the \( \sigma_z \) basis, with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively.

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is calculated as:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 \cdot (+1) + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-1).
\]
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is calculated using the formula:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \, \text{Re}(a b^*),
\]
where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Substituting:
\[
a b^* = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}.
\]
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \)
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is linear and given by:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10 \langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5 \langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated expectation value is approximately \( -0.67 \), which rounds to \( -0.7 \). Comparing with the options:

- **A)** \( -1.4 \) — Too low.
- **B)** \( 1.65 \) — Positive, incorrect.
- **C)** \( -0.7 \) — Matches the rounded value.
- **D)** \( 0.85 \) — Positive, incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
