Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows something called the exponential decay law. Let me think. The question is about the probability of an atom decaying within a certain time after already having survived for some time.

So the setup is that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. They're asking for the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but wait—next 150 minutes from when? Oh, right, after the 50 minutes have already passed. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, no, actually, the 150 minutes is the time after the 50 minutes have passed. Oh, no, wait. Wait, the question says, the atom has survived 50 minutes. Now, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. So the next 150 after the 50, meaning total time from start would be 200 minutes.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial statement says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the half-life or something? Or is it just the decay constant?

Wait, the decay probability in a given time is related to the decay constant. The formula I remember is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant, and t is time. But the probability that a nucleus decays during a time interval t is 1 - e^(-λt). So in this case, the probability for 100 minutes is 32%, so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). So I can solve for λ.

Let me rearrange that equation. e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides: ln(0.68) = -λ*100. So λ = (-ln(0.68)) / 100. Let me calculate that. What's ln(0.68)? Well, ln(1)=0, ln(0.5)= about -0.6931. 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5, so ln(0.68) is about -0.38566. So λ is approximately 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.

But wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me see: ln(0.68) = let me approximate step by step. Let's see, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and ln(0.68) would be a bit lower. Maybe around -0.3857, as I thought. Hmm, perhaps using a calculator would be better, but in an exam setting, maybe I can just proceed with the approximate value.

So now, the question is, given that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. So that's a total time of 200 minutes from the start. Alternatively, the remaining time after 50 minutes is 150 minutes. But wait, no—wait, the probability that it decays within the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes have passed. So the time interval is 150 minutes starting from now.

Ah, right, because radioactive decay is memoryless. The probability doesn't depend on how much time has already passed; it's only about the time remaining. So even though 50 minutes have gone by, the probability for the next 150 minutes is the same as if the atom had just been created and we're looking at a 150-minute window.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the initial probability given is for 100 minutes. So perhaps the method needs to be adjusted.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The key point is that decay is memoryless, so the probability of decaying in the next T minutes is always 1 - e^(-λ T), regardless of how much time has already passed.

So in this case, the 50 minutes that have passed don't affect the probability for the next 150 minutes. So we can just calculate the probability for 150 minutes.

Wait, but wait. The 32% is for 100 minutes. We can use that to find λ, then use that λ to find the probability for 150 minutes.

So let's proceed.

Given that in 100 minutes, the probability is 32%, which is 0.32. So:

0.32 = 1 - e^{-λ * 100}

So, e^{-100λ} = 0.68

Take natural log on both sides:

-100λ = ln(0.68)

So λ = (-ln(0.68)) / 100.

Calculating ln(0.68): ln(0.68) = approximately -0.38566.

So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is: what is the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., in the interval from t=50 to t=200 minutes)?

The probability is P = 1 - e^{-λ * 150}.

Substituting λ:

P = 1 - e^{ -0.0038566 * 150 }.

Calculate 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.

So e^{-0.57849} ≈ let's compute this. e^(-0.57849) is approximately what?

We know that e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, and e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488. 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6, closer to 0.6.

Let me compute more accurately. Let's think about e^(-0.57849):

We can use the Taylor series expansion or approximate it. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of known values.

Wait, 0.57849 is approximately 0.5785. Let me compute ln(0.5623) is around -0.575. Wait, let me think. Wait, perhaps it's easier to use a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that ln(0.56) ≈ -0.5798. Hmm, let me see: ln(0.56) = ?

Wait, 0.56 is e^x. Let me compute x.

Wait, e^(-0.5785) ≈ approximately 0.561.

Wait, e^(-0.5785) ≈ 0.561.

So P = 1 - 0.561 ≈ 0.439, which is about 43.9%, approximately 44%. Looking at the options, option A is 44%.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for more precision.

Wait, ln(0.68) is -0.38566248. So λ = 0.0038566248 per minute.

Then, 150 minutes: 0.0038566248 * 150 = 0.57849372.

e^(-0.57849372) = ?

Let me check that. Let's compute 0.57849372.

We can use the formula for e^(-x). Let's compute e^(-0.5785) more accurately.

Alternatively, using a calculator-like approach:

We know that:

e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.60653066

e^{-0.6} ≈ 0.5488116

e^{-0.5785} is between 0.5488 and 0.6065.

We can use linear approximation, but maybe a better way is to compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps using the Taylor series expansion around x=0.5.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that 0.5785 is 0.5 + 0.0785.

Alternatively, using a calculator would be better, but since I don't have one, maybe I can use a better approximation.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator's approach. Let me compute e^(-0.5785):

We can use the formula:

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24 for small x, but 0.5785 is not small, so that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that e^(-0.5785) = 1/(e^{0.5785}).

Calculating e^{0.5785}:

We can think of it as e^{0.5} * e^{0.0785}.

e^{0.5} ≈ 1.64872.

e^{0.0785} ≈ 1 + 0.0785 + (0.0785)^2/2 + (0.0785)^3/6.

Calculating each term:

0.0785^2 = approximately 0.006162.

0.006162 / 2 = 0.003081.

0.0785^3 = 0.0785 * 0.006162 ≈ 0.000484.

0.000484 / 6 ≈ 0.0000807.

So e^0.0785 ≈ 1 + 0.0785 + 0.003081 + 0.0000807 ≈ 1.08166.

So e^{0.5785} ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08166 ≈ ?

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872.

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.131898.

1.64872 * 0.00166 ≈ approx 0.00273.

Adding up: 1.64872 + 0.131898 = 1.78062 + 0.00273 ≈ 1.78335.

So e^{0.5785} ≈ 1.78335.

Therefore, e^{-0.5785} ≈ 1 / 1.78335 ≈ 0.561.

So P = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or 43.9%, which is approximately 44%, so option A.

But wait, let's make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the decay probability in t is P(t) = 1 - e^{-λ t}.

Given that P(100) = 0.32, so 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100 λ}, which gives e^{-100 λ} = 0.68, so λ = (ln 0.68)/(-100) = approximately 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, for the next 150 minutes, the probability is P(150) = 1 - e^{-150 λ} = 1 - e^{-0.5785} ≈ 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is 43.9%.

So the closest option is A) 44%.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another way to approach this is considering that the problem is about conditional probability. The question is, given that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, what is the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes.

But because of the memoryless property of exponential decay, the probability only depends on the remaining time, so the 50 minutes are irrelevant. So the probability is the same as P(150) as calculated before.

So I think the correct answer is 44%, which is option A.

To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay law, which states that the probability of an atom decaying within a time interval \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The problem provides that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using this, we can solve for \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Using the same formula:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):

\[
-\lambda \cdot 150 = -0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx -0.57849
\]

\[
e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.561
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.561 \approx 0.439
\]

Thus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 43.9%, which rounds to 44%. Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, the fact that 50 minutes have already passed does not affect this calculation.

The closest option is:

**A) 44%**

Wait, but wait. The 32% is for 100 minutes. We can use that to find λ, then use that λ to find the probability for 150 minutes.

So let's proceed.

Given that in 100 minutes, the probability is 32%, which is 0.32. So:

0.32 = 1 - e^{-λ * 100}

So, e^{-100λ} = 0.68

Take natural log on both sides:

-100λ = ln(0.68)

So λ = (-ln(0.68)) / 100.

Calculating ln(0.68): ln(0.68) = approximately -0.38566.

So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is: what is the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., in the interval from t=50 to t=200 minutes)?

The probability is P = 1 - e^{-λ * 150}.

Substituting λ:

P = 1 - e^{ -0.0038566 * 150 }.

Calculate 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.

So e^{-0.57849} ≈ let's compute this. e^(-0.57849) is approximately what?

We know that e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, and e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488. 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6, closer to 0.6.

Wait, e^(-0.5785) ≈ approximately 0.561.

Wait, e^(-0.5785) ≈ 0.561.

So P = 1 - 0.561 ≈ 0.439, which is about 43.9%, approximately 44%. Looking at the options, option A is 44%.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for more precision.

Wait, ln(0.68) is -0.38566248. So λ = 0.0038566248 per minute.

Then, 150 minutes: 0.0038566248 * 150 = 0.57849372.

e^(-0.57849372) = ?

Let me check that. Let's compute 0.57849372.

We can use linear approximation, but maybe a better way is to compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps using the Taylor series expansion around x=0.5.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that 0.5785 is 0.5 + 0.0785.

Alternatively, using a calculator would be better, but since I don't have one, maybe I can use a better approximation.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator's approach. Let me compute e^(-0.5785):

We can use the formula:

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24 for small x, but 0.5785 is not small, so that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that e^(-0.5785) = 1/(e^{0.5785}).

Calculating e^{0.5785}:

We can think of it as e^{0.5} * e^{0.0785}.

e^{0.5} ≈ 1.64872.

e^{0.0785} ≈ 1 + 0.0785 + (0.0785)^2/2 + (0.0785)^3/6.

Calculating each term:

0.0785^2 = approximately 0.006162.

0.006162 / 2 = 0.003081.

0.0785^3 = 0.0785 * 0.006162 ≈ 0.000484.

0.000484 / 6 ≈ 0.0000807.

So e^0.0785 ≈ 1 + 0.0785 + 0.003081 + 0.0000807 ≈ 1.08166.

So e^{0.5785} ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08166 ≈ ?

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872.

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.131898.

1.64872 * 0.00166 ≈ approx 0.00273.

Adding up: 1.64872 + 0.131898 = 1.78062 + 0.00273 ≈ 1.78335.

So e^{0.5785} ≈ 1.78335.

Therefore, e^{-0.5785} ≈ 1 / 1.78335 ≈ 0.561.

So P = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or 43.9%, which is approximately 44%, so option A.

But wait, let's make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the decay probability in t is P(t) = 1 - e^{-λ t}.

Given that P(100) = 0.32, so 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100 λ}, which gives e^{-100 λ} = 0.68, so λ = (ln 0.68)/(-100) = approximately 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, for the next 150 minutes, the probability is P(150) = 1 - e^{-150 λ} = 1 - e^{-0.5785} ≈ 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is 43.9%.

So the closest option is A) 44%.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another way to approach this is considering that the problem is about conditional probability. The question is, given that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, what is the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes.

But because of the memoryless property of exponential decay, the probability only depends on the remaining time, so the 50 minutes are irrelevant. So the probability is the same as P(150) as calculated before.

So I think the correct answer is 44%, which is option A.


To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay law, which states that the probability of an atom decaying within a time interval \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The problem provides that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using this, we can solve for \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Using the same formula:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):

\[
-\lambda \cdot 150 = -0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx -0.57849
\]

\[
e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.561
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.561 \approx 0.439
\]

Thus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 43.9%, which rounds to 44%. Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, the fact that 50 minutes have already passed does not affect this calculation.

The closest option is:

**A) 44%**

Answer: A
