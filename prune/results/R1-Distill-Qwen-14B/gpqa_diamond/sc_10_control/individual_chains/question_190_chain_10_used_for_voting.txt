Okay, so I have this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Hmm, I need to arrange the given nucleophiles from most reactive to least reactive. The options are a bit confusing, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that nucleophilicity depends on the solvent. Since the question specifies aqueous solution, that's a polar protic solvent. In such solvents, the more polarizable and less solvated the nucleophile is, the more reactive it will be. Also, the basicity of the nucleophile plays a role because stronger bases are better nucleophiles in such solvents.

The nucleophiles given are:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)
3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)

Wait, I should note that some of these are stronger bases. Let's list their approximate pKa values to gauge their basicity. Remember, lower pKa means stronger acid, so the conjugate base is stronger.

- Hydroxide: The conjugate acid is water, pKa ~15.7.
- Ethanethiolate: The conjugate acid is ethanethiol, pKa ~10.
- 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: The conjugate acid is 4-methylcyclohexanol. Alcohols have pKa ~19-20, but the methyl group here might stabilize the conjugate acid a bit via induction? Not sure, but maybe around pKa 18-19?
- Propionate: The conjugate acid is propionic acid, pKa ~4.88. So propionate is a weaker base than hydroxide and ethanethiolate.
- Methanol: It's a weak acid with pKa ~19.7. So methanol is a weaker base than the hydroxide ion but stronger than, say, water.

Wait, wait. Methanol is CH3OH. It's a neutral molecule, not a deprotonated form. So as a nucleophile, its strength in aqueous solution would be lower compared to its deprotonated form. Because in solution, if it's not ionized, it won't be as effective a nucleophile.

So, arranging the nucleophiles in order of strength in aqueous solution (polar protic solvent):

Stronger bases (and hence better nucleophiles) should come first.

Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) has a conjugate acid pKa ~10, so it's a stronger base than hydroxide (OH⁻, pKa ~15.7). So HS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻, which makes it a better nucleophile in polar protic solvents, especially when they're both negatively charged.

Wait, but wait—sometimes in polar protic solvents, the solvent can stabilize the nucleophile through solvation. The more the nucleophile is solvated (i.e., surrounded by solvent molecules), the less reactive it becomes because its movement is hindered. So the larger and less charged (but more polarizable) the nucleophile, the less it's solvated, so perhaps more reactive. Wait, but in this case, we're comparing different ions and a neutral molecule.

So the order of base strength (from strongest to weakest):

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) – pKa ~10
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻) – pKa ~15.7
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (probably a stronger base than OH-? Wait, wait, I think I got this wrong. Wait, cyclohexanol has a pKa around 19, so the conjugate base would be weaker than hydroxide. Wait no, wait: the pKa of the acid is the key. For example, if the acid HA has a pKa of 10, then A⁻ is a stronger base than if HA has pKa 15, because a lower pKa for HA means it's a stronger acid, so A⁻ is weaker base. Wait, no, wait: if HA has lower pKa (stronger acid), then A⁻ is weaker base. So, comparing the conjugate acids:

- Ethanethiol (HS⁻ conjugate acid): pKa ~10 → HS⁻ is strong base.
- Water (OH⁻ conjugate acid): pKa ~15.7 → OH⁻ is weaker base than HS⁻.
- 4-methylcyclohexanol (1-olate conjugate acid): pKa ~19 → 1-olate is weaker base than OH⁻.
Wait, that can't be right. If 4-methylcyclohexanol has a pKa around 19, then the 1-olate ion is a stronger base than OH⁻ (since the conjugate acid is weaker). Because a higher pKa of the conjugate acid means the base is stronger.

Wait, let me think: The stronger the base (A⁻), the weaker its conjugate acid (HA). If HA has a high pKa, it's a weak acid, so A⁻ is a strong base.

So for example, if HA has pKa 2, it's a strong acid, so A⁻ is a weak base. If HA has pKa 12, it's a weak acid, so A⁻ is a strong base.

So, comparing the conjugate acids:

- HS⁻ → H-Ethanethiol (pKa ~10)
- OH⁻ → H2O (pKa ~15.7)
- 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate → 4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa ~19-20)
- Propionate → Propionic acid (pKa ~4.88)
- Methanol → CH3OH (pKa ~19.7)

Wait, the higher the pKa of the conjugate acid, the stronger the base of its conjugate base. So, the order of the conjugate acids' pKa from highest to lowest (since higher pKa → weaker acid → stronger base):

4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa ~19-20) → 1-olate is stronger base
Then, methanol (pKa ~19.7) → methoxide is stronger than OH⁻?
Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list the pKa of the conjugate acids:

1. 4-methylcyclohexanol: pKa ~19.3 (I think, maybe around 19)
2. Ethanethiol: pKa ~10
3. Water: ~15.7
4. Methanol: ~19.7
5. Propionic acid: ~4.88

So, the order of the conjugate acids' strengths (from strongest to weakest acid):

Propionic acid (pKa 4.88) → strongest acid, so propionate is weakest base.
Ethanethiol (pKa 10) → stronger acid than propionic? No, wait, ethanethiol has a lower pKa than propionic? No, wait, no: wait, I think propionic acid has a pKa around 4.88, which is stronger acid than ethanethiol (pKa ~10). So, propionic acid is stronger → propionate is weaker base.

So the order of conjugate acid strength (strongest → weakest):

Propionic acid (4.88) > Ethanethiol (10) > Water (15.7) > Methanol (19.7) > 4-methylcyclohexanol (19.3) → wait, but 4-methylcyclohexanol has a pKa of about 19.3, which is higher than methanol's 19.7? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get the pKa values correct.

Wait, let's clarify:

- Propionic acid: pKa ~4.88
- Ethanethiol: pKa ~10
- Water: pKa ~15.7
- Methanol: pKa ~19.7
- 4-methylcyclohexanol: pKa ~19.3

So the conjugate acids in order of strength (from strongest to weakest):

Propionic acid (4.88) → strongest acid
Ethanethiol (10) → next
Water (15.7) → next
4-methylcyclohexanol (19.3) → weaker than methanol?
Wait, methanol's pKa is ~19.7, which is weaker acid than 4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa 19.3). Wait, no: wait, lower pKa is stronger acid. So 4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa ~19.3) is a stronger acid than methanol (pKa ~19.7), because 19.3 < 19.7. So the order of the conjugate acids from strongest to weakest:

Propionic acid (4.88) > Ethanethiol (10) > Water (15.7) > 4-methylcyclohexanol (19.3) > Methanol (~19.7)

Therefore, the strength of the bases (conjugate bases) is the reverse of this. So the strongest base is the one from the weakest conjugate acid. So:

Methanol (pKa 19.7) → CH3O⁻ is a strong base because its conjugate acid is weak.
4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa 19.3) → conjugate base is strong, but weaker than methoxide.
Water (pKa 15.7) → OH⁻ is weaker base than 4-methylcyclohexanolate.
Ethanethiol (pKa 10) → HS⁻ is weaker base than OH⁻.
Propionic acid (pKa 4.88) → Propionate is the weakest base.

Wait, that's not right. Because if HA has a lower pKa (stronger acid), then A⁻ is a weaker base. So the order of the strength of the conjugate bases (from strongest to weakest):

Methanol (CH3O⁻) → because its conjugate acid (CH3OH) has pKa ~19.7, which is higher (weaker acid) → stronger base.
4-methylcyclohexanolate → conjugate acid pKa ~19.3 → so its base strength is weaker than methoxide.
Then, OH⁻ → conjugate acid pKa 15.7 → weaker base than 4-methylcyclohexanolate? No, wait, wait. Let me see: higher pKa of HA means weaker acid → stronger A⁻. So:

Methanol (CH3O⁻) → conjugate acid pKa 19.7 → strongest base.
4-methylcyclohexanolate → conjugate acid pKa 19.3 → next.
OH⁻ → conjugate acid pKa 15.7 → next.
Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → conjugate acid pKa 10 → weaker base.
Propionate (CH2CH2COO⁻) → conjugate acid pKa ~4.88 → weakest base.

So the order of base strength from strongest to weakest:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → Wait, no! Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Wait, HS⁻ has a conjugate acid with pKa ~10, which is a stronger acid than OH⁻ (pKa 15.7). So HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. No, wait, no. Because a stronger acid (lower pKa) means the conjugate base is weaker. So if HA has a pKa of 10, A⁻ (HS⁻) is a stronger base than if HA has a pKa of 15.7 (OH⁻).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. HA → A⁻ + H⁺.

If HA has a lower pKa (stronger acid), then A⁻ is a weaker base because it doesn't want to hold onto the proton as much—it's better at donating it. So a stronger acid (lower pKa) leads to a weaker conjugate base.

So, the order of conjugate acids from strongest to weakest:

Propionic acid (4.88) → strongest acid → weakest base (propionate).
Ethanethiol (10) → stronger acid than water (15.7) → so HS⁻ is weaker base than OH⁻.
Water (15.7) → OH⁻.
Methanol (19.7) → CH3O⁻.
4-methylcyclohexanol (19.3) → 4-methylcyclohexanolate.

Wait, but 4-methylcyclohexanol has a pKa of ~19.3, which is lower than methanol's 19.7, meaning it's a stronger acid. So the conjugate base (4-methylcyclohexanolate) is weaker base than methoxide.

So the order of base strength (strongest to weakest):

Methoxide (CH3O⁻) → because its conjugate acid (methanol) has the highest pKa (19.7). Wait no, wait, 4-methylcyclohexanol has pKa 19.3, which is lower than methanol's 19.7. So 4-methylcyclohexanol is a stronger acid than methanol, meaning its conjugate base (4-methylcyclohexanolate) is weaker base than methoxide.

So, the order of base strength:

1. Methoxide (CH3O⁻) → strongest base (since CH3OH is weakest acid)
2. 4-methylcyclohexanolate → next
3. OH⁻ (weaker than both because H2O is a stronger acid than methanol)
Wait, no, because methanol has higher pKa than 4-methylcyclohexanol. So CH3O⁻ is a stronger base than 4-methylcyclohexanolate?

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let's list them:

Conjugate acids and their pKa:

- Propionic acid (CH2CH2COOH): ~4.88
- Ethanethiol (HS-): ~10
- Water (H-O-H): ~15.7
- 4-methylcyclohexanol: ~19.3
- Methanol: ~19.7

So, the order of conjugate acids' strength (strongest first):

1. Propionic acid (4.88)
2. Ethanethiol (10)
3. Water (15.7)
4. 4-methylcyclohexanol (19.3)
5. Methanol (19.7)

Because a lower pKa means a stronger acid, this is correct.

So, the order of the strength of the bases (their conjugate bases) is the reverse, from weakest to strongest:

1. Propionate (weakest base)
2. HS⁻ (ethanethiolate)
3. OH⁻
4. 4-methylcyclohexanolate
5. CH3O⁻ (methoxide) → strongest base.

Wait, that can't be right. Because methanol has a higher pKa (19.7) than 4-methylcyclohexanol (19.3). So, the conjugate base of methanol (CH3O⁻) is a stronger base than the conjugate base of 4-methylcyclohexanol because methanol is a weaker acid.

So, the correct order of base strength is:

CH3O⁻ (strongest base) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate (weakest base).

But wait, does that make sense? Because HS⁻ comes from a stronger acid (pKa 10) than OH⁻ (pKa 15.7), so HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So the order would be:

Methoxide (CH3O⁻) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

Wait, but that can't be right because 4-methylcyclohexanol has a lower pKa (19.3) than methanol (19.7). So 4-methylcyclohexanol is a stronger acid than methanol, which makes its conjugate base (4-methylcyclohexanolate) a weaker base than methoxide. So methoxide is a stronger base than the cyclohexanolate.

So the base strength order is:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → weaker base than OH⁻.
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate → weaker base than methoxide, stronger than OH⁻.
4. Methanol (CH3O⁻) → strongest base.
Wait, I'm now getting even more confused. Let me try a different approach.

I think I should make a table:

Nucleophile | Conjugate Acid | pKa of Conjugate Acid | Strength of Conjugate Base (A⁻)
--- | --- | --- | ---
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate | 4-methylcyclohexanol | ~19.3 | Strong
2. Hydroxide | Water | 15.7 | Stronger than propionate, weaker than 4-methylcyclohexanolate?
Wait, no, 4-methylcyclohexanol has a lower pKa (19.3) than methanol (19.7). So 4-methylcyclohexanol is a stronger acid than methanol. That means, the conjugate base of 4-methylcyclohexanol (the 1-olate) is a weaker base than the conjugate base of methanol (methoxide). So methoxide is a stronger base than the 1-olate.

So, the order from strongest to weakest base:

CH3O⁻ (methoxide) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

Wait, but OH⁻ is weaker than methoxide and the cyclohexanolate. HS⁻ is weaker than OH⁻.

Wait, that can't be right. Because HS⁻ comes from a conjugate acid (ethanethiol) with pKa ~10, which is stronger than water (pKa 15.7). So HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So the order of base strength is: methoxide > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

Wait, but 4-methylcyclohexanolate comes from a weaker acid than methanol (since 4-methylcyclohexanol has pKa 19.3, which is lower than methanol's 19.7, meaning 4-methylcyclohexanol is a stronger acid than methanol. Therefore, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a weaker base than methoxide.

So the order is: methoxide (CH3O⁻) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

Wait, but wait another moment. Methanol has a pKa of ~19.7, so its conjugate base (methoxide) is a stronger base than 4-methylcyclohexanolate (since the latter's conjugate acid is 4-methylcyclohexanol, pKa ~19.3). Since 19.3 is lower than 19.7, 4-methylcyclohexanol is a stronger acid, which makes 4-methylcyclohexanolate a weaker base than methoxide. So methoxide is a stronger base than the 1-olate.

So the order of base strength is:

Methoxide (CH3O⁻) → strongest base
4-methylcyclohexanolate → next
OH⁻ → next
HS⁻ → weaker than OH⁻
Propionate → weakest.

Wait, but wait, that can't be. Because in reality, HS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻, isn't it? Because thiolates are stronger bases than hydroxide ions. Oh wait, yes! Because H-S has a lower pKa (~10) than H-O-H (~15.7), so HS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻. Wait, no, because the conjugate acid with lower pKa is stronger. So HS⁻ comes from a stronger acid (lower pKa) than OH⁻, so HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. Wait, no again. Because a stronger acid has a weaker conjugate base. Wait, let me think: if HA has a low pKa, it's a strong acid, so A⁻ is a weak base. So HS⁻ (from H-S, pKa ~10) is a weaker base than OH⁻ (from H2O, pKa ~15.7). Because H2O is a weaker acid than H-S, so OH⁻ is a stronger base than HS⁻.

Wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier. So in reality, OH⁻ is a stronger base than HS⁻ because H2O is a weaker acid than H-S. So in terms of basicity, OH⁻ > HS⁻.

Wait, that's confusing because sulfur is larger and can better stabilize the negative charge, but in this case, the pKa is the key. So, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻.

So, the order of base strength is:

Methoxide (CH3O⁻) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about HS⁻ and OH⁻. Which is a stronger base in water? I remember that thiolates are stronger bases than hydroxide ions in aprotic solvents, but in protic solvents like water, they might not be as strong because of solvation. Wait, but in aqueous solution, the solvent is water. HS⁻ is more polarizable and less solvated than OH⁻, making it a better nucleophile despite being a weaker base. Or wait, no. Wait, in polar protic solvents, the strength of the base is a key factor because the solvent stabilizes (solvates) the nucleophile. So a stronger base (which is less stabilized by solvation) might have better nucleophilicity.

Wait, but even so, the question is about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. So which factors influence that?

In polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity is related to the basicity of the nucleophile because stronger bases are less solvated and hence better nucleophiles. But the size and polarizability also play a role. For example, I⁻ is a better nucleophile than F⁻ in polar protic solvents because it's larger and less solvated, even though F⁻ is a stronger base.

So, in this case, perhaps the order of nucleophilicity (in aqueous solution) would follow the order of basicity because all the nucleophiles are - but wait, some are more polarizable.

Wait, the given nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strong base)
2. OH⁻ (moderate base)
3. Propionate (weak base)
4. Methanol (neutral; weak nucleophile)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) (weaker base than OH⁻? Or stronger?)

Wait, no, let's correct that. Let me get the correct pKa values:

- H2O: pKa ~15.7
- H-S: pKa ~10 → so HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻? Because H-S is a stronger acid (lower pKa) than H2O. So the conjugate base of a stronger acid is weaker. So HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because HS⁻ (from H-S, pKa 10) is a stronger base than HO⁻ (from H2O, pKa 15.7). Because a higher pKa of the conjugate acid means a stronger base. Wait, no: no, wait, lower pKa means stronger acid, so weaker base. So HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. Because H-S is a stronger acid than H2O.

So, HS⁻ is weaker base than OH⁻.

Therefore, the order of base strength is:

CH3O⁻ (methoxide) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

Wait, but this can't be right because I've heard that thiolates are stronger bases than hydroxide. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the pKa values to make sure.

Looking up:

- H2O: pKa ~15.7
- H-S: pKa ~7 (wait, is that correct?) Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Wait, I thought H-S has a pKa around 10, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I confused ethanethiol with something else. Let me think: I know that H2S has a pKa around 7, but ethanethiol (CH3CH2SH) is a stronger acid than H2S because the ethyl group donates electrons through induction, stabilizing the conjugate acid. So the pKa of ethanethiol is around 10.

Yes, so the pKa of ethanethiol is about 10, which makes HS⁻ a weaker base than OH⁻ (because H2O has pKa 15.7). So in terms of base strength:

OH⁻ (pKa 15.7) → stronger base than HS⁻ (pKa 10).

So, the order of base strength is:

Methoxide (CH3O⁻) → strongest base
4-methylcyclohexanolate → next
OH⁻ → next
HS⁻ → weaker
Propionate → weakest.

Wait, but in aqueous solution, the solvent is water, which can solvate the nucleophiles. So, the more the nucleophile is solvated, the less reactive it is. So, in a polar protic solvent, nucleophilicity is inversely related to the strength of the base because stronger bases are less solvated and hence more reactive.

Wait, but wait. In polar protic solvents, the trend is that the more polarizable the nucleophile is, the less it is solvated, making it a better nucleophile. So, for example, iodide is a better nucleophile than fluoride in polar protic solvents despite being a weaker base because it's larger and more polarizable.

So for the given nucleophiles, their nucleophilicity in aqueous solution would depend on both their basicity and their polarizability.

Let's list them:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻): moderately strong base, larger than OH⁻, more polarizable.
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻): weaker base than methoxide and the 1-olate, but stronger than HS⁻ (wait, no, HS⁻ is weaker base than OH⁻? Or stronger? Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong.)

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Let me think about the nucleophilicity trends in polar protic solvents.

In polar protic solvents, nucleophilicity tends to follow the basicity because stronger bases are less solvated. But there are exceptions when nucleophiles are large and polarizable, which makes them better nucleophiles despite being weaker bases.

So, among the given nucleophiles, which are strong bases and which are large and polarizable?

The nucleophiles in the list are:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: a strong base (stronger than OH⁻)
2. OH⁻: moderate base
3. Propionate: very weak base (since propionic acid is a strong acid)
4. Methanol: neutral, poor nucleophile
5. Ethanethiolate: HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻ because H-S is a stronger acid.

Wait, but earlier I thought HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me find a reliable source.

Upon checking, I find that the pKa of ethanethiol is about 10, while the pKa of water is 15.7. So, since H-S has a lower pKa, it is a stronger acid, which makes HS⁻ a weaker base than OH⁻. So, OH⁻ is a stronger base than HS⁻.

So, the order of basicity is:

1. Methoxide (CH3O⁻) → strongest base
2. 4-methylcyclohexanolate → next
3. OH⁻ → next
4. HS⁻ → weaker than OH⁻
5. Propionate → weakest.

But in aqueous solution, the solvent can solvate these ions. So, the more solvated a nucleophile is, the less reactive it becomes.

So, among the same charge, larger ions are less solvated and more reactive. For example, I⁻ is a better nucleophile than F⁻ in polar protic solvents because it's larger and less solvated, despite being a weaker base.

So, considering both basicity and polarizability:

HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, but it's larger and more polarizable. So which effect dominates?

In aqueous solution, I think the solvation effect may cause HS⁻ to be a better nucleophile than OH⁻. Because even though HS⁻ is a weaker base, its larger size and higher polarizability make it less solvated, so more reactive.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in aqueous solution, nucleophilicity tends to follow basicity for similar-sized nucleophiles. For example, RO⁻ nucleophiles with larger R are better nucleophiles because they're less solvated.

So, for the same charge and similar size, the stronger base is a better nucleophile. But when the nucleophiles differ significantly in size, the larger one may be more nucleophilic because of less solvation.

So, let me list the nucleophiles with their basicity and size:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate → strong base, large (cyclohexyl group is bulky)
2. OH⁻ → moderate base, small
3. Propionate → weak base, medium size (acetate-like)
4. Methanol → neutral, small
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → weaker base than OH⁻, but larger than OH⁻ (sulfur is bigger than oxygen)

So, in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity would be:

Strongest nucleophile → least.

Which factors are more important here: basicity or size?

I think for HS⁻, despite being a weaker base than OH⁻, its larger size makes it a better nucleophile in aqueous solution.

So, the order of nucleophilicity would be:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → more polarizable and less solvated → better nucleophile than OH⁻
2. OH⁻ → next
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate → strong base, but bulky. Wait, but bulkiness can hinder nucleophilicity because of steric hindrance. So, despite being a strong base, its bulk might make it a poorer nucleophile than OH⁻ in some cases. Or maybe not, because in SN2 reactions, bulky nucleophiles might not approach as easily, but in SN1, it's more about the leaving group. Wait, but here we're talking about nucleophilicity in substitution reactions, so it's about how well the nucleophile can attack.

Wait, but the question is about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, not about specific mechanisms. So, in terms of inherent nucleophilicity, considering solvation and basicity.

So, the order I'm considering is:

HS⁻ (higher polarizability, less solvated) > OH⁻ (moderate base, small) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate (strong base but bulky) > methanol (neutral, poor nucleophile) > propionate (weak base, polarized, but not as good as others).

Wait, but wait—another angle. In aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity order of common ions is usually I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻. But F⁻ is a stronger base than I⁻. However, in polar protic solvents, F⁻ is more solvated, so I⁻ is a better nucleophile.

So, applying that, even though HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, it's larger and less solvated, making it a better nucleophile.

So, the order would be:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → strongest
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate → strong base, but bulky. So, maybe it's less reactive than OH⁻ because of bulk. Or maybe not. Wait, if it's a strong base, but bulky, perhaps it's less reactive than OH⁻ despite being a stronger base. Because in SN2 reactions, bulky nucleophiles have a harder time approaching the electrophilic center.

Alternatively, in aqueous solution, which is a polar protic solvent, the strength of the base is more important. So, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it should be a better nucleophile.

Wait, but in reality, larger ions are less solvated. So, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a larger ion than OH⁻, so it's less solvated, making it a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

So, putting it all together:

The order of nucleophilicity (from strongest to weakest) is:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → because less solvated than OH⁻, despite being a weaker base.
2. OH⁻ → next
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate → strong base and less solvated than others?
Wait, but 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a stronger base than OH⁻ and HS⁻. So, it should be a better nucleophile in aqueous solution.

Hmm, this is getting really tangled. Let me try to approach this step by step.

Step 1: Assessing basicity.

The basicity (from strongest to weakest):

Methoxide (CH3O⁻) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

Step 2: Assessing polarizability and size.

HS⁻ is larger than OH⁻, so less solvated → better nucleophile than OH⁻ despite being weaker base.

4-methylcyclohexanolate is a large, bulky anion → less solvated than smaller ions, making it a good nucleophile.

But, is it a stronger base than methoxide? No, methoxide is a stronger base.

Wait, no. Earlier, I thought that 4-methylcyclohexanol's pKa is ~19.3, which is lower than methanol's 19.7. So, 4-methylcyclohexanol is a stronger acid, making its conjugate base (4-methylcyclohexanolate) a weaker base than methoxide.

So, methoxide is stronger base than 4-methylcyclohexanolate.

So, in terms of basicity, order is:

Methoxide > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

But in aqueous solution, the solvent's effect matters. Larger anions are less solvated, so better nucleophiles.

So, among the given options, which is the strongest nucleophile in aqueous solution?

Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) is larger than OH⁻, so it's less solvated → better nucleophile than OH⁻, despite being a weaker base.

4-methylcyclohexanolate is a strong base but bulky. Will that hinder its nucleophilicity? Or will its strong base strength make it a better nucleophile than OH⁻?

In polar protic solvents, the trend is that nucleophilicity follows basicity for same-sized ions. But when the ions differ in size, the larger ion may be more nucleophilic.

So, HS⁻ is larger than OH⁻. So, HS⁻ is a better nucleophile in aqueous solution than OH⁻, even though it's a weaker base.

Similarly, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, but its bulkiness might make it less nucleophilic than HS⁻ despite being a stronger base.

Wait, but 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, which often translates to better nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents.

So, perhaps the order is:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)
2. OH⁻
1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate.

Wait, but that can't be right because 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it should be a better nucleophile.

Alternatively, the order is:

1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate → strongest base → strongest nucleophile
5. Ethanethiolate → next because of size
2. OH⁻ → next (weaker base, but smaller)
3. Propionate → weak base, poor nucleophilicity.

Wait, but that doesn't account for HS⁻'s size advantage.

Alternatively, maybe the order is:

5. Ethanethiolate > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > Methanol > Propionate.

But why would 4-methylcyclohexanolate be better than HS⁻?

Because 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than HS⁻. So, in a polar protic solvent, the stronger base is a better nucleophile.

Wait, but HS⁻ is larger and less solvated, so perhaps it's a better nucleophile than 4-methylcyclohexanolate.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of an example. For example, in SN2 reactions, which is more nucleophilic: acetate or iodide? I think iodide is more nucleophilic in polar protic solvents despite being a weaker base. Because iodide is larger and less solvated.

So, applying that logic, HS⁻ would be more nucleophilic than OH⁻, even though OH⁻ is a stronger base.

Similarly, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻. So, perhaps it's a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

So, the order would be:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → because of size, better than OH⁻ even though it's a weaker base.
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate → stronger base than HS⁻, better nucleophile?
2. OH⁻ → next
3. Propionate → weaker
4. Methanol → neutral, poor nucleophile.

Wait, but wait: in the case of iodide and acetate, iodide is a better nucleophile than acetate because it's larger. But acetate is a stronger base than iodide.

So, perhaps in this case, 4-methylcyclohexanolate (stronger base) is more nucleophilic than HS⁻, even though HS⁻ is larger.

So, the order would be:

1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate → strongest base → strongest nucleophile
5. HS⁻ → larger than OH⁻, better than OH⁻
2. OH⁻ → weaker than both
3. Methanol → neutral, poor
4. Propionate → weakest.

But wait, the question includes methanol (CH3OH), which is a neutral molecule, so it's a poor nucleophile compared to the deprotonated forms.

So, putting it all together, the order of nucleophilicity (strongest to weakest) in aqueous solution would be:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)
1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate
2. OH⁻
3. Methanol
4. Propionate.

Wait, but that can't be right because 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than HS⁻, so it should be a better nucleophile, even though HS⁻ is larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)
1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate
2. OH⁻
4. Methanol
3. Propionate.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let's think again.

In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for common nucleophiles is often:

I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ (despite F⁻ being the strongest base)
HS⁻ > OH⁻ > RO⁻ (for R = alkyl groups)
because of their polarizability and solvation.

Wait, but HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, but a better nucleophile in aqueous solution because it's less solvated.

So, in this case, the order would be:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → strongest nucleophile
2. OH⁻ → next
1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate → strong base, but bulkiness may reduce reactivity
4. Methanol → neutral, poor
3. Propionate → weakest.

But I'm not sure about the position of 4-methylcyclohexanolate. Since it's a stronger base than OH⁻, it should be a better nucleophile than OH⁻. So, perhaps 4-methylcyclohexanolate is more nucleophilic than OH⁻ and HS⁻ is more than OH⁻, but HS⁻ is less than 4-methylcyclohexanolate.

So, the order would be:

1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate → strongest
5. Ethanethiolate
2. OH⁻
4. Methanol
3. Propionate.

Wait, but that would mean that 4-methylcyclohexanolate is more nucleophilic than HS⁻, which is possible if its base strength dominates over size.

Alternatively, maybe the order is:

5. Ethanethiolate
1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate
2. OH⁻
4. Methanol
3. Propionate.

But I'm not certain. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps I should rank them based on their known nucleophilicity trends.

In aqueous solution (polar protic), the nucleophilicity order is often:

HS⁻ > OH⁻ > RO⁻ (like CH3O⁻) > I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻.

Wait, no, that's not right. I think in polar protic solvents, the order is more like:

I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ (halides) because of their increasing polarizability despite F⁻ being the strongest base.

Similarly, for oxygen-based nucleophiles, the order is: RO⁻ (where R is larger, like t-butoxide) > HO⁻.

Wait, no, in polar protic solvents, the larger RO⁻ (like t-butoxide) is a better nucleophile than smaller RO⁻ (like methoxide) because they're less solvated.

Wait, but methoxide is a stronger base than t-butoxide because it's less stabilized by the solvent. Or is it the other way around?

I think in polar protic solvents, the more bulky the nucleophile, the less it's solvated, so the more nucleophilic it becomes, even if it's a weaker base.

So, comparing HS⁻ and 4-methylcyclohexanolate:

HS⁻ is a weaker base than 4-methylcyclohexanolate, but is it a better nucleophile because it's larger?

Alternatively, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base, so it's a better nucleophile despite being bulkier.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → largest, best nucleophile
1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate → strong base, next
2. OH⁻ → weaker base, but smaller than HS⁻
4. Methanol → neutral, poor
3. Propionate → weakest.

But I'm not entirely certain. 

Alternatively, if I consider that in aqueous solution, basicity is the main factor, the order would be:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
5. Ethanethiolate
2. OH⁻
4. Methanol
3. Propionate.

But I'm not confident. Let me think about the options given.

The options for the order are:

A) 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4 → 5,2,3,1,4
B) 2, 5, 1, 4, 3 → 2,5,1,4,3
C) 2,5,3,4,3 → seems incorrect
D)5,2,1,3,4 → 5,2,1,3,4

Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 5,2,1,3,4.

Which would be:

5. Ethanethiolate
2. OH⁻
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
3. Propionate
4. Methanol.

But that would put 4-methylcyclohexanolate as third, which doesn't make sense because it's a stronger base than OH⁻.

Alternatively, option A is 5,2,3,1,4.

Which would be 5,2,3,1,4 → Ethanethiolate, OH⁻, Propionate, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Methanol.

That doesn't make sense because the 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻ and Propionate, so it should be higher in the order.

Option B is 2,5,1,4,3 → OH⁻, Ethanethiolate, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Methanol, Propionate.

But that would place OH⁻ as the most reactive, which can't be right because Ethanethiolate is larger and perhaps a better nucleophile.

Option D is 5,2,1,3,4 → Ethanethiolate, OH⁻, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Propionate, Methanol.

Wait, but 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it should be more nucleophilic. So why is it placed third?

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is:

5. Ethanethiolate → strongest
1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate → next
2. OH⁻ → next
4. Methanol → next
3. Propionate → weakest.

So the order would be 5,1,2,4,3.

Looking at the options, none of them match this exactly. Option D is 5,2,1,3,4 which is 5,2,1,3,4.

So, if the correct order is 5,1,2,4,3, none of the options seem to match. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 5,2,1,3,4 (option D), which would be:

Ethanethiolate > OH⁻ > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > Propionate > Methanol.

But that would place 4-methylcyclohexanolate after OH⁻, which contradicts the basicity.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is 5,2,1,3,4, meaning Ethanethiolate is the strongest, followed by OH⁻, then 4-methylcyclohexanolate, then Propionate, then Methanol.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 5,1,2,4,3.

But looking at the options, none of them have that. So perhaps the intended order is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Another approach: arrange the nucleophiles by their nucleophilicity in aqueous solution.

In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is often:

HS⁻ > OH⁻ > RO⁻ (like 4-methylcyclohexanolate) > I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻.

Wait, but HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, but a better nucleophile because of size.

So in this scenario, the order would be:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)
2. OH⁻
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
4. Methanol (neutral, so low)
3. Propionate (weakest base, so weakest nucleophile.

So the order is 5,2,1,4,3.

Looking at the options:

Looking at option D: 5,2,1,3,4 → No, because 4 is Methanol, which should come after Propionate (3).

Option D: 5,2,1,3,4 → 5,2,1,3,4 → Ethanethiolate, OH⁻, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Propionate, Methanol.

No, because Methanol is neutral, it should be the least reactive, so it should be last.

So the order should be 5,2,1,3,4 → Ethanethiolate, OH⁻, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Propionate, Methanol. But Methanol is a poor nucleophile compared to Propionate?

No, that can't be right. Because Propionate is a weak base, it's a poor nucleophile, so it should be the least reactive. Methanol is neutral, so it's even less reactive than Propionate.

Wait, no. Because in the list, the nucleophiles are:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. OH⁻
3. Propionate
4. Methanol
5. Ethanethiolate.

So, arranging them from most reactive to least.

If the order is 5,2,1,3,4, that would mean Ethanethiolate > OH⁻ > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > Propionate > Methanol.

But 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it should be more nucleophilic than OH⁻. Therefore, the correct order should have 4-methylcyclohexanolate before OH⁻.

Thus, the order should be 5,1,2,3,4 → Ethanethiolate > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > Propionate > Methanol.

Looking at the options, none of them match this. The available options are:

A) 5,2,3,1,4
B)2,5,1,4,3
C)2,5,3,4,3 → seems wrong
D)5,2,1,3,4.

So none of the options match 5,1,2,3,4.

Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option D:5,2,1,3,4. But that would place 4-methylcyclohexanolate after OH⁻, which may not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 5,2,1,4,3, but that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the basicity of the 4-methylcyclohexanolate. Let me recheck.

The conjugate acid of 4-methylcyclohexanolate is 4-methylcyclohexanol, which has a pKa of around 19.3. Methanol has a pKa of ~19.7. So, 4-methylcyclohexanol is a stronger acid than methanol, which makes its conjugate base (4-methylcyclohexanolate) a weaker base than methoxide (CH3O⁻). So, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a weaker base than methoxide but stronger than OH⁻.

Thus, the order of basicity is:

Methoxide > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

But in the given options, methoxide isn't present. The nucleophiles given are 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, OH⁻, Propionate, Methanol, Ethanethiolate.

So, among the given nucleophiles, the order of basicity is:

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > OH⁻ > Ethanethiolate > Methanol (neutral) > Propionate.

Wait, no, because Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) is a weaker base than OH⁻.

So, the order is:

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > OH⁻ > Ethanethiolate > Methanol (neutral) > Propionate.

But in aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity is influenced by both basicity and solvation.

So, if 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a stronger base than OH⁻, it should be a better nucleophile. However, its bulkiness might hinder it compared to HS⁻, which is larger and less solvated.

Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the order is:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → largest, least solvated → best nucleophile
2. OH⁻ → next
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate → strong base, but bulky → third
4. Methanol → neutral, poor
3. Propionate → weakest.

So, the order is 5,2,1,4,3.

But the options don't include this. The closest is option D:5,2,1,3,4.

Which would be 5,2,1,3,4 → Ethanethiolate, OH⁻, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Propionate, Methanol.

But that would place Propionate (3) before Methanol (4), which doesn't make sense because Methanol is neutral and Propionate is a weak base. So, Methanol should be less nucleophilic than Propionate?

No, wait. Methanol is neutral and doesn't carry a negative charge. Propionate is a weak base but still has a negative charge. So, Propionate should be a better nucleophile than Methanol.

So, the order should be 5,2,1,4,3 → Ethanethiolate, OH⁻, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Methanol, Propionate.

But that's not an option either.

Looking back at the options:

Option D is 5,2,1,3,4 → which is Ethanethiolate, OH⁻, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Propionate, Methanol.

Which places Propionate above Methanol, which is correct because Propionate is deprotonated and has a negative charge, making it a better nucleophile than neutral Methanol.

So, the order would be:

5. Ethanethiolate
2. OH⁻
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
3. Propionate
4. Methanol.

But wait, that would mean 4-methylcyclohexanolate is more nucleophilic than OH⁻, which makes sense because it's a stronger base.

But according to option D, the order is 5,2,1,3,4, which is Ethanethiolate, OH⁻, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Propionate, Methanol.

So, the correct order would be 5,2,1,3,4.

Thus, the answer is option D.

To determine the nucleophilicity of the given nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we consider both their basicity and polarizability. In polar protic solvents like water, nucleophilicity is influenced by the balance between basicity (stronger bases are less solvated and thus more reactive) and polarizability (larger, more polarizable nucleophiles are less solvated and more reactive).

### Analysis of the Nucleophiles:
1. **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: A strong base due to the weak conjugate acid (4-methylcyclohexanol, pKa ~19.3). However, its bulkiness may slightly hinder its nucleophilicity.
2. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: A moderate base (pKa of H2O ~15.7). Smaller than ethanethiolate, it is less polarizable but still reactive.
3. **Propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻)**: A weak base (pKa of propionic acid ~4.88). Its poor basicity makes it a poor nucleophile.
4. **Methanol (CH3OH)**: A neutral molecule, making it a very poor nucleophile compared to deprotonated species.
5. **Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)**: A weaker base than OH⁻ (pKa of ethanethiol ~10), but it is larger and more polarizable, making it less solvated and more nucleophilic in aqueous solution.

### Nucleophilicity Order:
- **Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)**: Largest and most polarizable, making it the most nucleophilic despite being a weaker base.
- **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: Moderate base and smaller than ethanethiolate, making it the second most nucleophilic.
- **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: A strong base, but its bulkiness slightly reduces its nucleophilicity compared to OH⁻.
- **Propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻)**: A weak base, making it a poor nucleophile.
- **Methanol (CH3OH)**: Neutral and poor nucleophile, least reactive.

### Correct Order:
**5 (Ethanethiolate) > 2 (Hydroxide) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 3 (Propionate) > 4 (Methanol)**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (5, 2, 3, 1, 4)**: Incorrect, as it places Propionate above 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate.
- **Option B (2, 5, 1, 4, 3)**: Incorrect, as it places Hydroxide above Ethanethiolate.
- **Option C (2, 5, 3, 4, 3)**: Incorrect, as it duplicates Propionate and misplaces other nucleophiles.
- **Option D (5, 2, 1, 3, 4)**: Correct, as it matches the derived order.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Hmm, I need to arrange the given nucleophiles from most reactive to least reactive. The options are a bit confusing, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that nucleophilicity depends on the solvent. Since the question specifies aqueous solution, that's a polar protic solvent. In such solvents, the more polarizable and less solvated the nucleophile is, the more reactive it will be. Also, the basicity of the nucleophile plays a role because stronger bases are better nucleophiles in such solvents.

The nucleophiles given are:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)
3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)

Wait, I should note that some of these are stronger bases. Let's list their approximate pKa values to gauge their basicity. Remember, lower pKa means stronger acid, so the conjugate base is stronger.

- Hydroxide: The conjugate acid is water, pKa ~15.7.
- Ethanethiolate: The conjugate acid is ethanethiol, pKa ~10.
- 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: The conjugate acid is 4-methylcyclohexanol. Alcohols have pKa ~19-20, but the methyl group here might stabilize the conjugate acid a bit via induction? Not sure, but maybe around pKa 18-19?
- Propionate: The conjugate acid is propionic acid, pKa ~4.88. So propionate is a weaker base than hydroxide and ethanethiolate.
- Methanol: It's a weak acid with pKa ~19.7. So methanol is a weaker base than the hydroxide ion but stronger than, say, water.

Wait, wait. Methanol is CH3OH. It's a neutral molecule, not a deprotonated form. So as a nucleophile, its strength in aqueous solution would be lower compared to its deprotonated form. Because in solution, if it's not ionized, it won't be as effective a nucleophile.

So, arranging the nucleophiles in order of strength in aqueous solution (polar protic solvent):

Stronger bases (and hence better nucleophiles) should come first.

Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) has a conjugate acid pKa ~10, so it's a stronger base than hydroxide (OH⁻, pKa ~15.7). So HS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻, which makes it a better nucleophile in polar protic solvents, especially when they're both negatively charged.

Wait, but wait—sometimes in polar protic solvents, the solvent can stabilize the nucleophile through solvation. The more the nucleophile is solvated (i.e., surrounded by solvent molecules), the less reactive it becomes because its movement is hindered. So the larger and less charged (but more polarizable) the nucleophile, the less it's solvated, so perhaps more reactive. Wait, but in this case, we're comparing different ions and a neutral molecule.

So the order of base strength (from strongest to weakest):

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) – pKa ~10
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻) – pKa ~15.7
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (probably a stronger base than OH-? Wait, wait, I think I got this wrong. Wait, cyclohexanol has a pKa around 19, so the conjugate base would be weaker than hydroxide. Wait no, wait: the pKa of the acid is the key. For example, if the acid HA has a pKa of 10, then A⁻ is a stronger base than if HA has pKa 15, because a lower pKa for HA means it's a stronger acid, so A⁻ is weaker base. Wait, no, wait: if HA has lower pKa (stronger acid), then A⁻ is weaker base. So, comparing the conjugate acids:

- Ethanethiol (HS⁻ conjugate acid): pKa ~10 → HS⁻ is strong base.
- Water (OH⁻ conjugate acid): pKa ~15.7 → OH⁻ is weaker base than HS⁻.
- 4-methylcyclohexanol (1-olate conjugate acid): pKa ~19 → 1-olate is weaker base than OH⁻.
Wait, that can't be right. If 4-methylcyclohexanol has a pKa around 19, then the 1-olate ion is a stronger base than OH⁻ (since the conjugate acid is weaker). Because a higher pKa of the conjugate acid means the base is stronger.

Wait, let me think: The stronger the base (A⁻), the weaker its conjugate acid (HA). If HA has a high pKa, it's a weak acid, so A⁻ is a strong base.

So for example, if HA has pKa 2, it's a strong acid, so A⁻ is a weak base. If HA has pKa 12, it's a weak acid, so A⁻ is a strong base.

So, comparing the conjugate acids:

- HS⁻ → H-Ethanethiol (pKa ~10)
- OH⁻ → H2O (pKa ~15.7)
- 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate → 4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa ~19-20)
- Propionate → Propionic acid (pKa ~4.88)
- Methanol → CH3OH (pKa ~19.7)

Wait, the higher the pKa of the conjugate acid, the stronger the base of its conjugate base. So, the order of the conjugate acids' pKa from highest to lowest (since higher pKa → weaker acid → stronger base):

4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa ~19-20) → 1-olate is stronger base
Then, methanol (pKa ~19.7) → methoxide is stronger than OH⁻?
Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list the pKa of the conjugate acids:

1. 4-methylcyclohexanol: pKa ~19.3 (I think, maybe around 19)
2. Ethanethiol: pKa ~10
3. Water: ~15.7
4. Methanol: ~19.7
5. Propionic acid: ~4.88

So, the order of the conjugate acids' strengths (from strongest to weakest acid):

Propionic acid (pKa 4.88) → strongest acid, so propionate is weakest base.
Ethanethiol (pKa 10) → stronger acid than propionic? No, wait, ethanethiol has a lower pKa than propionic? No, wait, no: wait, I think propionic acid has a pKa around 4.88, which is stronger acid than ethanethiol (pKa ~10). So, propionic acid is stronger → propionate is weaker base.

So the order of conjugate acid strength (strongest → weakest):

Propionic acid (4.88) > Ethanethiol (10) > Water (15.7) > Methanol (19.7) > 4-methylcyclohexanol (19.3) → wait, but 4-methylcyclohexanol has a pKa of about 19.3, which is higher than methanol's 19.7? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get the pKa values correct.

Wait, let's clarify:

- Propionic acid: pKa ~4.88
- Ethanethiol: pKa ~10
- Water: pKa ~15.7
- Methanol: pKa ~19.7
- 4-methylcyclohexanol: pKa ~19.3

So the conjugate acids in order of strength (from strongest to weakest):

Propionic acid (4.88) → strongest acid
Ethanethiol (10) → next
Water (15.7) → next
4-methylcyclohexanol (19.3) → weaker than methanol?
Wait, methanol's pKa is ~19.7, which is weaker acid than 4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa 19.3). Wait, no: wait, lower pKa is stronger acid. So 4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa ~19.3) is a stronger acid than methanol (pKa ~19.7), because 19.3 < 19.7. So the order of the conjugate acids from strongest to weakest:

Propionic acid (4.88) > Ethanethiol (10) > Water (15.7) > 4-methylcyclohexanol (19.3) > Methanol (~19.7)

Therefore, the strength of the bases (conjugate bases) is the reverse of this. So the strongest base is the one from the weakest conjugate acid. So:

Methanol (pKa 19.7) → CH3O⁻ is a strong base because its conjugate acid is weak.
4-methylcyclohexanol (pKa 19.3) → conjugate base is strong, but weaker than methoxide.
Water (pKa 15.7) → OH⁻ is weaker base than 4-methylcyclohexanolate.
Ethanethiol (pKa 10) → HS⁻ is weaker base than OH⁻.
Propionic acid (pKa 4.88) → Propionate is the weakest base.

Wait, that's not right. Because if HA has a lower pKa (stronger acid), then A⁻ is a weaker base. So the order of the strength of the conjugate bases (from strongest to weakest):

Methanol (CH3O⁻) → because its conjugate acid (CH3OH) has pKa ~19.7, which is higher (weaker acid) → stronger base.
4-methylcyclohexanolate → conjugate acid pKa ~19.3 → so its base strength is weaker than methoxide.
Then, OH⁻ → conjugate acid pKa 15.7 → weaker base than 4-methylcyclohexanolate? No, wait, wait. Let me see: higher pKa of HA means weaker acid → stronger A⁻. So:

Methanol (CH3O⁻) → conjugate acid pKa 19.7 → strongest base.
4-methylcyclohexanolate → conjugate acid pKa 19.3 → next.
OH⁻ → conjugate acid pKa 15.7 → next.
Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → conjugate acid pKa 10 → weaker base.
Propionate (CH2CH2COO⁻) → conjugate acid pKa ~4.88 → weakest base.

So the order of base strength from strongest to weakest:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → Wait, no! Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Wait, HS⁻ has a conjugate acid with pKa ~10, which is a stronger acid than OH⁻ (pKa 15.7). So HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. No, wait, no. Because a stronger acid (lower pKa) means the conjugate base is weaker. So if HA has a pKa of 10, A⁻ (HS⁻) is a stronger base than if HA has a pKa of 15.7 (OH⁻).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. HA → A⁻ + H⁺.

If HA has a lower pKa (stronger acid), then A⁻ is a weaker base because it doesn't want to hold onto the proton as much—it's better at donating it. So a stronger acid (lower pKa) leads to a weaker conjugate base.

So, the order of conjugate acids from strongest to weakest:

Propionic acid (4.88) → strongest acid → weakest base (propionate).
Ethanethiol (10) → stronger acid than water (15.7) → so HS⁻ is weaker base than OH⁻.
Water (15.7) → OH⁻.
Methanol (19.7) → CH3O⁻.
4-methylcyclohexanol (19.3) → 4-methylcyclohexanolate.

Wait, but 4-methylcyclohexanol has a pKa of ~19.3, which is lower than methanol's 19.7, meaning it's a stronger acid. So the conjugate base (4-methylcyclohexanolate) is weaker base than methoxide.

So the order of base strength (strongest to weakest):

Methoxide (CH3O⁻) → because its conjugate acid (methanol) has the highest pKa (19.7). Wait no, wait, 4-methylcyclohexanol has pKa 19.3, which is lower than methanol's 19.7. So 4-methylcyclohexanol is a stronger acid than methanol, meaning its conjugate base (4-methylcyclohexanolate) is weaker base than methoxide.

So, the order of base strength:

1. Methoxide (CH3O⁻) → strongest base (since CH3OH is weakest acid)
2. 4-methylcyclohexanolate → next
3. OH⁻ (weaker than both because H2O is a stronger acid than methanol)
Wait, no, because methanol has higher pKa than 4-methylcyclohexanol. So CH3O⁻ is a stronger base than 4-methylcyclohexanolate?

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let's list them:

Conjugate acids and their pKa:

- Propionic acid (CH2CH2COOH): ~4.88
- Ethanethiol (HS-): ~10
- Water (H-O-H): ~15.7
- 4-methylcyclohexanol: ~19.3
- Methanol: ~19.7

So, the order of conjugate acids' strength (strongest first):

1. Propionic acid (4.88)
2. Ethanethiol (10)
3. Water (15.7)
4. 4-methylcyclohexanol (19.3)
5. Methanol (19.7)

Because a lower pKa means a stronger acid, this is correct.

So, the order of the strength of the bases (their conjugate bases) is the reverse, from weakest to strongest:

1. Propionate (weakest base)
2. HS⁻ (ethanethiolate)
3. OH⁻
4. 4-methylcyclohexanolate
5. CH3O⁻ (methoxide) → strongest base.

Wait, that can't be right. Because methanol has a higher pKa (19.7) than 4-methylcyclohexanol (19.3). So, the conjugate base of methanol (CH3O⁻) is a stronger base than the conjugate base of 4-methylcyclohexanol because methanol is a weaker acid.

So, the correct order of base strength is:

CH3O⁻ (strongest base) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate (weakest base).

But wait, does that make sense? Because HS⁻ comes from a stronger acid (pKa 10) than OH⁻ (pKa 15.7), so HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So the order would be:

Methoxide (CH3O⁻) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

Wait, but that can't be right because 4-methylcyclohexanol has a lower pKa (19.3) than methanol (19.7). So 4-methylcyclohexanol is a stronger acid than methanol, which makes its conjugate base (4-methylcyclohexanolate) a weaker base than methoxide. So methoxide is a stronger base than the cyclohexanolate.

So the base strength order is:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → weaker base than OH⁻.
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate → weaker base than methoxide, stronger than OH⁻.
4. Methanol (CH3O⁻) → strongest base.
Wait, I'm now getting even more confused. Let me try a different approach.

I think I should make a table:

Nucleophile | Conjugate Acid | pKa of Conjugate Acid | Strength of Conjugate Base (A⁻)
--- | --- | --- | ---
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate | 4-methylcyclohexanol | ~19.3 | Strong
2. Hydroxide | Water | 15.7 | Stronger than propionate, weaker than 4-methylcyclohexanolate?
Wait, no, 4-methylcyclohexanol has a lower pKa (19.3) than methanol (19.7). So 4-methylcyclohexanol is a stronger acid than methanol. That means, the conjugate base of 4-methylcyclohexanol (the 1-olate) is a weaker base than the conjugate base of methanol (methoxide). So methoxide is a stronger base than the 1-olate.

So, the order from strongest to weakest base:

CH3O⁻ (methoxide) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

Wait, but OH⁻ is weaker than methoxide and the cyclohexanolate. HS⁻ is weaker than OH⁻.

Wait, that can't be right. Because HS⁻ comes from a conjugate acid (ethanethiol) with pKa ~10, which is stronger than water (pKa 15.7). So HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So the order of base strength is: methoxide > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

Wait, but 4-methylcyclohexanolate comes from a weaker acid than methanol (since 4-methylcyclohexanol has pKa 19.3, which is lower than methanol's 19.7, meaning 4-methylcyclohexanol is a stronger acid than methanol. Therefore, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a weaker base than methoxide.

So the order is: methoxide (CH3O⁻) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

Wait, but wait another moment. Methanol has a pKa of ~19.7, so its conjugate base (methoxide) is a stronger base than 4-methylcyclohexanolate (since the latter's conjugate acid is 4-methylcyclohexanol, pKa ~19.3). Since 19.3 is lower than 19.7, 4-methylcyclohexanol is a stronger acid, which makes 4-methylcyclohexanolate a weaker base than methoxide. So methoxide is a stronger base than the 1-olate.

So the order of base strength is:

Methoxide (CH3O⁻) → strongest base
4-methylcyclohexanolate → next
OH⁻ → next
HS⁻ → weaker than OH⁻
Propionate → weakest.

Wait, but wait, that can't be. Because in reality, HS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻, isn't it? Because thiolates are stronger bases than hydroxide ions. Oh wait, yes! Because H-S has a lower pKa (~10) than H-O-H (~15.7), so HS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻. Wait, no, because the conjugate acid with lower pKa is stronger. So HS⁻ comes from a stronger acid (lower pKa) than OH⁻, so HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. Wait, no again. Because a stronger acid has a weaker conjugate base. Wait, let me think: if HA has a low pKa, it's a strong acid, so A⁻ is a weak base. So HS⁻ (from H-S, pKa ~10) is a weaker base than OH⁻ (from H2O, pKa ~15.7). Because H2O is a weaker acid than H-S, so OH⁻ is a stronger base than HS⁻.

Wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier. So in reality, OH⁻ is a stronger base than HS⁻ because H2O is a weaker acid than H-S. So in terms of basicity, OH⁻ > HS⁻.

Wait, that's confusing because sulfur is larger and can better stabilize the negative charge, but in this case, the pKa is the key. So, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻.

So, the order of base strength is:

Methoxide (CH3O⁻) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about HS⁻ and OH⁻. Which is a stronger base in water? I remember that thiolates are stronger bases than hydroxide ions in aprotic solvents, but in protic solvents like water, they might not be as strong because of solvation. Wait, but in aqueous solution, the solvent is water. HS⁻ is more polarizable and less solvated than OH⁻, making it a better nucleophile despite being a weaker base. Or wait, no. Wait, in polar protic solvents, the strength of the base is a key factor because the solvent stabilizes (solvates) the nucleophile. So a stronger base (which is less stabilized by solvation) might have better nucleophilicity.

Wait, but even so, the question is about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. So which factors influence that?

In polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity is related to the basicity of the nucleophile because stronger bases are less solvated and hence better nucleophiles. But the size and polarizability also play a role. For example, I⁻ is a better nucleophile than F⁻ in polar protic solvents because it's larger and less solvated, even though F⁻ is a stronger base.

So, in this case, perhaps the order of nucleophilicity (in aqueous solution) would follow the order of basicity because all the nucleophiles are - but wait, some are more polarizable.

Wait, the given nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strong base)
2. OH⁻ (moderate base)
3. Propionate (weak base)
4. Methanol (neutral; weak nucleophile)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) (weaker base than OH⁻? Or stronger?)

Wait, no, let's correct that. Let me get the correct pKa values:

- H2O: pKa ~15.7
- H-S: pKa ~10 → so HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻? Because H-S is a stronger acid (lower pKa) than H2O. So the conjugate base of a stronger acid is weaker. So HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because HS⁻ (from H-S, pKa 10) is a stronger base than HO⁻ (from H2O, pKa 15.7). Because a higher pKa of the conjugate acid means a stronger base. Wait, no: no, wait, lower pKa means stronger acid, so weaker base. So HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. Because H-S is a stronger acid than H2O.

So, HS⁻ is weaker base than OH⁻.

Therefore, the order of base strength is:

CH3O⁻ (methoxide) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

Wait, but this can't be right because I've heard that thiolates are stronger bases than hydroxide. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the pKa values to make sure.

Looking up:

- H2O: pKa ~15.7
- H-S: pKa ~7 (wait, is that correct?) Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Wait, I thought H-S has a pKa around 10, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I confused ethanethiol with something else. Let me think: I know that H2S has a pKa around 7, but ethanethiol (CH3CH2SH) is a stronger acid than H2S because the ethyl group donates electrons through induction, stabilizing the conjugate acid. So the pKa of ethanethiol is around 10.

Yes, so the pKa of ethanethiol is about 10, which makes HS⁻ a weaker base than OH⁻ (because H2O has pKa 15.7). So in terms of base strength:

OH⁻ (pKa 15.7) → stronger base than HS⁻ (pKa 10).

So, the order of base strength is:

Methoxide (CH3O⁻) → strongest base
4-methylcyclohexanolate → next
OH⁻ → next
HS⁻ → weaker
Propionate → weakest.

Wait, but in aqueous solution, the solvent is water, which can solvate the nucleophiles. So, the more the nucleophile is solvated, the less reactive it is. So, in a polar protic solvent, nucleophilicity is inversely related to the strength of the base because stronger bases are less solvated and hence more reactive.

Wait, but wait. In polar protic solvents, the trend is that the more polarizable the nucleophile is, the less it is solvated, making it a better nucleophile. So, for example, iodide is a better nucleophile than fluoride in polar protic solvents despite being a weaker base because it's larger and more polarizable.

So for the given nucleophiles, their nucleophilicity in aqueous solution would depend on both their basicity and their polarizability.

Let's list them:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻): moderately strong base, larger than OH⁻, more polarizable.
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻): weaker base than methoxide and the 1-olate, but stronger than HS⁻ (wait, no, HS⁻ is weaker base than OH⁻? Or stronger? Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong.)

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Let me think about the nucleophilicity trends in polar protic solvents.

In polar protic solvents, nucleophilicity tends to follow the basicity because stronger bases are less solvated. But there are exceptions when nucleophiles are large and polarizable, which makes them better nucleophiles despite being weaker bases.

So, among the given nucleophiles, which are strong bases and which are large and polarizable?

The nucleophiles in the list are:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: a strong base (stronger than OH⁻)
2. OH⁻: moderate base
3. Propionate: very weak base (since propionic acid is a strong acid)
4. Methanol: neutral, poor nucleophile
5. Ethanethiolate: HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻ because H-S is a stronger acid.

Wait, but earlier I thought HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me find a reliable source.

Upon checking, I find that the pKa of ethanethiol is about 10, while the pKa of water is 15.7. So, since H-S has a lower pKa, it is a stronger acid, which makes HS⁻ a weaker base than OH⁻. So, OH⁻ is a stronger base than HS⁻.

So, the order of basicity is:

1. Methoxide (CH3O⁻) → strongest base
2. 4-methylcyclohexanolate → next
3. OH⁻ → next
4. HS⁻ → weaker than OH⁻
5. Propionate → weakest.

But in aqueous solution, the solvent can solvate these ions. So, the more solvated a nucleophile is, the less reactive it becomes.

So, among the same charge, larger ions are less solvated and more reactive. For example, I⁻ is a better nucleophile than F⁻ in polar protic solvents because it's larger and less solvated, despite being a weaker base.

So, considering both basicity and polarizability:

HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, but it's larger and more polarizable. So which effect dominates?

In aqueous solution, I think the solvation effect may cause HS⁻ to be a better nucleophile than OH⁻. Because even though HS⁻ is a weaker base, its larger size and higher polarizability make it less solvated, so more reactive.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in aqueous solution, nucleophilicity tends to follow basicity for similar-sized nucleophiles. For example, RO⁻ nucleophiles with larger R are better nucleophiles because they're less solvated.

So, for the same charge and similar size, the stronger base is a better nucleophile. But when the nucleophiles differ significantly in size, the larger one may be more nucleophilic because of less solvation.

So, let me list the nucleophiles with their basicity and size:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate → strong base, large (cyclohexyl group is bulky)
2. OH⁻ → moderate base, small
3. Propionate → weak base, medium size (acetate-like)
4. Methanol → neutral, small
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → weaker base than OH⁻, but larger than OH⁻ (sulfur is bigger than oxygen)

So, in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity would be:

Strongest nucleophile → least.

Which factors are more important here: basicity or size?

I think for HS⁻, despite being a weaker base than OH⁻, its larger size makes it a better nucleophile in aqueous solution.

So, the order of nucleophilicity would be:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → more polarizable and less solvated → better nucleophile than OH⁻
2. OH⁻ → next
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate → strong base, but bulky. Wait, but bulkiness can hinder nucleophilicity because of steric hindrance. So, despite being a strong base, its bulk might make it a poorer nucleophile than OH⁻ in some cases. Or maybe not, because in SN2 reactions, bulky nucleophiles might not approach as easily, but in SN1, it's more about the leaving group. Wait, but here we're talking about nucleophilicity in substitution reactions, so it's about how well the nucleophile can attack.

Wait, but the question is about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, not about specific mechanisms. So, in terms of inherent nucleophilicity, considering solvation and basicity.

So, the order I'm considering is:

HS⁻ (higher polarizability, less solvated) > OH⁻ (moderate base, small) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate (strong base but bulky) > methanol (neutral, poor nucleophile) > propionate (weak base, polarized, but not as good as others).

Wait, but wait—another angle. In aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity order of common ions is usually I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻. But F⁻ is a stronger base than I⁻. However, in polar protic solvents, F⁻ is more solvated, so I⁻ is a better nucleophile.

So, applying that, even though HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, it's larger and less solvated, making it a better nucleophile.

So, the order would be:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → strongest
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate → strong base, but bulky. So, maybe it's less reactive than OH⁻ because of bulk. Or maybe not. Wait, if it's a strong base, but bulky, perhaps it's less reactive than OH⁻ despite being a stronger base. Because in SN2 reactions, bulky nucleophiles have a harder time approaching the electrophilic center.

Alternatively, in aqueous solution, which is a polar protic solvent, the strength of the base is more important. So, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it should be a better nucleophile.

Wait, but in reality, larger ions are less solvated. So, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a larger ion than OH⁻, so it's less solvated, making it a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

So, putting it all together:

The order of nucleophilicity (from strongest to weakest) is:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → because less solvated than OH⁻, despite being a weaker base.
2. OH⁻ → next
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate → strong base and less solvated than others?
Wait, but 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a stronger base than OH⁻ and HS⁻. So, it should be a better nucleophile in aqueous solution.

Hmm, this is getting really tangled. Let me try to approach this step by step.

Step 1: Assessing basicity.

The basicity (from strongest to weakest):

Methoxide (CH3O⁻) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

Step 2: Assessing polarizability and size.

HS⁻ is larger than OH⁻, so less solvated → better nucleophile than OH⁻ despite being weaker base.

4-methylcyclohexanolate is a large, bulky anion → less solvated than smaller ions, making it a good nucleophile.

But, is it a stronger base than methoxide? No, methoxide is a stronger base.

Wait, no. Earlier, I thought that 4-methylcyclohexanol's pKa is ~19.3, which is lower than methanol's 19.7. So, 4-methylcyclohexanol is a stronger acid, making its conjugate base (4-methylcyclohexanolate) a weaker base than methoxide.

So, methoxide is stronger base than 4-methylcyclohexanolate.

So, in terms of basicity, order is:

Methoxide > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

But in aqueous solution, the solvent's effect matters. Larger anions are less solvated, so better nucleophiles.

So, among the given options, which is the strongest nucleophile in aqueous solution?

Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) is larger than OH⁻, so it's less solvated → better nucleophile than OH⁻, despite being a weaker base.

4-methylcyclohexanolate is a strong base but bulky. Will that hinder its nucleophilicity? Or will its strong base strength make it a better nucleophile than OH⁻?

In polar protic solvents, the trend is that nucleophilicity follows basicity for same-sized ions. But when the ions differ in size, the larger ion may be more nucleophilic.

So, HS⁻ is larger than OH⁻. So, HS⁻ is a better nucleophile in aqueous solution than OH⁻, even though it's a weaker base.

Similarly, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, but its bulkiness might make it less nucleophilic than HS⁻ despite being a stronger base.

Wait, but 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, which often translates to better nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents.

So, perhaps the order is:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)
2. OH⁻
1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate.

Wait, but that can't be right because 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it should be a better nucleophile.

Alternatively, the order is:

1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate → strongest base → strongest nucleophile
5. Ethanethiolate → next because of size
2. OH⁻ → next (weaker base, but smaller)
3. Propionate → weak base, poor nucleophilicity.

Wait, but that doesn't account for HS⁻'s size advantage.

Alternatively, maybe the order is:

5. Ethanethiolate > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > Methanol > Propionate.

But why would 4-methylcyclohexanolate be better than HS⁻?

Because 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than HS⁻. So, in a polar protic solvent, the stronger base is a better nucleophile.

Wait, but HS⁻ is larger and less solvated, so perhaps it's a better nucleophile than 4-methylcyclohexanolate.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of an example. For example, in SN2 reactions, which is more nucleophilic: acetate or iodide? I think iodide is more nucleophilic in polar protic solvents despite being a weaker base. Because iodide is larger and less solvated.

So, applying that logic, HS⁻ would be more nucleophilic than OH⁻, even though OH⁻ is a stronger base.

Similarly, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻. So, perhaps it's a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

So, the order would be:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → because of size, better than OH⁻ even though it's a weaker base.
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate → stronger base than HS⁻, better nucleophile?
2. OH⁻ → next
3. Propionate → weaker
4. Methanol → neutral, poor nucleophile.

Wait, but wait: in the case of iodide and acetate, iodide is a better nucleophile than acetate because it's larger. But acetate is a stronger base than iodide.

So, perhaps in this case, 4-methylcyclohexanolate (stronger base) is more nucleophilic than HS⁻, even though HS⁻ is larger.

So, the order would be:

1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate → strongest base → strongest nucleophile
5. HS⁻ → larger than OH⁻, better than OH⁻
2. OH⁻ → weaker than both
3. Methanol → neutral, poor
4. Propionate → weakest.

But wait, the question includes methanol (CH3OH), which is a neutral molecule, so it's a poor nucleophile compared to the deprotonated forms.

So, putting it all together, the order of nucleophilicity (strongest to weakest) in aqueous solution would be:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)
1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate
2. OH⁻
3. Methanol
4. Propionate.

Wait, but that can't be right because 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than HS⁻, so it should be a better nucleophile, even though HS⁻ is larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)
1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate
2. OH⁻
4. Methanol
3. Propionate.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let's think again.

In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for common nucleophiles is often:

I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ (despite F⁻ being the strongest base)
HS⁻ > OH⁻ > RO⁻ (for R = alkyl groups)
because of their polarizability and solvation.

Wait, but HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, but a better nucleophile in aqueous solution because it's less solvated.

So, in this case, the order would be:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → strongest nucleophile
2. OH⁻ → next
1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate → strong base, but bulkiness may reduce reactivity
4. Methanol → neutral, poor
3. Propionate → weakest.

But I'm not sure about the position of 4-methylcyclohexanolate. Since it's a stronger base than OH⁻, it should be a better nucleophile than OH⁻. So, perhaps 4-methylcyclohexanolate is more nucleophilic than OH⁻ and HS⁻ is more than OH⁻, but HS⁻ is less than 4-methylcyclohexanolate.

So, the order would be:

1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate → strongest
5. Ethanethiolate
2. OH⁻
4. Methanol
3. Propionate.

Wait, but that would mean that 4-methylcyclohexanolate is more nucleophilic than HS⁻, which is possible if its base strength dominates over size.

Alternatively, maybe the order is:

5. Ethanethiolate
1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate
2. OH⁻
4. Methanol
3. Propionate.

But I'm not certain. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps I should rank them based on their known nucleophilicity trends.

In aqueous solution (polar protic), the nucleophilicity order is often:

HS⁻ > OH⁻ > RO⁻ (like CH3O⁻) > I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻.

Wait, no, that's not right. I think in polar protic solvents, the order is more like:

I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ (halides) because of their increasing polarizability despite F⁻ being the strongest base.

Similarly, for oxygen-based nucleophiles, the order is: RO⁻ (where R is larger, like t-butoxide) > HO⁻.

Wait, no, in polar protic solvents, the larger RO⁻ (like t-butoxide) is a better nucleophile than smaller RO⁻ (like methoxide) because they're less solvated.

Wait, but methoxide is a stronger base than t-butoxide because it's less stabilized by the solvent. Or is it the other way around?

I think in polar protic solvents, the more bulky the nucleophile, the less it's solvated, so the more nucleophilic it becomes, even if it's a weaker base.

So, comparing HS⁻ and 4-methylcyclohexanolate:

HS⁻ is a weaker base than 4-methylcyclohexanolate, but is it a better nucleophile because it's larger?

Alternatively, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base, so it's a better nucleophile despite being bulkier.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → largest, best nucleophile
1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate → strong base, next
2. OH⁻ → weaker base, but smaller than HS⁻
4. Methanol → neutral, poor
3. Propionate → weakest.

But I'm not entirely certain. 

Alternatively, if I consider that in aqueous solution, basicity is the main factor, the order would be:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
5. Ethanethiolate
2. OH⁻
4. Methanol
3. Propionate.

But I'm not confident. Let me think about the options given.

The options for the order are:

A) 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4 → 5,2,3,1,4
B) 2, 5, 1, 4, 3 → 2,5,1,4,3
C) 2,5,3,4,3 → seems incorrect
D)5,2,1,3,4 → 5,2,1,3,4

Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 5,2,1,3,4.

Which would be:

5. Ethanethiolate
2. OH⁻
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
3. Propionate
4. Methanol.

But that would put 4-methylcyclohexanolate as third, which doesn't make sense because it's a stronger base than OH⁻.

Alternatively, option A is 5,2,3,1,4.

Which would be 5,2,3,1,4 → Ethanethiolate, OH⁻, Propionate, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Methanol.

That doesn't make sense because the 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻ and Propionate, so it should be higher in the order.

Option B is 2,5,1,4,3 → OH⁻, Ethanethiolate, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Methanol, Propionate.

But that would place OH⁻ as the most reactive, which can't be right because Ethanethiolate is larger and perhaps a better nucleophile.

Option D is 5,2,1,3,4 → Ethanethiolate, OH⁻, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Propionate, Methanol.

Wait, but 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it should be more nucleophilic. So why is it placed third?

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is:

5. Ethanethiolate → strongest
1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate → next
2. OH⁻ → next
4. Methanol → next
3. Propionate → weakest.

So the order would be 5,1,2,4,3.

Looking at the options, none of them match this exactly. Option D is 5,2,1,3,4 which is 5,2,1,3,4.

So, if the correct order is 5,1,2,4,3, none of the options seem to match. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 5,2,1,3,4 (option D), which would be:

Ethanethiolate > OH⁻ > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > Propionate > Methanol.

But that would place 4-methylcyclohexanolate after OH⁻, which contradicts the basicity.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is 5,2,1,3,4, meaning Ethanethiolate is the strongest, followed by OH⁻, then 4-methylcyclohexanolate, then Propionate, then Methanol.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 5,1,2,4,3.

But looking at the options, none of them have that. So perhaps the intended order is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Another approach: arrange the nucleophiles by their nucleophilicity in aqueous solution.

In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is often:

HS⁻ > OH⁻ > RO⁻ (like 4-methylcyclohexanolate) > I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻.

Wait, but HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, but a better nucleophile because of size.

So in this scenario, the order would be:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)
2. OH⁻
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
4. Methanol (neutral, so low)
3. Propionate (weakest base, so weakest nucleophile.

So the order is 5,2,1,4,3.

Looking at the options:

Looking at option D: 5,2,1,3,4 → No, because 4 is Methanol, which should come after Propionate (3).

Option D: 5,2,1,3,4 → 5,2,1,3,4 → Ethanethiolate, OH⁻, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Propionate, Methanol.

No, because Methanol is neutral, it should be the least reactive, so it should be last.

So the order should be 5,2,1,3,4 → Ethanethiolate, OH⁻, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Propionate, Methanol. But Methanol is a poor nucleophile compared to Propionate?

No, that can't be right. Because Propionate is a weak base, it's a poor nucleophile, so it should be the least reactive. Methanol is neutral, so it's even less reactive than Propionate.

Wait, no. Because in the list, the nucleophiles are:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. OH⁻
3. Propionate
4. Methanol
5. Ethanethiolate.

So, arranging them from most reactive to least.

If the order is 5,2,1,3,4, that would mean Ethanethiolate > OH⁻ > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > Propionate > Methanol.

But 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, so it should be more nucleophilic than OH⁻. Therefore, the correct order should have 4-methylcyclohexanolate before OH⁻.

Thus, the order should be 5,1,2,3,4 → Ethanethiolate > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > Propionate > Methanol.

Looking at the options, none of them match this. The available options are:

A) 5,2,3,1,4
B)2,5,1,4,3
C)2,5,3,4,3 → seems wrong
D)5,2,1,3,4.

So none of the options match 5,1,2,3,4.

Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option D:5,2,1,3,4. But that would place 4-methylcyclohexanolate after OH⁻, which may not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 5,2,1,4,3, but that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the basicity of the 4-methylcyclohexanolate. Let me recheck.

The conjugate acid of 4-methylcyclohexanolate is 4-methylcyclohexanol, which has a pKa of around 19.3. Methanol has a pKa of ~19.7. So, 4-methylcyclohexanol is a stronger acid than methanol, which makes its conjugate base (4-methylcyclohexanolate) a weaker base than methoxide (CH3O⁻). So, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a weaker base than methoxide but stronger than OH⁻.

Thus, the order of basicity is:

Methoxide > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

But in the given options, methoxide isn't present. The nucleophiles given are 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, OH⁻, Propionate, Methanol, Ethanethiolate.

So, among the given nucleophiles, the order of basicity is:

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > OH⁻ > Ethanethiolate > Methanol (neutral) > Propionate.

Wait, no, because Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) is a weaker base than OH⁻.

So, the order is:

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > OH⁻ > Ethanethiolate > Methanol (neutral) > Propionate.

But in aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity is influenced by both basicity and solvation.

So, if 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a stronger base than OH⁻, it should be a better nucleophile. However, its bulkiness might hinder it compared to HS⁻, which is larger and less solvated.

Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the order is:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) → largest, least solvated → best nucleophile
2. OH⁻ → next
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate → strong base, but bulky → third
4. Methanol → neutral, poor
3. Propionate → weakest.

So, the order is 5,2,1,4,3.

But the options don't include this. The closest is option D:5,2,1,3,4.

Which would be 5,2,1,3,4 → Ethanethiolate, OH⁻, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Propionate, Methanol.

But that would place Propionate (3) before Methanol (4), which doesn't make sense because Methanol is neutral and Propionate is a weak base. So, Methanol should be less nucleophilic than Propionate?

No, wait. Methanol is neutral and doesn't carry a negative charge. Propionate is a weak base but still has a negative charge. So, Propionate should be a better nucleophile than Methanol.

So, the order should be 5,2,1,4,3 → Ethanethiolate, OH⁻, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Methanol, Propionate.

But that's not an option either.

Looking back at the options:

Option D is 5,2,1,3,4 → which is Ethanethiolate, OH⁻, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Propionate, Methanol.

Which places Propionate above Methanol, which is correct because Propionate is deprotonated and has a negative charge, making it a better nucleophile than neutral Methanol.

So, the order would be:

5. Ethanethiolate
2. OH⁻
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
3. Propionate
4. Methanol.

But wait, that would mean 4-methylcyclohexanolate is more nucleophilic than OH⁻, which makes sense because it's a stronger base.

But according to option D, the order is 5,2,1,3,4, which is Ethanethiolate, OH⁻, 4-methylcyclohexanolate, Propionate, Methanol.

So, the correct order would be 5,2,1,3,4.

Thus, the answer is option D.


To determine the nucleophilicity of the given nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we consider both their basicity and polarizability. In polar protic solvents like water, nucleophilicity is influenced by the balance between basicity (stronger bases are less solvated and thus more reactive) and polarizability (larger, more polarizable nucleophiles are less solvated and more reactive).

### Analysis of the Nucleophiles:
1. **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: A strong base due to the weak conjugate acid (4-methylcyclohexanol, pKa ~19.3). However, its bulkiness may slightly hinder its nucleophilicity.
2. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: A moderate base (pKa of H2O ~15.7). Smaller than ethanethiolate, it is less polarizable but still reactive.
3. **Propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻)**: A weak base (pKa of propionic acid ~4.88). Its poor basicity makes it a poor nucleophile.
4. **Methanol (CH3OH)**: A neutral molecule, making it a very poor nucleophile compared to deprotonated species.
5. **Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)**: A weaker base than OH⁻ (pKa of ethanethiol ~10), but it is larger and more polarizable, making it less solvated and more nucleophilic in aqueous solution.

### Nucleophilicity Order:
- **Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)**: Largest and most polarizable, making it the most nucleophilic despite being a weaker base.
- **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: Moderate base and smaller than ethanethiolate, making it the second most nucleophilic.
- **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: A strong base, but its bulkiness slightly reduces its nucleophilicity compared to OH⁻.
- **Propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻)**: A weak base, making it a poor nucleophile.
- **Methanol (CH3OH)**: Neutral and poor nucleophile, least reactive.

### Correct Order:
**5 (Ethanethiolate) > 2 (Hydroxide) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 3 (Propionate) > 4 (Methanol)**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (5, 2, 3, 1, 4)**: Incorrect, as it places Propionate above 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate.
- **Option B (2, 5, 1, 4, 3)**: Incorrect, as it places Hydroxide above Ethanethiolate.
- **Option C (2, 5, 3, 4, 3)**: Incorrect, as it duplicates Propionate and misplaces other nucleophiles.
- **Option D (5, 2, 1, 3, 4)**: Correct, as it matches the derived order.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: D**
