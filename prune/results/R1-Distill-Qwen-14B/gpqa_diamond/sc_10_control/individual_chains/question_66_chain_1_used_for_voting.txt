Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. I remember SMEFT is a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are four symmetries: Lorentz Symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), CP symmetry (3), and CPT symmetry (4). The choices given are combinations of these, and I have to pick the correct combination.

Hmm, I think I should start by recalling what each of these symmetries entails. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations, so it includes momentum conservation, etc. But wait, in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect Poincare symmetry, or is it automatically included?

Wait, let me think. All effective field theories respect Poincare symmetry because they're built from fields that transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations, and the interactions are local. So SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry. But wait, is Poincare symmetry a separate requirement or just a subset of Lorentz plus translation? Oh, right, Poincare is the whole symmetry group, including translations. So if Lorentz is already required, does that automatically include Poincare?

Wait, no. Because the operators in SMEFT are part of a local effective theory, they must respect the Poincare symmetry. So all SMEFT operators should respect both Lorentz and Poincare. Oh wait, but Lorentz is a subgroup of Poincare, right? Or is it the other way around? No, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, so Lorentz is a part of Poincare. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But wait, the question is, which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So, the SMEFT operators must respect the symmetries that the Standard Model respects. The Standard Model respects Lorentz, Poincare, but not necessarily CP or CPT?

Wait, no. The Standard Model actually does respect CP symmetry in its operators, but not necessarily in its predictions because there are CP-violating terms like in the CKM matrix. Oh, wait no, in the Standard Model, the symmetry is such that the terms respect CP, but the theory as a whole can have CP violation. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's think again. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model, maintaining the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model has certain symmetries. Which ones are they?

The Standard Model (and hence SMEFT) respects Lorentz symmetry, because all fields are in representations of the Lorentz group. Poincare symmetry is about the combination of Lorentz and translations; since the fields are local, the theory is Poincare invariant. So all SMEFT operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. Wait, but are they separate? Because Poincare includes Lorentz. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So perhaps the question is whether the operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare as separate symmetries, or whether one implies the other.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering Poincare as a separate symmetry, so both 1 and 2 must be respected. Then, the other options are about CP and CPT.

CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry because of the CKM matrix leading to CP violation. So SMEFT operators do not necessarily respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must-respect symmetry.

CPT symmetry is a bit different. I remember that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must be respected. Because the theory is Lorentz invariant and unitary, CPT is a symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So point 4 is correct.

So putting this together: which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT? They must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Wait, but wait, Poincare includes Lorentz, so if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So the question is whether all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare, or if they just need to respect Poincare.

Wait, but SMEFT is built from local operators, so they must respect Poincare symmetry. That implies they must respect Lorentz as part of that. So perhaps the question includes both because they are considered separate symmetries.

In SMEFT, each operator is a Lorentz scalar, which implies they respect Lorentz symmetry. But since the theory is Poincare invariant, the operators also respect Poincare. So both 1 and 2 are correct. And since the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT symmetry (4).

So the correct symmetries that operators must respect are 1,2,4. So looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, so all its terms (and SMEFT operators) must respect CPT. So 4 is a must.

But what about Poincare and Lorentz? Well, Poincare is a larger symmetry group. If the theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So in the options, do we include both 1 and 2, even though they're overlapping? The question is phrased as which of the following symmetries must be respected. So for example, if an operator respects Poincare, it already respects Lorentz. But if the question includes both, then the correct options would have both 1 and 2.

So looking back at the options:

Option A: 1,2. So that's Lorentz and Poincare.

Option C:1,2,4. So includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but does SMEFT require operators to respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry, or just Poincare? Because Poincare implies Lorentz. So if the operator respects Poincare, Lorentz is automatically respected. So perhaps the correct must-respected symmetries are 2 and 4, but the question is about which ones must be respected, regardless of inclusion.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So for an operator to respect Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. So in terms of the options, both 1 and 2 would be correct because Poincare implies Lorentz.

Wait, but the question is phrased as which of the following symmetries must be respected. So if 2 (Poincare) is a must, then 1 is automatically satisfied, but perhaps the correct answer includes both.

Wait, perhaps in SMEFT, the operators are required to respect Lorentz and Poincare as separate symmetries, but I think that's not the case. Because if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to think about whether the operators must be Lorentz scalars, hence respecting Lorentz symmetry, and whether the theory as a whole respects Poincare.

Wait, in EFTs, the operators must be local and Lorentz-invariant. So each operator is a Lorentz scalar. Thus, they must individually respect Lorentz symmetry. But the entire theory must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes translations. But since each operator is a local term, the whole theory should respect Poincare. So I think both 1 and 2 are correct. So in that case, the options with 1 and 2 would be correct.

But wait, no, because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. All operators are written as Lorentz scalars, so each operator respects Lorentz. But the overall theory respects Poincare. So perhaps each operator must respect Lorentz symmetry, and the whole theory must respect Poincare.

But the question says "all operators in the SMEFT must respect" the symmetries. So since each operator is a Lorentz scalar, they must respect Lorentz symmetry. But whether each operator must respect Poincare symmetry? Or is Poincare symmetry a global symmetry of the entire theory, not each operator?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe the correct approach is to think that SMEFT operators must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP.

So the SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So looking at the options, that's options 1,2,4. So the correct answer would be option C (1,2,4). But wait, looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C) 1,2,4

D)1,3,4

Wait, but earlier I thought that the operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So option C.

But wait, what about Poincare and Lorentz? Because Poincare implies Lorentz, so if the operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. So perhaps the question is phrased such that both must be true.

But I'm a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps in the SMEFT, the operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetry. Wait, because each term in the Lagrangian must be a Lorentz scalar, so they must be Lorentz-invariant. But the entire Lagrangian must be Poincare-invariant. So each operator is Lorentz-invariant, so each respects Lorentz symmetry. But whether each respects Poincare? Hmm, perhaps not individually. Because the Poincare symmetry involves translations, which are global. Each operator is a local term, so their sum must be Poincare-invariant, but each individual operator doesn't need to be Poincare-invariant. So, perhaps in the SMEFT, each operator must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), but the entire theory must respect Poincare. So in the question, which is about which symmetries must be respected by each operator, perhaps only Lorentz symmetry is a must, and Poincare is a global symmetry of the theory, not each operator.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. I think that in SMEFT, all operators are written as local, Lorentz-invariant terms. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, meaning they respect Lorentz symmetry. But Poincare symmetry is about the entire theory, so each operator doesn't have to individually respect Poincare symmetry, but their sum must.

So if the question is which symmetries must all operators respect (as in, each operator must be invariant under these symmetries), then the answer would be Lorentz (1) and CPT (4), because CPT is a symmetry of the theory as it's Lorentz-invariant.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator is a Lorentz scalar, it respects Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is correct. CPT is a symmetry for the entire theory because it's Lorentz-invariant, so each operator doesn't have to individually respect CPT. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry and CPT. Because the theory is Lorentz-invariant, which implies CPT symmetry. So the operators must each be Lorentz-invariant, and the theory must respect CPT, but each operator doesn't have to respect CPT individually.

Wait, but the question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So perhaps only Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must for each operator. But I'm not sure about Poincare and CPT.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry and CPT. Because the SMEFT is built from Lorentz-invariant operators, and the theory is CPT-invariant. So each operator must be Lorentz-invariant, and the entire theory must respect CPT. However, the question is about which symmetries each operator must respect, not the entire theory.

So, perhaps each operator must respect Lorentz symmetry. CPT is a global symmetry of the theory, so each operator doesn't have to individually respect CPT. Therefore, only Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2), because Poincare includes Lorentz but as a separate symmetry. Wait, but I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recall that in SMEFT, all operators are required to be Lorentz scalars, so they must respect Lorentz symmetry. Additionally, the theory as a whole must be Poincare-invariant and CPT-invariant. But the question is about each operator, so perhaps each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, so 1 is correct. But whether each operator must respect Poincare symmetry—probably not, because Poincare is a global symmetry of the entire theory, not each operator.

But the question says, which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator can transform non-trivially under Poincare (like translation), but the sum of all operators must be invariant. So individual operators don't have to be Poincare-invariant; only their sum is.

So for each operator, they must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), but Poincare (2) is a global symmetry of the whole theory, not each operator. So 2 is not a requirement for each operator.

Wait, but that's not correct, because each operator is part of the Lagrangian, which is required to be Poincare-invariant. So perhaps each operator must be written in a way that when combined, they form a Poincare-invariant Lagrangian. But that doesn't mean each operator is Poincare-invariant on its own.

So, each operator must respect Lorentz (1), but not necessarily Poincare (2) on their own.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, because each operator is a Lorentz scalar, and the entire theory must respect Poincare and CPT. So the operators must individually respect Lorentz symmetry, but whether they must all respect Poincare or not is unclear.

But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, so 1 is correct. For CPT symmetry, because the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT. So each operator doesn't have to individually respect CPT symmetry; it's the theory as a whole that respects it.

So, perhaps the correct answer is only Lorentz and CPT. Wait, but CPT is a global symmetry of the theory, not necessarily each operator. So if the question is about each operator, perhaps only Lorentz symmetry is a must.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. Because the theory is Poincare-invariant, so operators must be written in a way that the entire Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant. But I'm not entirely certain if each operator must respect Poincare.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that operators must respect Lorentz symmetry and CPT symmetry. Because each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, and the theory as a whole must be CPT-invariant. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the options again. The question asks which of the following must be respected by all operators.

Option C: 1,2,4 → Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

Option D: 1,3,4 → Lorentz, CP, CPT.

Which is correct?

I think that the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, and the entire theory must respect Poincare and CPT. But the question is about each operator, so perhaps only Lorentz is a must for each operator. Poincare is a global symmetry so each operator doesn't have to respect it. CPT is a symmetry of the theory, so each operator doesn't have to individually respect it, but the theory as a whole does.

But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the theory must respect CPT, then each operator must be a part of that. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. Because:

- Each operator must be a Lorentz scalar → respect Lorentz (1)
- The operators must be arranged so that the entire Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant, so each operator must be part of such a construction → but perhaps each operator doesn't need to be individually Poincare-invariant. So maybe 2 is correct.
- The theory is CPT-invariant because it's Lorentz-invariant, meaning each operator must be part of a CPT-invariant setup. So perhaps each operator must be CPT-invariant.

Wait, but CPT is a combination of symmetries. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the operators must respect Lorentz and CPT. Because:

- Each operator must be a Lorentz scalar (1)
- The theory must respect CPT symmetry (4)

But I'm not sure about Poincare.

Wait, but for the SMEFT to be a valid effective theory, it must have the same symmetries as the Standard Model, which includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So perhaps all operators must respect all three.

But again, the question is about each operator. So in that case, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar (1), but whether each operator must individually respect Poincare is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that operators must respect Lorentz and CPT, but not necessarily Poincare. Because Poincare is a global symmetry of the entire theory.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let's try a different approach. I'll look up what SMEFT's symmetries are.

In SMEFT, the operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars, so they must respect Lorentz symmetry. The theory is Poincare-invariant, meaning the entire Lagrangian must be invariant under Poincare transformations, but individual terms don't have to be. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar (so respects Lorentz symmetry), but not necessarily Poincare.

But the theory must respect CPT symmetry because it's Lorentz-invariant. So the entire theory is CPT-invariant, but individual operators don't have to be. So which symmetries must each operator respect? Only Lorentz symmetry (1). So which options include only Lorentz?

Looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2 (Lorentz and Poincare). So if only Lorentz is a must for each operator, then option A would not include CPT, which I thought was a must for the theory.

But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the entire theory must respect CPT, but each operator doesn't have to, then 4 is not necessary for each operator.

But I'm getting more confused. Alternatively, perhaps all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. Because:

Each operator must be Lorentz scalar → 1.

The theory must be Poincare-invariant, which requires that each operator is in a Poincare-invariant way. So each operator must respect Poincare. But wait, maybe not. Because Poincare includes translations, which are global. So each operator is a local term, but the sum must be translation-invariant. So each operator doesn't have to be translation-invariant on its own.

Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz (1) and CPT (4), because the theory must respect those, but Poincare (2) is a global symmetry not necessarily required for each operator.

So, if the question is which symmetries must each operator respect, the answer would be Lorentz (1) and CPT (4).

Wait, but the options don't have an option that includes 1 and 4 alone. Looking back, the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

Hmm. So the only option with 1 and 4 is option C or D. Option C includes 1,2,4. Option D includes 1,3,4.

Wait, but the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So if each operator must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, then option C would be correct.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz and CPT, but not necessarily Poincare. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and all three (1,2,4) are correct. So option C.

Wait, but the Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translations. So if the operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So if an operator must respect Poincare, then Lorentz is included. So perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Poincare (2) and CPT (4), but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4), making option C correct.

I think I'm going to have to go with option C: 1,2,4. So the answer is C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model while preserving the same symmetries. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze the options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators are Lorentz scalars, meaning they must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for any relativistic theory.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. While the entire SMEFT theory must respect Poincaré symmetry, individual operators do not need to respect it on their own. Poincaré symmetry is a global property of the theory, not necessarily of each operator.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model (and hence SMEFT) does not necessarily respect CP symmetry due to CP-violating terms like those in the CKM matrix. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for SMEFT operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: In any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must be respected. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT symmetry. This applies to the entire theory, but individual operators do not need to respect CPT symmetry on their own.

From this analysis:
- Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must for all operators.
- Poincaré symmetry (2) is a global property of the theory, not necessarily required for each operator.
- CP symmetry (3) is not a requirement for SMEFT operators.
- CPT symmetry (4) is a requirement for the entire theory, but not necessarily for each operator individually.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators. Since Poincaré symmetry is a global property and not a requirement for each operator, the correct answer includes Lorentz symmetry (1) and CPT symmetry (4). However, the phrasing of the question suggests that both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries are considered separately, even though Poincaré includes Lorentz. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. I remember SMEFT is a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are four symmetries: Lorentz Symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), CP symmetry (3), and CPT symmetry (4). The choices given are combinations of these, and I have to pick the correct combination.

Hmm, I think I should start by recalling what each of these symmetries entails. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations, so it includes momentum conservation, etc. But wait, in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect Poincare symmetry, or is it automatically included?

Wait, let me think. All effective field theories respect Poincare symmetry because they're built from fields that transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations, and the interactions are local. So SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry. But wait, is Poincare symmetry a separate requirement or just a subset of Lorentz plus translation? Oh, right, Poincare is the whole symmetry group, including translations. So if Lorentz is already required, does that automatically include Poincare?

Wait, no. Because the operators in SMEFT are part of a local effective theory, they must respect the Poincare symmetry. So all SMEFT operators should respect both Lorentz and Poincare. Oh wait, but Lorentz is a subgroup of Poincare, right? Or is it the other way around? No, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, so Lorentz is a part of Poincare. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But wait, the question is, which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So, the SMEFT operators must respect the symmetries that the Standard Model respects. The Standard Model respects Lorentz, Poincare, but not necessarily CP or CPT?

Wait, no. The Standard Model actually does respect CP symmetry in its operators, but not necessarily in its predictions because there are CP-violating terms like in the CKM matrix. Oh, wait no, in the Standard Model, the symmetry is such that the terms respect CP, but the theory as a whole can have CP violation. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's think again. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model, maintaining the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model has certain symmetries. Which ones are they?

The Standard Model (and hence SMEFT) respects Lorentz symmetry, because all fields are in representations of the Lorentz group. Poincare symmetry is about the combination of Lorentz and translations; since the fields are local, the theory is Poincare invariant. So all SMEFT operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. Wait, but are they separate? Because Poincare includes Lorentz. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So perhaps the question is whether the operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare as separate symmetries, or whether one implies the other.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering Poincare as a separate symmetry, so both 1 and 2 must be respected. Then, the other options are about CP and CPT.

CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry because of the CKM matrix leading to CP violation. So SMEFT operators do not necessarily respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must-respect symmetry.

CPT symmetry is a bit different. I remember that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must be respected. Because the theory is Lorentz invariant and unitary, CPT is a symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So point 4 is correct.

So putting this together: which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT? They must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Wait, but wait, Poincare includes Lorentz, so if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So the question is whether all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare, or if they just need to respect Poincare.

Wait, but SMEFT is built from local operators, so they must respect Poincare symmetry. That implies they must respect Lorentz as part of that. So perhaps the question includes both because they are considered separate symmetries.

In SMEFT, each operator is a Lorentz scalar, which implies they respect Lorentz symmetry. But since the theory is Poincare invariant, the operators also respect Poincare. So both 1 and 2 are correct. And since the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT symmetry (4).

So the correct symmetries that operators must respect are 1,2,4. So looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, so all its terms (and SMEFT operators) must respect CPT. So 4 is a must.

But what about Poincare and Lorentz? Well, Poincare is a larger symmetry group. If the theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So in the options, do we include both 1 and 2, even though they're overlapping? The question is phrased as which of the following symmetries must be respected. So for example, if an operator respects Poincare, it already respects Lorentz. But if the question includes both, then the correct options would have both 1 and 2.

So looking back at the options:

Option A: 1,2. So that's Lorentz and Poincare.

Option C:1,2,4. So includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but does SMEFT require operators to respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry, or just Poincare? Because Poincare implies Lorentz. So if the operator respects Poincare, Lorentz is automatically respected. So perhaps the correct must-respected symmetries are 2 and 4, but the question is about which ones must be respected, regardless of inclusion.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So for an operator to respect Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. So in terms of the options, both 1 and 2 would be correct because Poincare implies Lorentz.

Wait, but the question is phrased as which of the following symmetries must be respected. So if 2 (Poincare) is a must, then 1 is automatically satisfied, but perhaps the correct answer includes both.

Wait, perhaps in SMEFT, the operators are required to respect Lorentz and Poincare as separate symmetries, but I think that's not the case. Because if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to think about whether the operators must be Lorentz scalars, hence respecting Lorentz symmetry, and whether the theory as a whole respects Poincare.

Wait, in EFTs, the operators must be local and Lorentz-invariant. So each operator is a Lorentz scalar. Thus, they must individually respect Lorentz symmetry. But the entire theory must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes translations. But since each operator is a local term, the whole theory should respect Poincare. So I think both 1 and 2 are correct. So in that case, the options with 1 and 2 would be correct.

But wait, no, because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. All operators are written as Lorentz scalars, so each operator respects Lorentz. But the overall theory respects Poincare. So perhaps each operator must respect Lorentz symmetry, and the whole theory must respect Poincare.

But the question says "all operators in the SMEFT must respect" the symmetries. So since each operator is a Lorentz scalar, they must respect Lorentz symmetry. But whether each operator must respect Poincare symmetry? Or is Poincare symmetry a global symmetry of the entire theory, not each operator?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe the correct approach is to think that SMEFT operators must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP.

So the SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So looking at the options, that's options 1,2,4. So the correct answer would be option C (1,2,4). But wait, looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C) 1,2,4

D)1,3,4

Wait, but earlier I thought that the operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So option C.

But wait, what about Poincare and Lorentz? Because Poincare implies Lorentz, so if the operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. So perhaps the question is phrased such that both must be true.

But I'm a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps in the SMEFT, the operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetry. Wait, because each term in the Lagrangian must be a Lorentz scalar, so they must be Lorentz-invariant. But the entire Lagrangian must be Poincare-invariant. So each operator is Lorentz-invariant, so each respects Lorentz symmetry. But whether each respects Poincare? Hmm, perhaps not individually. Because the Poincare symmetry involves translations, which are global. Each operator is a local term, so their sum must be Poincare-invariant, but each individual operator doesn't need to be Poincare-invariant. So, perhaps in the SMEFT, each operator must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), but the entire theory must respect Poincare. So in the question, which is about which symmetries must be respected by each operator, perhaps only Lorentz symmetry is a must, and Poincare is a global symmetry of the theory, not each operator.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. I think that in SMEFT, all operators are written as local, Lorentz-invariant terms. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, meaning they respect Lorentz symmetry. But Poincare symmetry is about the entire theory, so each operator doesn't have to individually respect Poincare symmetry, but their sum must.

So if the question is which symmetries must all operators respect (as in, each operator must be invariant under these symmetries), then the answer would be Lorentz (1) and CPT (4), because CPT is a symmetry of the theory as it's Lorentz-invariant.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator is a Lorentz scalar, it respects Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is correct. CPT is a symmetry for the entire theory because it's Lorentz-invariant, so each operator doesn't have to individually respect CPT. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry and CPT. Because the theory is Lorentz-invariant, which implies CPT symmetry. So the operators must each be Lorentz-invariant, and the theory must respect CPT, but each operator doesn't have to respect CPT individually.

Wait, but the question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So perhaps only Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must for each operator. But I'm not sure about Poincare and CPT.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry and CPT. Because the SMEFT is built from Lorentz-invariant operators, and the theory is CPT-invariant. So each operator must be Lorentz-invariant, and the entire theory must respect CPT. However, the question is about which symmetries each operator must respect, not the entire theory.

So, perhaps each operator must respect Lorentz symmetry. CPT is a global symmetry of the theory, so each operator doesn't have to individually respect CPT. Therefore, only Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2), because Poincare includes Lorentz but as a separate symmetry. Wait, but I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recall that in SMEFT, all operators are required to be Lorentz scalars, so they must respect Lorentz symmetry. Additionally, the theory as a whole must be Poincare-invariant and CPT-invariant. But the question is about each operator, so perhaps each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, so 1 is correct. But whether each operator must respect Poincare symmetry—probably not, because Poincare is a global symmetry of the entire theory, not each operator.

But the question says, which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator can transform non-trivially under Poincare (like translation), but the sum of all operators must be invariant. So individual operators don't have to be Poincare-invariant; only their sum is.

So for each operator, they must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), but Poincare (2) is a global symmetry of the whole theory, not each operator. So 2 is not a requirement for each operator.

Wait, but that's not correct, because each operator is part of the Lagrangian, which is required to be Poincare-invariant. So perhaps each operator must be written in a way that when combined, they form a Poincare-invariant Lagrangian. But that doesn't mean each operator is Poincare-invariant on its own.

So, each operator must respect Lorentz (1), but not necessarily Poincare (2) on their own.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, because each operator is a Lorentz scalar, and the entire theory must respect Poincare and CPT. So the operators must individually respect Lorentz symmetry, but whether they must all respect Poincare or not is unclear.

But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, so 1 is correct. For CPT symmetry, because the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT. So each operator doesn't have to individually respect CPT symmetry; it's the theory as a whole that respects it.

So, perhaps the correct answer is only Lorentz and CPT. Wait, but CPT is a global symmetry of the theory, not necessarily each operator. So if the question is about each operator, perhaps only Lorentz symmetry is a must.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. Because the theory is Poincare-invariant, so operators must be written in a way that the entire Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant. But I'm not entirely certain if each operator must respect Poincare.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that operators must respect Lorentz symmetry and CPT symmetry. Because each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, and the theory as a whole must be CPT-invariant. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the options again. The question asks which of the following must be respected by all operators.

Option C: 1,2,4 → Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

Option D: 1,3,4 → Lorentz, CP, CPT.

Which is correct?

I think that the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, and the entire theory must respect Poincare and CPT. But the question is about each operator, so perhaps only Lorentz is a must for each operator. Poincare is a global symmetry so each operator doesn't have to respect it. CPT is a symmetry of the theory, so each operator doesn't have to individually respect it, but the theory as a whole does.

But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the theory must respect CPT, then each operator must be a part of that. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. Because:

- Each operator must be a Lorentz scalar → respect Lorentz (1)
- The operators must be arranged so that the entire Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant, so each operator must be part of such a construction → but perhaps each operator doesn't need to be individually Poincare-invariant. So maybe 2 is correct.
- The theory is CPT-invariant because it's Lorentz-invariant, meaning each operator must be part of a CPT-invariant setup. So perhaps each operator must be CPT-invariant.

Wait, but CPT is a combination of symmetries. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the operators must respect Lorentz and CPT. Because:

- Each operator must be a Lorentz scalar (1)
- The theory must respect CPT symmetry (4)

But I'm not sure about Poincare.

Wait, but for the SMEFT to be a valid effective theory, it must have the same symmetries as the Standard Model, which includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So perhaps all operators must respect all three.

But again, the question is about each operator. So in that case, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar (1), but whether each operator must individually respect Poincare is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that operators must respect Lorentz and CPT, but not necessarily Poincare. Because Poincare is a global symmetry of the entire theory.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let's try a different approach. I'll look up what SMEFT's symmetries are.

In SMEFT, the operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars, so they must respect Lorentz symmetry. The theory is Poincare-invariant, meaning the entire Lagrangian must be invariant under Poincare transformations, but individual terms don't have to be. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar (so respects Lorentz symmetry), but not necessarily Poincare.

But the theory must respect CPT symmetry because it's Lorentz-invariant. So the entire theory is CPT-invariant, but individual operators don't have to be. So which symmetries must each operator respect? Only Lorentz symmetry (1). So which options include only Lorentz?

Looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2 (Lorentz and Poincare). So if only Lorentz is a must for each operator, then option A would not include CPT, which I thought was a must for the theory.

But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the entire theory must respect CPT, but each operator doesn't have to, then 4 is not necessary for each operator.

But I'm getting more confused. Alternatively, perhaps all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. Because:

Each operator must be Lorentz scalar → 1.

The theory must be Poincare-invariant, which requires that each operator is in a Poincare-invariant way. So each operator must respect Poincare. But wait, maybe not. Because Poincare includes translations, which are global. So each operator is a local term, but the sum must be translation-invariant. So each operator doesn't have to be translation-invariant on its own.

Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz (1) and CPT (4), because the theory must respect those, but Poincare (2) is a global symmetry not necessarily required for each operator.

So, if the question is which symmetries must each operator respect, the answer would be Lorentz (1) and CPT (4).

Wait, but the options don't have an option that includes 1 and 4 alone. Looking back, the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

Hmm. So the only option with 1 and 4 is option C or D. Option C includes 1,2,4. Option D includes 1,3,4.

Wait, but the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So if each operator must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, then option C would be correct.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz and CPT, but not necessarily Poincare. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and all three (1,2,4) are correct. So option C.

Wait, but the Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translations. So if the operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So if an operator must respect Poincare, then Lorentz is included. So perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Poincare (2) and CPT (4), but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4), making option C correct.

I think I'm going to have to go with option C: 1,2,4. So the answer is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model while preserving the same symmetries. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze the options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators are Lorentz scalars, meaning they must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for any relativistic theory.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. While the entire SMEFT theory must respect Poincaré symmetry, individual operators do not need to respect it on their own. Poincaré symmetry is a global property of the theory, not necessarily of each operator.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model (and hence SMEFT) does not necessarily respect CP symmetry due to CP-violating terms like those in the CKM matrix. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for SMEFT operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: In any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must be respected. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT symmetry. This applies to the entire theory, but individual operators do not need to respect CPT symmetry on their own.

From this analysis:
- Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must for all operators.
- Poincaré symmetry (2) is a global property of the theory, not necessarily required for each operator.
- CP symmetry (3) is not a requirement for SMEFT operators.
- CPT symmetry (4) is a requirement for the entire theory, but not necessarily for each operator individually.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators. Since Poincaré symmetry is a global property and not a requirement for each operator, the correct answer includes Lorentz symmetry (1) and CPT symmetry (4). However, the phrasing of the question suggests that both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries are considered separately, even though Poincaré includes Lorentz. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

**Answer: C**
