Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but I'll think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm. So first, I think I need to figure out the concentrations after dilution and then during titration at 25% and equivalence point.

Let me break it down. So initially, we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution can be calculated using dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) /40 = (1) /40 = 0.0125 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.0125 M.

Now, when we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, let's calculate the moles initially. The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) after dilution are M * V = 0.0125 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). So 0.0125 * 0.04 = 0.0005 moles. Because moles = Molarity * Volume in liters.

The NaOH is 0.1 M. So to reach equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed = moles of acetic acid = 0.0005 mol. So volume of NaOH needed is moles / Molarity = 0.0005 / 0.1 = 0.005 L, which is 5 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 5 cm³ of NaOH is added. But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume is 5 * 0.25 = 1.25 cm³. So at 25% titration, we've added 1.25 cm³ of NaOH.

Now, I need to find the pH at both 25% titration and equivalence point.

Let me start with the 25% point.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.00125 L = 0.000125 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.0005 mol. So moles reacted: 0.000125 mol. Remaining acetic acid: 0.0005 - 0.000125 = 0.000375 mol. Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.000125 mol.

So now, the solution is a buffer of acetic acid and acetate. The total volume is original volume (40 cm³) + NaOH added (1.25 cm³) = 41.25 cm³, which is 0.04125 L.

The concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.000375 / 0.04125 = 0.0090909 M (approx 0.00909 M)
[CH3COO^-] = 0.000125 / 0.04125 = 0.0030303 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is approximately 1.85 x 10^-5. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.0030303 / 0.0090909).

Calculating the ratio: 0.0030303 / 0.0090909 = approx 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is about 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. But let me check the calculations again to make sure.

Wait, let me re-calculate the moles. The diluted acetic acid is 0.0125 M. So for 20 cm³ diluted to 40, the moles are 0.0125 * 0.04 = 0.0005 mol. Correct. Then 25% of 5 cm³ is 1.25 cm³. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.00125 L = 0.000125 mol. Correct.

So, moles after reaction: 0.000375 HA, 0.000125 A-. Volume is 40 + 1.25 = 41.25 cm³, 0.04125 L.

Concentrations: 0.000375 / 0.04125 = 0.0090909 M HA.

0.000125 / 0.04125 is 0.0030303 M A-.

So the ratio is 0.0030303 / 0.0090909 = 1/3. So log(1/3) is -0.477.

pH = pKa + (-0.477) → 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So that's the pH at 25% titration.

Now, the equivalence point. At this point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The solution is now a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added are 5 cm³, as calculated earlier. So the total volume is 40 cm³ +5 cm³ =45 cm³ (0.045 L).

Moles of acetate ions from NaOH: 0.0005 mol. Because all the acetic acid (0.0005 mol) has been converted to acetate.

So concentration of acetate is 0.0005 / 0.045 L ≈ 0.01111 M.

Now, the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. The initial concentration of acetate is 0.01111 M.

Using the approximation for weak base: [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C). So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.01111) = sqrt(6.0e-12) = 7.75e-6 M.

So pOH = -log(7.75e-6) ≈ 5.108. So pH = 14 -5.108 =8.892.

Wait, that's about pH 8.89. But none of the options have 8.89 as the second value. Let me look at the options again.

Option D is 4.57;6.92. No, that's not matching. Option A is 4.26;8.52. Hmm, perhaps my calculation is off.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating Kb or the concentration. Let me recheck.

Wait, Kb is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14. Ka is 1.85e-5.

So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * (1e-14 / 1e-5) )= 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.0005 mol / 0.045 L = 0.01111 M. Correct.

So Kb =5.405e-10. So the expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the [OH^-], then Kb = x² / (0.01111 - x) ≈ x² / 0.01111.

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.01111 =5.405e-10 * 0.01111 ≈6.0e-12.

x = sqrt(6e-12) ≈ 7.75e-6 → [OH^-] =7.75e-6.

pOH = -log(7.75e-6) → log(7.75) is about 0.889, so log(7.75e-6)= 0.889 -6 = -5.111 → pOH=5.111. pH=14-5.111=8.889.

Hmm, so at equivalence point, pH is approx 8.89. But looking at the options:

Option A: 4.26;8.52.

Option D: 4.57;6.92.

Wait, none of the options have 8.89. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. Maybe I miscalculated the volume. Let me check that part.

Wait, the initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³. Then, at equivalence point, 5 cm³ of NaOH is added. So total volume is 40 +5 =45 cm³ (0.045 L), as I did earlier. So the concentration of acetate is 0.0005 / 0.045 = 0.01111 M. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution at equivalence point might involve more precise calculation, not just the approximation. Let's try using the exact quadratic equation.

So Kb =5.405e-10. Let me write the expression:

x² / (0.01111 - x ) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is very small compared to 0.01111. So 0.01111 -x ≈ 0.01111.

x² =5.405e-10 * 0.01111 =6.0e-12 → x= sqrt(6e-12) =7.75e-6, as before. So the approximation holds, as x is much smaller than 0.01111.

Hmm, so why don't any of the options match 8.89? Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the initial moles. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, the initial solution after dilution has 0.0125 M acetic acid in 40 cm³.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.0125 * 0.04 =0.0005 mol. Correct.

Equivalence point requires 0.0005 mol of NaOH. So volume of NaOH = 0.0005 / 0.1 =0.005 L =5 cm³. Correct.

So total volume at equivalence is 40 +5=45 cm³. So acetate concentration is 0.0005 /0.045 =0.01111 M.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I forgot that at equivalence point, the solution is a buffer? No, no, because all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So it's a solution of acetate ion, which is a weak base.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate it using the exact formula without approximation.

So:

Kb = (x)(x)/(0.01111 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, but let's set it up as:

x² =5.405e-10 * (0.01111 -x )

x² =5.405e-10 *0.01111 -5.405e-10 x

x² +5.405e-10 x -6.0e-12 =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -6.0e-12.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*6.0e-12 = (2.921e-19) + 2.4e-11.

Wait, 5.405e-10 squared is (5.405)^2 * 1e-20 = approx 29.21 * 1e-20=2.921e-19.

4ac is 4*1*(-6e-12) = -2.4e-11. Oh wait, in the discriminant, it's 4ac, but in equation it's 4*1*(-6e-12) → but in discriminant, it's (b² -4ac), but in this case, it's x² +bx +c, so a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -6e-12. So the discriminant is (5.405e-10)^2 -4*1*(-6e-12) =5.405e-10^2 +24e-12.

Wait, 5.405e-10 squared is approx 2.92e-19.

24e-12 is 2.4e-11.

So 2.92e-19 +2.4e-11= approx 2.400292e-11.

Square root of that is sqrt(2.400292e-11)= approximately 4.90e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 4.90e-6 ] / 2.

We take the positive root, so x=( -5.405e-10 +4.90e-6 ) /2.

4.90e-6 is about 4.90e-6, which is much larger than 5.4e-10, so x≈ (4.9e-6)/2=2.45e-6.

Wait, that's different from before. Wait, this can't be right because earlier approximation gave 7.75e-6.

Wait, wait. I'm getting confused. Let me recompute the discriminant.

Looking back: The equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -6e-12=0.

So for discriminant D: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(6e-12) = (2.921e-19) + (2.4e-11) = 2.4002921e-11.

So sqrt(D)= sqrt(2.4002921e-11) = approx 4.9e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 ±4.9e-6 ] /2.

We take positive root: (4.9e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (4.9e-6)/2 = 2.45e-6.

Wait, so [OH^-] is 2.45e-6 → pOH = -log(2.45e-6)≈5.61 → pH=14-5.61=8.39.

Hmm, that's different. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the quadratic setup. Alternatively, maybe using the approximation is better. Because the approximation gave [OH^-] ≈7.75e-6, which would be pOH=5.11, pH=8.89.

But the exact calculation using quadratic gave [OH^-]= approx 2.45e-6 → pH=8.39.

Wait, conflicting results. Hmm. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic setup. Let me re-express the equation correctly.

The correct equation after substituting Kb:

x² = Kb * (0.01111 -x )

So x² + Kb x - Kb *0.01111 =0.

Wait, wait, no, the correct equation is:

x² = (5.405e-10) * (0.01111 -x)

Which can be rewritten as x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 * 0.01111)=0.

So 5.405e-10 *0.01111 is 6.0e-12, as before.

So equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -6e-12=0.

Wait, but earlier I thought that x² + (5.405e-10) x -6e-12=0.

Wait, but when I plug into quadratic, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -6e-12.

So D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(6e-12) = 2.921e-19 + 2.4e-11 = 2.4002921e-11.

sqrt(D)=4.9e-6.

So x= [-5.405e-10 +4.9e-6 ]/(2*1) = (4.9e-6 -5.4e-10)/2 ≈ (4.9e-6)/2 =2.45e-6.

So [OH^-] is 2.45e-6 → pOH=5.61 → pH=8.39.

But earlier approximation gave 7.75e-6 → pH=8.89.

These are conflicting results. There's a discrepancy here. Why?

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, let's recompute Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa=4.733.

Kb= Kw/Ka =1e-14 /1.85e-5=5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the two approaches. Let's see, the initial approximation (x^2 = Kb * C) gave x=7.75e-6, pOH=5.11→pH=8.89.

The exact calculation via quadratic gave x=2.45e-6, pOH=5.61→pH=8.39.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when the approximation holds, the exact solution shouldn't differ so much. There must be a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps the quadratic setup is incorrect. Let me double-check.

The correct expression for Kb is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] = initial concentration - x =0.01111 -x.

[OH^-] = x.

[CH3COOH] = x, because for each mole of OH^- produced, one mole of CH3COOH is formed.

So Kb = (x)(x) / (0.01111 -x) → x² = Kb (0.01111 -x )

So x² + Kb x - Kb *0.01111=0.

So Kb is 5.405e-10, so equation: x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 *0.01111) =0.

Which is x² +5.405e-10 x -6e-12=0.

So in quadratic, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -6e-12.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(6e-12).

Wait, 4ac=4*1*(-6e-12)= -2.4e-11. But in the discriminant, it's b² -4ac. Wait, no, no, because in the quadratic equation, the discriminant is b² -4ac. But in this case, the equation is x² +bx +c=0, so a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -6e-12.

So D= b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-6e-12) = (2.921e-19) + (2.4e-11) = 2.921e-19 + 2.4e-11= approx 2.400292e-11.

So sqrt(D)= sqrt(2.400292e-11) ≈4.9e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +4.9e-6 ] / 2 → approximately (4.9e-6) / 2=2.45e-6.

Wait, but this is giving a lower [OH^-] than the approximation. So why is this happening?

Wait, perhaps the approximation is not valid here. Wait, with x=2.45e-6, and initial concentration of 0.01111 M, x is about 0.022% of 0.01111. So the approximation x<<C holds, so why is the exact solution giving a much smaller x?

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value more accurately.

Let me compute (5.405e-10)^2:

5.405e-10 squared is (5.405)^2 =29.21, so 29.21e-20 =2.921e-19.

4ac is 4*(1)*(6e-12) =2.4e-11.

So D=2.921e-19 +2.4e-11 =2.4000002921e-11.

Sqrt(D)=sqrt(2.4000002921e-11)=?

We know that sqrt(2.4e-11)= approx 4.89898e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +4.89898e-6 ] /2.

So 4.89898e-6 is 0.00000489898.

5.405e-10 is 0.0000000005405.

So -5.405e-10 +4.89898e-6 ≈4.89898e-6 -5.405e-10 ≈4.898e-6.

Divide by 2: 4.898e-6 /2=2.449e-6.

So [OH^-]=2.449e-6 → pOH= -log(2.449e-6)=5.61.

So pH=14-5.61=8.39.

But earlier approximation said [OH^-]=7.75e-6 → pOH=5.11 → pH=8.89.

Wait, that's a big difference. So why is the exact solution giving a lower pH than the approximation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb expression.

Wait, another approach: Use the exact formula without approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact [OH^-].

Wait, let me try plugging in x=2.449e-6 into the equation.

x² = (2.449e-6)^2 = approx 6e-12.

Kb * (0.01111 - x )=5.405e-10*(0.01111 -2.449e-6) ≈5.405e-10 *0.01111 ≈6e-12.

So x²=6e-12.

Which holds, so yes, x=2.449e-6 is correct.

So [OH^-]=2.449e-6 → pOH=5.61 → pH=8.39.

But wait, none of the options have 8.39 as the equivalence point. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: 4.26;8.52.

Option D:4.57;6.92.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the Kb and the [OH^-].

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me recheck.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa=4.73.

Kb =1e-14 /1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

So the Kb is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration of acetate. Let me re-calculate.

Moles of acetate:0.0005 mol.

Volume:45 cm³=0.045 L.

Concentration:0.0005 /0.045=0.01111 M. Correct.

Hmm. So why is the pH at equivalence point lower than what I thought earlier?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the activity coefficients or something else, but that's probably beyond the scope. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A says pH is 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence. My calculation for 25% is 4.26, which matches option A. But the equivalence point I calculated is 8.39, but option A has 8.52. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the pH at equivalence point more precisely.

Let me compute [OH^-] more accurately.

We have x=2.449e-6.

pOH =-log(2.449e-6).

Log(2.449)=0.3897.

So log(2.449e-6)=0.3897 -6= -5.6103 → pOH=5.6103.

pH=14-5.6103=8.3897 ≈8.39.

Hmm, but option A's equivalence point is 8.52, which is higher than 8.39.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me double-check.

The initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) of 0.0125 M acetic acid. Moles:0.0125 *0.04=0.0005 mol. Correct.

At equivalence, 5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. Moles NaOH:0.1 *0.005=0.0005. So yes, all acetic acid is neutralized.

So moles of acetate:0.0005.

Total volume:40+5=45 cm³=0.045 L.

Concentration of acetate:0.0005/0.045=0.01111 M.

Kb=5.405e-10.

So using exact calculation, [OH^-]=2.449e-6 → pH=8.39.

But none of the options have 8.39. The closest is option A at 8.52.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial assumption is that the solution at equivalence point is acetate. But perhaps it's the acetate and some residual acetic acid? No, at equivalence, all acetic acid is neutralized.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for weak base more accurately.

Wait, perhaps the initial concentration is 0.01111 M, and Kb is 5.405e-10.

The OH- concentration can be found using the formula:

[OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * C )

Which would be sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.01111 )= sqrt(6.0e-12)=7.75e-6 → pOH=5.11, pH=8.89.

But that's conflicting with the quadratic approach.

Wait, but if the quadratic solution is giving a lower [OH^-], perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic setup.

Another thought: perhaps I should have considered that in the quadratic equation, the equation is x² + (5.405e-10) x -6e-12=0.

But 5.405e-10 x is negligible compared to x² and the constant term. So perhaps the quadratic can be approximated as x² ≈6e-12 → x≈7.75e-6, which would give pH=8.89.

But why does the quadratic solution give a different result?

Wait, perhaps the earlier assumption that x is much smaller than C is not valid, but in reality, 7.75e-6 is much smaller than 0.01111 (which is 1.1e-2). So 7.75e-6 is about 0.7% of 0.01111, which is small enough to justify the approximation.

So why does the quadratic solution give a different result? It must have been a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the quadratic equation is set up incorrectly. Let me re-express the equation correctly.

The correct equation is:

x² = Kb * (C - x )

Which becomes x² + Kb x - Kb C =0.

So a=1, b=Kb=5.405e-10, c= -Kb*C= -5.405e-10 *0.01111= -6.0e-12.

So D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(6e-12).

Which is 2.921e-19 +2.4e-11=2.400292e-11.

sqrt(D)=4.9e-6.

So x= [ -b + sqrt(D) ]/(2a) → [ -5.405e-10 +4.9e-6 ]/(2).

Which is approx (4.9e-6)/2=2.45e-6.

But wait, this seems to contradict the approximation. Why is this happening?

Wait, perhaps I should not neglect the Kb x term. Let me compute the Kb x term.

Kb x=5.405e-10 *2.45e-6=1.326e-15, which is negligible compared to x²= (2.45e-6)^2=6.00e-12.

So perhaps the exact solution is x=2.45e-6, which is the same as the approximation when we ignore the Kb x term.

Wait, but that leads me back to the same confusion.

Wait, perhaps because I made a mistake in the sign. Let me double-check the quadratic formula.

The quadratic equation is ax² +bx +c=0.

In this case, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -6.0e-12.

So the roots are x= [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ]/(2a).

Wait, wait a second! I think I made a mistake in the sign of the discriminant in the quadratic formula.

The correct formula is x= [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ]/(2a).

In this case, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -6.0e-12.

So D= (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-6.0e-12) = 2.921e-19 + 2.4e-11 =2.400292e-11.

So sqrt(D)=4.9e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 ±4.9e-6 ]/(2).

We take the positive root: [ -5.405e-10 +4.9e-6 ] /2 → (4.9e-6 -5.4e-10)/2 ≈ (4.9e-6)/2=2.45e-6.

So [OH^-]=2.45e-6 → pOH=5.61 → pH=8.39.

But earlier, using the approximation, I got 7.75e-6 → pH=8.89.

So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the quadratic approach is more accurate, but why is there such a big difference?

Wait, let me compute the [OH^-] more accurately.

Using the quadratic solution, x=2.45e-6.

So Kb = x²/(C -x ) → (2.45e-6)^2 / (0.01111 -2.45e-6 )= (6.00e-12)/(0.0110855) =5.41e-10, which matches Kb=5.405e-10.

So the quadratic approach is correct.

Hmm, so the pH at equivalence point is 8.39. But none of the options have that. Looking back at the options.

Option A: 4.26;8.52.

Option D:4.57;6.92.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in Kb.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for Ka.

Ka=1.85e-5 → pKa=4.733.

Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 =5.405405405e-10.

So Kb=5.4054054e-10.

So when I calculate x, let me use more precise numbers.

Let me compute the discriminant more accurately.

D= (5.4054054e-10)^2 +4*(6.0e-12) → (5.4054054e-10)^2 is (5.4054054)^2 *1e-20.

5.4054054^2=29.21 (exactly, since 5.4054054 is 5 +0.4054054, and (5)^2=25, 2*5*0.4054054=4.054054, (0.4054054)^2≈0.16435, so total≈25+4.054054 +0.16435=29.2184)

So (5.4054054e-10)^2=29.2184e-20=2.92184e-19.

Adding 4*6e-12=2.4e-11 → 2.92184e-19 +2.4e-11=2.400292184e-11.

Square root of 2.400292184e-11 is:

Let me compute sqrt(2.400292184e-11):

We know that 4.89898^2=24, so sqrt(2.4e-11)=4.89898e-6.

Because (4.89898e-6)^2 = (4.89898)^2 *1e-12=24 *1e-12=2.4e-11.

So sqrt(2.400292184e-11)=4.89898e-6.

So x= [ -5.4054054e-10 +4.89898e-6 ]/(2) → (4.89898e-6 -5.4054054e-10)/2 → approximately 4.89898e-6 /2=2.44949e-6.

So [OH^-]=2.44949e-6 → pOH=5.61 → pH=8.39.

Hmm. So the pH is approximately 8.39. But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that at equivalence point, the solution is a buffer between acetate and acetic acid? No, no, because all the acetic acid has been neutralized, so it's just acetate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles of acetate. Let me recheck.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.0125 M *0.04 L=0.0005 mol. Correct.

At equivalence, all converted to acetate:0.0005 mol.

Volume:45 cm³=0.045 L.

Concentration:0.0005 /0.045=0.01111 M. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the pH at 25% titration and equivalence point, but perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% calculation.

Wait, let's recheck the 25% titration pH calculation.

At 25% titration, 1.25 cm³ of NaOH added.

Molarity of NaOH:0.1 M.

Moles NaOH:0.1 *0.00125=0.000125 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially:0.0005 mol.

So moles reacted:0.000125 mol.

Moles of acetic acid left:0.0005 -0.000125=0.000375 mol.

Moles of acetate formed:0.000125 mol.

Volume after addition:40 +1.25=41.25 cm³=0.04125 L.

Concentration of acetic acid: 0.000375 /0.04125=0.0090909 M.

Concentration of acetate:0.000125 /0.04125=0.0030303 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

pKa=4.733.

log(0.0030303/0.0090909)=log(1/3)= -0.477.

pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256 →4.26.

So that's correct.

So at 25% titration, pH is 4.26, which matches option A's first value.

But the equivalence point is 8.39, which isn't in the options. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, looking at option D:4.57;6.92.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula for weak base:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw - pKb )

Wait, no, that's not a standard formula. Alternatively, perhaps using the exact formula with [OH^-]=sqrt(Kb * C).

Wait, but that gives pH=8.89, which option A's equivalence point is 8.52.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm getting conflicting results. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence point is sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it should form a basic solution. But perhaps the calculation is correct, and the options have a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of pH at equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact calculation with precise numbers.

OH- concentration:2.449e-6.

pOH= -log(2.449e-6)=5.6103.

pH=14-5.6103=8.3897, which is approximately 8.39.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps I should re-evaluate the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the solution is diluted, the initial concentration is different. Let me recheck.

Wait, the problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: (0.05 M *20 cm³)/(40 cm³) =0.025 M? Wait, no, wait: 0.05 M *20 cm³ =0.001 mol. Divided by 40 cm³=0.04 L → 0.001/0.04=0.025 M.

Wait a minute! Did I make a mistake earlier?

Oh no! I think I made a mistake in the initial dilution calculation.

Yes, I think I did. Let me re-calculate this part.

Original volume:20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid.

Diluting with 20 cm³ water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: M = (M1 * V1) / (V1 +V2) → (0.05 *20) /40 = (1) /40=0.025 M.

Oh! I thought it was 0.0125 M earlier, but it's actually 0.025 M.

That changes everything. I must have made a mistake earlier.

So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M, not 0.0125 M.

That's a significant error. Let me redo all the calculations based on this.

So initial moles after dilution:0.025 M *0.04 L =0.001 mol.

So at equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH:0.001 /0.1 M=0.01 L=10 cm³.

Wait, earlier I thought 5 cm³, but now it's 10 cm³.

So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

At 25% titration, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

So let's re-calculate everything.

First, 25% titration:

Moles of NaOH added:0.1 M *0.0025 L=0.00025 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially:0.001 mol.

Moles reacted:0.00025 → remaining acetic acid:0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate formed:0.00025 mol.

Volume after addition:40 cm³ +2.5 cm³=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

Concentrations:

[HA]=0.00075 /0.0425=0.017647 M.

[A-]=0.00025 /0.0425=0.0058824 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

pKa=4.733.

log(0.0058824/0.017647)=log(0.3333)= -0.477.

pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256 →4.26.

So same as before. So at 25% titration, pH is 4.26. So that part is correct.

Now, equivalence point.

At equivalence, all 0.001 mol acetic acid is neutralized to acetate.

Volume is 40 +10=50 cm³=0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate:0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

Now, Kb=5.405e-10.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch isn't applicable here. It's a solution of acetate, a weak base.

Using the approximation:

[OH^-]=sqrt(Kb * C )=sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 M.

pOH= -log(1.04e-5)=4.982.

pH=14-4.982=9.018.

But that's around 9.02, which isn't matching any option.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Using exact calculation:

x² = Kb * (C -x )

x² =5.405e-10 * (0.02 -x )

Assume x is much smaller than 0.02.

So x²≈5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x≈1.04e-5.

pOH=4.982 →pH≈9.02.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I made another mistake.

Wait, no. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, initial moles after dilution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L=0.001 mol.

At equivalence, 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH added. Moles NaOH=0.1 *0.01=0.001 mol. Correct.

So acetate concentration is 0.001 mol /0.05 L=0.02 M. Correct.

So Kb=5.405e-10.

Using the exact quadratic approach:

x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 *0.02 )=0 → x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1.081e-11 )=2.921e-19 +4.324e-11=4.3240002921e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ]/(2) → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈6.576e-6/2=3.288e-6.

[OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=14-5.486=8.514.

Which is approximately 8.51, which matches option A's second value of 8.52.

Ah! So that's the mistake. Earlier, I miscalculated the diluted concentration, which led to wrong calculations for equivalence point. Now, with corrected diluted concentration, the equivalence point pH is around 8.51, which matches option A's 8.52.

So the correct answer is option A: pH at 25% is 4.26, equivalence point 8.52.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the diluted concentration of acetic acid after mixing 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Using the dilution formula:

\[
M_1V_1 = M_2V_2
\]

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = M_2 \times V_2 = 0.025 \times 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### At 25% Titration:
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume has been reached. The equivalence point requires 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH (calculated later), so 25% corresponds to 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \times 0.0025 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

After the reaction:
- Remaining moles of acetic acid: \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \),
- Moles of acetate ion formed: \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).

The total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} = 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} = 0.0058824 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right),
\]
where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) = 4.733 \):

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.0058824}{0.017647}\right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \, \text{(rounded to 4.26)}.
\]

### At Equivalence Point:
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The moles of NaOH required are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The volume of NaOH required is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Molarity of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The total volume at the equivalence point is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion acts as a weak base, and its hydrolysis reaction is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} = 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot C} = \sqrt{5.405 \times 10^{-10} \cdot 0.02} = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} = 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) = 4.982.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.982 = 9.018.
\]

However, using the exact quadratic solution gives a slightly lower pH of approximately 8.52, which matches the closest option.

### Final Answer:
At 25% titration, the pH is 4.26, and at the equivalence point, the pH is 8.52. These values match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but I'll think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm. So first, I think I need to figure out the concentrations after dilution and then during titration at 25% and equivalence point.

Let me break it down. So initially, we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution can be calculated using dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) /40 = (1) /40 = 0.0125 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.0125 M.

Now, when we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, let's calculate the moles initially. The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) after dilution are M * V = 0.0125 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). So 0.0125 * 0.04 = 0.0005 moles. Because moles = Molarity * Volume in liters.

The NaOH is 0.1 M. So to reach equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed = moles of acetic acid = 0.0005 mol. So volume of NaOH needed is moles / Molarity = 0.0005 / 0.1 = 0.005 L, which is 5 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 5 cm³ of NaOH is added. But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume is 5 * 0.25 = 1.25 cm³. So at 25% titration, we've added 1.25 cm³ of NaOH.

Now, I need to find the pH at both 25% titration and equivalence point.

Let me start with the 25% point.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.00125 L = 0.000125 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.0005 mol. So moles reacted: 0.000125 mol. Remaining acetic acid: 0.0005 - 0.000125 = 0.000375 mol. Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.000125 mol.

So now, the solution is a buffer of acetic acid and acetate. The total volume is original volume (40 cm³) + NaOH added (1.25 cm³) = 41.25 cm³, which is 0.04125 L.

The concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.000375 / 0.04125 = 0.0090909 M (approx 0.00909 M)
[CH3COO^-] = 0.000125 / 0.04125 = 0.0030303 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is approximately 1.85 x 10^-5. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.0030303 / 0.0090909).

Calculating the ratio: 0.0030303 / 0.0090909 = approx 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is about 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. But let me check the calculations again to make sure.

Wait, let me re-calculate the moles. The diluted acetic acid is 0.0125 M. So for 20 cm³ diluted to 40, the moles are 0.0125 * 0.04 = 0.0005 mol. Correct. Then 25% of 5 cm³ is 1.25 cm³. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.00125 L = 0.000125 mol. Correct.

So, moles after reaction: 0.000375 HA, 0.000125 A-. Volume is 40 + 1.25 = 41.25 cm³, 0.04125 L.

Concentrations: 0.000375 / 0.04125 = 0.0090909 M HA.

0.000125 / 0.04125 is 0.0030303 M A-.

So the ratio is 0.0030303 / 0.0090909 = 1/3. So log(1/3) is -0.477.

pH = pKa + (-0.477) → 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So that's the pH at 25% titration.

Now, the equivalence point. At this point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The solution is now a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added are 5 cm³, as calculated earlier. So the total volume is 40 cm³ +5 cm³ =45 cm³ (0.045 L).

Moles of acetate ions from NaOH: 0.0005 mol. Because all the acetic acid (0.0005 mol) has been converted to acetate.

So concentration of acetate is 0.0005 / 0.045 L ≈ 0.01111 M.

Now, the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. The initial concentration of acetate is 0.01111 M.

Using the approximation for weak base: [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C). So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.01111) = sqrt(6.0e-12) = 7.75e-6 M.

So pOH = -log(7.75e-6) ≈ 5.108. So pH = 14 -5.108 =8.892.

Wait, that's about pH 8.89. But none of the options have 8.89 as the second value. Let me look at the options again.

Option D is 4.57;6.92. No, that's not matching. Option A is 4.26;8.52. Hmm, perhaps my calculation is off.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating Kb or the concentration. Let me recheck.

Wait, Kb is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14. Ka is 1.85e-5.

So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * (1e-14 / 1e-5) )= 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.0005 mol / 0.045 L = 0.01111 M. Correct.

So Kb =5.405e-10. So the expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the [OH^-], then Kb = x² / (0.01111 - x) ≈ x² / 0.01111.

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.01111 =5.405e-10 * 0.01111 ≈6.0e-12.

x = sqrt(6e-12) ≈ 7.75e-6 → [OH^-] =7.75e-6.

pOH = -log(7.75e-6) → log(7.75) is about 0.889, so log(7.75e-6)= 0.889 -6 = -5.111 → pOH=5.111. pH=14-5.111=8.889.

Hmm, so at equivalence point, pH is approx 8.89. But looking at the options:

Option A: 4.26;8.52.

Option D: 4.57;6.92.

Wait, none of the options have 8.89. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. Maybe I miscalculated the volume. Let me check that part.

Wait, the initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³. Then, at equivalence point, 5 cm³ of NaOH is added. So total volume is 40 +5 =45 cm³ (0.045 L), as I did earlier. So the concentration of acetate is 0.0005 / 0.045 = 0.01111 M. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution at equivalence point might involve more precise calculation, not just the approximation. Let's try using the exact quadratic equation.

So Kb =5.405e-10. Let me write the expression:

x² / (0.01111 - x ) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is very small compared to 0.01111. So 0.01111 -x ≈ 0.01111.

x² =5.405e-10 * 0.01111 =6.0e-12 → x= sqrt(6e-12) =7.75e-6, as before. So the approximation holds, as x is much smaller than 0.01111.

Hmm, so why don't any of the options match 8.89? Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the initial moles. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, the initial solution after dilution has 0.0125 M acetic acid in 40 cm³.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.0125 * 0.04 =0.0005 mol. Correct.

Equivalence point requires 0.0005 mol of NaOH. So volume of NaOH = 0.0005 / 0.1 =0.005 L =5 cm³. Correct.

So total volume at equivalence is 40 +5=45 cm³. So acetate concentration is 0.0005 /0.045 =0.01111 M.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I forgot that at equivalence point, the solution is a buffer? No, no, because all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So it's a solution of acetate ion, which is a weak base.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate it using the exact formula without approximation.

So:

Kb = (x)(x)/(0.01111 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, but let's set it up as:

x² =5.405e-10 * (0.01111 -x )

x² =5.405e-10 *0.01111 -5.405e-10 x

x² +5.405e-10 x -6.0e-12 =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -6.0e-12.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*6.0e-12 = (2.921e-19) + 2.4e-11.

Wait, 5.405e-10 squared is (5.405)^2 * 1e-20 = approx 29.21 * 1e-20=2.921e-19.

4ac is 4*1*(-6e-12) = -2.4e-11. Oh wait, in the discriminant, it's 4ac, but in equation it's 4*1*(-6e-12) → but in discriminant, it's (b² -4ac), but in this case, it's x² +bx +c, so a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -6e-12. So the discriminant is (5.405e-10)^2 -4*1*(-6e-12) =5.405e-10^2 +24e-12.

Wait, 5.405e-10 squared is approx 2.92e-19.

24e-12 is 2.4e-11.

So 2.92e-19 +2.4e-11= approx 2.400292e-11.

Square root of that is sqrt(2.400292e-11)= approximately 4.90e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 4.90e-6 ] / 2.

We take the positive root, so x=( -5.405e-10 +4.90e-6 ) /2.

4.90e-6 is about 4.90e-6, which is much larger than 5.4e-10, so x≈ (4.9e-6)/2=2.45e-6.

Wait, that's different from before. Wait, this can't be right because earlier approximation gave 7.75e-6.

Wait, wait. I'm getting confused. Let me recompute the discriminant.

Looking back: The equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -6e-12=0.

So for discriminant D: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(6e-12) = (2.921e-19) + (2.4e-11) = 2.4002921e-11.

So sqrt(D)= sqrt(2.4002921e-11) = approx 4.9e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 ±4.9e-6 ] /2.

We take positive root: (4.9e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (4.9e-6)/2 = 2.45e-6.

Wait, so [OH^-] is 2.45e-6 → pOH = -log(2.45e-6)≈5.61 → pH=14-5.61=8.39.

Hmm, that's different. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the quadratic setup. Alternatively, maybe using the approximation is better. Because the approximation gave [OH^-] ≈7.75e-6, which would be pOH=5.11, pH=8.89.

But the exact calculation using quadratic gave [OH^-]= approx 2.45e-6 → pH=8.39.

Wait, conflicting results. Hmm. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic setup. Let me re-express the equation correctly.

The correct equation after substituting Kb:

x² = Kb * (0.01111 -x )

So x² + Kb x - Kb *0.01111 =0.

Wait, wait, no, the correct equation is:

x² = (5.405e-10) * (0.01111 -x)

Which can be rewritten as x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 * 0.01111)=0.

So 5.405e-10 *0.01111 is 6.0e-12, as before.

So equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -6e-12=0.

Wait, but earlier I thought that x² + (5.405e-10) x -6e-12=0.

Wait, but when I plug into quadratic, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -6e-12.

So D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(6e-12) = 2.921e-19 + 2.4e-11 = 2.4002921e-11.

sqrt(D)=4.9e-6.

So x= [-5.405e-10 +4.9e-6 ]/(2*1) = (4.9e-6 -5.4e-10)/2 ≈ (4.9e-6)/2 =2.45e-6.

So [OH^-] is 2.45e-6 → pOH=5.61 → pH=8.39.

But earlier approximation gave 7.75e-6 → pH=8.89.

These are conflicting results. There's a discrepancy here. Why?

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, let's recompute Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa=4.733.

Kb= Kw/Ka =1e-14 /1.85e-5=5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the two approaches. Let's see, the initial approximation (x^2 = Kb * C) gave x=7.75e-6, pOH=5.11→pH=8.89.

The exact calculation via quadratic gave x=2.45e-6, pOH=5.61→pH=8.39.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when the approximation holds, the exact solution shouldn't differ so much. There must be a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps the quadratic setup is incorrect. Let me double-check.

The correct expression for Kb is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] = initial concentration - x =0.01111 -x.

[OH^-] = x.

[CH3COOH] = x, because for each mole of OH^- produced, one mole of CH3COOH is formed.

So Kb = (x)(x) / (0.01111 -x) → x² = Kb (0.01111 -x )

So x² + Kb x - Kb *0.01111=0.

So Kb is 5.405e-10, so equation: x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 *0.01111) =0.

Which is x² +5.405e-10 x -6e-12=0.

So in quadratic, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -6e-12.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(6e-12).

Wait, 4ac=4*1*(-6e-12)= -2.4e-11. But in the discriminant, it's b² -4ac. Wait, no, no, because in the quadratic equation, the discriminant is b² -4ac. But in this case, the equation is x² +bx +c=0, so a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -6e-12.

So D= b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-6e-12) = (2.921e-19) + (2.4e-11) = 2.921e-19 + 2.4e-11= approx 2.400292e-11.

So sqrt(D)= sqrt(2.400292e-11) ≈4.9e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +4.9e-6 ] / 2 → approximately (4.9e-6) / 2=2.45e-6.

Wait, but this is giving a lower [OH^-] than the approximation. So why is this happening?

Wait, perhaps the approximation is not valid here. Wait, with x=2.45e-6, and initial concentration of 0.01111 M, x is about 0.022% of 0.01111. So the approximation x<<C holds, so why is the exact solution giving a much smaller x?

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value more accurately.

Let me compute (5.405e-10)^2:

5.405e-10 squared is (5.405)^2 =29.21, so 29.21e-20 =2.921e-19.

4ac is 4*(1)*(6e-12) =2.4e-11.

So D=2.921e-19 +2.4e-11 =2.4000002921e-11.

Sqrt(D)=sqrt(2.4000002921e-11)=?

We know that sqrt(2.4e-11)= approx 4.89898e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +4.89898e-6 ] /2.

So 4.89898e-6 is 0.00000489898.

5.405e-10 is 0.0000000005405.

So -5.405e-10 +4.89898e-6 ≈4.89898e-6 -5.405e-10 ≈4.898e-6.

Divide by 2: 4.898e-6 /2=2.449e-6.

So [OH^-]=2.449e-6 → pOH= -log(2.449e-6)=5.61.

So pH=14-5.61=8.39.

But earlier approximation said [OH^-]=7.75e-6 → pOH=5.11 → pH=8.89.

Wait, that's a big difference. So why is the exact solution giving a lower pH than the approximation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb expression.

Wait, another approach: Use the exact formula without approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact [OH^-].

Wait, let me try plugging in x=2.449e-6 into the equation.

x² = (2.449e-6)^2 = approx 6e-12.

Kb * (0.01111 - x )=5.405e-10*(0.01111 -2.449e-6) ≈5.405e-10 *0.01111 ≈6e-12.

So x²=6e-12.

Which holds, so yes, x=2.449e-6 is correct.

So [OH^-]=2.449e-6 → pOH=5.61 → pH=8.39.

But wait, none of the options have 8.39 as the equivalence point. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: 4.26;8.52.

Option D:4.57;6.92.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the Kb and the [OH^-].

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me recheck.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa=4.73.

Kb =1e-14 /1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

So the Kb is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration of acetate. Let me re-calculate.

Moles of acetate:0.0005 mol.

Volume:45 cm³=0.045 L.

Concentration:0.0005 /0.045=0.01111 M. Correct.

Hmm. So why is the pH at equivalence point lower than what I thought earlier?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the activity coefficients or something else, but that's probably beyond the scope. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A says pH is 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence. My calculation for 25% is 4.26, which matches option A. But the equivalence point I calculated is 8.39, but option A has 8.52. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the pH at equivalence point more precisely.

Let me compute [OH^-] more accurately.

We have x=2.449e-6.

pOH =-log(2.449e-6).

Log(2.449)=0.3897.

So log(2.449e-6)=0.3897 -6= -5.6103 → pOH=5.6103.

pH=14-5.6103=8.3897 ≈8.39.

Hmm, but option A's equivalence point is 8.52, which is higher than 8.39.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me double-check.

The initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) of 0.0125 M acetic acid. Moles:0.0125 *0.04=0.0005 mol. Correct.

At equivalence, 5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. Moles NaOH:0.1 *0.005=0.0005. So yes, all acetic acid is neutralized.

So moles of acetate:0.0005.

Total volume:40+5=45 cm³=0.045 L.

Concentration of acetate:0.0005/0.045=0.01111 M.

Kb=5.405e-10.

So using exact calculation, [OH^-]=2.449e-6 → pH=8.39.

But none of the options have 8.39. The closest is option A at 8.52.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial assumption is that the solution at equivalence point is acetate. But perhaps it's the acetate and some residual acetic acid? No, at equivalence, all acetic acid is neutralized.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for weak base more accurately.

Wait, perhaps the initial concentration is 0.01111 M, and Kb is 5.405e-10.

The OH- concentration can be found using the formula:

[OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * C )

Which would be sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.01111 )= sqrt(6.0e-12)=7.75e-6 → pOH=5.11, pH=8.89.

But that's conflicting with the quadratic approach.

Wait, but if the quadratic solution is giving a lower [OH^-], perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic setup.

Another thought: perhaps I should have considered that in the quadratic equation, the equation is x² + (5.405e-10) x -6e-12=0.

But 5.405e-10 x is negligible compared to x² and the constant term. So perhaps the quadratic can be approximated as x² ≈6e-12 → x≈7.75e-6, which would give pH=8.89.

But why does the quadratic solution give a different result?

Wait, perhaps the earlier assumption that x is much smaller than C is not valid, but in reality, 7.75e-6 is much smaller than 0.01111 (which is 1.1e-2). So 7.75e-6 is about 0.7% of 0.01111, which is small enough to justify the approximation.

So why does the quadratic solution give a different result? It must have been a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the quadratic equation is set up incorrectly. Let me re-express the equation correctly.

The correct equation is:

x² = Kb * (C - x )

Which becomes x² + Kb x - Kb C =0.

So a=1, b=Kb=5.405e-10, c= -Kb*C= -5.405e-10 *0.01111= -6.0e-12.

So D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(6e-12).

Which is 2.921e-19 +2.4e-11=2.400292e-11.

sqrt(D)=4.9e-6.

So x= [ -b + sqrt(D) ]/(2a) → [ -5.405e-10 +4.9e-6 ]/(2).

Which is approx (4.9e-6)/2=2.45e-6.

But wait, this seems to contradict the approximation. Why is this happening?

Wait, perhaps I should not neglect the Kb x term. Let me compute the Kb x term.

Kb x=5.405e-10 *2.45e-6=1.326e-15, which is negligible compared to x²= (2.45e-6)^2=6.00e-12.

So perhaps the exact solution is x=2.45e-6, which is the same as the approximation when we ignore the Kb x term.

Wait, but that leads me back to the same confusion.

Wait, perhaps because I made a mistake in the sign. Let me double-check the quadratic formula.

The quadratic equation is ax² +bx +c=0.

In this case, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -6.0e-12.

So the roots are x= [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ]/(2a).

Wait, wait a second! I think I made a mistake in the sign of the discriminant in the quadratic formula.

The correct formula is x= [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ]/(2a).

In this case, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -6.0e-12.

So D= (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-6.0e-12) = 2.921e-19 + 2.4e-11 =2.400292e-11.

So sqrt(D)=4.9e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 ±4.9e-6 ]/(2).

We take the positive root: [ -5.405e-10 +4.9e-6 ] /2 → (4.9e-6 -5.4e-10)/2 ≈ (4.9e-6)/2=2.45e-6.

So [OH^-]=2.45e-6 → pOH=5.61 → pH=8.39.

But earlier, using the approximation, I got 7.75e-6 → pH=8.89.

So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the quadratic approach is more accurate, but why is there such a big difference?

Wait, let me compute the [OH^-] more accurately.

Using the quadratic solution, x=2.45e-6.

So Kb = x²/(C -x ) → (2.45e-6)^2 / (0.01111 -2.45e-6 )= (6.00e-12)/(0.0110855) =5.41e-10, which matches Kb=5.405e-10.

So the quadratic approach is correct.

Hmm, so the pH at equivalence point is 8.39. But none of the options have that. Looking back at the options.

Option A: 4.26;8.52.

Option D:4.57;6.92.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in Kb.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for Ka.

Ka=1.85e-5 → pKa=4.733.

Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 =5.405405405e-10.

So Kb=5.4054054e-10.

So when I calculate x, let me use more precise numbers.

Let me compute the discriminant more accurately.

D= (5.4054054e-10)^2 +4*(6.0e-12) → (5.4054054e-10)^2 is (5.4054054)^2 *1e-20.

5.4054054^2=29.21 (exactly, since 5.4054054 is 5 +0.4054054, and (5)^2=25, 2*5*0.4054054=4.054054, (0.4054054)^2≈0.16435, so total≈25+4.054054 +0.16435=29.2184)

So (5.4054054e-10)^2=29.2184e-20=2.92184e-19.

Adding 4*6e-12=2.4e-11 → 2.92184e-19 +2.4e-11=2.400292184e-11.

Square root of 2.400292184e-11 is:

Let me compute sqrt(2.400292184e-11):

We know that 4.89898^2=24, so sqrt(2.4e-11)=4.89898e-6.

Because (4.89898e-6)^2 = (4.89898)^2 *1e-12=24 *1e-12=2.4e-11.

So sqrt(2.400292184e-11)=4.89898e-6.

So x= [ -5.4054054e-10 +4.89898e-6 ]/(2) → (4.89898e-6 -5.4054054e-10)/2 → approximately 4.89898e-6 /2=2.44949e-6.

So [OH^-]=2.44949e-6 → pOH=5.61 → pH=8.39.

Hmm. So the pH is approximately 8.39. But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that at equivalence point, the solution is a buffer between acetate and acetic acid? No, no, because all the acetic acid has been neutralized, so it's just acetate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles of acetate. Let me recheck.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.0125 M *0.04 L=0.0005 mol. Correct.

At equivalence, all converted to acetate:0.0005 mol.

Volume:45 cm³=0.045 L.

Concentration:0.0005 /0.045=0.01111 M. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the pH at 25% titration and equivalence point, but perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% calculation.

Wait, let's recheck the 25% titration pH calculation.

At 25% titration, 1.25 cm³ of NaOH added.

Molarity of NaOH:0.1 M.

Moles NaOH:0.1 *0.00125=0.000125 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially:0.0005 mol.

So moles reacted:0.000125 mol.

Moles of acetic acid left:0.0005 -0.000125=0.000375 mol.

Moles of acetate formed:0.000125 mol.

Volume after addition:40 +1.25=41.25 cm³=0.04125 L.

Concentration of acetic acid: 0.000375 /0.04125=0.0090909 M.

Concentration of acetate:0.000125 /0.04125=0.0030303 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

pKa=4.733.

log(0.0030303/0.0090909)=log(1/3)= -0.477.

pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256 →4.26.

So that's correct.

So at 25% titration, pH is 4.26, which matches option A's first value.

But the equivalence point is 8.39, which isn't in the options. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, looking at option D:4.57;6.92.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula for weak base:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw - pKb )

Wait, no, that's not a standard formula. Alternatively, perhaps using the exact formula with [OH^-]=sqrt(Kb * C).

Wait, but that gives pH=8.89, which option A's equivalence point is 8.52.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm getting conflicting results. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence point is sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it should form a basic solution. But perhaps the calculation is correct, and the options have a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of pH at equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact calculation with precise numbers.

OH- concentration:2.449e-6.

pOH= -log(2.449e-6)=5.6103.

pH=14-5.6103=8.3897, which is approximately 8.39.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps I should re-evaluate the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the solution is diluted, the initial concentration is different. Let me recheck.

Wait, the problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: (0.05 M *20 cm³)/(40 cm³) =0.025 M? Wait, no, wait: 0.05 M *20 cm³ =0.001 mol. Divided by 40 cm³=0.04 L → 0.001/0.04=0.025 M.

Wait a minute! Did I make a mistake earlier?

Oh no! I think I made a mistake in the initial dilution calculation.

Yes, I think I did. Let me re-calculate this part.

Original volume:20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid.

Diluting with 20 cm³ water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: M = (M1 * V1) / (V1 +V2) → (0.05 *20) /40 = (1) /40=0.025 M.

Oh! I thought it was 0.0125 M earlier, but it's actually 0.025 M.

That changes everything. I must have made a mistake earlier.

So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M, not 0.0125 M.

That's a significant error. Let me redo all the calculations based on this.

So initial moles after dilution:0.025 M *0.04 L =0.001 mol.

So at equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH:0.001 /0.1 M=0.01 L=10 cm³.

Wait, earlier I thought 5 cm³, but now it's 10 cm³.

So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

At 25% titration, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

So let's re-calculate everything.

First, 25% titration:

Moles of NaOH added:0.1 M *0.0025 L=0.00025 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially:0.001 mol.

Moles reacted:0.00025 → remaining acetic acid:0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate formed:0.00025 mol.

Volume after addition:40 cm³ +2.5 cm³=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

Concentrations:

[HA]=0.00075 /0.0425=0.017647 M.

[A-]=0.00025 /0.0425=0.0058824 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

pKa=4.733.

log(0.0058824/0.017647)=log(0.3333)= -0.477.

pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256 →4.26.

So same as before. So at 25% titration, pH is 4.26. So that part is correct.

Now, equivalence point.

At equivalence, all 0.001 mol acetic acid is neutralized to acetate.

Volume is 40 +10=50 cm³=0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate:0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

Now, Kb=5.405e-10.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch isn't applicable here. It's a solution of acetate, a weak base.

Using the approximation:

[OH^-]=sqrt(Kb * C )=sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 M.

pOH= -log(1.04e-5)=4.982.

pH=14-4.982=9.018.

But that's around 9.02, which isn't matching any option.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Using exact calculation:

x² = Kb * (C -x )

x² =5.405e-10 * (0.02 -x )

Assume x is much smaller than 0.02.

So x²≈5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x≈1.04e-5.

pOH=4.982 →pH≈9.02.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I made another mistake.

Wait, no. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, initial moles after dilution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L=0.001 mol.

At equivalence, 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH added. Moles NaOH=0.1 *0.01=0.001 mol. Correct.

So acetate concentration is 0.001 mol /0.05 L=0.02 M. Correct.

So Kb=5.405e-10.

Using the exact quadratic approach:

x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 *0.02 )=0 → x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1.081e-11 )=2.921e-19 +4.324e-11=4.3240002921e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ]/(2) → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈6.576e-6/2=3.288e-6.

[OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=14-5.486=8.514.

Which is approximately 8.51, which matches option A's second value of 8.52.

Ah! So that's the mistake. Earlier, I miscalculated the diluted concentration, which led to wrong calculations for equivalence point. Now, with corrected diluted concentration, the equivalence point pH is around 8.51, which matches option A's 8.52.

So the correct answer is option A: pH at 25% is 4.26, equivalence point 8.52.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the diluted concentration of acetic acid after mixing 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Using the dilution formula:

\[
M_1V_1 = M_2V_2
\]

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = M_2 \times V_2 = 0.025 \times 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### At 25% Titration:
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume has been reached. The equivalence point requires 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH (calculated later), so 25% corresponds to 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \times 0.0025 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

After the reaction:
- Remaining moles of acetic acid: \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \),
- Moles of acetate ion formed: \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).

The total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} = 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} = 0.0058824 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right),
\]
where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) = 4.733 \):

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.0058824}{0.017647}\right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \, \text{(rounded to 4.26)}.
\]

### At Equivalence Point:
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The moles of NaOH required are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The volume of NaOH required is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Molarity of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The total volume at the equivalence point is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion acts as a weak base, and its hydrolysis reaction is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} = 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot C} = \sqrt{5.405 \times 10^{-10} \cdot 0.02} = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} = 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) = 4.982.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.982 = 9.018.
\]

However, using the exact quadratic solution gives a slightly lower pH of approximately 8.52, which matches the closest option.

### Final Answer:
At 25% titration, the pH is 4.26, and at the equivalence point, the pH is 8.52. These values match **Option A**.
