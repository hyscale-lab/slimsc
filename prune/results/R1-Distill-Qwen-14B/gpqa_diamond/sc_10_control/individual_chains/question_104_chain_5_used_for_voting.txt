Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, and both have masses similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. They gave the Doppler shifts: Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. We need to find how much longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, what's the RV method again? Oh right, the star moves towards and away from us due to the planet's orbit. The RV method measures the star's velocity towards us (blue shift) and away (red shift). The amplitude of this velocity is what's measured.

The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude of the RV (K) is given by some equation involving the masses, orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. Since both planets are detected, I think the inclination must be the same or we don't know, but the problem might assume circular orbits and face-on, so the same inclination. Wait, but the problem states that both planets have circular orbits, but doesn't say about the inclination. Hmm, but I think the formula accounts for the sine of the inclination, but maybe in this problem, it's assumed that the inclination is 90 degrees (edge-on), so sin(i) is 1. Or perhaps the shifts can be directly compared.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is K = ( (G * (M_p^3) ) / ( (M_p + M_s)^2 * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2π)/P ) )^(1/3) ) / c ?

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula. Oh wait, I'm just thinking, so let me try to recall.

The RV semi-amplitude is given by K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )

But since both planets are around stars of the same mass (solar masses), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), so M_p is much less than M_s, which is about the Sun's mass. So M_p + M_s ≈ M_s, which is the mass of the star.

So simplifying, K ≈ [ (G * P ) / (2π c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_s^(2/3) ) ) * [1/(sqrt(1-e²))] )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the denominator becomes 1. Both planets have similar masses, so M_p is the same for both. Therefore, the dependence on K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3) and proportional to M_p / M_s^(2/3).

Wait, but let's write the formula correctly. Another way I remember is K = (v) is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)).

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compare the two planets since many terms are the same.

Let’s denote:

K1 = 5 milliangstroms for Planet #1,

K2 = 7 milliangstroms for Planet #2.

Since the stars are identical, M_s is the same. The planets have similar masses, so M_p1 ≈ M_p2. Let's say M_p1 = M_p2 = M_p.

So, K is proportional to (M_p / (M_s^(2/3))) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Wait, I might have mixed up the exponents. Let me get the formula right.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) * ( 2π / (c * P) ) )^(1/3 )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach: since the formula for K involves the planet mass and the orbital period. Let me think in terms of scaling.

Suppose I have two planets around the same star (same M_s). The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_s + M_p) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(P))).

Wait, no, perhaps it's K ∝ (M_p) / ( (M_s)^(1) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s) ) ) * (M_s + M_p) ) ]^(-1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3) )

Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think of the ratio of K1 to K2.

Since M_p1 ≈ M_p2, and M_s is same for both, the ratio K1/K2 would be proportional to (P2/P1)^(1/3) ) * (something else), but maybe when P is longer, K is smaller.

Wait, perhaps the formula for K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

But wait, let me think again. From the formula, K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s)^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2π / (c P) )^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_s^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Since both M_p and M_s are same for both planets, the ratio of K1/K2 would be (P2/P1)^(1/3). Wait, no, because K1 is 5 and K2 is 7. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no. Let's think about it.

If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) ).

Because K1 = (something) * 1/P1^(1/3) ) and K2 = (same something) * 1/P2^(1/3) ). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, that can't be right. Let me see. Suppose P1 is smaller than P2. Then K1 would be larger than K2 because it's inversely proportional.

In our case, K1=5, K2=7. So K2 is larger than K1.

Wait, but if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then when P increases, K decreases. So if K2 is larger than K1, that would imply that P2 is smaller than P1. But wait, the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is smaller, then P2/P1 is less than 1.

Wait, but the question is about P2's period being longer. Let me just make sure.

The question says: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So if K2 > K1, and K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P2 must be smaller than P1. Because if P2 is smaller, then 1/P2^(1/3) is larger than 1/P1^(1/3), so K2 would be larger than K1.

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So let's write that:

K2/K1 = (P1 / P2) ^ (1/3)

We can rearrange this to find P2/P1.

Take both sides to the power of 3:

(K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Because P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3.

Calculating that: 5/7 is approximately 0.7143. Cubed, that's (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Wait, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then it's shorter, so it's not longer. But the options include 0.36 as option A, which is the ratio P2/P1. But the question is how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So the answer would be 0.36 times, meaning it's shorter, not longer. Therefore, the question must have a different setup. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_s) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)).

Wait, no. The correct formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s) ) )^(1/3) * (2π/(c P))^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 + (M_p/M_s))^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much less than M_s, (M_p/M_s) is negligible, so 1/(1 + ...) is approximately 1.

So K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / M_s )^(1/3) * (2π/(c P))^(1/3 )

Combine these terms:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p * 2π) / (M_s * c P) ) )^(1/3 )

So K is proportional to ( M_p / ( M_s * P ) )^(1/3 )

But since M_p is same for both, and M_s same for both, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3) )

So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3)

Which means that P ∝ 1/K^3

So P is inversely proportional to the cube of K.

Therefore, P1 / P2 = ( K2^3 ) / ( K1^3 )

So P2 = P1 * ( K1^3 ) / ( K2^3 )

Wait, no. Let's see.

If K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), then P ∝ 1/K^3.

So P1 = C / K1^3

P2 = C / K2^3

So P2 / P1 = (C/K2^3) / (C/K1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3

So P2 is (K1/K2)^3 times P1.

In numbers, (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125/343 ≈ 0.364

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's. So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. The answer would be approximately 0.36 times, so P2 is shorter. So the ratio is 0.36.

But looking at the options, option A is ~0.36, which would be the ratio P2 / P1.

Wait, but the question says, "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1, which is 36% of P1's period. So it's not longer; it's shorter. But the options include 0.36 as option A, which would be the ratio of P2 to P1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck the formula for K.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1/ P^(1/3) )

In that case, K is proportional to (M_p / (M_s)^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

But since M_p is same, and M_s is same, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So same as before.

So yes, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

So (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364, so P2 is 0.364 times P1. So the answer would be 0.36 times longer, which is option A.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that means P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1, which is shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So option A is 0.36, which would be the correct ratio, but the question is phrased as how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if the answer is 0.36, that means P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's actually shorter, not longer. So why is the option A correct? Because the question is asking how many times longer P2 is, so if it's shorter, the answer would be less than 1. So option A is the correct one.

Wait, maybe I got the ratio inverse. Let me make sure.

K2 is 7, K1 is 5. So K2 > K1.

Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), higher K means shorter P.

So higher K implies shorter period.

So K2 is higher than K1 → P2 is shorter than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1. So when the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1, the answer is less than 1. So the ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

So the answer is option A.

The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, given their respective radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes. Both planets orbit stars of the same mass, and the planets themselves have similar masses. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relationship Between \( K \) and \( P \):**
   Since \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), the orbital period \( P \) is inversely proportional to the cube of the RV semi-amplitude \( K \). This means:
   \[
   P \propto 1/K^3
   \]

2. **Ratio of Orbital Periods:**
   For two planets, the ratio of their orbital periods is given by:
   \[
   \frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
   \]
   where \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) are the RV semi-amplitudes of Planet #1 and Planet #2, respectively.

3. **Substitute Values:**
   - \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \)
   - \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \)
   Substituting these values:
   \[
   \frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
   \]

4. **Calculate the Ratio:**
   \[
   \frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
   \]

5. **Interpretation:**
   The result \( P_2/P_1 \approx 0.36 \) indicates that Planet #2's orbital period is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. However, the question asks how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1. Since \( P_2 < P_1 \), Planet #2's period is shorter, and the ratio \( P_2/P_1 \) directly answers the question.

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times longer than that of Planet #1. This corresponds to option **A**.

Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Since both planets are detected, I think the inclination must be the same or we don't know, but the problem might assume circular orbits and face-on, so the same inclination. Wait, but the problem states that both planets have circular orbits, but doesn't say about the inclination. Hmm, but I think the formula accounts for the sine of the inclination, but maybe in this problem, it's assumed that the inclination is 90 degrees (edge-on), so sin(i) is 1. Or perhaps the shifts can be directly compared.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is K = ( (G * (M_p^3) ) / ( (M_p + M_s)^2 * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2π)/P ) )^(1/3) ) / c ?

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula. Oh wait, I'm just thinking, so let me try to recall.

The RV semi-amplitude is given by K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )

But since both planets are around stars of the same mass (solar masses), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), so M_p is much less than M_s, which is about the Sun's mass. So M_p + M_s ≈ M_s, which is the mass of the star.

So simplifying, K ≈ [ (G * P ) / (2π c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_s^(2/3) ) ) * [1/(sqrt(1-e²))] )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the denominator becomes 1. Both planets have similar masses, so M_p is the same for both. Therefore, the dependence on K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3) and proportional to M_p / M_s^(2/3).

Wait, but let's write the formula correctly. Another way I remember is K = (v) is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)).

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compare the two planets since many terms are the same.

Let’s denote:

K1 = 5 milliangstroms for Planet #1,

K2 = 7 milliangstroms for Planet #2.

Since the stars are identical, M_s is the same. The planets have similar masses, so M_p1 ≈ M_p2. Let's say M_p1 = M_p2 = M_p.

So, K is proportional to (M_p / (M_s^(2/3))) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Wait, I might have mixed up the exponents. Let me get the formula right.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) * ( 2π / (c * P) ) )^(1/3 )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach: since the formula for K involves the planet mass and the orbital period. Let me think in terms of scaling.

Suppose I have two planets around the same star (same M_s). The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_s + M_p) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(P))).

Wait, no, perhaps it's K ∝ (M_p) / ( (M_s)^(1) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s) ) ) * (M_s + M_p) ) ]^(-1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3) )

Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think of the ratio of K1 to K2.

Since M_p1 ≈ M_p2, and M_s is same for both, the ratio K1/K2 would be proportional to (P2/P1)^(1/3) ) * (something else), but maybe when P is longer, K is smaller.

Wait, perhaps the formula for K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

But wait, let me think again. From the formula, K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s)^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2π / (c P) )^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_s^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Since both M_p and M_s are same for both planets, the ratio of K1/K2 would be (P2/P1)^(1/3). Wait, no, because K1 is 5 and K2 is 7. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no. Let's think about it.

If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) ).

Because K1 = (something) * 1/P1^(1/3) ) and K2 = (same something) * 1/P2^(1/3) ). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, that can't be right. Let me see. Suppose P1 is smaller than P2. Then K1 would be larger than K2 because it's inversely proportional.

In our case, K1=5, K2=7. So K2 is larger than K1.

Wait, but if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then when P increases, K decreases. So if K2 is larger than K1, that would imply that P2 is smaller than P1. But wait, the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is smaller, then P2/P1 is less than 1.

Wait, but the question is about P2's period being longer. Let me just make sure.

The question says: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So if K2 > K1, and K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P2 must be smaller than P1. Because if P2 is smaller, then 1/P2^(1/3) is larger than 1/P1^(1/3), so K2 would be larger than K1.

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So let's write that:

K2/K1 = (P1 / P2) ^ (1/3)

We can rearrange this to find P2/P1.

Take both sides to the power of 3:

(K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Because P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3.

Calculating that: 5/7 is approximately 0.7143. Cubed, that's (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Wait, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then it's shorter, so it's not longer. But the options include 0.36 as option A, which is the ratio P2/P1. But the question is how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So the answer would be 0.36 times, meaning it's shorter, not longer. Therefore, the question must have a different setup. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_s) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)).

Wait, no. The correct formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s) ) )^(1/3) * (2π/(c P))^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 + (M_p/M_s))^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much less than M_s, (M_p/M_s) is negligible, so 1/(1 + ...) is approximately 1.

So K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / M_s )^(1/3) * (2π/(c P))^(1/3 )

Combine these terms:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p * 2π) / (M_s * c P) ) )^(1/3 )

So K is proportional to ( M_p / ( M_s * P ) )^(1/3 )

But since M_p is same for both, and M_s same for both, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3) )

So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3)

Which means that P ∝ 1/K^3

So P is inversely proportional to the cube of K.

Therefore, P1 / P2 = ( K2^3 ) / ( K1^3 )

So P2 = P1 * ( K1^3 ) / ( K2^3 )

Wait, no. Let's see.

If K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), then P ∝ 1/K^3.

So P1 = C / K1^3

P2 = C / K2^3

So P2 / P1 = (C/K2^3) / (C/K1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3

So P2 is (K1/K2)^3 times P1.

In numbers, (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125/343 ≈ 0.364

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's. So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. The answer would be approximately 0.36 times, so P2 is shorter. So the ratio is 0.36.

But looking at the options, option A is ~0.36, which would be the ratio P2 / P1.

Wait, but the question says, "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1, which is 36% of P1's period. So it's not longer; it's shorter. But the options include 0.36 as option A, which would be the ratio of P2 to P1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck the formula for K.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1/ P^(1/3) )

In that case, K is proportional to (M_p / (M_s)^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

But since M_p is same, and M_s is same, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So same as before.

So yes, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

So (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364, so P2 is 0.364 times P1. So the answer would be 0.36 times longer, which is option A.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that means P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1, which is shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So option A is 0.36, which would be the correct ratio, but the question is phrased as how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if the answer is 0.36, that means P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's actually shorter, not longer. So why is the option A correct? Because the question is asking how many times longer P2 is, so if it's shorter, the answer would be less than 1. So option A is the correct one.

Wait, maybe I got the ratio inverse. Let me make sure.

K2 is 7, K1 is 5. So K2 > K1.

Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), higher K means shorter P.

So higher K implies shorter period.

So K2 is higher than K1 → P2 is shorter than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1. So when the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1, the answer is less than 1. So the ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

So the answer is option A.


The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, given their respective radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes. Both planets orbit stars of the same mass, and the planets themselves have similar masses. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relationship Between \( K \) and \( P \):**
   Since \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), the orbital period \( P \) is inversely proportional to the cube of the RV semi-amplitude \( K \). This means:
   \[
   P \propto 1/K^3
   \]

2. **Ratio of Orbital Periods:**
   For two planets, the ratio of their orbital periods is given by:
   \[
   \frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
   \]
   where \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) are the RV semi-amplitudes of Planet #1 and Planet #2, respectively.

3. **Substitute Values:**
   - \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \)
   - \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \)
   Substituting these values:
   \[
   \frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
   \]

4. **Calculate the Ratio:**
   \[
   \frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
   \]

5. **Interpretation:**
   The result \( P_2/P_1 \approx 0.36 \) indicates that Planet #2's orbital period is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. However, the question asks how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1. Since \( P_2 < P_1 \), Planet #2's period is shorter, and the ratio \( P_2/P_1 \) directly answers the question.

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times longer than that of Planet #1. This corresponds to option **A**.
