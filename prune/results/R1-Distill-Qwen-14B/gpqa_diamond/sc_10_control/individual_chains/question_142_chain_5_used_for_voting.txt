Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

First, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. The given matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that out. So each term is a projector onto |0> and |1>, respectively.

Wait, |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (0,0) and zeros elsewhere, same for |1><1|, which has 1 at (1,1). Adding them and multiplying by 1/2 would give me a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are 1/2 each and the off-diagonal are zero. So ρ looks like [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. Oh right, when you have a qubit, its state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. But wait, the density matrix's geometrical position is probably referring to its representation in the vector space.

I think the vector representation of a qubit state |ψ> is (x, y, z), where x = <x|ψ>, and similarly for y and z. But wait, for a density matrix ρ, the Bloch vector (x, y, z) is found using the formula x = Tr(ρ X), y = Tr(ρ Y), z = Tr(ρ Z), where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, Pauli matrices are X = [[0,1],[1,0]], Y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], Z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So let me compute each of these.

First, compute Tr(ρ X). The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. Let's compute ρ multiplied by X. ρ is diagonal, so when I multiply it with X, which swaps the basis vectors, I think it results in a matrix [[0,0.5], [0.5, 0]]. Taking the trace, which is 0.5 + 0 = 0.5? Wait, no, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements of the product. So ρX would be (1/2)(|0><0|X + |1><1|X). Hmm, perhaps a better way is to compute Tr(ρ X) directly.

Tr(ρ X) = (1/2) * Tr(|0><0| X ) + (1/2) Tr(|1><1| X )

We know that |0><0| X is X when applied to |0><0|. Because X|0> = |1>, so |0><0| X |0> = |0><0|1> = 0. Wait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.

Alternatively, Tr(ρ X) = (1/2)(Tr( |0><0| X ) + Tr( |1><1| X )).

The trace of |0><0| X is <0|X|0> = <0|1> = 0. Similarly, trace of |1><1| X is <1|X|1> = <1|0> = 0. So Tr(ρ X) is 0.5*(0 + 0) = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because for an equal mixture of |0> and |1>, the Bloch vector should be along the z-axis, since the state is a completely mixed state. So perhaps the x and y components are zero, and z is 1. Because the Bloch sphere has the z-axis corresponding to the mixture of |0> and |1>.

Wait, the Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is given by r = (x, y, z), where each component is Tr(ρ σ_i), with σ_i being the Pauli matrices. Let's compute each component.

Compute x = Tr(ρ X): X is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ρX is (1/2)[[0,1],[1,0]] * each term in ρ? Wait, maybe better to compute ρX directly.

ρ is diagonal: [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Multiplying by X: [[0.5*0, 0.5*1], [0.5*1, 0.5*0]] => [[0, 0.5], [0.5, 0]].

The trace is 0 + 0 = 0.

Similarly for Y: Y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So ρY = (1/2)* [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * each term. Wait, same as X, but with i's.

But when we take the trace, Y's diagonal elements are zero. So Tr(ρ Y) is 0.

And Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So ρZ is [[0.5, 0], [0, -0.5]]. The trace is 0.5 + (-0.5) = 0. So z would be Tr(ρ Z) / 2? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, wait, no. The formula is x = Tr(ρ X), same for y and z. So for the Pauli matrices scaled correctly.

Wait, the Bloch vector components are x = (Tr(ρ X))/2, y = (Tr(ρ Y))/2, z = (Tr(ρ Z))/2. Wait, no, wait. Let me check the formula.

I think the Bloch vector is given by r = (2 Re<ψ|X|ψ>, 2 Re<ψ|Y|ψ>, 2 Re<ψ|Z|ψ>), but for a density matrix, it's r = Tr(ρ X), Tr(ρ Y), Tr(ρ Z). Because for a pure state |ψ><ψ|, r would be the Bloch vector.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. For a density matrix ρ, the Bloch vector components are:

x = Tr(ρ X) / 2, y = Tr(ρ Y) / 2, z = Tr(ρ Z) / 2?

Wait, no, the formula for the Bloch vector is r = (Tr(ρ X), Tr(ρ Y), Tr(ρ Z)).

Wait, because for a single qubit state, the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector. So solving for r·σ, we get 2ρ - I = r_x X + r_y Y + r_z Z.

Taking the trace of both sides, the left side is Tr(2ρ - I) = 2 Tr(ρ) - Tr(I). Since ρ is a density matrix, Tr(ρ) =1. So Tr(2ρ - I) = 2*1 - 2 = 0. The right side is Tr(r_x X + r_y Y + r_z Z) = r_x Tr(X) + r_y Tr(Y) + r_z Tr(Z). But Tr(X)=Tr(Y)=Tr(Z)=0. So that doesn't help directly. Instead, perhaps better to compute each component.

Let me compute each Tr(ρ σ_i):

For X: Tr(ρ X) = (1/2)(Tr(|0><0| X ) + Tr(|1><1| X)).

Each Tr(|i><i| X) is <i| X |i> = 0, since X|i> = |i+1 mod 2>, so <i| X |i> is the inner product of |i> and |i+1>, which is zero.

So Tr(ρ X) = 0.

Similarly, Tr(ρ Y) is zero because Y has the same effect but with complex phases, but the trace would still be zero.

Tr(ρ Z) = (1/2)(Tr(|0><0| Z ) + Tr(|1><1| Z )).

Tr(|0><0| Z ) = <0| Z |0> = 1, since Z|0> = |0>, so <0|Z|0> =1.

Tr(|1><1| Z ) = <1| Z |1> = -1.

So Tr(ρ Z) = (1/2)(1 + (-1)) = 0. Huh, but that would make the Bloch vector (0,0,0). But wait, that can't be right, because the state is a completely mixed state.

Wait, I must have made a mistake. Because the density matrix given is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That's the maximally mixed state. Its Bloch vector should be at the origin, but wait, is that correct?

Wait, the maximally mixed state is equivalent to the completely depolarized state, which is (I + 0)/2, so r would be (0,0,0). Oh, right, that's correct. The maximally mixed state has no coherence and no bias along any axis, so it's at the center of the Bloch sphere. But wait, the Bloch sphere has radius 1, and the center is (0,0,0). So the state is in the center.

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which must be the correct answer. So the geometrical position is the origin.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state, which is equally likely to be in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). Such a state has no coherence and is unpolarized along any axis in the Bloch sphere representation.

To determine the geometrical position of this state in qubit space, we compute the Bloch vector \((x, y, z)\), where each component is given by \(x = \text{Tr}(\rho X)\), \(y = \text{Tr}(\rho Y)\), and \(z = \text{Tr}(\rho Z)\), with \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) being the Pauli matrices. 

1. **Compute \(x = \text{Tr}(\rho X)\):**  
   The Pauli \(X\) matrix is \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\). Multiplying \(\rho\) with \(X\) gives a matrix with zero diagonal elements. Taking the trace, \(\text{Tr}(\rho X) = 0\).

2. **Compute \(y = \text{Tr}(\rho Y)\):**  
   The Pauli \(Y\) matrix is \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}\). Similarly, multiplying \(\rho\) with \(Y\) results in a matrix with zero diagonal elements. Taking the trace, \(\text{Tr}(\rho Y) = 0\).

3. **Compute \(z = \text{Tr}(\rho Z)\):**  
   The Pauli \(Z\) matrix is \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\). Multiplying \(\rho\) with \(Z\) gives a diagonal matrix with elements \(0.5\) and \(-0.5\). Taking the trace, \(\text{Tr}(\rho Z) = 0.5 + (-0.5) = 0\).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \((x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in qubit space. This is consistent with the fact that the maximally mixed state has no preference along any axis and is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

**Option Analysis:**
- **A) \(r = (1,1,0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the origin.
- **B) \(r = (0,0,1)\):** Incorrect, as this would represent a state polarized along the \(z\)-axis, not the maximally mixed state.
- **C) \(r = (0,0,0)\):** Correct, as the maximally mixed state is at the origin.
- **D) \(r = (1,1,1)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the origin.

The correct geometrical position of the given density matrix in qubit space is \((0,0,0)\).

ρ is diagonal: [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Multiplying by X: [[0.5*0, 0.5*1], [0.5*1, 0.5*0]] => [[0, 0.5], [0.5, 0]].

The trace is 0 + 0 = 0.

Similarly for Y: Y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So ρY = (1/2)* [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * each term. Wait, same as X, but with i's.

But when we take the trace, Y's diagonal elements are zero. So Tr(ρ Y) is 0.

And Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So ρZ is [[0.5, 0], [0, -0.5]]. The trace is 0.5 + (-0.5) = 0. So z would be Tr(ρ Z) / 2? Wait, no, wait.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state, which is equally likely to be in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). Such a state has no coherence and is unpolarized along any axis in the Bloch sphere representation.

To determine the geometrical position of this state in qubit space, we compute the Bloch vector \((x, y, z)\), where each component is given by \(x = \text{Tr}(\rho X)\), \(y = \text{Tr}(\rho Y)\), and \(z = \text{Tr}(\rho Z)\), with \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) being the Pauli matrices.

2. **Compute \(y = \text{Tr}(\rho Y)\):**  
   The Pauli \(Y\) matrix is \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}\). Similarly, multiplying \(\rho\) with \(Y\) results in a matrix with zero diagonal elements. Taking the trace, \(\text{Tr}(\rho Y) = 0\).

3. **Compute \(z = \text{Tr}(\rho Z)\):**  
   The Pauli \(Z\) matrix is \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\). Multiplying \(\rho\) with \(Z\) gives a diagonal matrix with elements \(0.5\) and \(-0.5\). Taking the trace, \(\text{Tr}(\rho Z) = 0.5 + (-0.5) = 0\).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \((x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in qubit space. This is consistent with the fact that the maximally mixed state has no preference along any axis and is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

**Option Analysis:**

- **B) \(r = (0,0,1)\):** Incorrect, as this would represent a state polarized along the \(z\)-axis, not the maximally mixed state.
- **C) \(r = (0,0,0)\):** Correct, as the maximally mixed state is at the origin.
- **D) \(r = (1,1,1)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the origin.

The correct geometrical position of the given density matrix in qubit space is \((0,0,0)\).
