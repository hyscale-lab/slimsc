Okay, so I have this question about symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this.

First, what's SMEFT? Oh right, it's the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework where you take the Standard Model and add higher-dimensional operators to account for physics beyond the SM, like new particles or interactions at higher energy scales. These operators are organized by their dimension and the symmetries they respect.

The question is about which symmetries all these operators must obey. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The options given are combinations of these.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? Oh right, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like boost, rotation, and translation in space and time). So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz as a subset. But does SMEFT require Poincare or just Lorentz?

Well, the SM itself is a Poincare-invariant theory. In SMEFT, the higher-dimensional operators are built from SM fields, and they should also respect the same symmetries as the SM. So Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz, and I think that all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare, which means they also respect Lorentz. But wait, the question says "must be respected by all operators"—so if an operator doesn't respect Lorentz, it wouldn't be part of SMEFT. Same with Poincare?

Wait, but is Poincare symmetry automatically respected? Because the SM is Poincare invariant, and SMEFT is an effective theory based on it. So the effective operators are constructed in a way that maintains Poincare invariance. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are respected.

Then, what about CP and CPT? The SM is CP and CPT symmetric. But not all theories are. Wait, but SMEFT is based on the SM, so the operators must respect the same symmetries. So do operators in SMEFT have to respect CP and CPT?

Wait, I remember that in the SM, the CPT symmetry is a big deal. The SM is CPT symmetric, which means that any operator in the SM must respect CPT. But what about effective theories? Do they have to respect all the same symmetries? Because if you add an operator that doesn't respect a symmetry, like CPT, that would imply new physics that breaks that symmetry.

But wait, I'm not sure about whether CPT is automatically respected or not. Because operators in SMEFT are even-parity and have definite CPT properties. Oh wait, maybe SMEFT requires that all operators have definite CPT quantum numbers, but that doesn't necessarily mean the operators themselves are CPT-symmetric. No, wait. CPT symmetry is a spacetime symmetry, so operators in the theory must transform correctly under CPT.

Wait, but I think SMEFT doesn't necessarily require CPT symmetry for each operator. Because, for example, some operators might violate CPT, but that would imply that the low-energy theory (SMEFT) is not CPT symmetric, which would be a big deal. But the SM respects CPT, so SMEFT, as an effective theory, must also respect CPT. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

But wait, that's not exactly right. Because SMEFT is an effective theory, and adding higher-dimension operators doesn't necessarily break CPT unless the operators themselves violate it. So if the SM is CPT symmetric, the effective operators must also be CPT symmetric. Because otherwise, integrating out heavy fields (which are part of the UV completion) must preserve the CPT symmetry of the effective theory.

So operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

What about CP symmetry? The SM is CP symmetric, but adding operators could potentially violate CP. Wait, but in SMEFT, the operators are classified by their CP properties. For instance, operators can be CP-even or CP-odd. But wait, do the operators themselves have to respect CP symmetry, or can they break it?

Wait, no. Because the SM has CP symmetry, so the effective operators must transform in a way that maintains the overall CP symmetry of the theory. So I think that all operators in SMEFT must respect CP symmetry. Because if an operator violates CP, that would mean the effective theory isn't CP symmetric, which would imply new physics beyond the SM that breaks CP, but that's not necessarily prohibited. Wait, no, the question is about which symmetries are "must be respected by all operators."

Hmm, this is confusing. Let's break it down:

1. Lorentz symmetry: Operators must be Lorentz scalars. So yes, all must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. Poincare symmetry: Since it includes Lorentz and translations, but in the effective theory, operators are local, so Poincare is respected. So all operators must respect Poincare.

Wait, but wait: the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So 1 and 2 are correct.

CP symmetry: The operators in SMEFT can be either CP-even or CP-odd. Wait, no, that's about their quantum numbers. But the symmetry itself requires that the theory as a whole is CP invariant. Or do the individual operators have to be CP-symmetric? I think each operator must be a scalar under CP. Because if any operator isn't, then the theory would have a term that breaks CP. But the SM is CP-symmetric, so the effective theory must also be. Therefore, all operators must be CP eigenstates, so each operator has to respect CP. So 3 is correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Because in the SM, individual terms can be CP-odd, but the entire Lagrangian is CP symmetric. Wait, no, the SM is actually CP symmetric, so the Lagrangian doesn't have any CP-odd terms. So in SMEFT, the higher-dimensional operators must also preserve CP. So each operator must be a CP eigenstate, meaning that the operator either is CP-even or CP-odd, but the entire Lagrangian remains CP symmetric.

Wait, no, wait. The operators themselves are part of the Lagrangian, so if an operator is CP-odd, then the Lagrangian would have a CP-odd term, which would violate CP symmetry. But the SM is CP symmetric, so the effective theory must also be. Therefore, the operators must be CP-even. Or is that not the case?

Wait, let's think. Suppose you have a dimension-6 operator that's CP-odd. Then, when you add it to the SM Lagrangian, which is CP-even, the total Lagrangian would have a CP-odd term. So the theory would no longer be CP symmetric. But the SM is CP symmetric, so the effective theory must also be CP symmetric. Therefore, all operators must be CP-even. So 3 is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Because in SMEFT, the operators are classified by their chiral properties, including their CP properties. For example, the operator (say) (WW)^2 is CP-even, while something like W Wtilde W Wtilde would be CP-odd. Wait, no, I think the WW^3 operator is CP even. But regardless, each operator must have a well-defined CP transformation property, but the full theory must be CP symmetric. So perhaps each operator must be CP even, but that's not necessarily true. Because if you have a combination of even and odd terms, but for the entire Lagrangian to be CP symmetric, perhaps the coefficients of the operators must be such that the sum respects CP. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe I should look at it another way. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator doesn't respect a symmetry (like CP), then the operator would violate that symmetry. But SMEFT is built on the SM, which respects CP symmetry, so the effective theory must preserve CP. So all operators must respect CP symmetry.

Alternatively, think about the SMEFT operators: their form is dictated by the symmetries of the SM. For example, if the operator is not a scalar under CP, it wouldn't be allowed. So yes, all operators must respect CP symmetry.

So 3 is correct.

But wait, another angle: the SM is a CPT symmetric theory. Therefore, any effective theory derived from it must also respect CPT symmetry. So all operators must transform correctly under CPT. But that doesn't necessarily mean they have to be CPT-symmetric by themselves. Because CPT symmetry is a combination of C, P, and T. So if an operator is, say, P-odd and C-even, then under CPT, it would have a certain transformation. But the operator as a whole must be a scalar under CPT. So each operator must transform as a scalar under CPT. Therefore, each operator must have a definite CPT transformation property, but the operators themselves don't have to be CPT-symmetric. However, the overall theory would respect CPT because the SM does. So, do the operators in SMEFT have to respect CPT?

Wait, CPT symmetry is a product of C, P, and T. So for the SMEFT Lagrangian to be CPT symmetric, each operator must transform as a scalar under CPT. So each operator must have a definite CPT quantum number, but the operator itself can change under CPT, but the Lagrangian remains the same. So the operator doesn't have to be CPT-symmetric, but the combination of all operators must make the Lagrangian invariant under CPT.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetry must be respected by all operators. So, for example, an operator could change under CPT. So the operator doesn't have to respect CPT symmetry (i.e., be invariant under it), but the entire Lagrangian must be. So maybe the operators don't have to individually respect CPT, but the Lagrangian does. So in that case, the answer would not include CPT.

Wait, but the question says "must be respected by all operators." So if an operator isn't invariant under a symmetry, it doesn't respect that symmetry. So if the operator changes under CPT, then it doesn't respect CPT symmetry. But the Lagrangian as a whole must be CPT invariant.

Wait, that's a crucial point. The operators themselves may not be invariant under CPT, but the sum of their contributions in the Lagrangian must be invariant. So the individual operators don't need to respect CPT symmetry, but the combination must. Therefore, the operators might not respect CPT individually.

So, the symmetries that all operators must respect are Lorentz, Poincare, and CP? Or just Lorentz and Poincare?

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me think again.

Symmetries that the theory must respect are:

- Poincare: includes Lorentz and translations. So operators must be Poincare scalars. So both 1 and 2 must be respected.

- CP and CPT: The theory must respect these, but the individual operators may not. For example, a term could be CP-odd, but in the Lagrangian it would have to have a coefficient that is also CP-odd to make the overall Lagrangian CP-even. But wait, no, because the SM has CP-even terms. So in SMEFT, to keep the theory CP-symmetric, all operators must be CP-even, right? Because if you have a CP-odd operator, its inclusion would break CP unless the coefficient also has a phase that makes the product CP-even. But in the SM, all terms are CP-even, so in SMEFT, the operators must also be CP-even, because otherwise the theory would have a term that violates CP.

Wait, no, because the effective operators are additions to the SM. So the SM is CP-even, so any operator added must also be CP-even to preserve the overall CP symmetry. So each operator must be CP-even. So that would require that all operators respect CP symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Because in the Standard Model, the CKM matrix can lead to CP violation. But in that case, the SM has terms that are CP-odd, but the overall Lagrangian remains CP-symmetric because the combination of terms is. Hmm, no, that's not right. The SM with CKM phases does violate CP. So wait, the SM is not CP-symmetric. Oh! So I was wrong earlier. The SM is not CP-symmetric because of the CKM matrix. So that changes things.

Wait, no. The SM is not CP-symmetric. The presence of the CKM matrix introduces CP violation. So the SM itself doesn't respect CP. Therefore, SMEFT, built on the SM, doesn't need to respect CP either. So the operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP. So 3 is incorrect.

Wait, that's a game-changer. Because if the SM isn't CP-symmetric, then SMEFT operators don't have to be. So the question is which symmetries must be respected.

So step by step:

1. Lorentz symmetry: All operators must be Lorentz scalars. So yes, 1 is correct.

2. Poincare symmetry: Since it includes Lorentz and translations, yes, but in the context of field theories, operators must be local, so yes, 2 is correct.

3. CP symmetry: SM doesn't respect CP, so SMEFT doesn't need to. So 3 is incorrect.

4. CPT symmetry: The SM is CPT-symmetric. So even though it's not CP-symmetric, the SM is CPT-symmetric. Therefore, the SMEFT must respect CPT. Because any violation of CPT would be a big issue—like acausal behavior or non-unitarity.

So, the operators must respect CPT.

So now, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4), but not CP (3).

Wait, but earlier I thought that Poincare is correct, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected. Wait, but in the SMEFT, all operators are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory. So Poincare is automatically satisfied if Lorentz and translation invariance are. But translation invariance is part of the SM. So do SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare symmetry?

Hmm, perhaps more accurately, Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translation. Since the SM is a Poincare-invariant theory, the SMEFT must also be. Therefore, operators must be Poincare scalars, so 2 is correct.

But wait, in the question, the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So if 1,2,4 are correct, that's option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that SMEFT doesn't have to respect CP because SM doesn't. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the operator doesn't respect Lorentz, it's not allowed. Same for Poincare and CPT.

So answer would be 1,2,4. So option C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by incorporating higher-dimensional operators to account for physics beyond the SM. These operators must respect the symmetries of the SM, as SMEFT is derived from it. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: All operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars. This is a fundamental requirement because SMEFT, like the SM, is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a local effective field theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry. This ensures that the operators are local and maintain the structure of the SM.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM is not CP-symmetric due to the presence of CP-violating phases in the CKM matrix. Consequently, SMEFT does not need to respect CP symmetry either. Operators in SMEFT can have CP-odd components, and the theory as a whole does not require CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM is CPT-symmetric, and SMEFT, as an effective theory derived from the SM, must also respect CPT symmetry. Any violation of CPT symmetry would lead to significant issues, such as acausality or non-unitarity, which are not observed in the SM or SMEFT.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not required because the SM itself does not respect CP symmetry.

**Correct Answer**: C) 1, 2, 4.

Hmm, perhaps more accurately, Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translation. Since the SM is a Poincare-invariant theory, the SMEFT must also be. Therefore, operators must be Poincare scalars, so 2 is correct.

But wait, in the question, the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So if 1,2,4 are correct, that's option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that SMEFT doesn't have to respect CP because SM doesn't. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the operator doesn't respect Lorentz, it's not allowed. Same for Poincare and CPT.

So answer would be 1,2,4. So option C.

**Correct Answer**: C) 1, 2, 4.

Answer: C
