Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this quantum mechanics problem, right? Let me read through the question carefully. 

So, the problem is about a bound system of two nucleons (like a deuteron or something) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. We need to figure out which partial wave is not permitted based on the given conditions.

The question states that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T=0. Hmm, so I need to use this to find the possible or impossible partial waves.

First, let me understand the initial state. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So, 1S0 means S=0, L=0, and J=0, right? Because 2S+1 would be 1 for S=0. So, the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

When they emit a particle X, the system becomes an NN state (the two nucleons) and the emitted particle X. The NN state is the final state. So, the initial state was NN in 1S0, and they emit X, so the final state is NN in some state plus X.

Wait, but the problem is about the partial waves of X. Each option gives a different state for X. The options are:

A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p
B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p
C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f
D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s

Wait, no, the options are the final states of the NN system. Wait, no, let me read the options again. Oh, the question says the options are the final states, so for each option, the first part is the initial state (1S0), and the second part is the emitted particle X in a specific state.

Wait no, the way it's written is like 1S0 -> something. Wait, no, the question says, "Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X?" So the emitted particle X has a certain angular momentum state, denoted by the lowercase letters s, p, d, f. So each option is an initial state (1S0) emitting X in a specific state, and the NN system ends up in a state with certain quantum numbers.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The question says, "the term symbol (e.g., 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J)..." So the initial state is 1S0, which is (1)S0, so S=0, L=0, J=0.

When they emit X, the NN system will have a new state with certain T, S, L. And X has its own angular momentum state (like s, p, etc.), which will influence the total angular momentum.

But the problem is about the parity and angular momentum conservation, as well as the Pauli condition on isospin.

Wait, the question says that the NN system in the final state has T=0. So T(NN) = 0.

The Pauli condition is given as T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since T=0, that equation becomes 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parities. If one is even, the other must be odd, and vice versa.

So, S is the spin of the NN system, and L is the orbital angular momentum. Wait, but S here is the total spin? Or is it another S? Hmm, the question says, "T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)." So I think S here is the total spin of the NN system. So for each option, I need to find the NN's spin S and orbital L, then check if S + L is odd (since 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S+L ≡ 1 mod 2).

But wait, the initial state was 1S0, which has S=0 (since it's 1S0 → S=0, L=0, J=0). So the initial state has S=0, L=0. After emission, the NN state will have some S' and L' values.

Wait, but how does the emission affect the NN state? Well, when the NN emits a particle X, the total angular momentum and isospin must be conserved. Also, the parity must be conserved.

So, parity of the initial state: the initial state is 1S0, so parity is (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1. But wait, parity is also affected by the intrinsic parity of the emitted particle.

Wait, the initial parity is the parity of the NN system: for a state with orbital angular momentum L, parity is (-1)^L. So initial parity is 1 (since L=0) for the NN system.

When the NN system emits a particle X, the parity of the total system (NN + X) must be conserved? Or is it parity of the initial and final states of the NN system that's considered?

Wait, the parity of the system before and after the emission must be conserved, considering the intrinsic parities of the particles.

So, the initial parity is (parity of NN) × (parity of X). Wait, no, the parity is a property of the entire system. When the NN emits X, the parity of the NN system after emission must be considered.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the parity of the initial state and the parity of the final state, and ensure they are equal.

The initial state's parity is for the NN system: parity = (-1)^L_initial. Since L_initial is 0, parity is +1.

The final state is the NN system in some state with L_final and S_final, and they emit X. The parity of the final state of the NN system would be (-1)^L_final.

But wait, the parity of the entire process (initial to final) must be the same. Because parity is a multiplicative quantum number.

Alternatively, the parity of the process would be the product of the intrinsic parity of X and the parity change due to orbital angular momentum.

Wait, when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum state (l) of the emitted particle affects the parity. The orbital angular momentum between the NN and X is l, so the parity from this is (-1)^l.

But the parity of the emitted particle X is given as intrinsic parity -1. So, the parity change would be (-1)^l × (intrinsic parity of X).

Wait, but the overall parity before and after must match. The initial parity is for the NN system, which is +1.

The final parity is the parity of the NN system (which has parity (-1)^L_final) multiplied by the parity of X's emission, which is (-1)^l × (-1) (since X has intrinsic parity -1). So, the parity of the entire final state (NN and X) is [(-1)^L_final] × [ (-1)^l × (-1) ].

Wait, but the initial parity is just the parity of the NN system, which is +1. So, the final parity must be the same as the initial.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the parity of the initial state and the parity of the final state of the NN system.

Wait, perhaps the parity of the NN system must be the same before and after the emission, considering the parity of the emitted particle and the orbital angular momentum involved.

Alternatively, the parity conservation implies that (parity of NN initial state) × (parity of X) = (parity of NN final state) × (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum of X.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation:

parity_initial = parity_final × parity_X × (-1)^l.

Because when X is emitted, the orbital angular momentum l contributes a factor of (-1)^l to the parity.

So, parity_initial (NN) = parity_final (NN) × parity_X × (-1)^l.

Let me plug in the numbers. The initial parity of the NN system is (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = 1.

Parity_final (NN) is (-1)^L_final.

Parity_X is given as -1.

So,

1 = (-1)^L_final × (-1) × (-1)^l.

Simplify the right side:

Multiply the factors: (-1) * (-1)^l = (-1)^(l+1).

So,

1 = (-1)^L_final × (-1)^(l + 1).

Which can be written as:

1 = (-1)^(L_final + l +1).

Taking both sides to the power of parity, so:

(-1)^0 = (-1)^(L_final + l +1).

Which implies that L_final + l + 1 must be even. Because (-1)^even = 1.

So,

L_final + l + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2.

Which simplifies to:

L_final + l ≡ 1 mod 2.

So, L_final and l must have opposite parities. If l is even, L_final is odd, and vice versa.

That's one condition.

The other condition comes from the Pauli statistics condition given: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

We know T=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

So, S and L must have opposite parities.

Now, for each option, I need to find what the final state's S and L are, and the emitted X's l (denoted by the letter), then check if the conditions are satisfied.

But wait, the question is about the partial wave of X. The lowercase letters s, p, d, f denote the orbital angular momentum l of the emitted particle X. So, s is l=0, p is l=1, d is l=2, f is l=3.

So, each option gives the state of X as s, p, d, or f. So, for each option, the emitted X has l=0, 1, 2, or 3.

Now, the problem is about whether the partial wave (i.e., the value of l) is allowed or not. The question asks which is not permitted.

So, for each option:

1. Determine the emitted X's l (from the letter).
2. Determine the final NN's L and S.
3. Check the two conditions:
   a. From parity: L_final + l ≡ 1 mod 2.
   b. From Pauli: S + L_final ≡ 1 mod 2.

If any condition is violated, that option is not permitted.

But wait, how do I find the final NN's L and S from the options?

Wait, the options give the final state of the NN system. For example, option A says 7D1 + p. Wait, no, each option is written as 1S0 -> something. The something is the emitted particle's state, right?

Wait, the question says: "the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum."

So, the emitted X's state is written as, say, 7D1. Wait, no, the options are given as 1S0 -> 3P0 + s, etc. So the part after the arrow is the final state of the NN system plus the emitted X.

Wait, wait. Maybe the options are:

For example, option D is 1S0 -> 3P0 + s.

So the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is NN in 3P0 and X in s state.

But X's state is in s, which is l=0.

Wait, perhaps the notation is that each option is the initial state (1S0) emitting X into a specific state (like p, s, etc.), and the NN goes into a specific state (like 3P0, etc.).

So in each option, the NN's state is given, and the X's state is given by the lowercase letter.

Wait, maybe the arrow is showing the decay: 1S0 (initial) → NN state (final) + X (emitted in some state).

So each option is the initial state (1S0) emitting X in a specific l state (s, p, d, f) and the NN ending up in a specific (2S'+1)L'(J') state.

So, for each option, the final NN state is given, and the X's l is given by the lowercase letter.

So, for option A: the final NN state is 7D1. Let me parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 7D1 would be (2S+1)=7 → S=3, L=D=2, J=1.

Wait, but wait, 2S+1=7 implies S=3, since 2*3 +1=7.

So for option A:

NN final state: S=3, L=2, J=1.

X's l: p → l=1.

So, for condition a (parity), L_final + l must be odd.

L_final is 2 (even), l=1 (odd). So 2+1=3 → odd. So condition a is satisfied.

For condition b (Pauli): S + L_final = 3 + 2 =5 → 5 mod 2 is 1. So condition is satisfied.

So both conditions are met, so this option is allowed.

Option B: 3S1 + p.

So, final NN state: 3S1. (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L=S=0? Wait, no: the term is 3S1. So L is S? Wait, no. The term is (2S+1)L(J). So 3S1: 3 is (2S+1), so S=1. L is S? No, the L is denoted by the letter. So S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 3S1: (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S? No, L is a capital letter. So L would be S? Wait, no. Wait, the letter after the number is the orbital angular momentum. So 3S1: L is S, which is a lowercase 's'? No, wait, no. The letters for L are S (L=0), P (L=1), D (L=2), F (L=3), etc. So for term symbol 3S1: (2S+1)=3 → S=1, L=S → no, wait, no. Because the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 3S1 would be S=1, L=0 (since S is the orbital angular momentum letter?), no, wait, no. Wait, the second letter in the term symbol is the orbital angular momentum. So for 3S1, the first part is 3, which is (2S+1)=3 → S=1. The second part is S, which is the orbital angular momentum L=0 (because S is the letter for L=0). So L=0.

So, for option B: NN's S=1, L=0. X's l is p → l=1.

Check conditions.

Condition a: L_final + l = 0 +1=1 → odd. So condition a is satisfied.

Condition b: S + L_final =1 +0=1 → 1 mod2. So condition satisfied.

So both conditions met. So option B is allowed.

Option C: 3D3 + f.

Let's parse the final NN state: 3D3. (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is D, which is L=2. J=3.

X's state is f → l=3.

Condition a: L_final + l = 2 +3=5 → odd. So condition a is satisfied.

Condition b: S + L_final =1 +2=3 → 1 mod2. So condition satisfied.

So option C is allowed.

Option D: 3P0 + s.

Final NN state: 3P0. (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is P → L=1.

X's l is s → l=0.

Condition a: L_final + l =1 +0=1 → odd. So condition a is satisfied.

Condition b: S + L_final =1 +1=2 → 0 mod2. So 2 mod2 is 0.

But condition requires S + L ≡1 mod2. So this is not satisfied.

So condition b is violated here. So this option would be disallowed.

Wait, but wait, option D: 3P0 + s.

So, let's double-check:

NN final state: 3P0 → S=1, L=1.

X's l is s → l=0.

So, condition a: L_final + l =1 +0=1 → odd → condition met.

Condition b: S + L_final =1 +1=2 → even → 0 mod2. So 0 ≡1? No. So condition not met. So this partial wave is not permitted.

So the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So option D is the one not allowed.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Initial State**: The system starts in the 1S0 state, which corresponds to \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The parity of the initial state is \( (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \).

2. **Final State**: After emitting a particle \( X \), the NN system ends in a new state with total spin \( S' \), orbital angular momentum \( L' \), and isospin \( T' \). The emitted particle \( X \) has intrinsic parity \( -1 \) and orbital angular momentum \( l \), denoted by the lowercase letters \( s \), \( p \), \( d \), or \( f \) (\( l = 0, 1, 2, 3 \), respectively).

3. **Conservation Laws**:
   - **Parity Conservation**: The parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state. The parity of the NN system is \( (-1)^{L'} \), and the parity of \( X \) is \( (-1)^l \times (-1) \) (including its intrinsic parity). Thus:
     \[
     (-1)^L = (-1)^{L'} \times (-1)^l \times (-1)
     \]
     Simplifying, \( L' + l + 1 \) must be even, meaning \( L' + l \) is odd.
   - **Pauli Condition**: The isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy:
     \[
     T' = S' + L' + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)
     \]
     Since \( T' = 0 \), this implies \( S' + L' \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), meaning \( S' \) and \( L' \) must have opposite parities.

4. **Analysis of Each Option**:
   - **Option A**: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)
     - Final NN state: \( 7D1 \). From the term symbol, \( S' = 3 \), \( L' = 2 \), \( J' = 1 \).
     - \( X \): \( l = 1 \) (denoted by \( p \)).
     - Parity check: \( L' + l = 2 + 1 = 3 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
     - Pauli check: \( S' + L' = 3 + 2 = 5 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
     - **Allowed**.

   - **Option B**: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3S1 \). From the term symbol, \( S' = 1 \), \( L' = 0 \), \( J' = 1 \).
     - \( X \): \( l = 1 \) (denoted by \( p \)).
     - Parity check: \( L' + l = 0 + 1 = 1 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
     - Pauli check: \( S' + L' = 1 + 0 = 1 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
     - **Allowed**.

   - **Option C**: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3D3 \). From the term symbol, \( S' = 1 \), \( L' = 2 \), \( J' = 3 \).
     - \( X \): \( l = 3 \) (denoted by \( f \)).
     - Parity check: \( L' + l = 2 + 3 = 5 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
     - Pauli check: \( S' + L' = 1 + 2 = 3 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
     - **Allowed**.

   - **Option D**: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3P0 \). From the term symbol, \( S' = 1 \), \( L' = 1 \), \( J' = 0 \).
     - \( X \): \( l = 0 \) (denoted by \( s \)).
     - Parity check: \( L' + l = 1 + 0 = 1 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
     - Pauli check: \( S' + L' = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is even. Condition **not** satisfied.
     - **Not Allowed**.

5. **Conclusion**: The partial wave not permitted is the one corresponding to Option D.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this quantum mechanics problem, right? Let me read through the question carefully. 

So, the problem is about a bound system of two nucleons (like a deuteron or something) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. We need to figure out which partial wave is not permitted based on the given conditions.

The question states that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T=0. Hmm, so I need to use this to find the possible or impossible partial waves.

First, let me understand the initial state. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So, 1S0 means S=0, L=0, and J=0, right? Because 2S+1 would be 1 for S=0. So, the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

When they emit a particle X, the system becomes an NN state (the two nucleons) and the emitted particle X. The NN state is the final state. So, the initial state was NN in 1S0, and they emit X, so the final state is NN in some state plus X.

Wait, but the problem is about the partial waves of X. Each option gives a different state for X. The options are:

A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p
B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p
C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f
D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s

Wait, no, the options are the final states of the NN system. Wait, no, let me read the options again. Oh, the question says the options are the final states, so for each option, the first part is the initial state (1S0), and the second part is the emitted particle X in a specific state.

Wait no, the way it's written is like 1S0 -> something. Wait, no, the question says, "Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X?" So the emitted particle X has a certain angular momentum state, denoted by the lowercase letters s, p, d, f. So each option is an initial state (1S0) emitting X in a specific state, and the NN system ends up in a state with certain quantum numbers.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The question says, "the term symbol (e.g., 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J)..." So the initial state is 1S0, which is (1)S0, so S=0, L=0, J=0.

When they emit X, the NN system will have a new state with certain T, S, L. And X has its own angular momentum state (like s, p, etc.), which will influence the total angular momentum.

But the problem is about the parity and angular momentum conservation, as well as the Pauli condition on isospin.

Wait, the question says that the NN system in the final state has T=0. So T(NN) = 0.

The Pauli condition is given as T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since T=0, that equation becomes 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parities. If one is even, the other must be odd, and vice versa.

So, S is the spin of the NN system, and L is the orbital angular momentum. Wait, but S here is the total spin? Or is it another S? Hmm, the question says, "T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)." So I think S here is the total spin of the NN system. So for each option, I need to find the NN's spin S and orbital L, then check if S + L is odd (since 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S+L ≡ 1 mod 2).

But wait, the initial state was 1S0, which has S=0 (since it's 1S0 → S=0, L=0, J=0). So the initial state has S=0, L=0. After emission, the NN state will have some S' and L' values.

Wait, but how does the emission affect the NN state? Well, when the NN emits a particle X, the total angular momentum and isospin must be conserved. Also, the parity must be conserved.

So, parity of the initial state: the initial state is 1S0, so parity is (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1. But wait, parity is also affected by the intrinsic parity of the emitted particle.

Wait, the initial parity is the parity of the NN system: for a state with orbital angular momentum L, parity is (-1)^L. So initial parity is 1 (since L=0) for the NN system.

When the NN system emits a particle X, the parity of the total system (NN + X) must be conserved? Or is it parity of the initial and final states of the NN system that's considered?

Wait, the parity of the system before and after the emission must be conserved, considering the intrinsic parities of the particles.

So, the initial parity is (parity of NN) × (parity of X). Wait, no, the parity is a property of the entire system. When the NN emits X, the parity of the NN system after emission must be considered.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the parity of the initial state and the parity of the final state, and ensure they are equal.

The initial state's parity is for the NN system: parity = (-1)^L_initial. Since L_initial is 0, parity is +1.

The final state is the NN system in some state with L_final and S_final, and they emit X. The parity of the final state of the NN system would be (-1)^L_final.

But wait, the parity of the entire process (initial to final) must be the same. Because parity is a multiplicative quantum number.

Alternatively, the parity of the process would be the product of the intrinsic parity of X and the parity change due to orbital angular momentum.

Wait, when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum state (l) of the emitted particle affects the parity. The orbital angular momentum between the NN and X is l, so the parity from this is (-1)^l.

But the parity of the emitted particle X is given as intrinsic parity -1. So, the parity change would be (-1)^l × (intrinsic parity of X).

Wait, but the overall parity before and after must match. The initial parity is for the NN system, which is +1.

The final parity is the parity of the NN system (which has parity (-1)^L_final) multiplied by the parity of X's emission, which is (-1)^l × (-1) (since X has intrinsic parity -1). So, the parity of the entire final state (NN and X) is [(-1)^L_final] × [ (-1)^l × (-1) ].

Wait, but the initial parity is just the parity of the NN system, which is +1. So, the final parity must be the same as the initial.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the parity of the initial state and the parity of the final state of the NN system.

Wait, perhaps the parity of the NN system must be the same before and after the emission, considering the parity of the emitted particle and the orbital angular momentum involved.

Alternatively, the parity conservation implies that (parity of NN initial state) × (parity of X) = (parity of NN final state) × (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum of X.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation:

parity_initial = parity_final × parity_X × (-1)^l.

Because when X is emitted, the orbital angular momentum l contributes a factor of (-1)^l to the parity.

So, parity_initial (NN) = parity_final (NN) × parity_X × (-1)^l.

Let me plug in the numbers. The initial parity of the NN system is (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = 1.

Parity_final (NN) is (-1)^L_final.

Parity_X is given as -1.

So,

1 = (-1)^L_final × (-1) × (-1)^l.

Simplify the right side:

Multiply the factors: (-1) * (-1)^l = (-1)^(l+1).

So,

1 = (-1)^L_final × (-1)^(l + 1).

Which can be written as:

1 = (-1)^(L_final + l +1).

Taking both sides to the power of parity, so:

(-1)^0 = (-1)^(L_final + l +1).

Which implies that L_final + l + 1 must be even. Because (-1)^even = 1.

So,

L_final + l + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2.

Which simplifies to:

L_final + l ≡ 1 mod 2.

So, L_final and l must have opposite parities. If l is even, L_final is odd, and vice versa.

That's one condition.

The other condition comes from the Pauli statistics condition given: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

We know T=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

So, S and L must have opposite parities.

Now, for each option, I need to find what the final state's S and L are, and the emitted X's l (denoted by the letter), then check if the conditions are satisfied.

But wait, the question is about the partial wave of X. The lowercase letters s, p, d, f denote the orbital angular momentum l of the emitted particle X. So, s is l=0, p is l=1, d is l=2, f is l=3.

So, each option gives the state of X as s, p, d, or f. So, for each option, the emitted X has l=0, 1, 2, or 3.

Now, the problem is about whether the partial wave (i.e., the value of l) is allowed or not. The question asks which is not permitted.

So, for each option:

1. Determine the emitted X's l (from the letter).
2. Determine the final NN's L and S.
3. Check the two conditions:
   a. From parity: L_final + l ≡ 1 mod 2.
   b. From Pauli: S + L_final ≡ 1 mod 2.

If any condition is violated, that option is not permitted.

But wait, how do I find the final NN's L and S from the options?

Wait, the options give the final state of the NN system. For example, option A says 7D1 + p. Wait, no, each option is written as 1S0 -> something. The something is the emitted particle's state, right?

Wait, the question says: "the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum."

So, the emitted X's state is written as, say, 7D1. Wait, no, the options are given as 1S0 -> 3P0 + s, etc. So the part after the arrow is the final state of the NN system plus the emitted X.

Wait, wait. Maybe the options are:

For example, option D is 1S0 -> 3P0 + s.

So the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is NN in 3P0 and X in s state.

But X's state is in s, which is l=0.

Wait, perhaps the notation is that each option is the initial state (1S0) emitting X into a specific state (like p, s, etc.), and the NN goes into a specific state (like 3P0, etc.).

So in each option, the NN's state is given, and the X's state is given by the lowercase letter.

Wait, maybe the arrow is showing the decay: 1S0 (initial) → NN state (final) + X (emitted in some state).

So each option is the initial state (1S0) emitting X in a specific l state (s, p, d, f) and the NN ending up in a specific (2S'+1)L'(J') state.

So, for each option, the final NN state is given, and the X's l is given by the lowercase letter.

So, for option A: the final NN state is 7D1. Let me parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 7D1 would be (2S+1)=7 → S=3, L=D=2, J=1.

Wait, but wait, 2S+1=7 implies S=3, since 2*3 +1=7.

So for option A:

NN final state: S=3, L=2, J=1.

X's l: p → l=1.

So, for condition a (parity), L_final + l must be odd.

L_final is 2 (even), l=1 (odd). So 2+1=3 → odd. So condition a is satisfied.

For condition b (Pauli): S + L_final = 3 + 2 =5 → 5 mod 2 is 1. So condition is satisfied.

So both conditions are met, so this option is allowed.

Option B: 3S1 + p.

So, final NN state: 3S1. (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L=S=0? Wait, no: the term is 3S1. So L is S? Wait, no. The term is (2S+1)L(J). So 3S1: 3 is (2S+1), so S=1. L is S? No, the L is denoted by the letter. So S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 3S1: (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S? No, L is a capital letter. So L would be S? Wait, no. Wait, the letter after the number is the orbital angular momentum. So 3S1: L is S, which is a lowercase 's'? No, wait, no. The letters for L are S (L=0), P (L=1), D (L=2), F (L=3), etc. So for term symbol 3S1: (2S+1)=3 → S=1, L=S → no, wait, no. Because the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 3S1 would be S=1, L=0 (since S is the orbital angular momentum letter?), no, wait, no. Wait, the second letter in the term symbol is the orbital angular momentum. So for 3S1, the first part is 3, which is (2S+1)=3 → S=1. The second part is S, which is the orbital angular momentum L=0 (because S is the letter for L=0). So L=0.

So, for option B: NN's S=1, L=0. X's l is p → l=1.

Check conditions.

Condition a: L_final + l = 0 +1=1 → odd. So condition a is satisfied.

Condition b: S + L_final =1 +0=1 → 1 mod2. So condition satisfied.

So both conditions met. So option B is allowed.

Option C: 3D3 + f.

Let's parse the final NN state: 3D3. (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is D, which is L=2. J=3.

X's state is f → l=3.

Condition a: L_final + l = 2 +3=5 → odd. So condition a is satisfied.

Condition b: S + L_final =1 +2=3 → 1 mod2. So condition satisfied.

So option C is allowed.

Option D: 3P0 + s.

Final NN state: 3P0. (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is P → L=1.

X's l is s → l=0.

Condition a: L_final + l =1 +0=1 → odd. So condition a is satisfied.

Condition b: S + L_final =1 +1=2 → 0 mod2. So 2 mod2 is 0.

But condition requires S + L ≡1 mod2. So this is not satisfied.

So condition b is violated here. So this option would be disallowed.

Wait, but wait, option D: 3P0 + s.

So, let's double-check:

NN final state: 3P0 → S=1, L=1.

X's l is s → l=0.

So, condition a: L_final + l =1 +0=1 → odd → condition met.

Condition b: S + L_final =1 +1=2 → even → 0 mod2. So 0 ≡1? No. So condition not met. So this partial wave is not permitted.

So the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So option D is the one not allowed.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Initial State**: The system starts in the 1S0 state, which corresponds to \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The parity of the initial state is \( (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \).

2. **Final State**: After emitting a particle \( X \), the NN system ends in a new state with total spin \( S' \), orbital angular momentum \( L' \), and isospin \( T' \). The emitted particle \( X \) has intrinsic parity \( -1 \) and orbital angular momentum \( l \), denoted by the lowercase letters \( s \), \( p \), \( d \), or \( f \) (\( l = 0, 1, 2, 3 \), respectively).

3. **Conservation Laws**:
   - **Parity Conservation**: The parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state. The parity of the NN system is \( (-1)^{L'} \), and the parity of \( X \) is \( (-1)^l \times (-1) \) (including its intrinsic parity). Thus:
     \[
     (-1)^L = (-1)^{L'} \times (-1)^l \times (-1)
     \]
     Simplifying, \( L' + l + 1 \) must be even, meaning \( L' + l \) is odd.
   - **Pauli Condition**: The isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy:
     \[
     T' = S' + L' + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2)
     \]
     Since \( T' = 0 \), this implies \( S' + L' \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), meaning \( S' \) and \( L' \) must have opposite parities.

4. **Analysis of Each Option**:
   - **Option A**: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)
     - Final NN state: \( 7D1 \). From the term symbol, \( S' = 3 \), \( L' = 2 \), \( J' = 1 \).
     - \( X \): \( l = 1 \) (denoted by \( p \)).
     - Parity check: \( L' + l = 2 + 1 = 3 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
     - Pauli check: \( S' + L' = 3 + 2 = 5 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
     - **Allowed**.

   - **Option B**: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3S1 \). From the term symbol, \( S' = 1 \), \( L' = 0 \), \( J' = 1 \).
     - \( X \): \( l = 1 \) (denoted by \( p \)).
     - Parity check: \( L' + l = 0 + 1 = 1 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
     - Pauli check: \( S' + L' = 1 + 0 = 1 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
     - **Allowed**.

   - **Option C**: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3D3 \). From the term symbol, \( S' = 1 \), \( L' = 2 \), \( J' = 3 \).
     - \( X \): \( l = 3 \) (denoted by \( f \)).
     - Parity check: \( L' + l = 2 + 3 = 5 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
     - Pauli check: \( S' + L' = 1 + 2 = 3 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
     - **Allowed**.

   - **Option D**: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3P0 \). From the term symbol, \( S' = 1 \), \( L' = 1 \), \( J' = 0 \).
     - \( X \): \( l = 0 \) (denoted by \( s \)).
     - Parity check: \( L' + l = 1 + 0 = 1 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
     - Pauli check: \( S' + L' = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is even. Condition **not** satisfied.
     - **Not Allowed**.

5. **Conclusion**: The partial wave not permitted is the one corresponding to Option D.

**Answer: D**
