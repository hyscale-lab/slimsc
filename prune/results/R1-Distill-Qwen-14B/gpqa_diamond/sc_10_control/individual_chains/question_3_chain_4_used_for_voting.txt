Okay, I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. Hmm, I remember that expectation values are calculated using the state vector and the operator. Let me get the details right.

The particle is in a linear superposition state, specifically 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, the Pauli z-matrix. Right, because σ_z |↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σ_z |↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩.

The operator we're looking at is 10σ_z + 5σ_x. So the expectation value would be the expectation of each part added together. Because expectation values are linear, I can compute each term separately and sum them.

So, expectation value of 10σ_z plus expectation of 5σ_x. Let me write that as 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩.

First, I need to find ⟨σ_z⟩. Since the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of σ_z, it's straightforward. The expectation value for σ_z is just the probability of measuring +1 times (+1) plus the probability of measuring -1 times (-1).

The coefficients are 0.5 and (√3)/2. Let's square their magnitudes for the probabilities. 

The first term is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. This is the probability of spin-up. So that contributes 0.25 * (+1) = 0.25.

The second term is (√3/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So the probability for spin-down is 0.75. That contributes 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75.

Adding these gives 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σ_z⟩ is -0.5. Therefore, 10⟨σ_z⟩ is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, I need to find ⟨σ_x⟩. Oh wait, σ_x is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩; instead, they are the states |+⟩ and |−⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So I can't directly read off the expectation value as I did for σ_z. Instead, I'll have to compute it using the state.

The operator σ_x is represented by the matrix [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ] in the standard basis. But perhaps a better approach is to compute ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the given state.

The state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this as a column vector. The basis is |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so:

|ψ⟩ = [0.5; (√3/2)].

Wait, no, actually, the order matters. The first component is for |↑⟩, so the vector is [0.5, (√3/2)]^T.

The expectation value ⟨σ_x⟩ is given by ψ† σ_x ψ, where ψ is a column vector, and † is the conjugate transpose. Since the coefficients are real here, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose.

So, let's compute that.

σ_x is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

ψ† σ_x is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by σ_x. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply σ_x with ψ, you get:

σ_x * ψ = [0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)]^T = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, ψ† σ_x ψ is the dot product of ψ and σ_x ψ.

So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and σ_x ψ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. So the dot product is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5).

Let me compute that: each term is (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. So adding them together gives 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660... So ⟨σ_x⟩ is sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, wait a second. Another approach: perhaps using expectation value formula for σ_x. Alternatively, since σ_x can be written in terms of the spin states, maybe using the expectation value formula.

But I think the calculation I did is correct. Let me check again.

No, wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps another way to calculate ⟨σ_x⟩ is to use the fact that σ_x = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

So, ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = ⟨ψ| (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|) |ψ⟩.

Expanding that, it's ⟨ψ|↑⟩⟨ψ|↓⟩ + ⟨ψ|↓⟩⟨ψ|↑⟩.

So, each term is the product of the coefficients. Let me compute each part.

⟨ψ|↑⟩ is 0.5, ⟨ψ|↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2. So the first term is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4.

The second term is (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = sqrt(3)/4 as well.

Adding them gives sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2. So same result as before. So ⟨σ_x⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So, putting it all together, the expectation value of 10σ_z +5σ_x is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Calculating each term:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5 * (1.732/2) ≈5 *0.866 ≈4.33.

Adding these gives -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Because sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.

So sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866025.

So 5 * 0.866025 = 4.330125.

Then 10 * (-0.5) is -5.

So adding them: -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.669875. Rounded to one decimal place, that would be -0.7.

Wait, but let me check again. If the value is -0.669875, then to one decimal place, the first decimal is 6 (tenths place). The next digit is 6 (hundredths), which is 5 or more, so we round up. So 0.669875 is approximately 0.7 when rounded to one decimal. But wait, wait. Wait, 0.669875 is approximately 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place? Let me think.

No, wait. No, 0.66 is approximately 0.7 when rounded to one decimal? Wait, no. Wait, 0.66 is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place, but wait, 0.66 is 0.7 when rounded to the nearest tenth? No, wait. 0.6 is 0.6, 0.7 is 0.7. 0.66 is closer to 0.7 than 0.6? No. Wait, 0.66 is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place because the next digit is 6, which is >=5. So 0.66 (to two decimals) becomes 0.7 when rounded to one decimal.

Wait no, wait. Let's think in tenths. The number is -0.669875. So the tenths place is 6, the hundredths is 6, which is >=5. So when rounding to tenths, the 6 becomes 7.

So the result is approximately -0.70 when rounded to one decimal place.

Wait, but the options don't have -0.7 as an option? Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So option C is -0.7, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait, wait. Did I make a mistake in calculating the expectation value of σ_x?

Wait, let me double-check that. Because the state is a superposition of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are eigenstates of σ_z. So the expectation value of σ_x is computed correctly?

Yes, I think so. Because when you have a state in σ_z basis, the expectation of σ_x doesn't just come from the probabilities; it's a bit more involved.

Wait another approach: σ_x has eigenstates (|+⟩ and |−⟩), where |+⟩ = (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/√2 and |−⟩ = (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/√2.

But perhaps another way to compute ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ is to express |ψ⟩ in the σ_x eigenbasis and compute from there. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for expectation value:

⟨σ_x⟩ = ( |⟨↑|ψ⟩|^2 + |⟨↓|ψ⟩|^2 ) ? No, that's not correct. Because σ_x is not diagonal in the σ_z basis, so the expectation isn't just based on the squared coefficients. So my initial calculation was correct.

So, no mistake there. So the expectation value is -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875, which is approximately -0.7.

So the correct answer should be option C) -0.7.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is linear, so we compute the contributions from \( \sigma_z \) and \( \sigma_x \) separately.

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The probabilities of measuring \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) are given by the squared magnitudes of the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in \( |\psi\rangle \):

- Probability of \( +1 \): \( |0.5|^2 = 0.25 \)
- Probability of \( -1 \): \( \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75 \)

The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]

Thus, the contribution from \( 10\sigma_z \) is:
\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented by the matrix:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\]
The state \( |\psi\rangle \) is written as a column vector:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}
\]
The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is computed as:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle
\]
First, compute \( \sigma_x |\psi\rangle \):
\[
\sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}
\]
Then, compute the dot product \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \):
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})(0.5) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

Thus, the contribution from \( 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
5\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx 5(0.866) = 4.33
\]

### Step 3: Total expectation value
Adding the contributions from \( 10\sigma_z \) and \( 5\sigma_x \):
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is approximately \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is closest to option **C) -0.7**.

Okay, I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. Hmm, I remember that expectation values are calculated using the state vector and the operator. Let me get the details right.

The particle is in a linear superposition state, specifically 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, the Pauli z-matrix. Right, because σ_z |↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σ_z |↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩.

The operator we're looking at is 10σ_z + 5σ_x. So the expectation value would be the expectation of each part added together. Because expectation values are linear, I can compute each term separately and sum them.

So, expectation value of 10σ_z plus expectation of 5σ_x. Let me write that as 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩.

First, I need to find ⟨σ_z⟩. Since the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of σ_z, it's straightforward. The expectation value for σ_z is just the probability of measuring +1 times (+1) plus the probability of measuring -1 times (-1).

The coefficients are 0.5 and (√3)/2. Let's square their magnitudes for the probabilities. 

The first term is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. This is the probability of spin-up. So that contributes 0.25 * (+1) = 0.25.

The second term is (√3/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So the probability for spin-down is 0.75. That contributes 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75.

Adding these gives 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σ_z⟩ is -0.5. Therefore, 10⟨σ_z⟩ is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, I need to find ⟨σ_x⟩. Oh wait, σ_x is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩; instead, they are the states |+⟩ and |−⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So I can't directly read off the expectation value as I did for σ_z. Instead, I'll have to compute it using the state.

The operator σ_x is represented by the matrix [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ] in the standard basis. But perhaps a better approach is to compute ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the given state.

The state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this as a column vector. The basis is |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so:

|ψ⟩ = [0.5; (√3/2)].

Wait, no, actually, the order matters. The first component is for |↑⟩, so the vector is [0.5, (√3/2)]^T.

The expectation value ⟨σ_x⟩ is given by ψ† σ_x ψ, where ψ is a column vector, and † is the conjugate transpose. Since the coefficients are real here, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose.

So, let's compute that.

σ_x is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

ψ† σ_x is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by σ_x. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply σ_x with ψ, you get:

σ_x * ψ = [0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)]^T = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, ψ† σ_x ψ is the dot product of ψ and σ_x ψ.

So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and σ_x ψ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. So the dot product is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5).

Let me compute that: each term is (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. So adding them together gives 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660... So ⟨σ_x⟩ is sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, wait a second. Another approach: perhaps using expectation value formula for σ_x. Alternatively, since σ_x can be written in terms of the spin states, maybe using the expectation value formula.

But I think the calculation I did is correct. Let me check again.

No, wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps another way to calculate ⟨σ_x⟩ is to use the fact that σ_x = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

So, ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = ⟨ψ| (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|) |ψ⟩.

Expanding that, it's ⟨ψ|↑⟩⟨ψ|↓⟩ + ⟨ψ|↓⟩⟨ψ|↑⟩.

So, each term is the product of the coefficients. Let me compute each part.

⟨ψ|↑⟩ is 0.5, ⟨ψ|↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2. So the first term is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4.

The second term is (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = sqrt(3)/4 as well.

Adding them gives sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2. So same result as before. So ⟨σ_x⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So, putting it all together, the expectation value of 10σ_z +5σ_x is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Calculating each term:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5 * (1.732/2) ≈5 *0.866 ≈4.33.

Adding these gives -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Because sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.

So sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866025.

So 5 * 0.866025 = 4.330125.

Then 10 * (-0.5) is -5.

So adding them: -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.669875. Rounded to one decimal place, that would be -0.7.

Wait, but let me check again. If the value is -0.669875, then to one decimal place, the first decimal is 6 (tenths place). The next digit is 6 (hundredths), which is 5 or more, so we round up. So 0.669875 is approximately 0.7 when rounded to one decimal. But wait, wait. Wait, 0.669875 is approximately 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place? Let me think.

No, wait. No, 0.66 is approximately 0.7 when rounded to one decimal? Wait, no. Wait, 0.66 is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place, but wait, 0.66 is 0.7 when rounded to the nearest tenth? No, wait. 0.6 is 0.6, 0.7 is 0.7. 0.66 is closer to 0.7 than 0.6? No. Wait, 0.66 is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place because the next digit is 6, which is >=5. So 0.66 (to two decimals) becomes 0.7 when rounded to one decimal.

Wait no, wait. Let's think in tenths. The number is -0.669875. So the tenths place is 6, the hundredths is 6, which is >=5. So when rounding to tenths, the 6 becomes 7.

So the result is approximately -0.70 when rounded to one decimal place.

Wait, but the options don't have -0.7 as an option? Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So option C is -0.7, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait, wait. Did I make a mistake in calculating the expectation value of σ_x?

Wait, let me double-check that. Because the state is a superposition of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are eigenstates of σ_z. So the expectation value of σ_x is computed correctly?

Yes, I think so. Because when you have a state in σ_z basis, the expectation of σ_x doesn't just come from the probabilities; it's a bit more involved.

Wait another approach: σ_x has eigenstates (|+⟩ and |−⟩), where |+⟩ = (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/√2 and |−⟩ = (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/√2.

But perhaps another way to compute ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ is to express |ψ⟩ in the σ_x eigenbasis and compute from there. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for expectation value:

⟨σ_x⟩ = ( |⟨↑|ψ⟩|^2 + |⟨↓|ψ⟩|^2 ) ? No, that's not correct. Because σ_x is not diagonal in the σ_z basis, so the expectation isn't just based on the squared coefficients. So my initial calculation was correct.

So, no mistake there. So the expectation value is -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875, which is approximately -0.7.

So the correct answer should be option C) -0.7.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is linear, so we compute the contributions from \( \sigma_z \) and \( \sigma_x \) separately.

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The probabilities of measuring \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) are given by the squared magnitudes of the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in \( |\psi\rangle \):

- Probability of \( +1 \): \( |0.5|^2 = 0.25 \)
- Probability of \( -1 \): \( \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75 \)

The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]

Thus, the contribution from \( 10\sigma_z \) is:
\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented by the matrix:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\]
The state \( |\psi\rangle \) is written as a column vector:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}
\]
The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is computed as:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle
\]
First, compute \( \sigma_x |\psi\rangle \):
\[
\sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}
\]
Then, compute the dot product \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \):
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})(0.5) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

Thus, the contribution from \( 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
5\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx 5(0.866) = 4.33
\]

### Step 3: Total expectation value
Adding the contributions from \( 10\sigma_z \) and \( 5\sigma_x \):
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is approximately \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is closest to option **C) -0.7**.

Answer: C
