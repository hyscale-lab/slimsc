Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. Hmm, I think the index of hydrogen deficiency is also known as the degree of unsaturation. Right, that's the number of rings plus double bonds (each triple bond counts as two, but I don't think that's in play here) in the molecule.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring, which I know has a double bond. The numbering is such that the carboxylic acid group is at position 3 (cyclohex-3-ene). Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid would have the carboxylic acid group attached to the cyclohexene ring at position 1? Or position 3? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Wait, the numbering would place the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the cyclohexene ring has a double bond at 3-4 positions. Then, the carboxylic acid is in position 3? Or is position 3 the double bond between 3 and 4, and the carboxylic acid is at position 1?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to draw it out mentally. Let's see. The cyclohexene ring has a five-membered structure? Wait, no, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So, the substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Wait, the compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the substituents are at positions 2 and 5. The carboxylic acid is at position 3? Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure.

The main ring is cyclohexene. The double bond is at position 3 (so between C3 and C4). Then, the substituents are: at position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but actually, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so attached as a substituent).

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me break it down:

- The parent ring is cyclohexene, with the double bond starting at position 3, so between C3 and C4.

- Substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

- At position 2: formyl group (CHO).

- At position 5: vinyl group. Vinyl is CH2=CH-, so that's a substituent attached to the cyclohexene ring at position 5.

Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH2, but as a substituent, it's CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, the group is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond? Or is it a substituent with a double bond? Oh wait, no. The vinyl group is CH2=CH–, so when attached to the ring, it's like –CH2–CH2 with a double bond between the two CH2's? Or wait, maybe not. Wait, the structure of the vinyl group is –CH2–CH2–, but that's single bonds. No, no, vinyl is an ethylene group, so it's –CH2–CH2– but with a double bond between the two carbons, so it's –CH2–CH2– where the two CH2's are actually CH2–CH2 with a double bond? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, vinyl is like CH2=CH–, so when it's attached to the ring, it's –CH2–CH2– but with the double bond between the two carbons. So the substituent is CH2=CH– connected to the ring. So the ring has a CH2-CH2 group attached, but with a double bond, making it a substituent that's an alkene.

So, the molecule has a cyclohexene ring (so one double bond in the ring) and two substituents: one formyl group (CHO, which is a carbonyl, another double bond) and a vinyl group (another double bond). So, counting the degrees of unsaturation: each double bond is one, and the ring is one.

Wait, but the ring itself is a cyclohexene, which already has one double bond. Then, the substituents add more.

Wait, the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the substituents are:

- At position 2: formyl (CHO) group. That's a double bond (C=O).

- At position 5: vinyl group (CH2=CH–), another double bond.

Additionally, the ring itself has a double bond (cyclohexene).

So, let's count the degrees of unsaturation for the starting molecule.

Each ring or double bond contributes 1. Triple bonds contribute 2, but I don't think any are present.

So, cyclohexene has 1 ring and 1 double bond. Wait wait, no. Wait, the cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So, the ring itself accounts for 1 degree (since it's a ring, which is a ring structure, but wait, no: each ring is a degree, each double bond is a degree, each triple bond is two, etc.

Wait, the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as:

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (Double bonds + Triple bonds *2 + Rings) 

Wait, more accurately, the formula is:

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, N nitrogens. But perhaps I should just count the rings and double bonds.

In this case, the starting molecule:

The cyclohexene ring has one double bond (so that's one DoU) and a ring (another DoU). So that's two.

Then, the substituents:

Formyl group (CHO) has a double bond (C=O): that's another one.

Vinyl group (CH2=CH–) is another double bond: that's another one.

So starting molecule has 2 (from ring and its double bond) + 1 (CHO) +1 (vinyl) = 4 degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, but wait. The cyclohexene ring itself has one double bond and one ring. So that's two DoU.

Then, the substituents add two more DoU (formyl and vinyl). So starting molecule has 4 DoU.

But wait, the carboxylic acid group is also present. Carboxylic acid is –COOH. That has a double bond (C=O), so that's another one. So, wait, am I missing that?

Wait, looking at the name: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

So, the parent chain is cyclohexene with a carboxylic acid group. So, the carboxylic acid is at position 3, presumably.

Wait, the cyclohexene is the main ring. So, substituents are at positions 2 (formyl), 5 (vinyl), and 3 (carboxylic acid group). Wait, but the numbering might be such that the carboxylic acid is at position 1? Because in carboxylic acids, the carboxylic acid group is at position 1, I think.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure again. Let me try to number the cyclohexene ring.

Numbering the ring so that the carboxylic acid group is at position 1. Then, the double bond would be between positions 3 and 4 (so cyclohex-3-ene). Then, the formyl group is at position 2, and the vinyl group at position 5.

So, the substituents are:

Position 1: COOH (carboxylic acid group, has a double bond C=O).

Position 2: CHO (formyl group, another double bond).

Position 5: CH2=CH– (vinyl group, another double bond).

And the ring itself has a double bond between 3 and 4.

So, the cyclohexene ring has one double bond (3-4) and the ring structure counts as a ring (so two DoU).

Then, substituents:

COOH: double bond (1 DoU).

CHO: double bond (1 DoU).

Vinyl: double bond (1 DoU).

So, that's 2 (ring and its double bond) + 3 (substituents) = 5 DoU in the starting material.

Wait, but wait: the cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring. The formula for a cyclohexene is C6H10O2 (if considering the substituents, but perhaps I should calculate using the formula for DoU.

Alternatively, I can use the formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

But perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, just counting rings and double bonds.

In the starting material: 

- The cyclohexene ring: 1 ring, 1 double bond. So 2 DoU.

- COOH group: 1 DoU (C=O).

- CHO group: 1 DoU (C=O).

- Vinyl group: 1 DoU (CH2=CH–).

So, total: 2 + 3 = 5 DoU.

Wait, but the ring is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So the ring has one double bond and the ring (so 2 DoU).

The substituents add three more.

So total DoU is 5.

Now, the reaction: the starting material is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Hmm, red phosphorus and HI—wait, that's a typical reaction for the hydrolysis of a nitrile or maybe for the elimination of certain functional groups. Wait, no, red phosphorus is often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, but in this case, maybe it's part of a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: when HI is used with red phosphorus, it might be part of a process to remove certain functional groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deoxygenation reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that uses different reagents. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but in this case, the molecule doesn't have a nitrile, but a formyl group and a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, but red phosphorus and HI might not be that. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrohalogenation or dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about eliminating groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a process to remove the formyl group or the vinyl group.

Wait, another angle. The starting molecule has a formyl group (CHO), which is an aldehyde. HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. Maybe the reaction is about removing the aldehyde group.

Wait, but wait: the starting molecule is a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids are usually not very reactive towards nucleophilic additions unless under specific conditions, but the formyl group is adjacent to the ring. Maybe it's about the formyl group undergoing some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a di-iodination or something else, but I'm not too sure.

Wait, another approach: What happens when a formyl group is treated with HI and red phosphorus? I'm trying to remember any reactions.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is about removing functional groups. For example, the formyl group (CHO) can be reduced. Wait, but in the presence of HCl, I think the Clemmensen reduction reduces aldehydes and ketones to CH2 groups. But the reagents here are red phosphorus and HI, which might be similar.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of carbonyl groups. So, for example, aldehydes and ketones would be reduced to CH2 groups. So perhaps the formyl group (CHO) would be reduced to CH2OH, but wait, no, in the Clemmensen reduction (Zn-Hg, HCl), aldehydes are reduced to CH2Cl. Wait, but maybe with red phosphorus and HI, the formyl group is converted into something else.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a di-iodination of the double bonds. Since the starting material has multiple double bonds (ring, formyl, vinyl, and the carboxylic acid?), but wait, the carboxylic acid has a double bond. So perhaps the reaction is adding iodine across the double bonds.

But wait, the reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI. So, perhaps this is a situation where the HI is acting as a source of iodide, and the red phosphorus is a reducing agent. Wait, in some reactions, red phosphorus can reduce the oxidizing conditions. For example, in the presence of iodine, red phosphorus can reduce carbonyl groups.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or dehalogenation. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about removing the formyl group. For example, in the presence of HI, the formyl group (CHO) might undergo some elimination.

Wait, perhaps it's a question about the Baeyer-Villiger reaction, but that involves ketones and forms lactones or ketones, but I don't think that fits here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation. For instance, the formyl group (CHO) could be converted into a CH2 group by removing oxygen. So, maybe the CHO becomes CH2I, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when aldehydes are treated with HI, they might undergo addition. For example, adding HI to the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of a diiodide. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the diels-alder reaction, but no, that's for dienes and dienophiles, which doesn't seem to apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about adding iodine to the double bonds. Since HI is a source of iodide, and red phosphorus could be a reducing agent or a catalyst. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. The starting molecule has several double bonds. If HI adds across the double bonds, each addition would reduce the degree of unsaturation by one. But with excess HI, perhaps all the double bonds are saturated. Or maybe some are.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrohalogenation, adding HI to the double bonds.

Wait, but the presence of red phosphorus suggests it's a reduction. So maybe the double bonds are being hydrogenated, but with HI, which is a source of iodide.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the reaction is a diiodination of the rings. For example, adding iodine across the cyclohexene double bond, which would open up the ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the complete addition of HI to all the double bonds, converting each into single bonds, thus reducing the degree of unsaturation.

Wait, let me think: the starting molecule has several double bonds. Each double bond can add two molecules of HI (each addition would be across the double bond, making it a single bond and adding two iodide groups). But I'm not sure what the reaction would do.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about removing functional groups. For example, the formyl group (CHO) is being converted into a CH2 group, and the vinyl group is being hydrogenated.

So, the reaction could be reducing the double bonds in the substituents and the ring.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about the formyl group being converted into a CH2I group via some addition.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to the carbonyl groups. For example, the formyl group (CHO) could undergo a nucleophilic addition with HI, adding iodide across the carbonyl, converting it into a diiodide. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydroboration, but no, that's with BH3 and such.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the reaction conditions: red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, but that's under acidic conditions. But in this case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid already, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, another thought: The reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile, but again, the starting material doesn't have a nitrile. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation. When a formyl group is present, treatment with H2O and HgO can reduce it to a CH2OH group, but I'm not sure about the reagents here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Staudinger reaction, but that's with azides and phosphines, which doesn't fit.

Wait, another idea: The reaction could be the addition of HI to the double bonds, leading to the formation of vicinal diiodides. Each addition would convert a double bond to a single bond, reducing the degree of unsaturation by one per double bond. But with excess HI, perhaps all double bonds are saturated.

Wait, the starting molecule has:

1. A double bond in the cyclohexene ring.

2. A double bond in the formyl group (C=O).

3. A double bond in the vinyl group (CH2=CH–).

Plus, the carboxylic acid also has a double bond, but wait, carboxylic acid is COOH, which is O=C-OH. So that's another double bond.

Wait, so let's recount:

Cyclohexene ring: one double bond.

Formyl group: one double bond.

Vinyl group: one double bond.

Carboxylic acid: one double bond.

So that's four double bonds. Plus the ring counts as a ring, which is another DoU. So, 5 DoU in total.

Wait, but each of those contributes to the index. So, if the reaction adds HI across each double bond, each addition would reduce the DoU by one. But how many double bonds are there?

Wait, perhaps not all of them react. Let me think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI. Wait, HI is a strong acid, and in the presence of red phosphorus, maybe it's a way to add iodide to triple bonds or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of certain groups. For example, the formyl group (CHO) could be reduced to a CH2 group. So, if the CHO group is converted to CH2I, that would eliminate the double bond there, thus reducing DoU by one.

Similarly, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) could add HI, converting the double bond into a single bond, so another decrease in DoU by one.

The cyclohexene ring's double bond could also add HI, again reducing DoU by one.

And the carboxylic acid's double bond (O=C-OH) is in the COOH group. Would that react? COOH is a strong acid, so maybe not under these conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is converted into something else.

Wait, but if the reaction reduces the formyl group and the vinyl group, and the cyclohexene ring, that would reduce the DoU by three. Let's see:

Starting DoU: 5.

After reaction, if three double bonds are saturated, DoU becomes 2.

Wait, but the question is about the product, so what's the product's DoU?

But I'm not exactly sure which double bonds are reacting.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the complete hydrogenation of all double bonds, but with HI and red phosphorus, that's more about addition rather than hydrogenation.

Wait, another approach: What is the product when a formyl group is treated with HI and red phosphorus? I think I've heard of a reaction where formyl groups are converted into CH2I. For example, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, the carbonyl group is converted into a CH2 group. So, the CHO becomes CH2I.

Similarly, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) could add HI, becoming CH2I-CH2I (after two additions). But wait, each addition would convert the double bond to a single bond, adding two iodides.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group is reduced to CH2I. The vinyl group's double bond is saturated with HI, adding iodide. The cyclohexene ring's double bond is also saturated.

And the carboxylic acid's double bond (C=O) might be converted into something else.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Maybe the carboxylic acid is also being converted. How?

Wait, let's think: If the formyl group (CHO) is converted to CH2I, that's a reduction. Similarly, the cyclohexene ring's double bond is added to HI, becoming a single bond with iodide substituents. The vinyl group's double bond is also added to HI. The carboxylic acid might react as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is converted to an iodide. For example, COOH could become CH2I under certain reaction conditions.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid is deprotonated and reacts with HI, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering that HI is in excess, perhaps all the carbonyl groups (formyl and carboxylic acid) are converted into CH2I groups. So, the CHO and COOH groups are saturated.

Wait, but the carboxylic acid is a strong acid. Would it react with HI? Maybe not, as HI is also a strong acid, but perhaps under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the complete addition of HI to all the double bonds, leading to the formation of a molecule with all single bonds. But the ring would open, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexene ring would add HI across its double bond, becoming a cyclohexane ring with two iodine atoms. Then, the formyl group's carbonyl would add HI, becoming a geminal diiodide (CH(I)I). Similarly, the vinyl group would add HI across its double bond, becoming a vicinal diiodide.

But wait, this would convert all double bonds into single bonds, each addition using two HI molecules.

So, each double bond would add two HI, consuming two HI per double bond.

But the starting molecule has four double bonds (ring, formyl, vinyl, and COOH). So, four double bonds, each adding two HI, but that's a lot of HI—if it's in excess, that's possible.

Wait, but the question says excess HI, so perhaps all double bonds are saturated.

Then, the product would have all double bonds converted to single bonds, resulting in a molecule with all single bonds. So, the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoU) would be zero, because all rings and double bonds are gone. But wait, the ring might open if the double bond is saturated and the ring becomes a chain.

Wait, but when cyclohexene adds HI across the double bond, it becomes a cyclohexane with two iodines. So, the ring remains, but the double bond is gone. So the ring contributes one DoU (as a ring), and any remaining double bonds contribute more.

Wait, no—the ring in cyclohexene has a double bond. When you add HI to the double bond in the ring, the ring becomes a cyclohexane (no double bond), so the ring is still present. So the ring is one DoU (since it's a ring without any double bonds).

Wait, but wait: a cyclohexane ring is just a ring structure, which contributes one DoU because a ring is a cyclic structure, regardless of whether it has a double bond. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. The index of hydrogen deficiency is based on the number of rings and double bonds. So, a cyclohexane ring (all single bonds) has one DoU because it's a ring. If it's cyclohexene (with a double bond), it has two DoU: one for the ring and one for the double bond.

So, in the product, if the cyclohexene ring's double bond is saturated, it remains a ring but without the double bond. So, the ring contributes one DoU. Are there any other double bonds left?

In the product:

- The formyl group (CHO) is converted to CH2I (no double bond).

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH–) is converted to CH2CH2I (but wait, that would require adding two HIs across the double bond, making it CH2-I-CH2-I?), or perhaps each CH2 group gets an iodide. Alternatively, the vinyl group would become CH2CH2I with a single bond, so that's one DoU eliminated.

Wait, but the vinyl group was a double bond, which after addition becomes a single bond. So, that's one DoU eliminated.

The formyl group's C=O becomes a single bond (CH2I), so another DoU eliminated.

The COOH group's C=O would also be converted. If COOH is converted into CH2I, then that's another DoU eliminated.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is only affecting the formyl and vinyl groups, leaving the ring's double bond intact.

Wait, but with excess HI and red phosphorus, perhaps all the double bonds are saturated.

So, let's recalculate the DoU of the product.

In the product, we would have:

- The cyclohexene ring's double bond is saturated, so the ring remains (DoU 1, because it's a ring).

- The formyl group's double bond is eliminated (converted to CH2I, so no DoU from there).

- The vinyl group's double bond is eliminated (converted to CH2I-CH2I, which is a single bond, so no DoU from there).

- The carboxylic acid's double bond is converted into CH2I (so no DoU from that).

So, the product would have only the ring as a DoU.

Wait, but wait, the product is a cyclohexane (which is a ring, so DoU 1) plus any other rings or double bonds.

Wait, but if the ring is a cyclohexane (six-membered ring, no double bonds), it contributes one DoU (the ring). So the product's DoU would be 1.

Wait, but wait—the starting material's DoU was 5, and the product's DoU would be 1. That would mean that four DoU were eliminated. But how?

Wait, perhaps the ring's DoU remains, but the other three double bonds (formyl, vinyl, and COOH) are all eliminated, so 3 DoU eliminated. So 5 - 3 = 2. But that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's DoU remains, but the other three double bonds are converted (so 3 DoU eliminated), leading to 2 DoU.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try another approach. Let's list all the possible double bonds and rings in the starting material and see which ones are converted in the product.

Starting Material:

1. Cyclohexene ring: one ring, one double bond → 2 DoU.

2. Formyl group (CHO): one double bond → 1 DoU.

3. Vinyl group (CH2=CH–): one double bond → 1 DoU.

4. Carboxylic acid (COOH): one double bond → 1 DoU.

Total: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 DoU.

Reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI:

Assuming that all double bonds except the cyclohexene ring are saturated.

If the formyl, vinyl, and carboxylic acid's double bonds are saturated, that's three DoU eliminated. The remaining cyclohexene ring would have two DoU (ring and its double bond), but wait, the reaction could also saturate the ring's double bond.

Wait, if the reaction adds HI to the cyclohexene's double bond, that would convert the ring into a cyclohexane (still a ring, but with a single bond), so the ring contributes one DoU.

So, in the product:

- Cyclohexane ring: 1 DoU.

- All other double bonds (formyl, vinyl, COOH) have been eliminated. So, product has 1 DoU.

But wait, the product's DoU would be 1.

But looking at the options, option A is 1.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the reaction doesn't affect the ring, but that seems unlikely with excess HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's double bond is also saturated, so the ring becomes a cyclohexane (still one DoU as a ring) and the double bond is gone. So, the product has only the ring as DoU.

Wait, but another thought: the reaction might hydrogenate the ring's double bond, turning it into a cyclohexane. Then, the ring is a cyclohexane (no double bonds), so the DoU from the ring is still 1 (because it's a ring). The other three double bonds are eliminated. So, product's DoU is 1.

Yes, that seems plausible. So the product would have a DoU of 1.

Wait, but another possibility: if all double bonds are eliminated, including the ring, then the product would be a fully saturated molecule. But that would require the ring's double bond to be saturated, which would make it a cyclohexane ring, contributing one DoU.

So, the product would have one DoU.

But wait, if all the other double bonds are gone, the product would have:

- Ring: 1 DoU.

- No other double bonds.

So total DoU is 1.

Therefore, the answer would be A) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoU), also known as the degree of unsaturation, of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The DoU is calculated based on the number of rings and double bonds in the molecule.

### Analysis of the Starting Material
The starting molecule, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has the following structural features:
1. **Cyclohexene ring**: A six-membered ring with one double bond (between C3 and C4), contributing **2 DoU** (1 for the ring and 1 for the double bond).
2. **Formyl group (CHO)**: Contains a carbonyl group (C=O), contributing **1 DoU**.
3. **Vinyl group (CH2=CH–)**: Contains a double bond (C=C), contributing **1 DoU**.
4. **Carboxylic acid group (COOH)**: Contains a carbonyl group (C=O), contributing **1 DoU**.

Thus, the total DoU for the starting material is:
\[
\text{DoU} = 2 \, (\text{cyclohexene}) + 1 \, (\text{formyl}) + 1 \, (\text{vinyl}) + 1 \, (\text{carboxylic acid}) = 5 \, \text{DoU}.
\]

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI
The reaction conditions involve red phosphorus and excess HI. Red phosphorus is a reducing agent, and HI is a strong acid. Under these conditions:
1. **Formyl group (CHO)**: The carbonyl group (C=O) is reduced to a CH2 group, eliminating the double bond and reducing the DoU by 1.
2. **Vinyl group (CH2=CH–)**: The double bond (C=C) is saturated by HI, converting it into a single bond and reducing the DoU by 1.
3. **Cyclohexene ring**: The double bond in the ring is saturated by HI, converting the cyclohexene into cyclohexane. The ring remains intact, contributing 1 DoU (from the ring structure).
4. **Carboxylic acid group (COOH)**: The carbonyl group (C=O) is reduced to a CH2 group, eliminating the double bond and reducing the DoU by 1.

### DoU of the Product
After the reaction:
- The cyclohexene ring becomes cyclohexane, contributing **1 DoU** (from the ring).
- All other double bonds (formyl, vinyl, and carboxylic acid) are eliminated.

Thus, the total DoU of the product is:
\[
\text{DoU} = 1 \, (\text{cyclohexane ring}).
\]

### Conclusion
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. Hmm, I think the index of hydrogen deficiency is also known as the degree of unsaturation. Right, that's the number of rings plus double bonds (each triple bond counts as two, but I don't think that's in play here) in the molecule.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring, which I know has a double bond. The numbering is such that the carboxylic acid group is at position 3 (cyclohex-3-ene). Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid would have the carboxylic acid group attached to the cyclohexene ring at position 1? Or position 3? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Wait, the numbering would place the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the cyclohexene ring has a double bond at 3-4 positions. Then, the carboxylic acid is in position 3? Or is position 3 the double bond between 3 and 4, and the carboxylic acid is at position 1?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to draw it out mentally. Let's see. The cyclohexene ring has a five-membered structure? Wait, no, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So, the substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Wait, the compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the substituents are at positions 2 and 5. The carboxylic acid is at position 3? Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure.

The main ring is cyclohexene. The double bond is at position 3 (so between C3 and C4). Then, the substituents are: at position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but actually, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so attached as a substituent).

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me break it down:

- The parent ring is cyclohexene, with the double bond starting at position 3, so between C3 and C4.

- Substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

- At position 2: formyl group (CHO).

- At position 5: vinyl group. Vinyl is CH2=CH-, so that's a substituent attached to the cyclohexene ring at position 5.

Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH2, but as a substituent, it's CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, the group is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond? Or is it a substituent with a double bond? Oh wait, no. The vinyl group is CH2=CH–, so when attached to the ring, it's like –CH2–CH2 with a double bond between the two CH2's? Or wait, maybe not. Wait, the structure of the vinyl group is –CH2–CH2–, but that's single bonds. No, no, vinyl is an ethylene group, so it's –CH2–CH2– but with a double bond between the two carbons, so it's –CH2–CH2– where the two CH2's are actually CH2–CH2 with a double bond? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, vinyl is like CH2=CH–, so when it's attached to the ring, it's –CH2–CH2– but with the double bond between the two carbons. So the substituent is CH2=CH– connected to the ring. So the ring has a CH2-CH2 group attached, but with a double bond, making it a substituent that's an alkene.

So, the molecule has a cyclohexene ring (so one double bond in the ring) and two substituents: one formyl group (CHO, which is a carbonyl, another double bond) and a vinyl group (another double bond). So, counting the degrees of unsaturation: each double bond is one, and the ring is one.

Wait, but the ring itself is a cyclohexene, which already has one double bond. Then, the substituents add more.

Wait, the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the substituents are:

- At position 2: formyl (CHO) group. That's a double bond (C=O).

- At position 5: vinyl group (CH2=CH–), another double bond.

Additionally, the ring itself has a double bond (cyclohexene).

So, let's count the degrees of unsaturation for the starting molecule.

Each ring or double bond contributes 1. Triple bonds contribute 2, but I don't think any are present.

So, cyclohexene has 1 ring and 1 double bond. Wait wait, no. Wait, the cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So, the ring itself accounts for 1 degree (since it's a ring, which is a ring structure, but wait, no: each ring is a degree, each double bond is a degree, each triple bond is two, etc.

Wait, the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as:

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (Double bonds + Triple bonds *2 + Rings) 

Wait, more accurately, the formula is:

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, N nitrogens. But perhaps I should just count the rings and double bonds.

In this case, the starting molecule:

The cyclohexene ring has one double bond (so that's one DoU) and a ring (another DoU). So that's two.

Then, the substituents:

Formyl group (CHO) has a double bond (C=O): that's another one.

Vinyl group (CH2=CH–) is another double bond: that's another one.

So starting molecule has 2 (from ring and its double bond) + 1 (CHO) +1 (vinyl) = 4 degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, but wait. The cyclohexene ring itself has one double bond and one ring. So that's two DoU.

Then, the substituents add two more DoU (formyl and vinyl). So starting molecule has 4 DoU.

But wait, the carboxylic acid group is also present. Carboxylic acid is –COOH. That has a double bond (C=O), so that's another one. So, wait, am I missing that?

Wait, looking at the name: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

So, the parent chain is cyclohexene with a carboxylic acid group. So, the carboxylic acid is at position 3, presumably.

Wait, the cyclohexene is the main ring. So, substituents are at positions 2 (formyl), 5 (vinyl), and 3 (carboxylic acid group). Wait, but the numbering might be such that the carboxylic acid is at position 1? Because in carboxylic acids, the carboxylic acid group is at position 1, I think.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure again. Let me try to number the cyclohexene ring.

Numbering the ring so that the carboxylic acid group is at position 1. Then, the double bond would be between positions 3 and 4 (so cyclohex-3-ene). Then, the formyl group is at position 2, and the vinyl group at position 5.

So, the substituents are:

Position 1: COOH (carboxylic acid group, has a double bond C=O).

Position 2: CHO (formyl group, another double bond).

Position 5: CH2=CH– (vinyl group, another double bond).

And the ring itself has a double bond between 3 and 4.

So, the cyclohexene ring has one double bond (3-4) and the ring structure counts as a ring (so two DoU).

Then, substituents:

COOH: double bond (1 DoU).

CHO: double bond (1 DoU).

Vinyl: double bond (1 DoU).

So, that's 2 (ring and its double bond) + 3 (substituents) = 5 DoU in the starting material.

Wait, but wait: the cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring. The formula for a cyclohexene is C6H10O2 (if considering the substituents, but perhaps I should calculate using the formula for DoU.

Alternatively, I can use the formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

But perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, just counting rings and double bonds.

In the starting material: 

- The cyclohexene ring: 1 ring, 1 double bond. So 2 DoU.

- COOH group: 1 DoU (C=O).

- CHO group: 1 DoU (C=O).

- Vinyl group: 1 DoU (CH2=CH–).

So, total: 2 + 3 = 5 DoU.

Wait, but the ring is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So the ring has one double bond and the ring (so 2 DoU).

The substituents add three more.

So total DoU is 5.

Now, the reaction: the starting material is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Hmm, red phosphorus and HI—wait, that's a typical reaction for the hydrolysis of a nitrile or maybe for the elimination of certain functional groups. Wait, no, red phosphorus is often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, but in this case, maybe it's part of a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: when HI is used with red phosphorus, it might be part of a process to remove certain functional groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deoxygenation reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that uses different reagents. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but in this case, the molecule doesn't have a nitrile, but a formyl group and a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, but red phosphorus and HI might not be that. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrohalogenation or dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about eliminating groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a process to remove the formyl group or the vinyl group.

Wait, another angle. The starting molecule has a formyl group (CHO), which is an aldehyde. HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. Maybe the reaction is about removing the aldehyde group.

Wait, but wait: the starting molecule is a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids are usually not very reactive towards nucleophilic additions unless under specific conditions, but the formyl group is adjacent to the ring. Maybe it's about the formyl group undergoing some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a di-iodination or something else, but I'm not too sure.

Wait, another approach: What happens when a formyl group is treated with HI and red phosphorus? I'm trying to remember any reactions.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is about removing functional groups. For example, the formyl group (CHO) can be reduced. Wait, but in the presence of HCl, I think the Clemmensen reduction reduces aldehydes and ketones to CH2 groups. But the reagents here are red phosphorus and HI, which might be similar.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of carbonyl groups. So, for example, aldehydes and ketones would be reduced to CH2 groups. So perhaps the formyl group (CHO) would be reduced to CH2OH, but wait, no, in the Clemmensen reduction (Zn-Hg, HCl), aldehydes are reduced to CH2Cl. Wait, but maybe with red phosphorus and HI, the formyl group is converted into something else.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a di-iodination of the double bonds. Since the starting material has multiple double bonds (ring, formyl, vinyl, and the carboxylic acid?), but wait, the carboxylic acid has a double bond. So perhaps the reaction is adding iodine across the double bonds.

But wait, the reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI. So, perhaps this is a situation where the HI is acting as a source of iodide, and the red phosphorus is a reducing agent. Wait, in some reactions, red phosphorus can reduce the oxidizing conditions. For example, in the presence of iodine, red phosphorus can reduce carbonyl groups.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or dehalogenation. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about removing the formyl group. For example, in the presence of HI, the formyl group (CHO) might undergo some elimination.

Wait, perhaps it's a question about the Baeyer-Villiger reaction, but that involves ketones and forms lactones or ketones, but I don't think that fits here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation. For instance, the formyl group (CHO) could be converted into a CH2 group by removing oxygen. So, maybe the CHO becomes CH2I, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when aldehydes are treated with HI, they might undergo addition. For example, adding HI to the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of a diiodide. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the diels-alder reaction, but no, that's for dienes and dienophiles, which doesn't seem to apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about adding iodine to the double bonds. Since HI is a source of iodide, and red phosphorus could be a reducing agent or a catalyst. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. The starting molecule has several double bonds. If HI adds across the double bonds, each addition would reduce the degree of unsaturation by one. But with excess HI, perhaps all the double bonds are saturated. Or maybe some are.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrohalogenation, adding HI to the double bonds.

Wait, but the presence of red phosphorus suggests it's a reduction. So maybe the double bonds are being hydrogenated, but with HI, which is a source of iodide.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the reaction is a diiodination of the rings. For example, adding iodine across the cyclohexene double bond, which would open up the ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the complete addition of HI to all the double bonds, converting each into single bonds, thus reducing the degree of unsaturation.

Wait, let me think: the starting molecule has several double bonds. Each double bond can add two molecules of HI (each addition would be across the double bond, making it a single bond and adding two iodide groups). But I'm not sure what the reaction would do.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about removing functional groups. For example, the formyl group (CHO) is being converted into a CH2 group, and the vinyl group is being hydrogenated.

So, the reaction could be reducing the double bonds in the substituents and the ring.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about the formyl group being converted into a CH2I group via some addition.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to the carbonyl groups. For example, the formyl group (CHO) could undergo a nucleophilic addition with HI, adding iodide across the carbonyl, converting it into a diiodide. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydroboration, but no, that's with BH3 and such.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the reaction conditions: red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, but that's under acidic conditions. But in this case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid already, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, another thought: The reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile, but again, the starting material doesn't have a nitrile. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation. When a formyl group is present, treatment with H2O and HgO can reduce it to a CH2OH group, but I'm not sure about the reagents here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Staudinger reaction, but that's with azides and phosphines, which doesn't fit.

Wait, another idea: The reaction could be the addition of HI to the double bonds, leading to the formation of vicinal diiodides. Each addition would convert a double bond to a single bond, reducing the degree of unsaturation by one per double bond. But with excess HI, perhaps all double bonds are saturated.

Wait, the starting molecule has:

1. A double bond in the cyclohexene ring.

2. A double bond in the formyl group (C=O).

3. A double bond in the vinyl group (CH2=CH–).

Plus, the carboxylic acid also has a double bond, but wait, carboxylic acid is COOH, which is O=C-OH. So that's another double bond.

Wait, so let's recount:

Cyclohexene ring: one double bond.

Formyl group: one double bond.

Vinyl group: one double bond.

Carboxylic acid: one double bond.

So that's four double bonds. Plus the ring counts as a ring, which is another DoU. So, 5 DoU in total.

Wait, but each of those contributes to the index. So, if the reaction adds HI across each double bond, each addition would reduce the DoU by one. But how many double bonds are there?

Wait, perhaps not all of them react. Let me think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI. Wait, HI is a strong acid, and in the presence of red phosphorus, maybe it's a way to add iodide to triple bonds or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of certain groups. For example, the formyl group (CHO) could be reduced to a CH2 group. So, if the CHO group is converted to CH2I, that would eliminate the double bond there, thus reducing DoU by one.

Similarly, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) could add HI, converting the double bond into a single bond, so another decrease in DoU by one.

The cyclohexene ring's double bond could also add HI, again reducing DoU by one.

And the carboxylic acid's double bond (O=C-OH) is in the COOH group. Would that react? COOH is a strong acid, so maybe not under these conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is converted into something else.

Wait, but if the reaction reduces the formyl group and the vinyl group, and the cyclohexene ring, that would reduce the DoU by three. Let's see:

Starting DoU: 5.

After reaction, if three double bonds are saturated, DoU becomes 2.

Wait, but the question is about the product, so what's the product's DoU?

But I'm not exactly sure which double bonds are reacting.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the complete hydrogenation of all double bonds, but with HI and red phosphorus, that's more about addition rather than hydrogenation.

Wait, another approach: What is the product when a formyl group is treated with HI and red phosphorus? I think I've heard of a reaction where formyl groups are converted into CH2I. For example, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, the carbonyl group is converted into a CH2 group. So, the CHO becomes CH2I.

Similarly, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) could add HI, becoming CH2I-CH2I (after two additions). But wait, each addition would convert the double bond to a single bond, adding two iodides.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group is reduced to CH2I. The vinyl group's double bond is saturated with HI, adding iodide. The cyclohexene ring's double bond is also saturated.

And the carboxylic acid's double bond (C=O) might be converted into something else.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Maybe the carboxylic acid is also being converted. How?

Wait, let's think: If the formyl group (CHO) is converted to CH2I, that's a reduction. Similarly, the cyclohexene ring's double bond is added to HI, becoming a single bond with iodide substituents. The vinyl group's double bond is also added to HI. The carboxylic acid might react as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is converted to an iodide. For example, COOH could become CH2I under certain reaction conditions.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid is deprotonated and reacts with HI, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering that HI is in excess, perhaps all the carbonyl groups (formyl and carboxylic acid) are converted into CH2I groups. So, the CHO and COOH groups are saturated.

Wait, but the carboxylic acid is a strong acid. Would it react with HI? Maybe not, as HI is also a strong acid, but perhaps under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the complete addition of HI to all the double bonds, leading to the formation of a molecule with all single bonds. But the ring would open, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexene ring would add HI across its double bond, becoming a cyclohexane ring with two iodine atoms. Then, the formyl group's carbonyl would add HI, becoming a geminal diiodide (CH(I)I). Similarly, the vinyl group would add HI across its double bond, becoming a vicinal diiodide.

But wait, this would convert all double bonds into single bonds, each addition using two HI molecules.

So, each double bond would add two HI, consuming two HI per double bond.

But the starting molecule has four double bonds (ring, formyl, vinyl, and COOH). So, four double bonds, each adding two HI, but that's a lot of HI—if it's in excess, that's possible.

Wait, but the question says excess HI, so perhaps all double bonds are saturated.

Then, the product would have all double bonds converted to single bonds, resulting in a molecule with all single bonds. So, the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoU) would be zero, because all rings and double bonds are gone. But wait, the ring might open if the double bond is saturated and the ring becomes a chain.

Wait, but when cyclohexene adds HI across the double bond, it becomes a cyclohexane with two iodines. So, the ring remains, but the double bond is gone. So the ring contributes one DoU (as a ring), and any remaining double bonds contribute more.

Wait, no—the ring in cyclohexene has a double bond. When you add HI to the double bond in the ring, the ring becomes a cyclohexane (no double bond), so the ring is still present. So the ring is one DoU (since it's a ring without any double bonds).

Wait, but wait: a cyclohexane ring is just a ring structure, which contributes one DoU because a ring is a cyclic structure, regardless of whether it has a double bond. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. The index of hydrogen deficiency is based on the number of rings and double bonds. So, a cyclohexane ring (all single bonds) has one DoU because it's a ring. If it's cyclohexene (with a double bond), it has two DoU: one for the ring and one for the double bond.

So, in the product, if the cyclohexene ring's double bond is saturated, it remains a ring but without the double bond. So, the ring contributes one DoU. Are there any other double bonds left?

In the product:

- The formyl group (CHO) is converted to CH2I (no double bond).

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH–) is converted to CH2CH2I (but wait, that would require adding two HIs across the double bond, making it CH2-I-CH2-I?), or perhaps each CH2 group gets an iodide. Alternatively, the vinyl group would become CH2CH2I with a single bond, so that's one DoU eliminated.

Wait, but the vinyl group was a double bond, which after addition becomes a single bond. So, that's one DoU eliminated.

The formyl group's C=O becomes a single bond (CH2I), so another DoU eliminated.

The COOH group's C=O would also be converted. If COOH is converted into CH2I, then that's another DoU eliminated.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is only affecting the formyl and vinyl groups, leaving the ring's double bond intact.

Wait, but with excess HI and red phosphorus, perhaps all the double bonds are saturated.

So, let's recalculate the DoU of the product.

In the product, we would have:

- The cyclohexene ring's double bond is saturated, so the ring remains (DoU 1, because it's a ring).

- The formyl group's double bond is eliminated (converted to CH2I, so no DoU from there).

- The vinyl group's double bond is eliminated (converted to CH2I-CH2I, which is a single bond, so no DoU from there).

- The carboxylic acid's double bond is converted into CH2I (so no DoU from that).

So, the product would have only the ring as a DoU.

Wait, but wait, the product is a cyclohexane (which is a ring, so DoU 1) plus any other rings or double bonds.

Wait, but if the ring is a cyclohexane (six-membered ring, no double bonds), it contributes one DoU (the ring). So the product's DoU would be 1.

Wait, but wait—the starting material's DoU was 5, and the product's DoU would be 1. That would mean that four DoU were eliminated. But how?

Wait, perhaps the ring's DoU remains, but the other three double bonds (formyl, vinyl, and COOH) are all eliminated, so 3 DoU eliminated. So 5 - 3 = 2. But that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's DoU remains, but the other three double bonds are converted (so 3 DoU eliminated), leading to 2 DoU.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try another approach. Let's list all the possible double bonds and rings in the starting material and see which ones are converted in the product.

Starting Material:

1. Cyclohexene ring: one ring, one double bond → 2 DoU.

2. Formyl group (CHO): one double bond → 1 DoU.

3. Vinyl group (CH2=CH–): one double bond → 1 DoU.

4. Carboxylic acid (COOH): one double bond → 1 DoU.

Total: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 DoU.

Reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI:

Assuming that all double bonds except the cyclohexene ring are saturated.

If the formyl, vinyl, and carboxylic acid's double bonds are saturated, that's three DoU eliminated. The remaining cyclohexene ring would have two DoU (ring and its double bond), but wait, the reaction could also saturate the ring's double bond.

Wait, if the reaction adds HI to the cyclohexene's double bond, that would convert the ring into a cyclohexane (still a ring, but with a single bond), so the ring contributes one DoU.

So, in the product:

- Cyclohexane ring: 1 DoU.

- All other double bonds (formyl, vinyl, COOH) have been eliminated. So, product has 1 DoU.

But wait, the product's DoU would be 1.

But looking at the options, option A is 1.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the reaction doesn't affect the ring, but that seems unlikely with excess HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's double bond is also saturated, so the ring becomes a cyclohexane (still one DoU as a ring) and the double bond is gone. So, the product has only the ring as DoU.

Wait, but another thought: the reaction might hydrogenate the ring's double bond, turning it into a cyclohexane. Then, the ring is a cyclohexane (no double bonds), so the DoU from the ring is still 1 (because it's a ring). The other three double bonds are eliminated. So, product's DoU is 1.

Yes, that seems plausible. So the product would have a DoU of 1.

Wait, but another possibility: if all double bonds are eliminated, including the ring, then the product would be a fully saturated molecule. But that would require the ring's double bond to be saturated, which would make it a cyclohexane ring, contributing one DoU.

So, the product would have one DoU.

But wait, if all the other double bonds are gone, the product would have:

- Ring: 1 DoU.

- No other double bonds.

So total DoU is 1.

Therefore, the answer would be A) 1.


The problem involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoU), also known as the degree of unsaturation, of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The DoU is calculated based on the number of rings and double bonds in the molecule.

### Analysis of the Starting Material
The starting molecule, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has the following structural features:
1. **Cyclohexene ring**: A six-membered ring with one double bond (between C3 and C4), contributing **2 DoU** (1 for the ring and 1 for the double bond).
2. **Formyl group (CHO)**: Contains a carbonyl group (C=O), contributing **1 DoU**.
3. **Vinyl group (CH2=CH–)**: Contains a double bond (C=C), contributing **1 DoU**.
4. **Carboxylic acid group (COOH)**: Contains a carbonyl group (C=O), contributing **1 DoU**.

Thus, the total DoU for the starting material is:
\[
\text{DoU} = 2 \, (\text{cyclohexene}) + 1 \, (\text{formyl}) + 1 \, (\text{vinyl}) + 1 \, (\text{carboxylic acid}) = 5 \, \text{DoU}.
\]

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI
The reaction conditions involve red phosphorus and excess HI. Red phosphorus is a reducing agent, and HI is a strong acid. Under these conditions:
1. **Formyl group (CHO)**: The carbonyl group (C=O) is reduced to a CH2 group, eliminating the double bond and reducing the DoU by 1.
2. **Vinyl group (CH2=CH–)**: The double bond (C=C) is saturated by HI, converting it into a single bond and reducing the DoU by 1.
3. **Cyclohexene ring**: The double bond in the ring is saturated by HI, converting the cyclohexene into cyclohexane. The ring remains intact, contributing 1 DoU (from the ring structure).
4. **Carboxylic acid group (COOH)**: The carbonyl group (C=O) is reduced to a CH2 group, eliminating the double bond and reducing the DoU by 1.

### DoU of the Product
After the reaction:
- The cyclohexene ring becomes cyclohexane, contributing **1 DoU** (from the ring).
- All other double bonds (formyl, vinyl, and carboxylic acid) are eliminated.

Thus, the total DoU of the product is:
\[
\text{DoU} = 1 \, (\text{cyclohexane ring}).
\]

### Conclusion
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**.

Answer: A
