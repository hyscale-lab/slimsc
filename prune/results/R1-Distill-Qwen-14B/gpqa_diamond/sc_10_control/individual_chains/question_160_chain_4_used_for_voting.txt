Okay, so I have this problem about an aperture shaped like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis and hits the aperture vertically. This creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Hmm, I remember that when N is very large, the polygon becomes almost like a circle, right?

So, the setup is similar to the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture, but wait, wait. No, wait—actually, when N is infinite, the shape becomes a regular polygon with infinite sides, which is a circle. But wait, wait again. Or maybe not? Because an infinite-sided polygon with a fixed apothem... Let me think. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' relates to the side length. As N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem. So yes, the aperture becomes a circular one.

But wait, I should double-check. Because for a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is the radius of the inscribed circle. So when N becomes very large, the polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a'. So the problem reduces to finding the angular spacing between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Wait, but the options don't directly match what I know about the single-slit diffraction minima. Wait, no—the single-slit is different from the circular aperture. Actually, the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is the Airy disk, where the first minimum is at an angle θ given by sinθ = 1.22 λ / (diameter), which is 2a. Wait, because the diameter of the circular aperture would be twice the apothem, since the apothem is the radius.

So the formula for the first minimum in the Airy pattern is sinθ = 1.22 λ/(2a). But wait, since the problem states that tanθ is approximately equal to θ (because the angles are small), so θ ≈ sinθ ≈ tanθ. So we can approximate sinθ as θ, so θ ≈ 1.22 λ/(2a) → θ ≈ (1.22/2) λ/a → which is 0.61 λ/a. Hmm, but wait, the question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. Oh wait, no—the first minimum is the first dark ring. But wait, in the Airy pattern, the first minima after the central maximum is the first dark ring, and then the next minima? No, wait, the Airy disk has a central bright spot, then the first dark ring, then a brighter ring, then the second dark ring. So the first two minima would be the first and the second dark rings. Wait, but I thought the minima in the Airy pattern are at θ_m = 1.22 λ/(diameter) for the first minimum, and then 2.44 λ/(diameter), 3.65, etc., each increment adding 1.22 times λ/(diameter). So the angular spacing between consecutive minima would be 1.22 λ/(diameter) each time.

Wait, no, the m-th minimum occurs at θ_m = (m * 1.22) λ / (diameter), where m is 1,2,3,... So the first minimum is at m=1, the second at m=2, so the difference between them is 1.22 λ/(diameter), which is (1.22 λ)/(2a) since diameter is 2a. Wait, no, wait: diameter is 2a, because the apothem is a, which is the radius for the circle when N is infinite. So diameter is 2a.

So the formula for the first minimum is θ_1 = (1.22 λ)/(2a). The second minimum is θ_2 = (2.44 λ)/(2a). So the angular distance between them is θ_2 - θ_1 = (2.44 - 1.22) λ/(2a) = 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima, which would be the difference between the first and the second minima. So that's 0.61 λ/a. Looking at the options, option A is 0.610 λ/a. Option D is 0.506 λ/a. Hmm, but I thought the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/(diameter) = 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a. So the angular position of the first minimum is 0.61 λ/a. Wait, but the question is about the distance between the first two minima. Oh wait, no—since the first minimum is at 0.61 λ/a, the next (second) is at 0.61 * 2 = 1.22 λ/a. So the difference is 0.61 λ/a. So the angular distance is 0.61 λ/a. So option A is 0.610 λ/a, which matches.

Wait, but wait again. Let me re-express that. The first minimum is at θ = 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a. The second minimum is at θ = 2 * 1.22 λ/(2a) = 1.22 λ/a. The difference is 0.61 λ/a, so option A. But wait, what if the question is about the first and the second minima, but the first minima is the first one after the central maximum. So angular distance between first and second is 0.61 λ/a.

But wait, the options also have option C: 1.220 λ/a. Which is the position of the first minimum, not the spacing. So in the question, the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but looking back, the problem states that N is infinitely large, so the shape is a circle. So the diffraction pattern is that of a circular aperture, which gives the Airy disk. The first minima in that case is at θ = 1.22 λ/(2a) because the diameter is 2a. So the angular distance between first and second minima would be 1.22 λ/(2a) again, because each minima is spaced by 1.22 λ/(2a). But wait, no. Let me think again. The m-th minima are at θ_m = m * 1.22 λ/(2a), where m is 1,2,3... So the first is at m=1: 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a. The second is at m=2: 2.44 λ/(2a) = 1.22 λ/a. So the difference between m=2 and m=1 is (1.22 - 0.61) λ/a, which is 0.61 λ/a. So that's the angular spacing between first two minima.

Wait, but wait, what if the question is for the first and second minima. Because the first minima is the first one after the central maximum, which is m=1. The second minima would be the next dark ring, m=2. So the spacing is θ2 - θ1 = (2.44 - 1.22) λ/(2a) = 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a.

So the correct answer should be A) 0.610 λ/a.

But wait, looking at the options, there's also option D: 0.506 λ/a. Hmm. Where does that come from? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the shape becomes a circle. Wait, what if the polygon's apothem is 'a' but the diameter is not 2a? Let me think about the regular polygon.

In a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. The radius (the distance from center to a vertex) is R = a / cos(π/N). When N is infinite, cos(π/N) approaches cos(0) which is 1, so R ≈ a. So the diameter is 2a.

Wait, I think that's correct. So the diameter is 2a, so the equation remains as before.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about a single slit, but no, because the shape is a polygon. But when N approaches infinity, it's a circle, so the single-slit formula doesn't apply. Wait, no, the single-slit diffraction is different from a circular aperture. The single-slit has minima at a sinθ = mλ, where m is ±1, ±2, etc. But the spacing between consecutive minima would be λ/a. But wait, would that apply here?

Wait, no. Wait, the single-slit is for a rectangular aperture. So when the aperture is a circle, the diffraction pattern is an Airy disk, not the same as a single slit. So the minima positions are determined differently. So I think my initial approach is correct.

So the correct angular distance between the first two minima is 0.61 λ/a, so option A is correct.

The problem involves an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon, where all apothems are of length \(a\). When monochromatic light of wavelength \(\lambda\) falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern in the far field. The task is to determine the angular distance between the first two minima when \(N\) approaches infinity, assuming small angles where \(\tan\theta \approx \theta\).

As \(N\) becomes very large, the polygon approximates a circle with radius \(a\), making the aperture effectively circular. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is well-known as the Airy disk. The positions of the minima in the Airy pattern are given by:

\[
\theta_m = \frac{m \cdot 1.22 \lambda}{D},
\]

where \(m = 1, 2, 3, \dots\) and \(D\) is the diameter of the aperture. Since the apothem \(a\) is the radius of the circle, the diameter is \(D = 2a\). Substituting \(D = 2a\) into the formula for the minima, the angular positions become:

\[
\theta_m = \frac{m \cdot 1.22 \lambda}{2a}.
\]

For the first minimum (\(m = 1\)):

\[
\theta_1 = \frac{1.22 \lambda}{2a} = 0.61 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

For the second minimum (\(m = 2\)):

\[
\theta_2 = \frac{2.44 \lambda}{2a} = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

The angular distance between the first and second minima is:

\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{2.44 \lambda}{2a} - \frac{1.22 \lambda}{2a} = \frac{1.22 \lambda}{2a} = 0.61 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima is \(0.61 \frac{\lambda}{a}\). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \(0.610 \frac{\lambda}{a}\)**.
