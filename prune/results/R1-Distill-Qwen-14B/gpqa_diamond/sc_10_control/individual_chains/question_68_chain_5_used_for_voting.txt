Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says that the particle has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. So we need to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, it affects the energy levels of the particle, and the spin precesses. But this situation changes when the field direction changes. So maybe the system's Hamiltonian changes suddenly, causing the state to evolve differently.

Let me think about the initial state. The magnetic field was along Z, so the particle's spin is aligned with Z. That means the initial state is probably an eigenstate of Sz. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of Sz are |+z> and |-z>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Since the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * Sz, the initial state must be |+z>, because the magnetic moment is aligned with B. So the initial state is |+z> before the field is changed.

Then the field is turned off and turned on along Y. Oh wait, but when the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian might change. Wait, the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field via the Zeeman term, so the Hamiltonian is something like H = -mu · B. But when B is along Z, H is proportional to Sz. Then when B is along Y, H becomes proportional to Sy.

Wait, but wait. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B. So initially, H was along Z: H_initial = -gamma B S_z. Then, after, H_final = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but when the field is turned off, is the Hamiltonian zero? Or does the system's state change abruptly? Oh, the question says the magnetic field is turned off and another is turned on along Y. So the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial, then it's H_final, which is along Y. So the system's state changes from an eigenstate of Sz to a state that's no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian.

So the time evolution after the switch will be governed by H_final. The state will evolve under H_final, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question is about the average z-component of the particle's moment, <mu_z>. We need to find its oscillation frequency.

I remember that when a two-level system's Hamiltonian is time-dependent, the expectation values can oscillate. But in this case, after the switch, the Hamiltonian is time-independent, so the oscillations should come from the time evolution under the new H.

Let me model this. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. The new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. Since S_y has eigenstates that are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>, the initial state will evolve into a state that's a combination of those eigenstates, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). Since H is γ B S_y, H = γ B S_y. Wait, let me write S_y in terms of Pauli matrices. S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y, where sigma_y is the Pauli matrix. So H = gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So H = (gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y.

The time evolution operator becomes:

U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ ) 
= exp( -i (gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y t / ħ )
= exp( -i (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y )

Let me denote theta = gamma B t / 2.

Now, sigma_y is a Pauli matrix, which has the property that sigma_y^2 = I, so when expanding the exponential, higher even powers cancel out and odd powers give sigma_y.

So the exponential can be written as cos(theta) I - i sigma_y sin(theta).

Wait, because for any Pauli matrix, exp(-i theta sigma · n) = I cos(theta) - i (sigma · n) sin(theta). So in this case, the direction is along y, so n is (0,1,0), so sigma · n is sigma_y.

Thus, U(t) = cos(theta) I - i sigma_y sin(theta), where theta = (gamma B t) / 2.

Now, the initial state is |+z>, which is the eigenstate of S_z. Let's write |+z> as (1, 0)^T in the Sz basis. Let me compute U(t) |+z>.

U(t) |+z> = [cos(theta) I - i sigma_y sin(theta)] |+z>.

Breaking it down:

cos(theta) I |+z> = cos(theta) |+z>.
sigma_y |+z> = i |−z> (because sigma_y |+z> = i |−z>).

Wait, let me recall: for spin-1/2,

sigma_x |+z> = |−z>
sigma_y |+z> = i |−z>
sigma_z |+z> = |+z>

So, sigma_y |+z> = i |−z>.

So,

- i sigma_y sin(theta) |+z> = -i (i |−z>) sin(theta) 
= (-i^2) |−z> sin(theta)
= (- (-1)) |−z> sin(theta)
= |−z> sin(theta)

Putting it all together:

U(t) |+z> = [cos(theta) |+z> + sin(theta) |−z> ]

So the state at time t is |psi(t)> = cos(theta)|+z> + sin(theta)|−z>.

Now, the magnetic moment along z is mu_z = gamma S_z.

The expectation value <mu_z> is gamma <S_z>.

Since S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, and S_z |−z> = -(ħ/2)|−z>.

So <S_z> = [ <psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) > ]

Let's compute this.

|psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + sin(theta) |−z>
So,

<psi(t)| S_z | psi(t)> 
= [cos(theta)* < +z | + sin(theta) < -z | ] 
S_z [cos(theta) |+z> + sin(theta)|−z> ]

Expanding,

= cos(theta) cos(theta) < +z | S_z | +z > 
+ cos(theta) sin(theta) < +z | S_z | -z >
+ sin(theta) cos(theta) < -z | S_z | +z >
+ sin(theta) sin(theta) < -z | S_z | -z > 

Now, each term:

< +z | S_z | +z > = ħ/2.
< +z | S_z | -z > = 0 because S_z | -z > = -ħ/2 | -z >, so the inner product is zero.
Similarly, < -z | S_z | +z > =0.
< -z | S_z | -z > = -ħ/2.

So,

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + sin^2(theta) (-ħ/2)
= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]
= (ħ/2) cos(2 theta)

Because cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) = cos(2 theta).

So <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta).

Now, theta is (gamma B t)/2.

So,

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Because 2 theta = gamma B t.

Wait wait, wait: 2 theta is (gamma B t), so cos(2 theta) is cos(gamma B t).

So,

<mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma*(ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

But wait, wait, let me think about units. Does this make sense?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check that.

Wait, theta = gamma B t / 2.

So 2 theta = gamma B t.

So cos(2 theta) = cos(gamma B t).

So <mu_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

But wait, what's the unit of gamma here? Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, which has units of (rad s^-1 T^-1), I think. So gamma*B has units of rad s^-1, which is angular frequency. So the argument of the cosine is correct.

So the oscillation frequency of <mu_z> is gamma B, because the cosine function has argument gamma B t, so the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but the options include gamma B as option B, and others. So the answer would be B) gamma*B.

But wait a minute. Let me think again. Is there any factor of sqrt(2) or 1/2 involved?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Hamiltonian.

Wait, the Hamiltonian when the field is along Y is H = -mu · B = -gamma S_y B. So H = - gamma B S_y.

Wait, because mu = gamma S, so mu · B is gamma S · B. So if B is along Y, it's gamma S_y B.

So H = - gamma B S_y.

Earlier, I think I might have missed the negative sign, but in the time evolution, it's exp(-i H t / ħ ), so the negative sign would be incorporated.

Wait, let me re-derive the time evolution with the correct H.

H = - gamma B S_y.

So, H = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So, H = - (gamma B ħ / 2 ) sigma_y.

Thus, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ )

= exp( -i [ - gamma B ħ sigma_y / 2 ] * t / ħ )

= exp( i (gamma B t sigma_y) / 2 )

So, the exponential is exp( i (gamma B t / 2 ) sigma_y )

Which is the same as before, except the exponent is positive. So when expanding, the sigma_y term would have a positive.

So, the expansion would be cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta), with theta = gamma B t/2.

So, U(t) = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta).

Then, applying U(t) to |+z>:

U(t)|+z> = [cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta)] |+z>

Again, sigma_y |+z> = i |−z>. So,

= cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) (i |−z> )
= cos(theta) |+z> + i^2 sin(theta) |−z>
= cos(theta)|+z> - sin(theta)|−z>

So, the state is |+z> cos(theta) - |−z> sin(theta).

Wait, that's different from before. Hmm, but does that affect the expectation value of S_z?

Let me compute <S_z> again.

<mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma [ <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> ]

So |psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta)|−z>

Then,

<psi(t)| S_z | psi(t)> = [cos(theta) < +z | - sin(theta) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta)|−z> ]

Expanding:

cos(theta) cos(theta) < +z | S_z | +z> 
- cos(theta) sin(theta) < +z | S_z | -z> 
- sin(theta) cos(theta) < -z | S_z | +z> 
+ sin(theta) sin(theta) < -z | S_z | -z> 

Which again becomes:

cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 )

So again,

(ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ] = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

And theta is gamma B t/2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.

So same as before, <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

Thus, <mu_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

Wait, but wait. Gamma has units of (rad s^-1 T^-1 ), so gamma*B has units of rad/s, which is angular frequency. So the frequency of oscillation is gamma*B.

But looking at the options, option B is gamma*B.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier when I thought about the Rabi oscillations, the frequency is proportional to the energy difference over ħ. But maybe this isn't exactly a Rabi oscillation scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the energy levels.

The energy eigenvalues for H = - gamma B S_y are E = ± (gamma B ħ / 2 )

The energy difference between the two levels is gamma B ħ.

Thus, the transition frequency is (E_+ - E_-)/ħ = (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B.

Which matches our previous result.

So the oscillation frequency of <mu_z> is gamma*B.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option B is gamma*B.

So the correct answer should be B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then switched off and turned on along the $+Y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $|+z\rangle$, since the magnetic moment is aligned with the initial $+Z$ field.

2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the field is turned on along $+Y$, the Hamiltonian becomes:
   \[
   H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y.
   \]
   Substituting $S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y$, the Hamiltonian is:
   \[
   H = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2} \sigma_y.
   \]

3. **Time Evolution**: The time evolution operator is:
   \[
   U(t) = \exp\left(-\frac{i H t}{\hbar}\right) = \exp\left(i \frac{\gamma B t}{2} \sigma_y\right).
   \]
   Using the properties of Pauli matrices, the exponential can be expanded as:
   \[
   U(t) = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) I + i \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) \sigma_y.
   \]

4. **State Evolution**: Applying $U(t)$ to the initial state $|+z\rangle$, the state at time $t$ becomes:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|+z\rangle + i \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|-z\rangle.
   \]

5. **Expectation Value of $\mu_z$**: The $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. The expectation value $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle.
   \]
   Substituting $S_z |+z\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2}|+z\rangle$ and $S_z |-z\rangle = -\frac{\hbar}{2}|-z\rangle$, the computation yields:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

6. **Oscillation Frequency**: The cosine term oscillates with angular frequency $\gamma B$. Thus, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says that the particle has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. So we need to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, it affects the energy levels of the particle, and the spin precesses. But this situation changes when the field direction changes. So maybe the system's Hamiltonian changes suddenly, causing the state to evolve differently.

Let me think about the initial state. The magnetic field was along Z, so the particle's spin is aligned with Z. That means the initial state is probably an eigenstate of Sz. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of Sz are |+z> and |-z>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Since the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * Sz, the initial state must be |+z>, because the magnetic moment is aligned with B. So the initial state is |+z> before the field is changed.

Then the field is turned off and turned on along Y. Oh wait, but when the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian might change. Wait, the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field via the Zeeman term, so the Hamiltonian is something like H = -mu · B. But when B is along Z, H is proportional to Sz. Then when B is along Y, H becomes proportional to Sy.

Wait, but wait. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B. So initially, H was along Z: H_initial = -gamma B S_z. Then, after, H_final = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but when the field is turned off, is the Hamiltonian zero? Or does the system's state change abruptly? Oh, the question says the magnetic field is turned off and another is turned on along Y. So the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial, then it's H_final, which is along Y. So the system's state changes from an eigenstate of Sz to a state that's no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian.

So the time evolution after the switch will be governed by H_final. The state will evolve under H_final, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question is about the average z-component of the particle's moment, <mu_z>. We need to find its oscillation frequency.

I remember that when a two-level system's Hamiltonian is time-dependent, the expectation values can oscillate. But in this case, after the switch, the Hamiltonian is time-independent, so the oscillations should come from the time evolution under the new H.

Let me model this. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. The new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. Since S_y has eigenstates that are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>, the initial state will evolve into a state that's a combination of those eigenstates, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). Since H is γ B S_y, H = γ B S_y. Wait, let me write S_y in terms of Pauli matrices. S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y, where sigma_y is the Pauli matrix. So H = gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So H = (gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y.

The time evolution operator becomes:

U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ ) 
= exp( -i (gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y t / ħ )
= exp( -i (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y )

Let me denote theta = gamma B t / 2.

Now, sigma_y is a Pauli matrix, which has the property that sigma_y^2 = I, so when expanding the exponential, higher even powers cancel out and odd powers give sigma_y.

So the exponential can be written as cos(theta) I - i sigma_y sin(theta).

Wait, because for any Pauli matrix, exp(-i theta sigma · n) = I cos(theta) - i (sigma · n) sin(theta). So in this case, the direction is along y, so n is (0,1,0), so sigma · n is sigma_y.

Thus, U(t) = cos(theta) I - i sigma_y sin(theta), where theta = (gamma B t) / 2.

Now, the initial state is |+z>, which is the eigenstate of S_z. Let's write |+z> as (1, 0)^T in the Sz basis. Let me compute U(t) |+z>.

U(t) |+z> = [cos(theta) I - i sigma_y sin(theta)] |+z>.

Breaking it down:

cos(theta) I |+z> = cos(theta) |+z>.
sigma_y |+z> = i |−z> (because sigma_y |+z> = i |−z>).

Wait, let me recall: for spin-1/2,

sigma_x |+z> = |−z>
sigma_y |+z> = i |−z>
sigma_z |+z> = |+z>

So, sigma_y |+z> = i |−z>.

So,

- i sigma_y sin(theta) |+z> = -i (i |−z>) sin(theta) 
= (-i^2) |−z> sin(theta)
= (- (-1)) |−z> sin(theta)
= |−z> sin(theta)

Putting it all together:

U(t) |+z> = [cos(theta) |+z> + sin(theta) |−z> ]

So the state at time t is |psi(t)> = cos(theta)|+z> + sin(theta)|−z>.

Now, the magnetic moment along z is mu_z = gamma S_z.

The expectation value <mu_z> is gamma <S_z>.

Since S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, and S_z |−z> = -(ħ/2)|−z>.

So <S_z> = [ <psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) > ]

Let's compute this.

|psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + sin(theta) |−z>
So,

<psi(t)| S_z | psi(t)> 
= [cos(theta)* < +z | + sin(theta) < -z | ] 
S_z [cos(theta) |+z> + sin(theta)|−z> ]

Expanding,

= cos(theta) cos(theta) < +z | S_z | +z > 
+ cos(theta) sin(theta) < +z | S_z | -z >
+ sin(theta) cos(theta) < -z | S_z | +z >
+ sin(theta) sin(theta) < -z | S_z | -z > 

Now, each term:

< +z | S_z | +z > = ħ/2.
< +z | S_z | -z > = 0 because S_z | -z > = -ħ/2 | -z >, so the inner product is zero.
Similarly, < -z | S_z | +z > =0.
< -z | S_z | -z > = -ħ/2.

So,

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + sin^2(theta) (-ħ/2)
= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]
= (ħ/2) cos(2 theta)

Because cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) = cos(2 theta).

So <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta).

Now, theta is (gamma B t)/2.

So,

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Because 2 theta = gamma B t.

Wait wait, wait: 2 theta is (gamma B t), so cos(2 theta) is cos(gamma B t).

So,

<mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma*(ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

But wait, wait, let me think about units. Does this make sense?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check that.

Wait, theta = gamma B t / 2.

So 2 theta = gamma B t.

So cos(2 theta) = cos(gamma B t).

So <mu_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

But wait, what's the unit of gamma here? Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, which has units of (rad s^-1 T^-1), I think. So gamma*B has units of rad s^-1, which is angular frequency. So the argument of the cosine is correct.

So the oscillation frequency of <mu_z> is gamma B, because the cosine function has argument gamma B t, so the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but the options include gamma B as option B, and others. So the answer would be B) gamma*B.

But wait a minute. Let me think again. Is there any factor of sqrt(2) or 1/2 involved?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Hamiltonian.

Wait, the Hamiltonian when the field is along Y is H = -mu · B = -gamma S_y B. So H = - gamma B S_y.

Wait, because mu = gamma S, so mu · B is gamma S · B. So if B is along Y, it's gamma S_y B.

So H = - gamma B S_y.

Earlier, I think I might have missed the negative sign, but in the time evolution, it's exp(-i H t / ħ ), so the negative sign would be incorporated.

Wait, let me re-derive the time evolution with the correct H.

H = - gamma B S_y.

So, H = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So, H = - (gamma B ħ / 2 ) sigma_y.

Thus, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ )

= exp( -i [ - gamma B ħ sigma_y / 2 ] * t / ħ )

= exp( i (gamma B t sigma_y) / 2 )

So, the exponential is exp( i (gamma B t / 2 ) sigma_y )

Which is the same as before, except the exponent is positive. So when expanding, the sigma_y term would have a positive.

So, the expansion would be cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta), with theta = gamma B t/2.

So, U(t) = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta).

Then, applying U(t) to |+z>:

U(t)|+z> = [cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta)] |+z>

Again, sigma_y |+z> = i |−z>. So,

= cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) (i |−z> )
= cos(theta) |+z> + i^2 sin(theta) |−z>
= cos(theta)|+z> - sin(theta)|−z>

So, the state is |+z> cos(theta) - |−z> sin(theta).

Wait, that's different from before. Hmm, but does that affect the expectation value of S_z?

Let me compute <S_z> again.

<mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma [ <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> ]

So |psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta)|−z>

Then,

<psi(t)| S_z | psi(t)> = [cos(theta) < +z | - sin(theta) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta)|−z> ]

Expanding:

cos(theta) cos(theta) < +z | S_z | +z> 
- cos(theta) sin(theta) < +z | S_z | -z> 
- sin(theta) cos(theta) < -z | S_z | +z> 
+ sin(theta) sin(theta) < -z | S_z | -z> 

Which again becomes:

cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 )

So again,

(ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ] = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

And theta is gamma B t/2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.

So same as before, <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

Thus, <mu_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

Wait, but wait. Gamma has units of (rad s^-1 T^-1 ), so gamma*B has units of rad/s, which is angular frequency. So the frequency of oscillation is gamma*B.

But looking at the options, option B is gamma*B.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier when I thought about the Rabi oscillations, the frequency is proportional to the energy difference over ħ. But maybe this isn't exactly a Rabi oscillation scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the energy levels.

The energy eigenvalues for H = - gamma B S_y are E = ± (gamma B ħ / 2 )

The energy difference between the two levels is gamma B ħ.

Thus, the transition frequency is (E_+ - E_-)/ħ = (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B.

Which matches our previous result.

So the oscillation frequency of <mu_z> is gamma*B.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option B is gamma*B.

So the correct answer should be B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then switched off and turned on along the $+Y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $|+z\rangle$, since the magnetic moment is aligned with the initial $+Z$ field.

2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the field is turned on along $+Y$, the Hamiltonian becomes:
   \[
   H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y.
   \]
   Substituting $S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y$, the Hamiltonian is:
   \[
   H = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2} \sigma_y.
   \]

3. **Time Evolution**: The time evolution operator is:
   \[
   U(t) = \exp\left(-\frac{i H t}{\hbar}\right) = \exp\left(i \frac{\gamma B t}{2} \sigma_y\right).
   \]
   Using the properties of Pauli matrices, the exponential can be expanded as:
   \[
   U(t) = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) I + i \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) \sigma_y.
   \]

4. **State Evolution**: Applying $U(t)$ to the initial state $|+z\rangle$, the state at time $t$ becomes:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|+z\rangle + i \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|-z\rangle.
   \]

5. **Expectation Value of $\mu_z$**: The $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. The expectation value $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle.
   \]
   Substituting $S_z |+z\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2}|+z\rangle$ and $S_z |-z\rangle = -\frac{\hbar}{2}|-z\rangle$, the computation yields:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

6. **Oscillation Frequency**: The cosine term oscillates with angular frequency $\gamma B$. Thus, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.
