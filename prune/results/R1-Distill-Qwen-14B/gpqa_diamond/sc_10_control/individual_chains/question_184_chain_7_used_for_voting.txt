Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of steps. I need to choose the right one. 

Hmm, the target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are 1, 2, and 3 on the ring, which means they are meta to each other. Wait, no, wait. Let me visualize the benzene ring. The numbering is such that the substituents are 1, 2, and 3. So, it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. But wait, that can't be possible because with three substituents in adjacent positions, the structure would be a bit crowded. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is different. Wait, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions relative to each other in a way that they are placed ortho, meta, etc. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the substituents' positions in terms of meta and para. 

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, nitro at position 3, and tert-butyl at position 2. So, their positions are adjacent. So, positions 1, 2, and 3 are all ortho to each other. So, the substituents are in adjacent positions, which would make the molecule a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. That's a bit challenging because each substituent's directing effects could influence the next substitution.

Each substituent can be either an activating or deactivating group and either meta or para directing. Let me list the substituents:

- tert-butyl: This is a bulky, strong activating group because it's an alkyl group. Alkyl groups are ortho/para directors. So when adding a new group, the substituent will go to ortho or para positions relative to the tert-butyl group.

- ethoxy: This is an activating group (since O is more electronegative, but the lone pairs activate the ring), so it's an activating, ortho/para director.

- nitro: This is a strong deactivating, meta director.

Wait, but the target molecule has all three substituents. So the question is about the order in which these groups are added to the benzene ring. Since each substitution is a step that must occur in a certain order, I need to figure out the right sequence to get the substituents in the correct positions.

But synthesizing such a molecule usually requires planning the order of introducing substituents because each step affects where the next substituent will attach. The key is to choose the order that allows each new substituent to be added in the correct position relative to the existing groups.

So, to get all three substituents in 1,2,3 positions, perhaps the order of addition matters. Let me think about the possible orders of adding the substituents. The substituents are ethoxy, nitro, and tert-butyl.

Wait, but ethoxy can be introduced via an etherification reaction, nitro via nitration, and tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts alkylation (since it's a tertiary alkyl group, but wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires that the alkylating agent be a good enough Lewis acid to form the acylium ion, but tert-butyl chloride can be used with AlCl3 as a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts. However, Friedel-Crafts typically works better with alkyl halides that can form stable carbocations, but wait, wait, wait—tert-butyl chloride is a tertiary alkyl chloride. Friedel-Crafts alkylation generally works better for alkyl groups that can form stable carbocations, like those with at least one adjacent carbon (like isopropyl), but tert-butyl is a very bulky group. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation with a tertiary chloride may not proceed because the carbocation might be too stable but the reaction is more favorable for less hindered groups. Wait, actually, Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically doesn't work with tert-butyl chloride because of carbocation rearrangements, but wait, no, since it's a tertiary chloride, the carbocation is already the most stable possible (tert-butyl carbocation). So perhaps Friedel-Crafts can be used, but sometimes bulky groups can be difficult because the carbocation is so bulky that it's hard to attack the ring. Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different method to introduce the tert-butyl group, like using a directing group. But perhaps the question assumes Friedel-Crafts is possible here.

Now, the substituent order: Let's think about the order of substitution. Let's figure out which substituent is introduced first, second, and third.

If I add the nitro group first, it's a meta director. Then, adding the tert-butyl group (ortho/para), but that might complicate the positions. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is added first because it's an activating group and can help in directing the next group.

Wait, perhaps I should plan the steps. The target has ethoxy (OCH2CH3) at position 1, nitro (NO2) at position 3, and tert-butyl (C(CH3)3) at position 2. So, the benzene ring is 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro.

Wait, that's not possible because if you have three substituents, each being a substituent in adjacent positions, you can't have all three in a row without some overlap. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 around the ring. For example, substituents in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), which are adjacent to each other in a way that each is in the correct relative position.

But perhaps I should approach this by considering the order of substituent addition.

Let me think about the directing effects. The first substituent added will determine the positions where the next substituent can go.

Option 1: Add ethoxy first. Ethoxy is activating, ortho/para director. Then, next substituent (nitro or tert-butyl) will be added in an ortho or para position relative to the ethoxy. Let's say we add nitro next. Nitro is deactivating, meta director relative to itself, but when added to a ring that already has an ethoxy group, it will be directed by the ethoxy group. Wait, but when adding a nitro group, the existing substituents (like ethoxy) will direct the incoming nitro group.

Wait, no, wait. When a nitro group is added, it's a meta director. But when adding a nitro group to benzene that already has ethoxy, the nitration would occur at a position directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, benzene with ethoxy group: the ethoxy is at position 1. So, during nitration, the incoming nitro group would go to ortho or para positions relative to the ethoxy. But nitro is a meta director relative to itself. No, wait, no—when you add a substituent to benzene, the existing substituent(s) direct the incoming group. So, if we have ethoxy at position 1, the nitro group would be added either ortho (position 2) or para (position 4). But in our target, the nitro group is at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy and tert-butyl. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right order.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added third. Let me think about adding the tert-butyl group first.

If I first add tert-butyl, which is an activating group, ortho/para director. Then, add ethoxy, which would go ortho or para to the tert-butyl group. Then, add nitro, which would be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, let me go through an example. Suppose the first substituent is tert-butyl. Then, when adding ethoxy, it would go to an ortho or para position relative to the tert-butyl. Let's say it goes to the para position. Then, when adding nitro, it would be directed by both substituents. Wait, but nitro is meta director, but in the presence of other substituents, the strongest directors take over.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added before the ethoxy. Let's think: if I nitrate benzene first, the nitro group is meta to itself, but since it's the first substituent, it will direct the next substituents to the meta position relative to nitro. Then, adding ethoxy would go to the ortho or para relative to nitro, but since nitro is deactivating, the ethoxy would be an activating group, which might be harder to substitute.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me approach this by considering the steps each option presents and see which leads to the correct substituent positions.

Looking at the options, each is a series of reactions. Let's take option D as an example.

Option D: The steps are:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → this is a reducing condition, perhaps for reducing nitro groups, but I'm not sure. Wait, Fe/HCl could be for some kind of substitution, but more likely, it's a catalyst for some reaction. Alternatively, in the context of nitration, Fe is often used as a catalyst. Wait, no, for nitration, H2SO4 is the catalyst. Fe is used in other reactions, like the Clemmensen reduction, but that's for ketones to alkanes. Alternatively, FeCl3 is used as a catalyst in some reactions, like nucleophilic substitution. Hmm, perhaps this step is a nitration again, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each step in each option and see which sequence correctly builds the substituents in the right order.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is to first nitrate, then introduce ethoxy, then tert-butyl, but that might not work because nitro is a meta director, which could complicate the positions.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group last because nitration requires a strong catalyst and could be more challenging when other substituents are present. Alternatively, the nitro group might come early because it's a deactivating group, making further substitution harder.

Wait, another approach: Let me outline the target structure again. The molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). Wait, that's a bit confusing because in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent to each other, which would make them all ortho to each other. But that's not possible because a benzene ring can't have three substituents in adjacent positions without overlapping. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the positions. Let me draw the benzene ring. Let's say substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, meaning each is adjacent to the others. But that would require all three to be adjacent, which is possible, but the directing effects would be tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that substituents are in positions 1, 3, and 4, for example, but I'm not certain. Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituents as being in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), which are all adjacent. But perhaps that's not feasible because each substituent would direct new groups in a conflicting way.

Wait, maybe it's better to focus on the synthesis steps. Let me think about each substituent's effect. Each substituent is either activating or deactivating and directs incoming groups to certain positions.

The target molecule has ethoxy (activating, ortho/para), nitro (deactivating, meta), and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). So, when adding substituents, the order in which they're added will determine where the next group goes.

Option B: The steps are:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation) → adds tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → possibly a reduction or another alkylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis, maybe to form a sulfonic acid or something.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy group via SN2 (like Williamson ether synthesis, but perhaps using ethyl bromide and a base to displace a leaving group).

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis or another step.

Wait, but this seems a bit convoluted. Let me think about each step. Starting with benzene, step i adds tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts. So now we have tert-butylbenzene. Next, nitration: so the nitro group would be added either ortho or para to the tert-butyl group because tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para director. Let's say it goes para, so now we have 4-nitro-1-tert-butylbenzene. Hmm, but the target has nitro at position 3 relative to ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Wait, perhaps I should track each step. Let me outline the steps for option A:

Option A: 

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl to benzene. Product: tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate the benzene. Now, the tert-butyl group is an activating, ortho/para director. So the nitro group will add ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say para. Now, structure is 4-nitro-1-tert-butylbenzene.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation; adding a sulfonic acid group. Wait, but the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. So perhaps this is a mistake, or maybe it's part of the synthesis steps to aid in directing. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts sulfonation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should skip option A for now and look at another option.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → FeCl3 is a catalyst, but perhaps this step is for another nitration? Or is it a reduction? Let me think. Fe/HCl is often used in the Bechamp reaction, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it might be a step to form a diazonium salt. For example, in the presence of HCl and Fe, nitrobenzene might be reduced to aniline. Wait, but nitrobenzene can be reduced using Fe and HCl to produce phenylamine. So, step ii would be reduction of nitrobenzene to benzene with an amino group. But that would change the structure.

Wait, the target has a nitro group, so perhaps that's not the intended path. Alternatively, perhaps this step is a nitration again, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The target has all three substituents, so the steps should add these substituents in the correct order.

Option D's steps are:

i) Nitration → adds nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps converts nitro to amine (but that would remove the nitro group, which isn't desired). Alternatively, perhaps this is a nitration again, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me think about the synthesis steps required to get the substituents in the correct positions.

The target molecule's substituents are ethoxy (OCH2CH3) at position 1, nitro at position 3, and tert-butyl at position 2. Wait, perhaps I should number the ring such that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, each is adjacent to the next. But that would require all three substituents to be in a row, which could be challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is to first add ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Let me see:

1. Benzene → ethoxybenzene (using ethyl chloride and a base, perhaps via SNAr, but more likely via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but ethyl chloride is a primary alkyl halide, which might not undergo Friedel-Crafts easily. Alternatively, perhaps using a better alkylating agent like ethyl chloride with a Lewis acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that introducing ethoxy may require an etherification reaction. So, benzene can undergo alkylation to form ethoxybenzene. Alternatively, perhaps using a different method, like the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction, but that's for phenol derivatives.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to introduce the tert-butyl group, then the ethoxy, then the nitro.

So, benzene → tert-butylbenzene via Friedel-Crafts (step i in option D is nitration, but let me see).

But looking at the options, perhaps the correct sequence is to add the ethoxy group first, then tert-butyl, then nitro. But I'm not sure how that would fit with the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first nitrate, then add ethoxy, then add tert-butyl. But again, I'm not certain. Let me try to think through each option's steps.

Looking at option B:

Option B's steps are:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis (maybe to form a phenol or something).

vii) NaOH/EtBr → introduce ethoxy group via SN2.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis.

Wait, but the target molecule has nitro, tert-butyl, and ethoxy groups. So, after step ii, we have tert-butyl and nitro groups. Let's say nitro is at para position relative to tert-butyl because tert-butyl is an ortho/para director. Then, Fe/HCl (step iii) could be a reduction, converting nitro to amine. So, structure becomes tert-butylbenzene with an amine group at para position. Then, step iv nitrates again. But amine is a strong activating group, so nitration would occur at ortho or para relative to amine. But I'm not sure if this is leading us toward the target. Then, step v is diazotization, which would convert the amine to a diazonium salt. Step vi is hydrolysis under acidic conditions, which would form a phenol. Then, step vii: NaOH and EtBr would perform an SN2 reaction to introduce ethoxy group. So now we'd have a phenol with ethoxy. But I'm not sure how this leads to the target.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe another approach is needed. Let's think about the substituents' activating or deactivating nature and their directing effects.

The target has a nitro group (deactivating, meta director), ethoxy (activating, ortho/para), and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). So, the nitro group would be the most deactivating, making the ring less reactive toward further substitution.

Therefore, the nitro group should be introduced last because once it's present, the ring becomes less reactive, and adding other groups may be more difficult. Alternatively, if the nitro group is introduced early, the subsequent substitutions may be directed by it, which could complicate the positions.

Wait, but the tert-butyl and ethoxy groups are activating, so perhaps they are introduced first. Let me consider the order: tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Because after adding tert-butyl, the ring is still activated, making it easier to add ethoxy. Then, nitro is added last, perhaps in a position directed by both tert-butyl and ethoxy.

Wait, but the nitro group is meta to itself, so when adding it last, it's influenced by the existing substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added second, then ethoxy third.

This is tricky. Let me try to think about each option's steps again.

Looking back at the target, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me imagine the benzene ring with ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, each substituent is adjacent. Let's consider how each substituent is added.

If I add tert-butyl first, ring is activated, then add ethoxy. The ethoxy would go ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say para. So, structure is tert-butyl at position 1, ethoxy at position 4. Then, adding nitro next. Nitro would be directed by both substituents. But since nitro is meta to itself, perhaps it goes meta to the ethoxy, which would be position 6. That's not the target. Alternatively, perhaps it goes meta to the tert-butyl, which would be position 4 (but ethoxy is already there), so this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added between the tert-butyl and ethoxy. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first. So, benzene is nitrated to nitrobenzene. Then, tert-butyl is added via Friedel-Crafts, which would go ortho or para to the nitro group. Nitro is meta director, so the next substituent (tert-butyl) would go meta to nitro. Wait, but nitro is a meta director, so the substituent would be in the meta position relative to nitro. So, if nitro is at position 1, the next substituent would go to position 3, which is meta. Then, adding ethoxy would go to positions directed by both nitro and tert-butyl.

Wait, perhaps that's a way. Let me outline:

Step 1: Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene (nitro at position 1).

Step 2: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → adds tert-butyl. Since nitro is a meta director, tert-butyl would add at position 4 (meta to nitro at 1). Wait, but in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 4 are para, so that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me visualize the benzene ring with nitro at position 1. The meta positions are 3 and 5. So, tert-butyl would be added at position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3. Now, the ring has nitro at 1 and tert-butyl at 3.

Step 3: Now, add ethoxy. The existing substituents are nitro (at 1) and tert-butyl (at 3). Nitro is deactivating and meta director, tert-butyl is activating and ortho/para director. The ethoxy group will be directed primarily by the more activating group, tert-butyl. So, ethoxy would add ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say ortho, which would be position 4. But in that case, the substituents would be at positions 1 (nitro), 3 (tert-butyl), and 4 (ethoxy). That's not the target structure. The target requires substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let's think about another order.

What if the order is to first add ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro?

Step 1: Add ethoxy to benzene → ethoxybenzene. The ethoxy is at position 1.

Step 2: Add tert-butyl. It would be directed by the ethoxy group, so ortho or para. Let's say para → position 4.

Now, the ring has ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 4.

Step 3: Add nitro. Now, the substituents are ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). The nitro group is deactivating and meta director. So, where would it go? It would be directed by the existing substituents. Let me see:

The ethoxy is at 1. Its ortho positions are 2 and 6; para is 4 (which is already occupied by tert-butyl). So, possible positions for nitro would be 3 or 5, considering the ethoxy's meta positions. Alternatively, considering the tert-butyl at 4, its ortho positions are 3 and 5; para is 1 (ethoxy). So, nitro can go to 3 or 5. Let's say nitro goes to position 3. Now, the substituents are ethoxy (1), tert-butyl (4), nitro (3). But the target has nitro at 3, tert-butyl at 2, and ethoxy at 1. So, the positions don't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group goes to position 2. But ethoxy at 1 would direct the nitro to positions 3 and 5 (its meta positions). So, perhaps this approach isn't leading us to the target.

Wait, perhaps the order is to add tert-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy.

Step 1: Add tert-butyl → tert-butylbenzene.

Step 2: Nitrate → nitro group adds ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say para → position 4.

Now, substituents are tert-butyl (1), nitro (4).

Step 3: Add ethoxy. The ethoxy is directed by both substituents. The tert-butyl is activating, ortho/para director, and nitro is deactivating, meta director. So, the most activating group (tert-butyl) would have a stronger influence. The ethoxy would go ortho or para to tert-butyl. So, ortho would be position 2 or position 6. Let's say position 2.

Now, substituents are tert-butyl (1), nitro (4), ethoxy (2). But the target needs nitro at 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. So, perhaps this doesn't align.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is ethoxy first, then nitro, then tert-butyl.

Step 1: Ethoxy added → ethoxybenzene (position 1).

Step 2: Nitrate. Nitro would be directed by ethoxy to ortho or para positions. Let's say para → position 4.

Now, substituents are ethoxy (1), nitro (4).

Step 3: Add tert-butyl. Now, the ring has ethoxy (1) and nitro (4). Ethoxy is activating, directs ortho/para. Nitro is deactivating, meta. So, tert-butyl would be directed to ortho or para of ethoxy. Let's say ortho → position 2. Now, substituents are ethoxy (1), nitro (4), tert-butyl (2). But the target needs nitro at 3, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2. So, that's close but not exactly the target. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the target has nitro at position 3 relative to ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2. So, the substituents are in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, how to get nitro to position 3?

If ethoxy is at 1 and tert-butyl at 2, then nitro would be added adjacent to both, which would be position 3. But when adding nitro, the directing effects of ethoxy and tert-butyl would influence where it goes.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Let me outline:

Step 1: Ethoxy added to benzene → ethoxybenzene (position 1).

Step 2: Add tert-butyl. It goes ortho or para to ethoxy. Let's say ortho → position 2.

Now, substituents are ethoxy (1), tert-butyl (2).

Step 3: Add nitro. Now, the existing substituents are ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). The nitro group is deactivating and meta director. So, where would it go? It would be directed by the existing activating groups. Since ethoxy is at 1 and tert-butyl at 2, the possible positions for nitro would be where it's meta to one of them and ortho/para to the other. Let's see:

Looking from ethoxy at 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5. From tert-butyl at 2, the meta positions are 5 and 6. So, the only overlapping position is 5. But if nitro is added at position 5, that's not the target. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added para to the ethoxy, which would be position 4. But that's not the target either. So perhaps this order isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl, but in a position that's meta to one substituent and ortho to the other. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about which options correctly place the substituents in the correct order. Let me go back to the options and see which one's steps would lead to the target.

Looking at option B again:

Steps:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolyze.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → introduce ethoxy.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → ?

Wait, perhaps this is a long way, but let me think.

After step i, tert-butyl is added.

Step ii: nitrate → nitro group added ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say para → position 4.

Now, substituents are tert-butyl (1), nitro (4).

Step iii: Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine. So now, substituents are tert-butyl (1), amine (4).

Step iv: nitrate again → but the ring now has an amine (activating) which directs incoming nitro to ortho or para positions relative to amine. So nitro would be added at position 1 (already has tert-butyl) or position 7 (which is same as position 1 in a benzene ring). Wait, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the ring has amine at 4, and the nitro would go to position 2 or 6 (ortho to amine). Let's say position 2.

Now, substituents are tert-butyl (1), nitro (4), and another nitro (2). But the target only has one nitro group, so this seems off.

This path doesn't seem to fit. Let me check another option.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

ix) NaOH/EtBr → introduce ethoxy.

Hmm. Let's think:

Step i: tert-butyl added → tert-butylbenzene.

Step ii: sulfonate → adds SO3 group, which is a strong meta director and deactivating.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so perhaps this is not the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps each option's steps should be evaluated based on the substituent positions.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts to add tert-butyl.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → ?

ix) NaOH/EtBr → introduce ethoxy.

Wait, let me outline the steps:

Start with benzene.

Step i: Nitrate → nitrobenzene.

Step ii: Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → aniline.

Step iii: Friedel-Crafts with tert-butyl → add tert-butyl to aniline. But aniline is a strong activating group, so the tert-butyl would add in ortho or para positions. Let's say para to the amine (now at position 1), so tert-butyl at position 4.

Step iv: Nitrate again → the ring has amine (1) and tert-butyl (4). Nitration would be directed by the amine, which is ortho/para. So nitro would be added at position 2 or 6. Let's say position 2.

Now, substituents are amine (1), tert-butyl (4), nitro (2).

Step v: Diazotization → convert amine to diazonium salt.

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate → perhaps introduces a sulfonic acid group. But the target doesn't have this. Hmm, perhaps this is a wrong path.

Alternatively, perhaps this option doesn't lead to the correct substituents. 

This is getting too time-consuming. Let me think of another approach: each substituent must be added in a way that their directing effects lead to the correct position for the next substituent.

The target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3.

So, when adding nitro last, the positions of ethoxy and tert-butyl should direct the nitro group to position 3.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director, so when adding it as the last substituent, it would be directed meta to itself, but how does that help?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added before ethoxy and tert-butyl. But then, ethoxy and tert-butyl would have to be added in the correct positions relative to the nitro.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, making further substitution harder. So perhaps it's better to add nitro last.

Let me try to outline the correct order:

1. Add ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

2. Add tert-butyl → directed by ethoxy to ortho or para. Let's say para, so now substituents are ethoxy (1), tert-butyl (4).

3. Add nitro → must go to position 3 or position 5 (meta to ethoxy). But considering the tert-butyl at 4, perhaps nitro is directed to position 3, which is ortho to tert-butyl and meta to ethoxy.

Wait, that might work. So, the steps would be:

- Ethoxy added first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find the sequence that includes these steps.

Looking at option B:

Option B's steps are:

i) tert-butyl → add tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate → add nitro (directed by tert-butyl, perhaps para → position 4).

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → add another nitro.

But this seems to add more nitro groups, which isn't desired.

Looking at option C:

Option C's steps:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate (adds SO3 group, which is a strong meta director).

iii) nitrate → add nitro.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro.

v) NaNO2 → diazotize.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy.

This seems to involve multiple nitration steps and doesn't clearly add ethoxy in the right place.

Option D:

i) Nitrate first → nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

iv) nitrate again.

v) diazotize.

vi) sulfonate.

vii) H2SO4.

viii) H3O+.

ix) ethoxy via NaOH and EtBr.

This seems to involve adding ethoxy last, which may not fit the target structure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D, but let me try to see.

In option D:

After step iii, we have tert-butyl added to the ring which has an amine (from step ii). The amine would direct the tert-butyl to ortho or para. Then, in step iv, nitrate again; but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Looking for which option's steps reflect this.

Looking at the options, perhaps option B or option D don't include ethoxy introduction via SN2 with NaOH and EtBr until a later step.

Wait, step vii in option B is NaOH/EtBr, which would introduce an ethoxy group via SN2, perhaps substituting a leaving group like a halide.

But in which step would that happen?

Let me think: perhaps after adding the nitro group and tert-butyl, the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts → tert-butylbenzene.

2. Nitrate → nitro added para to tert-butyl.

3. Diazotize nitro → but wait, nitro isn't easily converted to diazonium salts. Alternatively, perhaps it's the amine that is diazotized.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a diazonium salt to introduce a substituent. For example, introducing an ethoxy group via a diazonium salt might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring with a strong electron-withdrawing group. But that would require the ring to be strongly activated, which may not be feasible.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think differently. The target has nitro at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. So, when adding the nitro group last, the existing substituents (ethoxy and tert-butyl) must direct the nitro to position 3.

To achieve that, the existing substituents when adding nitro must be in positions that direct to 3.

If ethoxy is at 1 and tert-butyl at 2, then adding nitro would be directed by both. The ethoxy would direct meta (positions 3 and 5), and the tert-butyl would direct ortho or para (positions 1, 3). So, position 3 is a common position, which is meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl.

So, the sequence would be:

1. Add ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

2. Add tert-butyl → ortho to ethoxy (position 2).

3. Add nitro → position 3.

Now, which option has this sequence?

Looking at the options, perhaps option B or D.

Looking at option B:

The steps are:

i) tert-butyl → add tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro para to tert-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → another nitro group.

v) diazotize.

vi) hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → add ethoxy.

Hmm. So after step vii, ethoxy is added. But this would be after nitro groups have been added, which might not be the desired order.

Alternatively, perhaps option B's steps are as follows:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Nitrate → nitro at para (position 4).

3. Reduce nitro to amine.

4. Nitrate again → another nitro group at position 2 (ortho to amine at 4? Not sure).

Wait, this doesn't seem to lead to the target structure.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitrate → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts → adds at position 4 (para to amine).

iv) nitrate → nitro added at position 2 (ortho to amine).

v) diazotize → amine to diazonium.

vi) sulfonate → add SO3 group.

vii) H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+/H2O → ?

ix) NaOH/EtBr → add ethoxy.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so perhaps this is incorrect.

After considering all options, perhaps option D is the correct one because it includes adding the ethoxy group last, which could be directed correctly by the existing substituents.

Wait, but let me think: in option D, after step ix (NaOH/EtBr), the ethoxy group is added. So, the previous steps would have introduced nitro and tert-butyl groups. Let's track:

After step iii: tert-butyl added to the ring that has an amine group (from step ii). So, amine is at position 1, tert-butyl at position 4 (para).

Step iv: nitrate again → since the ring has an amine (activating), nitro would be added ortho or para to amine. Let's say para to amine is already taken by tert-butyl, so nitro goes ortho → position 2.

Now, substituents are amine (1), tert-butyl (4), nitro (2).

Step v: diazotize → convert amine to diazonium, which is then hydrolyzed in step vi (H3O+/H2O/Heat) to form a phenol group.

Wait, but step vi is H3O+ and heat, which would hydrolyze the diazonium salt to a phenol. So now, substituents are phenol (1), tert-butyl (4), nitro (2).

Step vii: dilute H2SO4 → perhaps sulfonation, but I'm not sure. Or maybe another step.

Step viii: H3O+/H2O/Heat → perhaps another hydrolysis, but I'm not certain.

Step ix: NaOH and EtBr → this would perform an SN2 reaction, but with what leaving group? The phenol would have to have a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the phenol is converted into something else first.

Wait, perhaps this isn't the right path. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, let me think about the correct order again. The target has substituents at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, when adding nitro last, the existing substituents would direct it to position 3.

Which options introduce nitro as the last substituent?

Looking at the options, option B introduces nitro in step iv, which is after ethoxy in step vii. So, nitro is introduced before ethoxy. That might not be correct.

Wait, no. Option B's steps are:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iv) nitrate → another nitro.

v) diazotize.

vi) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy.

So, ethoxy is added last. So, when adding nitro in step ii, the ring has only tert-butyl. So, nitro would be para to tert-butyl. Then, in step iii, nitro is reduced to amine. Then, step iv nitrates again, adding a new nitro group. Then, steps v-vi involve diazotization and hydrolysis, leading to a phenol. Finally, step vii adds ethoxy.

But the target has only one nitro group, so this seems to add two nitro groups, which is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that option C is the correct one.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) diazotize.

vi) nitrate.

vii) H3O+/H2O.

viii) H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy.

But this involves multiple nitrations and sulfonations, which don't seem to fit the target.

After considering all options, perhaps option B is the correct one. Because:

In option B, after adding tert-butyl and nitro, the steps involve reducing nitro to amine, nitrating again, then introducing ethoxy. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Which option does this?

Looking at option B again, the steps are:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iv) nitrate.

v) diazotize.

vi) hydrolysis.

vii) ethoxy.

So, ethoxy is added last, which may not be the correct order.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, perhaps option D's steps are:

i) nitrate → nitro at position 1.

ii) reduce → amine.

iii) add tert-butyl → para to amine (position 4).

iv) nitrate → nitro at position 2 (ortho to amine).

v) diazotize → amine to diazonium.

vi) sulfonate → add SO3 at position 5 (meta to nitro at 2).

vii) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+ → ?

ix) ethoxy via NaOH and EtBr.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so this may not be correct.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps it's best to make an educated guess. Based on the target structure, the correct sequence likely involves adding tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Looking at the options, option B seems to involve adding nitro before ethoxy, which might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, another thought: when adding ethoxy, you need a good leaving group. Perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution reaction, like in step vii of option B, which uses NaOH and EtBr. So, if the ring has a good leaving group like a nitro group, perhaps it's possible. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct. Let me quickly look at option C's steps:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) diazotize.

vi) nitrate.

vii) H3O+/H2O.

viii) H2SO4.

ix) ethoxy.

Hmm. Not sure.

After all this, I think the correct option is option B. But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituents' directing effects again. The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, when you add it last, the existing substituents should be activating and ortho/para directors to direct the nitro to the correct position.

So, the correct order would be to add ethoxy and tert-butyl first, then nitro. Which option has this order?

Looking at the options, option B adds nitro after tert-butyl, then reduces, then nitrates again. So, maybe that's not correct.

Alternatively, option D adds nitro first, then tert-butyl, then nitro again. Which doesn't seem right.

Another approach: the target requires a nitro group, an ethoxy, and a tert-butyl group. The order must be such that the nitro group is added last, as it's deactivating.

So, the first two steps would add the other two groups in a way that directs the nitro to the correct position.

Which option adds the nitro last?

Looking at the options:

Option A: steps i) tert-butyl, ii) nitrate, iii) sulfonate, iv) nitrate again, etc. So, nitro is added second and fourth. Not last.

Option B: nitro second, fourth. Not last.

Option C: nitro third, sixth. Not last.

Option D: nitro first, fourth. Not last.

Hmm, none of the options have nitro as the last step. So perhaps the correct order is different.

Wait, perhaps the nitro is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl.

This would require the nitro to be added last. Let me think which option does this.

Looking again:

Option B: steps i) tert-butyl, ii) nitrate → nitro added. So nitro is added second, not last.

Option D: steps i) nitrate → nitro first, then steps involving other reactions, and nitro added again in step iv. So nitro is added multiple times.

Wait, perhaps none of the options are perfect, but the correct sequence is to add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Let me see which option reflects this.

Looking for an option where the steps are:

1. Tert-butyl.

2. Ethoxy.

3. Nitro.

Looking at the options:

Option B: steps i) tert-butyl, ii) nitrate → nitro, then steps involving reduction, nitrate again, etc. So nitro is added second and fourth.

Option C: steps i) tert-butyl, ii) sulfonate, iii) nitrate → nitro added third. Then steps iv) reduce, v) diazo, vi) nitrate again, etc.

Hmm. Perhaps option B is the correct one because after adding tert-butyl and nitro, other steps introduce the ethoxy group in the correct position.

Wait, perhaps in option B, after adding tert-butyl and nitro, the steps reduce the nitro to amine, then nitrate again, which could add another nitro group in a different position. But I'm not sure.

After all this, I think I'll go with option B as the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct sequence of reactions for synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the analysis focuses on the order of introducing the substituents (tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro) and their directing effects. The target molecule has three substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), which are adjacent to each other. The directing effects of the substituents are critical:

1. **tert-butyl**: Activating, ortho/para director.  
2. **ethoxy**: Activating, ortho/para director.  
3. **nitro**: Deactivating, meta director.  

The synthesis must ensure that each substituent is added in a sequence that allows the next substituent to be directed to the correct position. The nitro group, being deactivating, should ideally be added last to avoid complicating subsequent substitutions.

### Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
- Steps include tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃, nitration, sulfonation, and others.  
- The sequence introduces the nitro group early, which could complicate subsequent substitutions due to its deactivating nature.  
- This option does not align well with the target structure.

#### **Option B**:
- Steps:  
  1. tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → Adds tert-butyl.  
  2. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates, adding nitro ortho/para to tert-butyl.  
  3. Fe/HCl → Reduces nitro to amine.  
  4. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates again.  
  5. NaNO₂/HCl → Diazotizes.  
  6. H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → Hydrolyzes.  
  7. NaOH/EtBr → Introduces ethoxy.  

- This sequence introduces the nitro group early and involves multiple nitrations, which may not lead to the correct positions for the substituents. However, it ultimately introduces the ethoxy group last, which could align with the target structure.

#### **Option C**:
- Steps:  
  1. tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → Adds tert-butyl.  
  2. SO₃/H₂SO₄ → Sulfonates.  
  3. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates.  
  4. Fe/HCl → Reduces nitro to amine.  
  5. NaNO₂/HCl → Diazotizes.  
  6. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates again.  
  7. H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → Hydrolyzes.  
  8. Dilute H₂SO₄ → ?  
  9. NaOH/EtBr → Introduces ethoxy.  

- This sequence involves multiple nitrations, sulfonations, and reductions, which do not clearly lead to the correct substituent positions.

#### **Option D**:
- Steps:  
  1. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates, adding nitro.  
  2. Fe/HCl → Reduces nitro to amine.  
  3. tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → Adds tert-butyl.  
  4. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates again.  
  5. NaNO₂/HCl → Diazotizes.  
  6. SO₃/H₂SO₄ → Sulfonates.  
  7. Dilute H₂SO₄ → ?  
  8. H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → ?  
  9. NaOH/EtBr → Introduces ethoxy.  

- This sequence introduces the nitro group first, which is deactivating and complicates subsequent substitutions. It does not align well with the target structure.

### Conclusion:
Option B provides the most plausible sequence for synthesizing the target molecule, as it introduces the ethoxy group last, which could be directed to the correct position by the existing tert-butyl and nitro groups. While the sequence involves multiple nitrations, it aligns better with the target structure compared to the other options.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of steps. I need to choose the right one. 

Hmm, the target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are 1, 2, and 3 on the ring, which means they are meta to each other. Wait, no, wait. Let me visualize the benzene ring. The numbering is such that the substituents are 1, 2, and 3. So, it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. But wait, that can't be possible because with three substituents in adjacent positions, the structure would be a bit crowded. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is different. Wait, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions relative to each other in a way that they are placed ortho, meta, etc. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the substituents' positions in terms of meta and para. 

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, nitro at position 3, and tert-butyl at position 2. So, their positions are adjacent. So, positions 1, 2, and 3 are all ortho to each other. So, the substituents are in adjacent positions, which would make the molecule a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. That's a bit challenging because each substituent's directing effects could influence the next substitution.

Each substituent can be either an activating or deactivating group and either meta or para directing. Let me list the substituents:

- tert-butyl: This is a bulky, strong activating group because it's an alkyl group. Alkyl groups are ortho/para directors. So when adding a new group, the substituent will go to ortho or para positions relative to the tert-butyl group.

- ethoxy: This is an activating group (since O is more electronegative, but the lone pairs activate the ring), so it's an activating, ortho/para director.

- nitro: This is a strong deactivating, meta director.

Wait, but the target molecule has all three substituents. So the question is about the order in which these groups are added to the benzene ring. Since each substitution is a step that must occur in a certain order, I need to figure out the right sequence to get the substituents in the correct positions.

But synthesizing such a molecule usually requires planning the order of introducing substituents because each step affects where the next substituent will attach. The key is to choose the order that allows each new substituent to be added in the correct position relative to the existing groups.

So, to get all three substituents in 1,2,3 positions, perhaps the order of addition matters. Let me think about the possible orders of adding the substituents. The substituents are ethoxy, nitro, and tert-butyl.

Wait, but ethoxy can be introduced via an etherification reaction, nitro via nitration, and tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts alkylation (since it's a tertiary alkyl group, but wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires that the alkylating agent be a good enough Lewis acid to form the acylium ion, but tert-butyl chloride can be used with AlCl3 as a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts. However, Friedel-Crafts typically works better with alkyl halides that can form stable carbocations, but wait, wait, wait—tert-butyl chloride is a tertiary alkyl chloride. Friedel-Crafts alkylation generally works better for alkyl groups that can form stable carbocations, like those with at least one adjacent carbon (like isopropyl), but tert-butyl is a very bulky group. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation with a tertiary chloride may not proceed because the carbocation might be too stable but the reaction is more favorable for less hindered groups. Wait, actually, Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically doesn't work with tert-butyl chloride because of carbocation rearrangements, but wait, no, since it's a tertiary chloride, the carbocation is already the most stable possible (tert-butyl carbocation). So perhaps Friedel-Crafts can be used, but sometimes bulky groups can be difficult because the carbocation is so bulky that it's hard to attack the ring. Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different method to introduce the tert-butyl group, like using a directing group. But perhaps the question assumes Friedel-Crafts is possible here.

Now, the substituent order: Let's think about the order of substitution. Let's figure out which substituent is introduced first, second, and third.

If I add the nitro group first, it's a meta director. Then, adding the tert-butyl group (ortho/para), but that might complicate the positions. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is added first because it's an activating group and can help in directing the next group.

Wait, perhaps I should plan the steps. The target has ethoxy (OCH2CH3) at position 1, nitro (NO2) at position 3, and tert-butyl (C(CH3)3) at position 2. So, the benzene ring is 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro.

Wait, that's not possible because if you have three substituents, each being a substituent in adjacent positions, you can't have all three in a row without some overlap. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 around the ring. For example, substituents in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), which are adjacent to each other in a way that each is in the correct relative position.

But perhaps I should approach this by considering the order of substituent addition.

Let me think about the directing effects. The first substituent added will determine the positions where the next substituent can go.

Option 1: Add ethoxy first. Ethoxy is activating, ortho/para director. Then, next substituent (nitro or tert-butyl) will be added in an ortho or para position relative to the ethoxy. Let's say we add nitro next. Nitro is deactivating, meta director relative to itself, but when added to a ring that already has an ethoxy group, it will be directed by the ethoxy group. Wait, but when adding a nitro group, the existing substituents (like ethoxy) will direct the incoming nitro group.

Wait, no, wait. When a nitro group is added, it's a meta director. But when adding a nitro group to benzene that already has ethoxy, the nitration would occur at a position directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, benzene with ethoxy group: the ethoxy is at position 1. So, during nitration, the incoming nitro group would go to ortho or para positions relative to the ethoxy. But nitro is a meta director relative to itself. No, wait, no—when you add a substituent to benzene, the existing substituent(s) direct the incoming group. So, if we have ethoxy at position 1, the nitro group would be added either ortho (position 2) or para (position 4). But in our target, the nitro group is at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy and tert-butyl. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right order.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added third. Let me think about adding the tert-butyl group first.

If I first add tert-butyl, which is an activating group, ortho/para director. Then, add ethoxy, which would go ortho or para to the tert-butyl group. Then, add nitro, which would be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, let me go through an example. Suppose the first substituent is tert-butyl. Then, when adding ethoxy, it would go to an ortho or para position relative to the tert-butyl. Let's say it goes to the para position. Then, when adding nitro, it would be directed by both substituents. Wait, but nitro is meta director, but in the presence of other substituents, the strongest directors take over.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added before the ethoxy. Let's think: if I nitrate benzene first, the nitro group is meta to itself, but since it's the first substituent, it will direct the next substituents to the meta position relative to nitro. Then, adding ethoxy would go to the ortho or para relative to nitro, but since nitro is deactivating, the ethoxy would be an activating group, which might be harder to substitute.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me approach this by considering the steps each option presents and see which leads to the correct substituent positions.

Looking at the options, each is a series of reactions. Let's take option D as an example.

Option D: The steps are:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → this is a reducing condition, perhaps for reducing nitro groups, but I'm not sure. Wait, Fe/HCl could be for some kind of substitution, but more likely, it's a catalyst for some reaction. Alternatively, in the context of nitration, Fe is often used as a catalyst. Wait, no, for nitration, H2SO4 is the catalyst. Fe is used in other reactions, like the Clemmensen reduction, but that's for ketones to alkanes. Alternatively, FeCl3 is used as a catalyst in some reactions, like nucleophilic substitution. Hmm, perhaps this step is a nitration again, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each step in each option and see which sequence correctly builds the substituents in the right order.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is to first nitrate, then introduce ethoxy, then tert-butyl, but that might not work because nitro is a meta director, which could complicate the positions.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group last because nitration requires a strong catalyst and could be more challenging when other substituents are present. Alternatively, the nitro group might come early because it's a deactivating group, making further substitution harder.

Wait, another approach: Let me outline the target structure again. The molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). Wait, that's a bit confusing because in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent to each other, which would make them all ortho to each other. But that's not possible because a benzene ring can't have three substituents in adjacent positions without overlapping. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the positions. Let me draw the benzene ring. Let's say substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, meaning each is adjacent to the others. But that would require all three to be adjacent, which is possible, but the directing effects would be tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that substituents are in positions 1, 3, and 4, for example, but I'm not certain. Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituents as being in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), which are all adjacent. But perhaps that's not feasible because each substituent would direct new groups in a conflicting way.

Wait, maybe it's better to focus on the synthesis steps. Let me think about each substituent's effect. Each substituent is either activating or deactivating and directs incoming groups to certain positions.

The target molecule has ethoxy (activating, ortho/para), nitro (deactivating, meta), and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). So, when adding substituents, the order in which they're added will determine where the next group goes.

Option B: The steps are:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation) → adds tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → possibly a reduction or another alkylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis, maybe to form a sulfonic acid or something.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy group via SN2 (like Williamson ether synthesis, but perhaps using ethyl bromide and a base to displace a leaving group).

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis or another step.

Wait, but this seems a bit convoluted. Let me think about each step. Starting with benzene, step i adds tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts. So now we have tert-butylbenzene. Next, nitration: so the nitro group would be added either ortho or para to the tert-butyl group because tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para director. Let's say it goes para, so now we have 4-nitro-1-tert-butylbenzene. Hmm, but the target has nitro at position 3 relative to ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Wait, perhaps I should track each step. Let me outline the steps for option A:

Option A: 

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl to benzene. Product: tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate the benzene. Now, the tert-butyl group is an activating, ortho/para director. So the nitro group will add ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say para. Now, structure is 4-nitro-1-tert-butylbenzene.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation; adding a sulfonic acid group. Wait, but the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. So perhaps this is a mistake, or maybe it's part of the synthesis steps to aid in directing. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts sulfonation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should skip option A for now and look at another option.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → FeCl3 is a catalyst, but perhaps this step is for another nitration? Or is it a reduction? Let me think. Fe/HCl is often used in the Bechamp reaction, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it might be a step to form a diazonium salt. For example, in the presence of HCl and Fe, nitrobenzene might be reduced to aniline. Wait, but nitrobenzene can be reduced using Fe and HCl to produce phenylamine. So, step ii would be reduction of nitrobenzene to benzene with an amino group. But that would change the structure.

Wait, the target has a nitro group, so perhaps that's not the intended path. Alternatively, perhaps this step is a nitration again, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The target has all three substituents, so the steps should add these substituents in the correct order.

Option D's steps are:

i) Nitration → adds nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps converts nitro to amine (but that would remove the nitro group, which isn't desired). Alternatively, perhaps this is a nitration again, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me think about the synthesis steps required to get the substituents in the correct positions.

The target molecule's substituents are ethoxy (OCH2CH3) at position 1, nitro at position 3, and tert-butyl at position 2. Wait, perhaps I should number the ring such that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, each is adjacent to the next. But that would require all three substituents to be in a row, which could be challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is to first add ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Let me see:

1. Benzene → ethoxybenzene (using ethyl chloride and a base, perhaps via SNAr, but more likely via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but ethyl chloride is a primary alkyl halide, which might not undergo Friedel-Crafts easily. Alternatively, perhaps using a better alkylating agent like ethyl chloride with a Lewis acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that introducing ethoxy may require an etherification reaction. So, benzene can undergo alkylation to form ethoxybenzene. Alternatively, perhaps using a different method, like the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction, but that's for phenol derivatives.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to introduce the tert-butyl group, then the ethoxy, then the nitro.

So, benzene → tert-butylbenzene via Friedel-Crafts (step i in option D is nitration, but let me see).

But looking at the options, perhaps the correct sequence is to add the ethoxy group first, then tert-butyl, then nitro. But I'm not sure how that would fit with the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first nitrate, then add ethoxy, then add tert-butyl. But again, I'm not certain. Let me try to think through each option's steps.

Looking at option B:

Option B's steps are:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis (maybe to form a phenol or something).

vii) NaOH/EtBr → introduce ethoxy group via SN2.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis.

Wait, but the target molecule has nitro, tert-butyl, and ethoxy groups. So, after step ii, we have tert-butyl and nitro groups. Let's say nitro is at para position relative to tert-butyl because tert-butyl is an ortho/para director. Then, Fe/HCl (step iii) could be a reduction, converting nitro to amine. So, structure becomes tert-butylbenzene with an amine group at para position. Then, step iv nitrates again. But amine is a strong activating group, so nitration would occur at ortho or para relative to amine. But I'm not sure if this is leading us toward the target. Then, step v is diazotization, which would convert the amine to a diazonium salt. Step vi is hydrolysis under acidic conditions, which would form a phenol. Then, step vii: NaOH and EtBr would perform an SN2 reaction to introduce ethoxy group. So now we'd have a phenol with ethoxy. But I'm not sure how this leads to the target.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe another approach is needed. Let's think about the substituents' activating or deactivating nature and their directing effects.

The target has a nitro group (deactivating, meta director), ethoxy (activating, ortho/para), and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). So, the nitro group would be the most deactivating, making the ring less reactive toward further substitution.

Therefore, the nitro group should be introduced last because once it's present, the ring becomes less reactive, and adding other groups may be more difficult. Alternatively, if the nitro group is introduced early, the subsequent substitutions may be directed by it, which could complicate the positions.

Wait, but the tert-butyl and ethoxy groups are activating, so perhaps they are introduced first. Let me consider the order: tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Because after adding tert-butyl, the ring is still activated, making it easier to add ethoxy. Then, nitro is added last, perhaps in a position directed by both tert-butyl and ethoxy.

Wait, but the nitro group is meta to itself, so when adding it last, it's influenced by the existing substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added second, then ethoxy third.

This is tricky. Let me try to think about each option's steps again.

Looking back at the target, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me imagine the benzene ring with ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, each substituent is adjacent. Let's consider how each substituent is added.

If I add tert-butyl first, ring is activated, then add ethoxy. The ethoxy would go ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say para. So, structure is tert-butyl at position 1, ethoxy at position 4. Then, adding nitro next. Nitro would be directed by both substituents. But since nitro is meta to itself, perhaps it goes meta to the ethoxy, which would be position 6. That's not the target. Alternatively, perhaps it goes meta to the tert-butyl, which would be position 4 (but ethoxy is already there), so this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added between the tert-butyl and ethoxy. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first. So, benzene is nitrated to nitrobenzene. Then, tert-butyl is added via Friedel-Crafts, which would go ortho or para to the nitro group. Nitro is meta director, so the next substituent (tert-butyl) would go meta to nitro. Wait, but nitro is a meta director, so the substituent would be in the meta position relative to nitro. So, if nitro is at position 1, the next substituent would go to position 3, which is meta. Then, adding ethoxy would go to positions directed by both nitro and tert-butyl.

Wait, perhaps that's a way. Let me outline:

Step 1: Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene (nitro at position 1).

Step 2: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → adds tert-butyl. Since nitro is a meta director, tert-butyl would add at position 4 (meta to nitro at 1). Wait, but in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 4 are para, so that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me visualize the benzene ring with nitro at position 1. The meta positions are 3 and 5. So, tert-butyl would be added at position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3. Now, the ring has nitro at 1 and tert-butyl at 3.

Step 3: Now, add ethoxy. The existing substituents are nitro (at 1) and tert-butyl (at 3). Nitro is deactivating and meta director, tert-butyl is activating and ortho/para director. The ethoxy group will be directed primarily by the more activating group, tert-butyl. So, ethoxy would add ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say ortho, which would be position 4. But in that case, the substituents would be at positions 1 (nitro), 3 (tert-butyl), and 4 (ethoxy). That's not the target structure. The target requires substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let's think about another order.

What if the order is to first add ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro?

Step 1: Add ethoxy to benzene → ethoxybenzene. The ethoxy is at position 1.

Step 2: Add tert-butyl. It would be directed by the ethoxy group, so ortho or para. Let's say para → position 4.

Now, the ring has ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 4.

Step 3: Add nitro. Now, the substituents are ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). The nitro group is deactivating and meta director. So, where would it go? It would be directed by the existing substituents. Let me see:

The ethoxy is at 1. Its ortho positions are 2 and 6; para is 4 (which is already occupied by tert-butyl). So, possible positions for nitro would be 3 or 5, considering the ethoxy's meta positions. Alternatively, considering the tert-butyl at 4, its ortho positions are 3 and 5; para is 1 (ethoxy). So, nitro can go to 3 or 5. Let's say nitro goes to position 3. Now, the substituents are ethoxy (1), tert-butyl (4), nitro (3). But the target has nitro at 3, tert-butyl at 2, and ethoxy at 1. So, the positions don't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group goes to position 2. But ethoxy at 1 would direct the nitro to positions 3 and 5 (its meta positions). So, perhaps this approach isn't leading us to the target.

Wait, perhaps the order is to add tert-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy.

Step 1: Add tert-butyl → tert-butylbenzene.

Step 2: Nitrate → nitro group adds ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say para → position 4.

Now, substituents are tert-butyl (1), nitro (4).

Step 3: Add ethoxy. The ethoxy is directed by both substituents. The tert-butyl is activating, ortho/para director, and nitro is deactivating, meta director. So, the most activating group (tert-butyl) would have a stronger influence. The ethoxy would go ortho or para to tert-butyl. So, ortho would be position 2 or position 6. Let's say position 2.

Now, substituents are tert-butyl (1), nitro (4), ethoxy (2). But the target needs nitro at 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. So, perhaps this doesn't align.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is ethoxy first, then nitro, then tert-butyl.

Step 1: Ethoxy added → ethoxybenzene (position 1).

Step 2: Nitrate. Nitro would be directed by ethoxy to ortho or para positions. Let's say para → position 4.

Now, substituents are ethoxy (1), nitro (4).

Step 3: Add tert-butyl. Now, the ring has ethoxy (1) and nitro (4). Ethoxy is activating, directs ortho/para. Nitro is deactivating, meta. So, tert-butyl would be directed to ortho or para of ethoxy. Let's say ortho → position 2. Now, substituents are ethoxy (1), nitro (4), tert-butyl (2). But the target needs nitro at 3, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2. So, that's close but not exactly the target. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the target has nitro at position 3 relative to ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2. So, the substituents are in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, how to get nitro to position 3?

If ethoxy is at 1 and tert-butyl at 2, then nitro would be added adjacent to both, which would be position 3. But when adding nitro, the directing effects of ethoxy and tert-butyl would influence where it goes.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Let me outline:

Step 1: Ethoxy added to benzene → ethoxybenzene (position 1).

Step 2: Add tert-butyl. It goes ortho or para to ethoxy. Let's say ortho → position 2.

Now, substituents are ethoxy (1), tert-butyl (2).

Step 3: Add nitro. Now, the existing substituents are ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). The nitro group is deactivating and meta director. So, where would it go? It would be directed by the existing activating groups. Since ethoxy is at 1 and tert-butyl at 2, the possible positions for nitro would be where it's meta to one of them and ortho/para to the other. Let's see:

Looking from ethoxy at 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5. From tert-butyl at 2, the meta positions are 5 and 6. So, the only overlapping position is 5. But if nitro is added at position 5, that's not the target. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added para to the ethoxy, which would be position 4. But that's not the target either. So perhaps this order isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl, but in a position that's meta to one substituent and ortho to the other. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about which options correctly place the substituents in the correct order. Let me go back to the options and see which one's steps would lead to the target.

Looking at option B again:

Steps:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolyze.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → introduce ethoxy.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → ?

Wait, perhaps this is a long way, but let me think.

After step i, tert-butyl is added.

Step ii: nitrate → nitro group added ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say para → position 4.

Now, substituents are tert-butyl (1), nitro (4).

Step iii: Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine. So now, substituents are tert-butyl (1), amine (4).

Step iv: nitrate again → but the ring now has an amine (activating) which directs incoming nitro to ortho or para positions relative to amine. So nitro would be added at position 1 (already has tert-butyl) or position 7 (which is same as position 1 in a benzene ring). Wait, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the ring has amine at 4, and the nitro would go to position 2 or 6 (ortho to amine). Let's say position 2.

Now, substituents are tert-butyl (1), nitro (4), and another nitro (2). But the target only has one nitro group, so this seems off.

This path doesn't seem to fit. Let me check another option.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

ix) NaOH/EtBr → introduce ethoxy.

Hmm. Let's think:

Step i: tert-butyl added → tert-butylbenzene.

Step ii: sulfonate → adds SO3 group, which is a strong meta director and deactivating.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so perhaps this is not the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps each option's steps should be evaluated based on the substituent positions.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts to add tert-butyl.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → ?

ix) NaOH/EtBr → introduce ethoxy.

Wait, let me outline the steps:

Start with benzene.

Step i: Nitrate → nitrobenzene.

Step ii: Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → aniline.

Step iii: Friedel-Crafts with tert-butyl → add tert-butyl to aniline. But aniline is a strong activating group, so the tert-butyl would add in ortho or para positions. Let's say para to the amine (now at position 1), so tert-butyl at position 4.

Step iv: Nitrate again → the ring has amine (1) and tert-butyl (4). Nitration would be directed by the amine, which is ortho/para. So nitro would be added at position 2 or 6. Let's say position 2.

Now, substituents are amine (1), tert-butyl (4), nitro (2).

Step v: Diazotization → convert amine to diazonium salt.

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate → perhaps introduces a sulfonic acid group. But the target doesn't have this. Hmm, perhaps this is a wrong path.

Alternatively, perhaps this option doesn't lead to the correct substituents. 

This is getting too time-consuming. Let me think of another approach: each substituent must be added in a way that their directing effects lead to the correct position for the next substituent.

The target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3.

So, when adding nitro last, the positions of ethoxy and tert-butyl should direct the nitro group to position 3.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director, so when adding it as the last substituent, it would be directed meta to itself, but how does that help?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added before ethoxy and tert-butyl. But then, ethoxy and tert-butyl would have to be added in the correct positions relative to the nitro.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, making further substitution harder. So perhaps it's better to add nitro last.

Let me try to outline the correct order:

1. Add ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

2. Add tert-butyl → directed by ethoxy to ortho or para. Let's say para, so now substituents are ethoxy (1), tert-butyl (4).

3. Add nitro → must go to position 3 or position 5 (meta to ethoxy). But considering the tert-butyl at 4, perhaps nitro is directed to position 3, which is ortho to tert-butyl and meta to ethoxy.

Wait, that might work. So, the steps would be:

- Ethoxy added first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find the sequence that includes these steps.

Looking at option B:

Option B's steps are:

i) tert-butyl → add tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate → add nitro (directed by tert-butyl, perhaps para → position 4).

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → add another nitro.

But this seems to add more nitro groups, which isn't desired.

Looking at option C:

Option C's steps:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate (adds SO3 group, which is a strong meta director).

iii) nitrate → add nitro.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro.

v) NaNO2 → diazotize.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy.

This seems to involve multiple nitration steps and doesn't clearly add ethoxy in the right place.

Option D:

i) Nitrate first → nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

iv) nitrate again.

v) diazotize.

vi) sulfonate.

vii) H2SO4.

viii) H3O+.

ix) ethoxy via NaOH and EtBr.

This seems to involve adding ethoxy last, which may not fit the target structure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D, but let me try to see.

In option D:

After step iii, we have tert-butyl added to the ring which has an amine (from step ii). The amine would direct the tert-butyl to ortho or para. Then, in step iv, nitrate again; but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Looking for which option's steps reflect this.

Looking at the options, perhaps option B or option D don't include ethoxy introduction via SN2 with NaOH and EtBr until a later step.

Wait, step vii in option B is NaOH/EtBr, which would introduce an ethoxy group via SN2, perhaps substituting a leaving group like a halide.

But in which step would that happen?

Let me think: perhaps after adding the nitro group and tert-butyl, the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts → tert-butylbenzene.

2. Nitrate → nitro added para to tert-butyl.

3. Diazotize nitro → but wait, nitro isn't easily converted to diazonium salts. Alternatively, perhaps it's the amine that is diazotized.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a diazonium salt to introduce a substituent. For example, introducing an ethoxy group via a diazonium salt might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring with a strong electron-withdrawing group. But that would require the ring to be strongly activated, which may not be feasible.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think differently. The target has nitro at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. So, when adding the nitro group last, the existing substituents (ethoxy and tert-butyl) must direct the nitro to position 3.

To achieve that, the existing substituents when adding nitro must be in positions that direct to 3.

If ethoxy is at 1 and tert-butyl at 2, then adding nitro would be directed by both. The ethoxy would direct meta (positions 3 and 5), and the tert-butyl would direct ortho or para (positions 1, 3). So, position 3 is a common position, which is meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl.

So, the sequence would be:

1. Add ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

2. Add tert-butyl → ortho to ethoxy (position 2).

3. Add nitro → position 3.

Now, which option has this sequence?

Looking at the options, perhaps option B or D.

Looking at option B:

The steps are:

i) tert-butyl → add tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro para to tert-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → another nitro group.

v) diazotize.

vi) hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → add ethoxy.

Hmm. So after step vii, ethoxy is added. But this would be after nitro groups have been added, which might not be the desired order.

Alternatively, perhaps option B's steps are as follows:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Nitrate → nitro at para (position 4).

3. Reduce nitro to amine.

4. Nitrate again → another nitro group at position 2 (ortho to amine at 4? Not sure).

Wait, this doesn't seem to lead to the target structure.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitrate → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts → adds at position 4 (para to amine).

iv) nitrate → nitro added at position 2 (ortho to amine).

v) diazotize → amine to diazonium.

vi) sulfonate → add SO3 group.

vii) H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+/H2O → ?

ix) NaOH/EtBr → add ethoxy.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so perhaps this is incorrect.

After considering all options, perhaps option D is the correct one because it includes adding the ethoxy group last, which could be directed correctly by the existing substituents.

Wait, but let me think: in option D, after step ix (NaOH/EtBr), the ethoxy group is added. So, the previous steps would have introduced nitro and tert-butyl groups. Let's track:

After step iii: tert-butyl added to the ring that has an amine group (from step ii). So, amine is at position 1, tert-butyl at position 4 (para).

Step iv: nitrate again → since the ring has an amine (activating), nitro would be added ortho or para to amine. Let's say para to amine is already taken by tert-butyl, so nitro goes ortho → position 2.

Now, substituents are amine (1), tert-butyl (4), nitro (2).

Step v: diazotize → convert amine to diazonium, which is then hydrolyzed in step vi (H3O+/H2O/Heat) to form a phenol group.

Wait, but step vi is H3O+ and heat, which would hydrolyze the diazonium salt to a phenol. So now, substituents are phenol (1), tert-butyl (4), nitro (2).

Step vii: dilute H2SO4 → perhaps sulfonation, but I'm not sure. Or maybe another step.

Step viii: H3O+/H2O/Heat → perhaps another hydrolysis, but I'm not certain.

Step ix: NaOH and EtBr → this would perform an SN2 reaction, but with what leaving group? The phenol would have to have a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the phenol is converted into something else first.

Wait, perhaps this isn't the right path. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, let me think about the correct order again. The target has substituents at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, when adding nitro last, the existing substituents would direct it to position 3.

Which options introduce nitro as the last substituent?

Looking at the options, option B introduces nitro in step iv, which is after ethoxy in step vii. So, nitro is introduced before ethoxy. That might not be correct.

Wait, no. Option B's steps are:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iv) nitrate → another nitro.

v) diazotize.

vi) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy.

So, ethoxy is added last. So, when adding nitro in step ii, the ring has only tert-butyl. So, nitro would be para to tert-butyl. Then, in step iii, nitro is reduced to amine. Then, step iv nitrates again, adding a new nitro group. Then, steps v-vi involve diazotization and hydrolysis, leading to a phenol. Finally, step vii adds ethoxy.

But the target has only one nitro group, so this seems to add two nitro groups, which is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that option C is the correct one.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) diazotize.

vi) nitrate.

vii) H3O+/H2O.

viii) H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy.

But this involves multiple nitrations and sulfonations, which don't seem to fit the target.

After considering all options, perhaps option B is the correct one. Because:

In option B, after adding tert-butyl and nitro, the steps involve reducing nitro to amine, nitrating again, then introducing ethoxy. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Which option does this?

Looking at option B again, the steps are:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iv) nitrate.

v) diazotize.

vi) hydrolysis.

vii) ethoxy.

So, ethoxy is added last, which may not be the correct order.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, perhaps option D's steps are:

i) nitrate → nitro at position 1.

ii) reduce → amine.

iii) add tert-butyl → para to amine (position 4).

iv) nitrate → nitro at position 2 (ortho to amine).

v) diazotize → amine to diazonium.

vi) sulfonate → add SO3 at position 5 (meta to nitro at 2).

vii) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+ → ?

ix) ethoxy via NaOH and EtBr.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so this may not be correct.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps it's best to make an educated guess. Based on the target structure, the correct sequence likely involves adding tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Looking at the options, option B seems to involve adding nitro before ethoxy, which might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, another thought: when adding ethoxy, you need a good leaving group. Perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution reaction, like in step vii of option B, which uses NaOH and EtBr. So, if the ring has a good leaving group like a nitro group, perhaps it's possible. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct. Let me quickly look at option C's steps:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) diazotize.

vi) nitrate.

vii) H3O+/H2O.

viii) H2SO4.

ix) ethoxy.

Hmm. Not sure.

After all this, I think the correct option is option B. But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituents' directing effects again. The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, when you add it last, the existing substituents should be activating and ortho/para directors to direct the nitro to the correct position.

So, the correct order would be to add ethoxy and tert-butyl first, then nitro. Which option has this order?

Looking at the options, option B adds nitro after tert-butyl, then reduces, then nitrates again. So, maybe that's not correct.

Alternatively, option D adds nitro first, then tert-butyl, then nitro again. Which doesn't seem right.

Another approach: the target requires a nitro group, an ethoxy, and a tert-butyl group. The order must be such that the nitro group is added last, as it's deactivating.

So, the first two steps would add the other two groups in a way that directs the nitro to the correct position.

Which option adds the nitro last?

Looking at the options:

Option A: steps i) tert-butyl, ii) nitrate, iii) sulfonate, iv) nitrate again, etc. So, nitro is added second and fourth. Not last.

Option B: nitro second, fourth. Not last.

Option C: nitro third, sixth. Not last.

Option D: nitro first, fourth. Not last.

Hmm, none of the options have nitro as the last step. So perhaps the correct order is different.

Wait, perhaps the nitro is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl.

This would require the nitro to be added last. Let me think which option does this.

Looking again:

Option B: steps i) tert-butyl, ii) nitrate → nitro added. So nitro is added second, not last.

Option D: steps i) nitrate → nitro first, then steps involving other reactions, and nitro added again in step iv. So nitro is added multiple times.

Wait, perhaps none of the options are perfect, but the correct sequence is to add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Let me see which option reflects this.

Looking for an option where the steps are:

1. Tert-butyl.

2. Ethoxy.

3. Nitro.

Looking at the options:

Option B: steps i) tert-butyl, ii) nitrate → nitro, then steps involving reduction, nitrate again, etc. So nitro is added second and fourth.

Option C: steps i) tert-butyl, ii) sulfonate, iii) nitrate → nitro added third. Then steps iv) reduce, v) diazo, vi) nitrate again, etc.

Hmm. Perhaps option B is the correct one because after adding tert-butyl and nitro, other steps introduce the ethoxy group in the correct position.

Wait, perhaps in option B, after adding tert-butyl and nitro, the steps reduce the nitro to amine, then nitrate again, which could add another nitro group in a different position. But I'm not sure.

After all this, I think I'll go with option B as the correct answer.


To determine the correct sequence of reactions for synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the analysis focuses on the order of introducing the substituents (tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro) and their directing effects. The target molecule has three substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), which are adjacent to each other. The directing effects of the substituents are critical:

1. **tert-butyl**: Activating, ortho/para director.  
2. **ethoxy**: Activating, ortho/para director.  
3. **nitro**: Deactivating, meta director.  

The synthesis must ensure that each substituent is added in a sequence that allows the next substituent to be directed to the correct position. The nitro group, being deactivating, should ideally be added last to avoid complicating subsequent substitutions.

### Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
- Steps include tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃, nitration, sulfonation, and others.  
- The sequence introduces the nitro group early, which could complicate subsequent substitutions due to its deactivating nature.  
- This option does not align well with the target structure.

#### **Option B**:
- Steps:  
  1. tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → Adds tert-butyl.  
  2. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates, adding nitro ortho/para to tert-butyl.  
  3. Fe/HCl → Reduces nitro to amine.  
  4. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates again.  
  5. NaNO₂/HCl → Diazotizes.  
  6. H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → Hydrolyzes.  
  7. NaOH/EtBr → Introduces ethoxy.  

- This sequence introduces the nitro group early and involves multiple nitrations, which may not lead to the correct positions for the substituents. However, it ultimately introduces the ethoxy group last, which could align with the target structure.

#### **Option C**:
- Steps:  
  1. tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → Adds tert-butyl.  
  2. SO₃/H₂SO₄ → Sulfonates.  
  3. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates.  
  4. Fe/HCl → Reduces nitro to amine.  
  5. NaNO₂/HCl → Diazotizes.  
  6. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates again.  
  7. H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → Hydrolyzes.  
  8. Dilute H₂SO₄ → ?  
  9. NaOH/EtBr → Introduces ethoxy.  

- This sequence involves multiple nitrations, sulfonations, and reductions, which do not clearly lead to the correct substituent positions.

#### **Option D**:
- Steps:  
  1. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates, adding nitro.  
  2. Fe/HCl → Reduces nitro to amine.  
  3. tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → Adds tert-butyl.  
  4. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates again.  
  5. NaNO₂/HCl → Diazotizes.  
  6. SO₃/H₂SO₄ → Sulfonates.  
  7. Dilute H₂SO₄ → ?  
  8. H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → ?  
  9. NaOH/EtBr → Introduces ethoxy.  

- This sequence introduces the nitro group first, which is deactivating and complicates subsequent substitutions. It does not align well with the target structure.

### Conclusion:
Option B provides the most plausible sequence for synthesizing the target molecule, as it introduces the ethoxy group last, which could be directed to the correct position by the existing tert-butyl and nitro groups. While the sequence involves multiple nitrations, it aligns better with the target structure compared to the other options.
