Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember cyclotrons are particle accelerators that use magnetic fields and electric fields to accelerate charged particles. Synchrocyclotrons must be a type of cyclotron, maybe with some modifications.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

Wait, the question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. So I need to find the number of times the proton goes around the accelerator before it reaches that kinetic energy.

I'm a bit rusty on synchrocyclotrons. I remember that in cyclotrons, the magnetic field is kept constant, so the radius increases as the velocity increases. But synchrocyclotrons might have a different approach. Oh wait, maybe in synchrocyclotrons, the magnetic field is varied with time to keep the particles in phase with the accelerating electric field. That way, they can reach higher energies without hitting relativistic limits as much as regular cyclotrons.

So the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the electric field, right? Each time the voltage completes a cycle, the proton might gain a certain amount of energy. But since the magnetic field is changing, the cyclotron frequency might be adjusted.

Wait, but the problem says it's a synchrocyclotron, so the frequency ν(α) of the applied voltage probably changes as the particle's momentum changes. The proton starts with negligible KE, so its initial momentum is very low, and as it gains energy, its momentum increases, so the required frequency also changes.

The voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α) t + Φ0]. Since the voltage is alternating, the particles are accelerated each half-cycle or something like that. But I'm not exactly sure about the phase and how it affects the acceleration.

I think for each revolution, the particle gets a little bit of energy. The number of revolutions would be the total energy gained divided by the energy per revolution.

Wait, but the problem states the proton undergoes two accelerations. Hmm, maybe each acceleration happens each revolution? Or perhaps each half-revolution? I'm a bit confused there.

Alternatively, maybe each time the particle goes through the gap, it gets a kick of energy from the electric field. So each time it completes a half-period, it gains some energy. So if it goes around N times, it gets N kicks.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the gap in the magnetic field. The number of times they pass through depends on the time it takes to reach the desired energy.

But how does the energy per revolution relate to the applied voltage? The voltage is U0, so the energy gain per passage might be related to U0. But since the voltage is alternating, perhaps each passage gives a certain amount of energy.

Wait, the kinetic energy is being increased from 0 to 950 MeV. So the total energy to be gained is 950 MeV. How much energy is gained per revolution?

Wait, in a cyclotron, each time the particle goes through the gap, it gains an energy equal to the voltage applied, assuming it's synchronized. But in a synchrocyclotron, since the magnetic field is changing, the frequency changes. So maybe the energy per revolution isn't fixed but depends on time.

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can model it as each revolution providing a certain energy gain, maybe U0 per something.

Wait, the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos(...). The peak voltage is U0, which is 190 kV. So each passage through the gap might give the proton an energy gain equal to U0? Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, the kinetic energy gained by a charge when accelerated through a potential U is qU. Since the proton has charge e, the energy gain per acceleration would be e U0, but wait, the voltage is varying with time, so the maximum energy gain per passage would be e U0.

So for each half-cycle, the proton would gain e U0. Because the voltage reaches a maximum of U0 once per cycle, so each time the particle goes through, it's accelerated once. Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think again.

In a synchrocyclotron, the electric field alternates, so the particle is accelerated each time it passes through the gap. Each time the electric field is in the right direction, it gains energy. So the number of times it passes through the gap is twice the number of revolutions, maybe? Because each revolution brings it back to the gap twice (once on the way in, once on the way out).

Wait, in a cyclotron, each time the particle completes a half-circle, it passes through the gap once. So each full revolution would pass through the gap once. Or does it pass through twice per revolution? Because the gap is a small part of the ring. Hmm, perhaps it's better to model the acceleration per revolution.

Alternatively, perhaps each time the electric field reverses, the particle gets a kick. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a formula or an approach.

Another approach: the time taken for the proton to reach the desired energy can be found, and then the number of revolutions is the total time divided by the period of the cyclotron.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is varied so that the cyclotron frequency matches the frequency of the applied voltage. So as the proton gains energy, its momentum increases, and the magnetic field changes to keep it in the same orbit. Wait, no, actually, in synchrocyclotrons, the magnetic field increases with time to allow the particle to stay in the same orbit. Because if the magnetic field stays the same, the radius would have to increase as the momentum increases, but in synchrocyclotrons, the radius is kept fixed by varying the magnetic field. So the magnetic field increases as the proton gains energy. That way, the cyclotron frequency ν = q B/(2π m) also changes, but it's kept in phase with the applied voltage.

So the key thing to remember is that in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field B(t) is varied such that the cyclotron frequency matches the frequency of the applied voltage. So the time for each revolution depends on the current B(t), but since the frequency ν(α) is adjusted, the proton is always in phase with the accelerating field.

Now, the energy gain per revolution in a synchrocyclotron is given by E = e U0, where e is the charge of the proton, and U0 is the peak voltage. Because each time the particle passes through the gap, it is accelerated by the electric field and gains energy equal to e times the peak voltage.

Wait, but wait a minute. The voltage is varying as cos(...), so the maximum energy gain per passage is e U0. So maybe each time the particle passes through the gap, it gains e U0. How often does this happen? Once per revolution, right? Because each revolution brings the particle back to the gap once.

Wait, no. In a cyclotron, each passage through the gap (each time it goes through the gap, which is like a spoke in the wheel) happens once per revolution. So each time the particle does a half-circle, it passes through the gap once. Hence, each revolution (full circle) would have two gaps? Or perhaps each full revolution only passes through one gap... I'm getting a bit confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps each half-revolution brings the particle through the gap once. So in each full revolution, the particle passes through the gap twice. Therefore, each revolution would result in two energy gains of e U0 each. But wait, that can't be right because that would mean the energy is doubling each revolution, which would make the energy grow exponentially, which isn't the case.

Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense. Probably, the energy gained per revolution is e U0. So the energy after N revolutions is N e U0.

But wait, the initial energy is zero, and the target is 950 MeV. So 950 MeV = N * e * U0.

Wait, let's compute that.

e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602e-19 coulombs. But let me think in terms of energy units. 1 eV is the energy gained by an electron when accelerated through 1 volt. So a proton gaining e U0 volts would be e * U0 * e charge? Wait, no. The energy gained is e * U, where U is the voltage. Because the proton's charge is e, so E = e U.

Wait, no. The energy is e multiplied by the voltage. So for example, 1 V would give a proton 1 eV of energy. So if the voltage is U0 = 190 kV, then each time the proton goes through the gap, it gains 190 keV of energy.

But wait, the voltage is time-dependent. So the maximum energy gain per passage is e U0. So each time the particle passes through the gap in the right direction, it gains e U0. So if the applied voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[...], the peak is U0, so maximum energy gain is e U0.

So the total number of revolutions N would be the total energy gained divided by the energy per revolution.

So N = (950 MeV) / (190 keV per revolution).

Because 950 MeV = 950,000 keV. 950,000 / 190 = approximately 5000. But wait, let me compute that.

950,000 divided by 190. Let's see: 190 * 5000 = 950,000. Exactly. So N would be 5000.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 5300, and option C is 3536. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of required revolutions is N = (T1) / (e U0). But wait, the initial kinetic energy is zero, and the final is 950 MeV.

Wait, let me think again. Each time the particle passes through the gap, it gains e U0. So the number of times it passes through the gap is N_passages. But each revolution brings it to the gap twice (like entering and exiting), so the number of revolutions N is equal to N_passages divided by 2.

Wait, no. In a cyclotron, the particles go around in a circle, and each time they reach the gap, they feel the electric field. So each passage through the gap is once per revolution, I think. Because the gap is a small section in the magnetic field. So each time the particle completes a revolution, it comes back to the gap and gets another acceleration.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the energy gained per revolution is e U0. So the number of revolutions is the total energy divided by e U0.

So N = (950 MeV) / (190 keV).

Wait, 950 MeV is 950,000 keV. 950,000 / 190 = let's compute. 190 * 5000 = 950,000. So N = 5000. But the options don't have 5000. The closest option is B) 5300, which is about 50% higher.

Hmm. So perhaps my assumption is wrong. Maybe the energy gained per revolution isn't exactly e U0. Because in reality, the particle is accelerated multiple times as it goes around, perhaps multiple times per revolution.

Wait, in a cyclotron, the electric field alternates, so each half-period the particle is accelerated. So in one full period, the particle is accelerated once because the electric field switches direction. Or wait, no. Let me think: the electric field is applied across the gap, so as the particle moves through the gap, it experiences the electric field. The field alternates direction, so each time the field is in the correct phase, the particle gains energy.

Wait, the cyclotron frequency is such that the particles complete a half-circle in the time it takes the electric field to switch polarity. So each time the particle passes through the gap, it's accelerated once per cycle. So each full cycle (one period) of the electric field corresponds to one acceleration event.

Wait, perhaps the number of acceleration events is equal to the number of times the electric field is applied in the correct phase as the proton circles around. So each time the electric field is in the correct phase, the proton is accelerated. So the number of acceleration events is equal to the number of times the electric field is in phase with the proton's position, which is once per revolution? Or perhaps twice?

Alternatively, perhaps each revolution corresponds to two acceleration events. Because the electric field is applied in both directions, so each time the proton passes through the gap, it can be accelerated either from the top or the bottom, perhaps. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the number of acceleration events is twice the number of revolutions. So if each revolution provides two acceleration events, then the energy per revolution would be 2 e U0. So the total number of revolutions would be the total energy divided by 2 e U0.

So N = (950 MeV) / (2 * 190 keV) = (950,000 keV) / (380 keV) ≈ 2500.

Looking at the options, option D is 2500. But wait, the initial assumption that each revolution gives two acceleration events would lead to N=2500, which is option D.

But earlier I thought N was 5000. So which one is correct?

Wait, another thought: the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Wait, the question says it undergoes two accelerations. Hmm, no, the question says the proton is injected and undergoes two accelerations. Wait, no, the question says it undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Oh wait, no, the problem statement says "undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV". Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Oh, the original question says, "a proton is injected... undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV." Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's a translation issue. Oh, perhaps it's a typo and supposed to say "accelerations" as in "accelerations (as in, the process involves acceleration) to reach...", but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the number of acceleration cycles is two? That doesn't make sense either.

Wait, perhaps the number of times the voltage changes is two, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the number of times the voltage is applied is two, but that doesn't fit with reaching 950 MeV.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the formula for the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron.

I remember that the number of revolutions N is given by N = (T1) / (e U0) * (c / (2π r)), but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is needed. The time it takes for the proton to reach the desired energy can be found, and then the number of revolutions is the time divided by the period of the cyclotron frequency.

But for that, I need to know how the cyclotron frequency and the magnetic field change over time.

Hmm, the cyclotron frequency is ν = (e B)/(2 π m). As the proton gains energy, its momentum increases, so B must be adjusted to keep ν in phase with the applied voltage. Since the applied voltage has a frequency ν(t) = ν(α), which probably depends on the current momentum α (a parameter related to the momentum).

The phase condition for a synchrocyclotron is that the change in phase of the voltage matches the change in phase of the particle's motion as it goes around. The phase of the voltage is 2 π ν(t) t, and the phase change of the particle after each revolution is also 2 π. So for each revolution, the phase of the voltage must advance by 2 π as well. Therefore, the time for each revolution is T = 1/(ν(t)).

But the energy gained per revolution is e U0, as each time the particle goes through the gap, the voltage is maximum, so the energy increases by e U0 each time.

Wait, but if each revolution provides e U0 energy, then the number of revolutions N is 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV = 950,000 / 190 = 5000. But the options don't include 5000. Closest is option B) 5300, but that's about 6% higher. So perhaps my assumption is missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy gained per revolution is not exactly e U0. Maybe the average voltage is considered instead of the peak. Or perhaps the voltage is applied in such a way that each acceleration event gives half of U0, so each revolution gives e * (U0 / 2). Then N would be 950e6 / 95e3 = 10,000. Not matching the options.

Wait, another approach: the total energy is T1 = 950 MeV. Each time the proton goes around, it gains a certain amount of energy. If the number of revolutions is N, then N * (e U0) = T1.

Wait, so N = T1 / (e U0). But T1 is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV. U0 is 190 keV.

So N = 950,000 / 190 ≈ 5000.

But the options don't have 5000. So perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe the number of acceleration events is twice the number of revolutions. So if each revolution provides two acceleration events, each giving e U0, then the number of revolutions would be N = 950e6 / (2 * 190e3) ) ≈ 2500. Which is option D. But the problem states the proton undergoes two accelerations, which might mean two events, but that's not clear.

Wait, perhaps the number of acceleration events is equal to the number of revolutions. So if each revolution provides one acceleration, then N = 5000. But the given options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the number of revolutions is (T1) / (e U0) times some factor. Wait, maybe the actual energy per revolution is not e U0, but some fraction of that.

Wait, perhaps the voltage is applied in such a way that the particle is accelerated once per half-period. So each full period would correspond to two acceleration events. So each revolution would correspond to one acceleration event. So the number of revolutions is 5000. But again, no option matches.

Hmm. Another angle: the phase of the voltage is given as Φ0 = π/4. So the initial phase is 45 degrees. Does that affect the number of revolutions? Maybe it affects how the acceleration happens, perhaps leading to a different count. I'm not sure how to include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy per revolution depends on both U0 and the phase. But I'm not familiar with the exact formula here.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron is N = (T1) / (e U0) * (2π m)/(e B) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by T1 / (e U0) * (something). Let me think about the units. T1 is in MeV, e U0 is in keV, so 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV = 5000. So 5000 revolutions would give 950 MeV. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 1864

B)5300

C)3536

D)2500

Hmm, 5000 is close to option B (5300). But why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the energy gained per revolution is not exactly e U0. Maybe the effective voltage is lower due to some reason, or perhaps we have to account for relativistic effects. But the problem says the initial kinetic energy is negligible, implying non-relativistic speeds. So relativistic effects are probably ignored.

Alternatively, perhaps the acceleration occurs twice per revolution, so the energy per revolution is 2 e U0. Then N = 950e6 / (2 * 190e3) )= 2500, which is option D.

But another thought: the energy gained per revolution is e U0 times the number of gaps passed through. If each revolution passes through two gaps, then each gives e U0, so total 2 e U0 per revolution. So N = 950e6 / (2 * 190e3) = 2500. So that would be option D.

But why would the number of gaps per revolution be two? Because in a synchrocyclotron, there are two gaps per revolution, allowing for acceleration on each pass. So each revolution, the proton goes through two points where it can be accelerated, each giving e U0. So total per revolution is 2 e U0.

But wait, that would make the number of revolutions N = 950e6 / (2 * 190e3) )= 2500, which is option D.

But why would the number of gaps be two? Maybe the magnetic field has two regions where the electric field is applied, so the proton is accelerated twice per revolution.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Another approach: perhaps the correct formula for the number of revolutions is N = (T1) / (e U0) * (2π / (2π ν)). But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the time it takes to reach the desired energy. The time t is the time during which the proton is accelerated. Each time the electric field is applied, the proton gains some energy.

The voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(2π ν t + Φ0). The time between each acceleration is half the period, perhaps? Because each time the cosine reaches its maximum, the proton gains e U0.

Wait, the time between each acceleration event is the period of the voltage. So the period T is 1/ν. So the number of acceleration events is ν t_total. Each event gives e U0, so the total energy is T1 = e U0 * ν t_total.

But T1 is given, so ν t_total = T1/(e U0).

But the number of revolutions N is the number of times the proton circles the synchrocyclotron. Each revolution takes a time T_rev, which is 1/ν(t), where ν(t) is the cyclotron frequency. But in a synchrocyclotron, the cyclotron frequency is synchronized with the applied voltage's frequency, so ν(t) = ν(t), which is the same as the voltage's frequency.

Wait, wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the cyclotron frequency is ν = (e B)/(2 pi m). But the magnetic field B increases as the proton gains energy to keep the cyclotron frequency matched with the applied frequency. So the cyclotron frequency ν(t) = ν_applied(t) = ν(α), where α depends on the momentum.

So the time for each revolution is T_rev = 1/ν(t). The total time t_total is the time taken to reach T1.

But since the number of revolutions is N = t_total / T_rev = ν_applied(t) * t_total.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of it in terms of energy.

The total energy gained is T1 = e U0 * number_of_accelerations.

If the number of acceleration events is N_acc, then N_acc = T1/(e U0).

Each acceleration corresponds to a certain number of revolutions. If each revolution causes one acceleration, then N_acc = N. So N = T1/(e U0) = 950e6 eV / (190e3 eV) = 5000. But that's not an option.

If each revolution causes two accelerations, then N = N_acc / 2 = 5000 / 2 = 2500, which is option D.

Alternatively, if each revolution causes one acceleration, but the initial phase shift plays a role, maybe the effective number is slightly different.

But the question is asking for the number of revolutions, so if each revolution gives two acceleration events, then the number of revolutions is 2500, which is option D.

But looking back, the options include option C) 3536 and others. 3536 is roughly 950,000 / 270 ≈ 3536. So perhaps there's another factor involved.

Wait, another approach: the phase condition. The phase of the voltage must be matched with the phase of the particle’s motion.

The phase of the voltage is 2π ν(t) t + Φ0. The phase of the particle is 2π N(t), where N(t) is the number of revolutions up to time t.

The condition for resonance is that the phase of the voltage equals the phase of the particle. So:

2π ν(t) t + Φ0 = 2π N(t) + 2π k,

where k is an integer. Ignoring k for simplicity,

ν(t) t + Φ0/2π = N(t).

But N(t) is the number of revolutions, which is the integral of the revolution frequency over time. The revolution frequency is ν(t) = (e B(t))/(2π m). But in a synchrocyclotron, B(t) is adjusted such that ν(t) = ν_applied(t). So:

ν(t) t + Φ0/(2π) = ∫0^t ν(t') dt'

Wait, but that seems complicated. Let's consider that for each revolution, the phase must advance by 2π. So the total phase after N revolutions is 2π N. The phase of the voltage after time t is 2π ν(t) t + Φ0.

At the end of acceleration, when the proton has made N(t) revolutions, the phase condition is:

2π ν(t) t + Φ0 = 2π N(t) + 2π k.

Assuming that k is an integer, likely zero or one.

If we ignore k, perhaps:

ν(t) t ≈ N(t).

But since N(t) is the number of revolutions, which is also the integral of ν(t) dt from 0 to t, i.e., N(t) = ∫0^t ν(t') dt'.

So the equation becomes:

ν(t) t ≈ ∫0^t ν(t') dt'

Which can be rewritten as:

d/dt (1/2 ν(t)^2 ) = something. Hmm, perhaps not so useful.

Alternatively, assuming that ν(t) is approximately a constant, but that's not the case here because B(t) is changing.

Wait, perhaps for small changes, we can approximate. But this seems getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is approximately (T1)/(e U0), which is 5000, but since none of the options match, perhaps the correct approach is to account for the phase shift.

Wait, the initial phase is Φ0 = π/4. So the phase at t=0 is π/4. The condition for resonance is that the phase of the voltage must match the phase of the particle.

So the first acceleration occurs when the voltage's phase reaches π/2, perhaps. But I'm not sure how that affects the total count.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of acceleration events is (T1)/(e U0) * (something involving the phase). But I'm not certain.

Another thought: the energy gained per revolution isn't exactly e U0 because of the phase shift. So the effective energy per revolution is lower, leading to more revolutions needed. For example, if the phase is π/4, perhaps each revolution only provides a fraction of the maximum energy.

Wait, perhaps the effective energy per revolution is e U0 multiplied by sin(theta), where theta is the phase. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the initial phase is π/4, the first acceleration happens at a phase where the voltage is U0 cos(π/4) = U0 * sqrt(2)/2. So the first energy gain is e U0 * sqrt(2)/2. Then for subsequent revolutions, the phase would shift so that the maximum is achieved each time.

But this might complicate the calculation, as each revolution may contribute different amounts.

But considering that the problem gives the phase as π/4, I'm not sure if it's a red herring or if it affects the calculation.

Ah, wait. The initial phase Φ0 = π/4. So the voltage starts at U0 cos(π/4) = (U0√2)/2. So the initial acceleration is less than maximum. But as the proton starts accelerating, the magnetic field changes to keep phase.

Hmm, perhaps the number of revolutions is the same as if the phase were zero, because the phase shift only affects the initial condition.

But if the energy per revolution is fixed at e U0, regardless of phase, then the initial phase might not affect the total number of revolutions needed.

In that case, the number of revolutions is 5000, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption.

Wait, but the phase affects the first acceleration, but not the subsequent ones. So maybe the first acceleration is partial, and all the others are full. So the total energy would be (number of full accelerations) * e U0 plus the first partial.

But that would complicate things, but perhaps it's negligible if N is large.

Wait, another angle: the number of revolutions N is given by the formula N = (T1) / (e U0) * (2π m)/(e B0), where B0 is the initial magnetic field. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N = (T1) / (e U0) * (something involving the time derivative of B). But without knowing the exact formula, it's hard.

Wait, let's think about the energy gained in a synchrocyclotron. The kinetic energy gained per revolution is approximately e U0. Therefore, the number of revolutions N is T1 / (e U0).

But given that, N = (950e6 eV) / (190e3 eV) = 5000.

But the options don't have 5000. So perhaps the correct approach is to model each acceleration event as a half-revolution.

Wait, each time the proton completes a half-revolution, it gains e U0. So the number of half-revolutions would be 5000, which would mean 2500 full revolutions, which is option D.

But why would each half-revolution correspond to an acceleration? Because maybe the voltage is applied for each half-cycle, and each time the particle goes through the gap in the right direction, it gains energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of times the proton passes through the accelerating gap is equal to the number of revolutions, and each pass gives e U0. So N = 5000, but the options don't have that.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the answer options. Let's see: 5000 is not an option. The closest is option B) 5300, which is 6% higher. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1.06 or something. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the actual energy per revolution is e U0 * (2π) / (something), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the momentum of the proton increases as it gains energy, so the radius of its orbit increases. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases to keep the radius constant. So the cyclotron frequency changes as B increases.

The cyclotron frequency ν = (e B)/(2 π m). As B increases, ν increases. So the time for each revolution is T_rev = 1/ν, which decreases as B increases.

But the time t taken to reach the final energy is the integral of 1/ν(t) dt from 0 to t.

But without knowing the exact dependence of B(t), it's difficult to compute t.

But perhaps we can make an approximation. Since the proton starts with negligible KE, the initial magnetic field B0 is small. As the proton gains energy, B(t) increases.

The kinetic energy T is (p^2)/(2m), so p = sqrt(2 m T). The momentum p = e B r, where r is the radius (fixed in synchrocyclotron). So B = p/(e r) = sqrt(2 m T)/(e r).

So as T increases, B increases as sqrt(T).

The cyclotron frequency ν = (e B)/(2 π m) = sqrt(2 m T)/(2 π m) * e/(e r) ??? Wait, not sure.

Wait, let's substitute B from above: ν = (e B)/(2 π m) = (e/(2 π m)) * (sqrt(2 m T)/(e r)) )= sqrt(2 m T)/(2 π m r) * e/(e) → sqrt(2 m T)/(2 π m r).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled. Let me compute ν in terms of T.

ν = (e B)/(2 π m). And from B = p/(e r), and p = sqrt(2 m T), so B = sqrt(2 m T)/(e r).

Substitute into ν: ν = (e * sqrt(2 m T)/(e r)) ) / (2 π m) ) = sqrt(2 m T)/( r 2 π m).

Simplify:

ν = sqrt(2 T)/(2 π r sqrt(m)) ).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express ν in terms of T.

But regardless, the time for each revolution T_rev = 1/ν.

But the number of revolutions N is the integral of ν(t) dt from 0 to t_total. Because N = ∫0^t ν(t) dt.

But since the problem states that the number of revolutions is to be found, perhaps I can find N = ∫0^t ν(t) dt, and t is the time taken to reach T1.

But without knowing the exact dependence of ν(t) on T, it's hard to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula for the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron. Let me think: I recall that the number of revolutions N is given by N = T1/(e U0) * (2π m)/(e B0), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is (T1) / (e U0) times something else.

Wait, the only option that's close to 5000 is option B) 5300. Perhaps I should consider that the initial velocity isn't zero, but the problem states that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so it's almost zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula includes the phase term, like N = (T1)/(e U0) + (Φ0)/(2π), but that would add 1/4, making N 5000.25, which doesn't help.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option C) 3536. Let me see: 3536 * 190e3 eV = 3536 * 190 kV = 671,  3536 *190 = let's compute 3500 *190 = 665,000, 36 *190=6,840 → total 671,840 keV = 671.84 MeV. But the target is 950 MeV. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, option C is 3536, which is approximately 950e3 / (268.57) ≈ 3536. So perhaps the energy per revolution is about 268.57 keV. But why would that be the case?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula N = (m/(e)) * (T1)/(U0) * (something else), but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm probably overcomplicating. Let me think about the initial approach again. Each revolution gives e U0. So N = 950,000 / 190 = 5000. Not an option. But perhaps the initial phase causes the first acceleration to be partial, so the effective number is a bit higher.

But I'm not getting anywhere. I think the correct answer is option C) 3536. Because 3536 * 190 = 671, 840 → 671.84 MeV. No, that's less than 950 MeV. So not matching.

Wait, another thought: the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos(2 π ν(α) t + Φ0). The energy gained per passage is e U0, but perhaps the time between passages is not 1/ν, but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the time between each acceleration is the period of the applied voltage. So the number of accelerations is ν t_total. So the energy is T1 = e U0 * ν t_total.

But the number of revolutions N is the number of times the proton circles the synchrocyclotron, which depends on the time and the cyclotron frequency.

But N = ∫0^t ν(t) dt = ∫0^t (e B(t))/(2 π m) dt.

But since B(t) increases as sqrt(T), and T increases as the proton gains energy, this integral is complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can make an approximation. Since the initial energy is negligible, T ≈ e U0 * N_acc, where N_acc is the number of acceleration events.

But I'm not getting anywhere. I think the correct approach is to assume that each revolution gives one acceleration event, so N = 5000, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is 3536 (option C), but I'm not sure why.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the formula for the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron.

I found a formula online (though I can't access it now) that the number of revolutions N is given by:

N = (T1) / (e U0) * (2π m)/(e B0)

Assuming B0 is the initial magnetic field, but I don't have the value of B0. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, another formula says that N = (m)/(e) * (T1)/(U0) * (1/2π).

Wait, let's compute N = (m/(e)) * (950e6 eV) / (190e3 eV) * (1/(2π)).

m is the mass of the proton, about 1.67e-27 kg. e is 1.6e-19 C.

So (m/(e)) = (1.67e-27 kg) / (1.6e-19 C) ≈ 1.04e-8 kg/C.

(950e6 eV) / (190e3 eV) = 5000.

So N ≈ 1.04e-8 * 5000 * (1/(2π)) ≈ 1.04e-8 * 5000 /6.28 ≈ (5.2e-5) /6.28 ≈ 8.27e-6. That's way too small. So that approach isn't right.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the answer is 5000, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended approach is to consider each revolution as giving two acceleration events, leading to N=2500 (option D). Alternatively, perhaps the phase introduces a correction.

Wait, but the given options don't include 5000. So perhaps the correct answer is 3536, which is 950e6 / (270e3) ≈ 3536. So perhaps the energy per revolution is 270 keV.

But why would that be the case? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is N = ( T1 ) / (e U0) * (something). Let me think about the units. T1 is in energy, e U0 is energy, so N is dimensionless, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is N = ( T1 ) / (e U0 ) * (2π m)/(e B), but I don't know B.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I should go with the initial assumption that each revolution gives e U0, so N = 5000. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 3536, which is approximately 950e3 / (270e3) = 3.536, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the question meant that the proton undergoes acceleration twice, meaning two events, but that would give N= 950e6 / (2 *190e3) )= 2500, which is option D.

I think I'll settle on option C) 3536, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 950,000 divided by 190 again.

950,000 / 190 = ?

Well, 190 * 5 = 950. So 190 * 5000 = 950,000. So yes, 5000.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to account for the fact that each revolution provides two acceleration events, so N = 5000 / 2 = 2500, which is option D.

So I think the answer is D) 2500.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron as it accelerates from negligible kinetic energy to a final kinetic energy of \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \). The alternating voltage applied in the accelerator is given by \( U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi \nu(\alpha) t + \Phi_0] \), with \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Gain per Revolution**:  
   In a synchrocyclotron, the proton gains energy each time it passes through the accelerating gap. The energy gained per passage is \( e U_0 \), where \( e \) is the elementary charge. Since the problem does not explicitly state whether the proton passes through the gap once or twice per revolution, two scenarios are considered:
   - If the proton gains \( e U_0 \) per revolution, the total number of revolutions \( N \) is given by:
     \[
     N = \frac{T_1}{e U_0}
     \]
     Substituting \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{keV} \) and \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \):
     \[
     N = \frac{950,000}{190} = 5000
     \]
     However, this result does not match any of the provided options.

   - If the proton passes through the gap twice per revolution, the energy gained per revolution is \( 2 e U_0 \). In this case:
     \[
     N = \frac{T_1}{2 e U_0}
     \]
     Substituting the same values:
     \[
     N = \frac{950,000}{2 \times 190} = 2500
     \]
     This matches option D.

2. **Phase Consideration**:  
   The initial phase \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \) affects the first acceleration event but is unlikely to significantly alter the total number of revolutions, as the energy gain per revolution remains approximately \( e U_0 \).

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (1864)**: This is far too low compared to the calculated values.
   - **Option B (5300)**: This is close to the initial calculation of \( N = 5000 \), but it does not account for the possibility of two accelerations per revolution.
   - **Option C (3536)**: This value does not align with the energy-per-revolution assumption and appears arbitrary.
   - **Option D (2500)**: This matches the calculation when assuming two accelerations per revolution, making it the most plausible answer.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent interpretation is that the proton undergoes two accelerations per revolution, leading to \( N = 2500 \). This aligns with option D.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember cyclotrons are particle accelerators that use magnetic fields and electric fields to accelerate charged particles. Synchrocyclotrons must be a type of cyclotron, maybe with some modifications.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

Wait, the question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. So I need to find the number of times the proton goes around the accelerator before it reaches that kinetic energy.

I'm a bit rusty on synchrocyclotrons. I remember that in cyclotrons, the magnetic field is kept constant, so the radius increases as the velocity increases. But synchrocyclotrons might have a different approach. Oh wait, maybe in synchrocyclotrons, the magnetic field is varied with time to keep the particles in phase with the accelerating electric field. That way, they can reach higher energies without hitting relativistic limits as much as regular cyclotrons.

So the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the electric field, right? Each time the voltage completes a cycle, the proton might gain a certain amount of energy. But since the magnetic field is changing, the cyclotron frequency might be adjusted.

Wait, but the problem says it's a synchrocyclotron, so the frequency ν(α) of the applied voltage probably changes as the particle's momentum changes. The proton starts with negligible KE, so its initial momentum is very low, and as it gains energy, its momentum increases, so the required frequency also changes.

The voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α) t + Φ0]. Since the voltage is alternating, the particles are accelerated each half-cycle or something like that. But I'm not exactly sure about the phase and how it affects the acceleration.

I think for each revolution, the particle gets a little bit of energy. The number of revolutions would be the total energy gained divided by the energy per revolution.

Wait, but the problem states the proton undergoes two accelerations. Hmm, maybe each acceleration happens each revolution? Or perhaps each half-revolution? I'm a bit confused there.

Alternatively, maybe each time the particle goes through the gap, it gets a kick of energy from the electric field. So each time it completes a half-period, it gains some energy. So if it goes around N times, it gets N kicks.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the gap in the magnetic field. The number of times they pass through depends on the time it takes to reach the desired energy.

But how does the energy per revolution relate to the applied voltage? The voltage is U0, so the energy gain per passage might be related to U0. But since the voltage is alternating, perhaps each passage gives a certain amount of energy.

Wait, the kinetic energy is being increased from 0 to 950 MeV. So the total energy to be gained is 950 MeV. How much energy is gained per revolution?

Wait, in a cyclotron, each time the particle goes through the gap, it gains an energy equal to the voltage applied, assuming it's synchronized. But in a synchrocyclotron, since the magnetic field is changing, the frequency changes. So maybe the energy per revolution isn't fixed but depends on time.

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can model it as each revolution providing a certain energy gain, maybe U0 per something.

Wait, the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos(...). The peak voltage is U0, which is 190 kV. So each passage through the gap might give the proton an energy gain equal to U0? Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, the kinetic energy gained by a charge when accelerated through a potential U is qU. Since the proton has charge e, the energy gain per acceleration would be e U0, but wait, the voltage is varying with time, so the maximum energy gain per passage would be e U0.

So for each half-cycle, the proton would gain e U0. Because the voltage reaches a maximum of U0 once per cycle, so each time the particle goes through, it's accelerated once. Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think again.

In a synchrocyclotron, the electric field alternates, so the particle is accelerated each time it passes through the gap. Each time the electric field is in the right direction, it gains energy. So the number of times it passes through the gap is twice the number of revolutions, maybe? Because each revolution brings it back to the gap twice (once on the way in, once on the way out).

Wait, in a cyclotron, each time the particle completes a half-circle, it passes through the gap once. So each full revolution would pass through the gap once. Or does it pass through twice per revolution? Because the gap is a small part of the ring. Hmm, perhaps it's better to model the acceleration per revolution.

Alternatively, perhaps each time the electric field reverses, the particle gets a kick. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a formula or an approach.

Another approach: the time taken for the proton to reach the desired energy can be found, and then the number of revolutions is the total time divided by the period of the cyclotron.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is varied so that the cyclotron frequency matches the frequency of the applied voltage. So as the proton gains energy, its momentum increases, and the magnetic field changes to keep it in the same orbit. Wait, no, actually, in synchrocyclotrons, the magnetic field increases with time to allow the particle to stay in the same orbit. Because if the magnetic field stays the same, the radius would have to increase as the momentum increases, but in synchrocyclotrons, the radius is kept fixed by varying the magnetic field. So the magnetic field increases as the proton gains energy. That way, the cyclotron frequency ν = q B/(2π m) also changes, but it's kept in phase with the applied voltage.

So the key thing to remember is that in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field B(t) is varied such that the cyclotron frequency matches the frequency of the applied voltage. So the time for each revolution depends on the current B(t), but since the frequency ν(α) is adjusted, the proton is always in phase with the accelerating field.

Now, the energy gain per revolution in a synchrocyclotron is given by E = e U0, where e is the charge of the proton, and U0 is the peak voltage. Because each time the particle passes through the gap, it is accelerated by the electric field and gains energy equal to e times the peak voltage.

Wait, but wait a minute. The voltage is varying as cos(...), so the maximum energy gain per passage is e U0. So maybe each time the particle passes through the gap, it gains e U0. How often does this happen? Once per revolution, right? Because each revolution brings the particle back to the gap once.

Wait, no. In a cyclotron, each passage through the gap (each time it goes through the gap, which is like a spoke in the wheel) happens once per revolution. So each time the particle does a half-circle, it passes through the gap once. Hence, each revolution (full circle) would have two gaps? Or perhaps each full revolution only passes through one gap... I'm getting a bit confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps each half-revolution brings the particle through the gap once. So in each full revolution, the particle passes through the gap twice. Therefore, each revolution would result in two energy gains of e U0 each. But wait, that can't be right because that would mean the energy is doubling each revolution, which would make the energy grow exponentially, which isn't the case.

Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense. Probably, the energy gained per revolution is e U0. So the energy after N revolutions is N e U0.

But wait, the initial energy is zero, and the target is 950 MeV. So 950 MeV = N * e * U0.

Wait, let's compute that.

e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602e-19 coulombs. But let me think in terms of energy units. 1 eV is the energy gained by an electron when accelerated through 1 volt. So a proton gaining e U0 volts would be e * U0 * e charge? Wait, no. The energy gained is e * U, where U is the voltage. Because the proton's charge is e, so E = e U.

Wait, no. The energy is e multiplied by the voltage. So for example, 1 V would give a proton 1 eV of energy. So if the voltage is U0 = 190 kV, then each time the proton goes through the gap, it gains 190 keV of energy.

But wait, the voltage is time-dependent. So the maximum energy gain per passage is e U0. So each time the particle passes through the gap in the right direction, it gains e U0. So if the applied voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[...], the peak is U0, so maximum energy gain is e U0.

So the total number of revolutions N would be the total energy gained divided by the energy per revolution.

So N = (950 MeV) / (190 keV per revolution).

Because 950 MeV = 950,000 keV. 950,000 / 190 = approximately 5000. But wait, let me compute that.

950,000 divided by 190. Let's see: 190 * 5000 = 950,000. Exactly. So N would be 5000.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 5300, and option C is 3536. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of required revolutions is N = (T1) / (e U0). But wait, the initial kinetic energy is zero, and the final is 950 MeV.

Wait, let me think again. Each time the particle passes through the gap, it gains e U0. So the number of times it passes through the gap is N_passages. But each revolution brings it to the gap twice (like entering and exiting), so the number of revolutions N is equal to N_passages divided by 2.

Wait, no. In a cyclotron, the particles go around in a circle, and each time they reach the gap, they feel the electric field. So each passage through the gap is once per revolution, I think. Because the gap is a small section in the magnetic field. So each time the particle completes a revolution, it comes back to the gap and gets another acceleration.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the energy gained per revolution is e U0. So the number of revolutions is the total energy divided by e U0.

So N = (950 MeV) / (190 keV).

Wait, 950 MeV is 950,000 keV. 950,000 / 190 = let's compute. 190 * 5000 = 950,000. So N = 5000. But the options don't have 5000. The closest option is B) 5300, which is about 50% higher.

Hmm. So perhaps my assumption is wrong. Maybe the energy gained per revolution isn't exactly e U0. Because in reality, the particle is accelerated multiple times as it goes around, perhaps multiple times per revolution.

Wait, in a cyclotron, the electric field alternates, so each half-period the particle is accelerated. So in one full period, the particle is accelerated once because the electric field switches direction. Or wait, no. Let me think: the electric field is applied across the gap, so as the particle moves through the gap, it experiences the electric field. The field alternates direction, so each time the field is in the correct phase, the particle gains energy.

Wait, the cyclotron frequency is such that the particles complete a half-circle in the time it takes the electric field to switch polarity. So each time the particle passes through the gap, it's accelerated once per cycle. So each full cycle (one period) of the electric field corresponds to one acceleration event.

Wait, perhaps the number of acceleration events is equal to the number of times the electric field is applied in the correct phase as the proton circles around. So each time the electric field is in the correct phase, the proton is accelerated. So the number of acceleration events is equal to the number of times the electric field is in phase with the proton's position, which is once per revolution? Or perhaps twice?

Alternatively, perhaps each revolution corresponds to two acceleration events. Because the electric field is applied in both directions, so each time the proton passes through the gap, it can be accelerated either from the top or the bottom, perhaps. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the number of acceleration events is twice the number of revolutions. So if each revolution provides two acceleration events, then the energy per revolution would be 2 e U0. So the total number of revolutions would be the total energy divided by 2 e U0.

So N = (950 MeV) / (2 * 190 keV) = (950,000 keV) / (380 keV) ≈ 2500.

Looking at the options, option D is 2500. But wait, the initial assumption that each revolution gives two acceleration events would lead to N=2500, which is option D.

But earlier I thought N was 5000. So which one is correct?

Wait, another thought: the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Wait, the question says it undergoes two accelerations. Hmm, no, the question says the proton is injected and undergoes two accelerations. Wait, no, the question says it undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Oh wait, no, the problem statement says "undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV". Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Oh, the original question says, "a proton is injected... undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV." Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's a translation issue. Oh, perhaps it's a typo and supposed to say "accelerations" as in "accelerations (as in, the process involves acceleration) to reach...", but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the number of acceleration cycles is two? That doesn't make sense either.

Wait, perhaps the number of times the voltage changes is two, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the number of times the voltage is applied is two, but that doesn't fit with reaching 950 MeV.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the formula for the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron.

I remember that the number of revolutions N is given by N = (T1) / (e U0) * (c / (2π r)), but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is needed. The time it takes for the proton to reach the desired energy can be found, and then the number of revolutions is the time divided by the period of the cyclotron frequency.

But for that, I need to know how the cyclotron frequency and the magnetic field change over time.

Hmm, the cyclotron frequency is ν = (e B)/(2 π m). As the proton gains energy, its momentum increases, so B must be adjusted to keep ν in phase with the applied voltage. Since the applied voltage has a frequency ν(t) = ν(α), which probably depends on the current momentum α (a parameter related to the momentum).

The phase condition for a synchrocyclotron is that the change in phase of the voltage matches the change in phase of the particle's motion as it goes around. The phase of the voltage is 2 π ν(t) t, and the phase change of the particle after each revolution is also 2 π. So for each revolution, the phase of the voltage must advance by 2 π as well. Therefore, the time for each revolution is T = 1/(ν(t)).

But the energy gained per revolution is e U0, as each time the particle goes through the gap, the voltage is maximum, so the energy increases by e U0 each time.

Wait, but if each revolution provides e U0 energy, then the number of revolutions N is 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV = 950,000 / 190 = 5000. But the options don't include 5000. Closest is option B) 5300, but that's about 6% higher. So perhaps my assumption is missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy gained per revolution is not exactly e U0. Maybe the average voltage is considered instead of the peak. Or perhaps the voltage is applied in such a way that each acceleration event gives half of U0, so each revolution gives e * (U0 / 2). Then N would be 950e6 / 95e3 = 10,000. Not matching the options.

Wait, another approach: the total energy is T1 = 950 MeV. Each time the proton goes around, it gains a certain amount of energy. If the number of revolutions is N, then N * (e U0) = T1.

Wait, so N = T1 / (e U0). But T1 is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV. U0 is 190 keV.

So N = 950,000 / 190 ≈ 5000.

But the options don't have 5000. So perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe the number of acceleration events is twice the number of revolutions. So if each revolution provides two acceleration events, each giving e U0, then the number of revolutions would be N = 950e6 / (2 * 190e3) ) ≈ 2500. Which is option D. But the problem states the proton undergoes two accelerations, which might mean two events, but that's not clear.

Wait, perhaps the number of acceleration events is equal to the number of revolutions. So if each revolution provides one acceleration, then N = 5000. But the given options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the number of revolutions is (T1) / (e U0) times some factor. Wait, maybe the actual energy per revolution is not e U0, but some fraction of that.

Wait, perhaps the voltage is applied in such a way that the particle is accelerated once per half-period. So each full period would correspond to two acceleration events. So each revolution would correspond to one acceleration event. So the number of revolutions is 5000. But again, no option matches.

Hmm. Another angle: the phase of the voltage is given as Φ0 = π/4. So the initial phase is 45 degrees. Does that affect the number of revolutions? Maybe it affects how the acceleration happens, perhaps leading to a different count. I'm not sure how to include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy per revolution depends on both U0 and the phase. But I'm not familiar with the exact formula here.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron is N = (T1) / (e U0) * (2π m)/(e B) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by T1 / (e U0) * (something). Let me think about the units. T1 is in MeV, e U0 is in keV, so 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV = 5000. So 5000 revolutions would give 950 MeV. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 1864

B)5300

C)3536

D)2500

Hmm, 5000 is close to option B (5300). But why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the energy gained per revolution is not exactly e U0. Maybe the effective voltage is lower due to some reason, or perhaps we have to account for relativistic effects. But the problem says the initial kinetic energy is negligible, implying non-relativistic speeds. So relativistic effects are probably ignored.

Alternatively, perhaps the acceleration occurs twice per revolution, so the energy per revolution is 2 e U0. Then N = 950e6 / (2 * 190e3) )= 2500, which is option D.

But another thought: the energy gained per revolution is e U0 times the number of gaps passed through. If each revolution passes through two gaps, then each gives e U0, so total 2 e U0 per revolution. So N = 950e6 / (2 * 190e3) = 2500. So that would be option D.

But why would the number of gaps per revolution be two? Because in a synchrocyclotron, there are two gaps per revolution, allowing for acceleration on each pass. So each revolution, the proton goes through two points where it can be accelerated, each giving e U0. So total per revolution is 2 e U0.

But wait, that would make the number of revolutions N = 950e6 / (2 * 190e3) )= 2500, which is option D.

But why would the number of gaps be two? Maybe the magnetic field has two regions where the electric field is applied, so the proton is accelerated twice per revolution.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Another approach: perhaps the correct formula for the number of revolutions is N = (T1) / (e U0) * (2π / (2π ν)). But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the time it takes to reach the desired energy. The time t is the time during which the proton is accelerated. Each time the electric field is applied, the proton gains some energy.

The voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(2π ν t + Φ0). The time between each acceleration is half the period, perhaps? Because each time the cosine reaches its maximum, the proton gains e U0.

Wait, the time between each acceleration event is the period of the voltage. So the period T is 1/ν. So the number of acceleration events is ν t_total. Each event gives e U0, so the total energy is T1 = e U0 * ν t_total.

But T1 is given, so ν t_total = T1/(e U0).

But the number of revolutions N is the number of times the proton circles the synchrocyclotron. Each revolution takes a time T_rev, which is 1/ν(t), where ν(t) is the cyclotron frequency. But in a synchrocyclotron, the cyclotron frequency is synchronized with the applied voltage's frequency, so ν(t) = ν(t), which is the same as the voltage's frequency.

Wait, wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the cyclotron frequency is ν = (e B)/(2 pi m). But the magnetic field B increases as the proton gains energy to keep the cyclotron frequency matched with the applied frequency. So the cyclotron frequency ν(t) = ν_applied(t) = ν(α), where α depends on the momentum.

So the time for each revolution is T_rev = 1/ν(t). The total time t_total is the time taken to reach T1.

But since the number of revolutions is N = t_total / T_rev = ν_applied(t) * t_total.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of it in terms of energy.

The total energy gained is T1 = e U0 * number_of_accelerations.

If the number of acceleration events is N_acc, then N_acc = T1/(e U0).

Each acceleration corresponds to a certain number of revolutions. If each revolution causes one acceleration, then N_acc = N. So N = T1/(e U0) = 950e6 eV / (190e3 eV) = 5000. But that's not an option.

If each revolution causes two accelerations, then N = N_acc / 2 = 5000 / 2 = 2500, which is option D.

Alternatively, if each revolution causes one acceleration, but the initial phase shift plays a role, maybe the effective number is slightly different.

But the question is asking for the number of revolutions, so if each revolution gives two acceleration events, then the number of revolutions is 2500, which is option D.

But looking back, the options include option C) 3536 and others. 3536 is roughly 950,000 / 270 ≈ 3536. So perhaps there's another factor involved.

Wait, another approach: the phase condition. The phase of the voltage must be matched with the phase of the particle’s motion.

The phase of the voltage is 2π ν(t) t + Φ0. The phase of the particle is 2π N(t), where N(t) is the number of revolutions up to time t.

The condition for resonance is that the phase of the voltage equals the phase of the particle. So:

2π ν(t) t + Φ0 = 2π N(t) + 2π k,

where k is an integer. Ignoring k for simplicity,

ν(t) t + Φ0/2π = N(t).

But N(t) is the number of revolutions, which is the integral of the revolution frequency over time. The revolution frequency is ν(t) = (e B(t))/(2π m). But in a synchrocyclotron, B(t) is adjusted such that ν(t) = ν_applied(t). So:

ν(t) t + Φ0/(2π) = ∫0^t ν(t') dt'

Wait, but that seems complicated. Let's consider that for each revolution, the phase must advance by 2π. So the total phase after N revolutions is 2π N. The phase of the voltage after time t is 2π ν(t) t + Φ0.

At the end of acceleration, when the proton has made N(t) revolutions, the phase condition is:

2π ν(t) t + Φ0 = 2π N(t) + 2π k.

Assuming that k is an integer, likely zero or one.

If we ignore k, perhaps:

ν(t) t ≈ N(t).

But since N(t) is the number of revolutions, which is also the integral of ν(t) dt from 0 to t, i.e., N(t) = ∫0^t ν(t') dt'.

So the equation becomes:

ν(t) t ≈ ∫0^t ν(t') dt'

Which can be rewritten as:

d/dt (1/2 ν(t)^2 ) = something. Hmm, perhaps not so useful.

Alternatively, assuming that ν(t) is approximately a constant, but that's not the case here because B(t) is changing.

Wait, perhaps for small changes, we can approximate. But this seems getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is approximately (T1)/(e U0), which is 5000, but since none of the options match, perhaps the correct approach is to account for the phase shift.

Wait, the initial phase is Φ0 = π/4. So the phase at t=0 is π/4. The condition for resonance is that the phase of the voltage must match the phase of the particle.

So the first acceleration occurs when the voltage's phase reaches π/2, perhaps. But I'm not sure how that affects the total count.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of acceleration events is (T1)/(e U0) * (something involving the phase). But I'm not certain.

Another thought: the energy gained per revolution isn't exactly e U0 because of the phase shift. So the effective energy per revolution is lower, leading to more revolutions needed. For example, if the phase is π/4, perhaps each revolution only provides a fraction of the maximum energy.

Wait, perhaps the effective energy per revolution is e U0 multiplied by sin(theta), where theta is the phase. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the initial phase is π/4, the first acceleration happens at a phase where the voltage is U0 cos(π/4) = U0 * sqrt(2)/2. So the first energy gain is e U0 * sqrt(2)/2. Then for subsequent revolutions, the phase would shift so that the maximum is achieved each time.

But this might complicate the calculation, as each revolution may contribute different amounts.

But considering that the problem gives the phase as π/4, I'm not sure if it's a red herring or if it affects the calculation.

Ah, wait. The initial phase Φ0 = π/4. So the voltage starts at U0 cos(π/4) = (U0√2)/2. So the initial acceleration is less than maximum. But as the proton starts accelerating, the magnetic field changes to keep phase.

Hmm, perhaps the number of revolutions is the same as if the phase were zero, because the phase shift only affects the initial condition.

But if the energy per revolution is fixed at e U0, regardless of phase, then the initial phase might not affect the total number of revolutions needed.

In that case, the number of revolutions is 5000, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption.

Wait, but the phase affects the first acceleration, but not the subsequent ones. So maybe the first acceleration is partial, and all the others are full. So the total energy would be (number of full accelerations) * e U0 plus the first partial.

But that would complicate things, but perhaps it's negligible if N is large.

Wait, another angle: the number of revolutions N is given by the formula N = (T1) / (e U0) * (2π m)/(e B0), where B0 is the initial magnetic field. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N = (T1) / (e U0) * (something involving the time derivative of B). But without knowing the exact formula, it's hard.

Wait, let's think about the energy gained in a synchrocyclotron. The kinetic energy gained per revolution is approximately e U0. Therefore, the number of revolutions N is T1 / (e U0).

But given that, N = (950e6 eV) / (190e3 eV) = 5000.

But the options don't have 5000. So perhaps the correct approach is to model each acceleration event as a half-revolution.

Wait, each time the proton completes a half-revolution, it gains e U0. So the number of half-revolutions would be 5000, which would mean 2500 full revolutions, which is option D.

But why would each half-revolution correspond to an acceleration? Because maybe the voltage is applied for each half-cycle, and each time the particle goes through the gap in the right direction, it gains energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of times the proton passes through the accelerating gap is equal to the number of revolutions, and each pass gives e U0. So N = 5000, but the options don't have that.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the answer options. Let's see: 5000 is not an option. The closest is option B) 5300, which is 6% higher. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1.06 or something. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the actual energy per revolution is e U0 * (2π) / (something), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the momentum of the proton increases as it gains energy, so the radius of its orbit increases. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases to keep the radius constant. So the cyclotron frequency changes as B increases.

The cyclotron frequency ν = (e B)/(2 π m). As B increases, ν increases. So the time for each revolution is T_rev = 1/ν, which decreases as B increases.

But the time t taken to reach the final energy is the integral of 1/ν(t) dt from 0 to t.

But without knowing the exact dependence of B(t), it's difficult to compute t.

But perhaps we can make an approximation. Since the proton starts with negligible KE, the initial magnetic field B0 is small. As the proton gains energy, B(t) increases.

The kinetic energy T is (p^2)/(2m), so p = sqrt(2 m T). The momentum p = e B r, where r is the radius (fixed in synchrocyclotron). So B = p/(e r) = sqrt(2 m T)/(e r).

So as T increases, B increases as sqrt(T).

The cyclotron frequency ν = (e B)/(2 π m) = sqrt(2 m T)/(2 π m) * e/(e r) ??? Wait, not sure.

Wait, let's substitute B from above: ν = (e B)/(2 π m) = (e/(2 π m)) * (sqrt(2 m T)/(e r)) )= sqrt(2 m T)/(2 π m r) * e/(e) → sqrt(2 m T)/(2 π m r).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled. Let me compute ν in terms of T.

ν = (e B)/(2 π m). And from B = p/(e r), and p = sqrt(2 m T), so B = sqrt(2 m T)/(e r).

Substitute into ν: ν = (e * sqrt(2 m T)/(e r)) ) / (2 π m) ) = sqrt(2 m T)/( r 2 π m).

Simplify:

ν = sqrt(2 T)/(2 π r sqrt(m)) ).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express ν in terms of T.

But regardless, the time for each revolution T_rev = 1/ν.

But the number of revolutions N is the integral of ν(t) dt from 0 to t_total. Because N = ∫0^t ν(t) dt.

But since the problem states that the number of revolutions is to be found, perhaps I can find N = ∫0^t ν(t) dt, and t is the time taken to reach T1.

But without knowing the exact dependence of ν(t) on T, it's hard to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula for the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron. Let me think: I recall that the number of revolutions N is given by N = T1/(e U0) * (2π m)/(e B0), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is (T1) / (e U0) times something else.

Wait, the only option that's close to 5000 is option B) 5300. Perhaps I should consider that the initial velocity isn't zero, but the problem states that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so it's almost zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula includes the phase term, like N = (T1)/(e U0) + (Φ0)/(2π), but that would add 1/4, making N 5000.25, which doesn't help.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option C) 3536. Let me see: 3536 * 190e3 eV = 3536 * 190 kV = 671,  3536 *190 = let's compute 3500 *190 = 665,000, 36 *190=6,840 → total 671,840 keV = 671.84 MeV. But the target is 950 MeV. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, option C is 3536, which is approximately 950e3 / (268.57) ≈ 3536. So perhaps the energy per revolution is about 268.57 keV. But why would that be the case?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula N = (m/(e)) * (T1)/(U0) * (something else), but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm probably overcomplicating. Let me think about the initial approach again. Each revolution gives e U0. So N = 950,000 / 190 = 5000. Not an option. But perhaps the initial phase causes the first acceleration to be partial, so the effective number is a bit higher.

But I'm not getting anywhere. I think the correct answer is option C) 3536. Because 3536 * 190 = 671, 840 → 671.84 MeV. No, that's less than 950 MeV. So not matching.

Wait, another thought: the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos(2 π ν(α) t + Φ0). The energy gained per passage is e U0, but perhaps the time between passages is not 1/ν, but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the time between each acceleration is the period of the applied voltage. So the number of accelerations is ν t_total. So the energy is T1 = e U0 * ν t_total.

But the number of revolutions N is the number of times the proton circles the synchrocyclotron, which depends on the time and the cyclotron frequency.

But N = ∫0^t ν(t) dt = ∫0^t (e B(t))/(2 π m) dt.

But since B(t) increases as sqrt(T), and T increases as the proton gains energy, this integral is complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can make an approximation. Since the initial energy is negligible, T ≈ e U0 * N_acc, where N_acc is the number of acceleration events.

But I'm not getting anywhere. I think the correct approach is to assume that each revolution gives one acceleration event, so N = 5000, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is 3536 (option C), but I'm not sure why.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the formula for the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron.

I found a formula online (though I can't access it now) that the number of revolutions N is given by:

N = (T1) / (e U0) * (2π m)/(e B0)

Assuming B0 is the initial magnetic field, but I don't have the value of B0. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, another formula says that N = (m)/(e) * (T1)/(U0) * (1/2π).

Wait, let's compute N = (m/(e)) * (950e6 eV) / (190e3 eV) * (1/(2π)).

m is the mass of the proton, about 1.67e-27 kg. e is 1.6e-19 C.

So (m/(e)) = (1.67e-27 kg) / (1.6e-19 C) ≈ 1.04e-8 kg/C.

(950e6 eV) / (190e3 eV) = 5000.

So N ≈ 1.04e-8 * 5000 * (1/(2π)) ≈ 1.04e-8 * 5000 /6.28 ≈ (5.2e-5) /6.28 ≈ 8.27e-6. That's way too small. So that approach isn't right.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the answer is 5000, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended approach is to consider each revolution as giving two acceleration events, leading to N=2500 (option D). Alternatively, perhaps the phase introduces a correction.

Wait, but the given options don't include 5000. So perhaps the correct answer is 3536, which is 950e6 / (270e3) ≈ 3536. So perhaps the energy per revolution is 270 keV.

But why would that be the case? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is N = ( T1 ) / (e U0) * (something). Let me think about the units. T1 is in energy, e U0 is energy, so N is dimensionless, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is N = ( T1 ) / (e U0 ) * (2π m)/(e B), but I don't know B.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I should go with the initial assumption that each revolution gives e U0, so N = 5000. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 3536, which is approximately 950e3 / (270e3) = 3.536, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the question meant that the proton undergoes acceleration twice, meaning two events, but that would give N= 950e6 / (2 *190e3) )= 2500, which is option D.

I think I'll settle on option C) 3536, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 950,000 divided by 190 again.

950,000 / 190 = ?

Well, 190 * 5 = 950. So 190 * 5000 = 950,000. So yes, 5000.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to account for the fact that each revolution provides two acceleration events, so N = 5000 / 2 = 2500, which is option D.

So I think the answer is D) 2500.


The problem involves determining the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron as it accelerates from negligible kinetic energy to a final kinetic energy of \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \). The alternating voltage applied in the accelerator is given by \( U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi \nu(\alpha) t + \Phi_0] \), with \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Gain per Revolution**:  
   In a synchrocyclotron, the proton gains energy each time it passes through the accelerating gap. The energy gained per passage is \( e U_0 \), where \( e \) is the elementary charge. Since the problem does not explicitly state whether the proton passes through the gap once or twice per revolution, two scenarios are considered:
   - If the proton gains \( e U_0 \) per revolution, the total number of revolutions \( N \) is given by:
     \[
     N = \frac{T_1}{e U_0}
     \]
     Substituting \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{keV} \) and \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \):
     \[
     N = \frac{950,000}{190} = 5000
     \]
     However, this result does not match any of the provided options.

   - If the proton passes through the gap twice per revolution, the energy gained per revolution is \( 2 e U_0 \). In this case:
     \[
     N = \frac{T_1}{2 e U_0}
     \]
     Substituting the same values:
     \[
     N = \frac{950,000}{2 \times 190} = 2500
     \]
     This matches option D.

2. **Phase Consideration**:  
   The initial phase \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \) affects the first acceleration event but is unlikely to significantly alter the total number of revolutions, as the energy gain per revolution remains approximately \( e U_0 \).

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (1864)**: This is far too low compared to the calculated values.
   - **Option B (5300)**: This is close to the initial calculation of \( N = 5000 \), but it does not account for the possibility of two accelerations per revolution.
   - **Option C (3536)**: This value does not align with the energy-per-revolution assumption and appears arbitrary.
   - **Option D (2500)**: This matches the calculation when assuming two accelerations per revolution, making it the most plausible answer.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent interpretation is that the proton undergoes two accelerations per revolution, leading to \( N = 2500 \). This aligns with option D.

Answer: D
