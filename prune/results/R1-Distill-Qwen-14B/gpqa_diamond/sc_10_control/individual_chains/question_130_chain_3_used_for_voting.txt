Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of objects, specifically large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space, so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The absorption happens at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. So if these clouds are absorbing light at that wavelength, but we're using optical telescopes, which detect visible light, there's a problem. Because if the wavelength gets shifted into the optical range due to redshift, then maybe the absorption line would be in a part of the spectrum that optical telescopes can see. But wait, wait, no. Because if the wavelength is redshifted, the observed wavelength would be longer than 1216 Angstroms.

Wait, the question says that the clouds are absorbing the light at Lyman alpha, which is 1216 Angstroms. So that's the rest wavelength. The background quasars' light is getting absorbed at that wavelength. But for the absorption to be in the optical range (so that ground-based optical telescopes can detect it), the observed wavelength must be within the optical range. So how does that translate to redshift?

Optical wavelengths are roughly from about 400 to 700 nanometers, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So the Lyman alpha wavelength, when redshifted, must fall into this range. Because if it's redshifted beyond that, it would be in the infrared, which optical telescopes can't see.

So the formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1. So z = λ_obs / λ_rest - 1.

We need λ_obs >= 4000 Angstroms (since that's the lower end of optical). But wait, wait, higher redshift would mean a longer observed wavelength. So the minimum redshift is when the observed wavelength is as short as possible in the optical range. Wait, no. Wait, the quasar's emission is at 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud's redshift is z, then the absorption line would be at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. We need this to be in the optical range, which is up to about 7000 Angstroms. Wait, no. No, wait: optical is about 400-700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So the observed wavelength must be less than 7000 Angstroms because beyond that, it's infrared. Wait, no. Because if the observed wavelength is longer than 7000 Angstroms, it's in the IR, which optical telescopes can't see. So the maximum z would be when λ_obs is 7000. But the question is about the lower limit on redshift. Wait, no, the question says: the lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected. So the minimum z for which the absorption line is still in the optical.

Wait, but wait. The quasar's light is being absorbed at 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud is at a redshift z, then the absorption line is observed at 1216*(1 + z). For this to be in the optical range (so that it's detectable by optical telescopes), this observed wavelength must be less than or equal to 7000 Angstroms. Because if it's larger, it's in the IR and can't be detected with optical telescopes.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The quasar emits light across a broad spectrum, including the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud is at redshift z, then the Lyman alpha emission from the quasar is at 1216*(1 + z). We're looking for when that wavelength is in the optical range. So the optical range is roughly 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

So the observed wavelength λ_obs must satisfy 4000 ≤ λ_obs ≤ 7000. So λ_obs = 1216*(1 + z) must be ≥ 4000? Or wait, no. Wait, if the observed wavelength is longer than 7000, it's in the IR, which optical telescopes can't see. So the maximum z is when λ_obs is 7000. So 1216*(1 + z) ≤ 7000. Solving for z: (7000/1216) ≈ 5.758, so z ≈ 4.758. So the maximum z is about 4.76. But the question is about the lower limit. Wait, no, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected. So the minimum z would be when the observed wavelength is as small as possible in the optical. That would be 4000 Angstroms. So 1216*(1 + z) ≥ 4000. Let's compute that. 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29. So 1 + z = 3.29 → z ≈ 2.29. So the minimum redshift is about 2.29. But wait, the options don't have that exactly.

Looking at the options, the choices are A) 3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.29 is between 2.4 and 1.9, but closer to 2.4. Wait, but wait—maybe I'm making a mistake here. Because the quasar's emission is at 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud is at redshift z, then the quasar's Lyman alpha line is observed at 1216*(1 + z). But wait, the cloud is at redshift z, so the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud, right? Because the quasar's light passes through the cloud on its way to us. So the quasar's light is emitted and then gets absorbed by the cloud, which is between us and the quasar. So the quasar's redshift is higher than the cloud's redshift.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the quasar's redshift and the cloud's redshift. But the question is about the redshift of the cloud. So the cloud is at redshift z. The quasar is at a higher redshift, say z_quasar. The Lyman alpha emission from the quasar would be at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). But the cloud, being at z_cloud = z, would imprint an absorption line at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) on the quasar's spectrum. So the observed wavelength of that absorption line is 1216*(1 + z).

Wait, that's correct. So the absorption line's observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z). For this to be in the optical, it must be between 4000 and 7000 Angstroms.

So the minimum z is when 1216*(1 + z) is the smallest wavelength in the optical. That is, 4000 Angstroms.

So 1 + z = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29. So z ≈ 2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is a bit higher than 2.29. Option D is 1.9, which is lower. So the lower limit would be when the observed wavelength is 4000 Angstroms, so z ≈ 2.29. So the minimum redshift is about 2.3. But none of the options exactly match that. Wait, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm, so 2.29 is about 2.3, which is very close to option C)2.4. So perhaps the correct answer is C)2.4.

But wait, is the optical range starting at 4000 Angstroms (400 nm) or higher? Because if the optical starts at 4000 Angstroms, then the absorption line must be at least that. But if the optical range is more like starting at 5000 Angstroms (500 nm), then the calculation would be different.

Wait, maybe I should think about what's the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can detect. I think ground-based optical telescopes can detect up to about 700 nm (7000 Angstroms), but not beyond. So the Lyman alpha line, when redshifted, must be less than 7000 Angstroms to be in the optical. So the maximum z is (7000/1216) -1 ≈ 5.758 -1 =4.758. So any z less than that would have the absorption line in the optical.

But the question is about the lower limit on z. So the minimum z is when the absorption line is at the shortest wavelength in optical. But wait, no: the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z). If the cloud is at a higher redshift, the absorption line is at a longer wavelength. So the absorption line can't be shorter than 4000 Angstroms. So the minimum z is when 1216*(1+z) = 4000.

Wait, no, that gives the minimal redshift (since higher z makes λ_obs larger). Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify.

If z is lower, 1216*(1+z) would be smaller. So for the absorption line to be in the optical, the observed wavelength must be at least 4000 Angstroms. So when z is 0, the absorption is at 1216 Angstroms, which is in FUV, not visible. As z increases, the observed wavelength increases. So for the absorption line to be in the optical, the observed wavelength must be >=4000 Angstroms. Therefore, the minimal redshift is when 1216*(1 + z) = 4000.

So z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29. So z ≈2.29. So the lower limit on the redshift is about 2.29. So looking at the options, the closest higher value is 2.4 (option C). But wait, is there any consideration about the atmosphere blocking certain wavelengths?

Ah, right! The atmosphere is opaque to many wavelengths. The optical window allows certain wavelengths through. The atmospheric windows in the optical are roughly from about 300 nm (3000 Ang) to about 1000 nm (10,000 Ang), but the visible part is about 400-700 nm. Wait, so to detect the absorption line, it must be within this window. But more precisely, ground-based telescopes can't observe wavelengths shorter than about 300 nm because of atmospheric absorption (by ozone, etc.). So the Lyman alpha line, when redshifted, must be in the range that is observable, which is above 300 nm. Wait, but 1216 Ang is 121.6 nm, which is FUV. So when it's redshifted, it moves into UV or visible.

Hmm, so the Lyman-alpha forest refers to absorption lines in quasar spectra caused by intervening neutral hydrogen clouds. But if the clouds are at a redshift z, the absorption is at 1216*(1+z) Ang. For ground-based telescopes to see this line, it has to be in the part of the spectrum that isn't blocked by the atmosphere.

Wait, ground-based telescopes can't observe wavelengths below about 300 nm (3000 Ang) because of atmospheric absorption. So the observed wavelength must be >= 3000 Ang. So the minimal z is when 1216*(1+z) = 3000 Ang.

So let's compute that:

1 + z = 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.466.

z ≈ 1.466.

So about 1.47. Looking back at the options, option D is 1.9, which is higher than 1.47. Option B is 1.2, which is lower.

Wait, but then the question says "lower limit on the redshift". So the minimal z is when the observed wavelength is just entering the observable range. So if the atmosphere blocks below 3000 Ang, then the minimal z is when 1216*(1+z) = 3000 Ang.

So z = (3000/1216) -1 ≈ 2.466 -1 =1.466. So z ≈1.47.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D)1.9, which is higher than 1.47. But none of the options is exactly 1.47. Alternatively, perhaps I'm considering the wrong cutoff.

Wait, maybe the cutoff is higher. Because some sources say that the atmospheric window for ground-based telescopes is about 3000 Ang and above. So the observed wavelength must be >= 3000 Ang. So the minimal z is when 1216*(1+z) =3000.

So z= (3000/1216) -1 ≈2.466 -1 =1.466.

So z≈1.47. So the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.47.

Looking at the options, the closest lower is B)1.2 and the next is D)1.9, which is higher.

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering that the optical telescopes can only see up to a certain wavelength, but the absorption line must be in the visible part, not just beyond 3000 Ang.

Because 3000 Ang is 300 nm, which is near UV, but perhaps the optical telescopes can't detect that. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the emission and the absorption. The quasar emits light at various wavelengths, including the Lyman-alpha line at 1216 Ang. The intervening neutral hydrogen clouds absorb this light at their own redshift. So the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z). For this to be in the optical range (visible light, about 400-700 nm), the wavelength must be in that range.

So the observed wavelength needs to be between 4000 and 7000 Ang. So the minimal z is when 1216*(1+z) =4000.

So z= (4000/1216) -1 ≈3.29 -1= 2.29.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the quasar is at a redshift higher than the cloud, but the cloud's redshift z is such that the Lyman-alpha absorption is in the optical. So the cloud is at z where 1216*(1+z) is in the optical.

So to find the minimal z where the observed wavelength is in optical, that's when 1216*(1+z) >=4000.

Which gives z >= (4000/1216) -1 ≈2.29.

So the minimal z is about 2.29.

But looking at the options, the closest higher is option C)2.4, and the next is option A)3.

Wait, but another thing: perhaps the question is about the Lyman-alpha forest, which is observed in quasar spectra. The Lyman-alpha forest consists of absorption lines blueward of the quasar's emission line. But if the quasar's emission is at a wavelength longer than the Lyman-alpha line due to its own redshift.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me try to structure the approach step by step.

1. The Lyman-alpha absorption occurs at 1216 Ang (rest frame of the cloud).
2. The observed wavelength is lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z_cloud).
3. For the absorption to be in the optical range (detectable by ground-based optical telescopes), lambda_obs must be between 4000 Ang (400 nm) and 7000 Ang (700 nm).
4. The question asks for the lower limit on z_cloud such that the absorption is still in the optical. So lambda_obs must be >=4000 Ang.

So, calculate z where lambda_obs =4000 Ang.

z = (4000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29.

So the minimal z is approximately 2.29. But the options are 1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3.

So 2.29 is closest to option C)2.4.

But wait, another consideration: the atmosphere also affects what we can observe. The ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths below about 3000 Ang due to atmospheric absorption (like by ozone). So if the observed wavelength is below 3000 Ang, it's not detectable.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So the observed wavelength must be >=3000 Ang for it to be seen by ground-based telescopes.

So, let's compute the minimal z such that lambda_obs >=3000 Ang.

lambda_obs = 1216*(1+z) >=3000.

So, 1+z >= 3000/1216 ≈2.466.

z >= 1.466.

So the lower limit is approximately 1.47.

Looking at the options, the options are 1.2, 1.9, 2.4,3.

So 1.47 would require z to be more than 1.47, so the minimal z is about 1.47. So the options given don't have exactly that, but the closest higher option is D)1.9.

Wait, but let me think again. If the observed wavelength must be >=3000 Ang to be detected, then the minimal z is when 1216*(1+z)=3000, so z= (3000/1216) -1 ≈1.466.

So the lower limit is z=1.466. So any cloud with z >=1.466 would have the absorption line in the detectable range. So the lower limit on z is about 1.47.

But none of the options are exactly that. The options are B)1.2 and D)1.9.

So the minimal z is about 1.47, so the answer would be the first option that is higher than this, which is D)1.9.

Wait, but the question asks for the lower limit. So the minimal redshift is 1.47. So any cloud at z >=1.47 can be detected. So the lower limit is 1.47. So the minimal z is about 1.47, which is not exactly an option, but perhaps the question expects the 4000 Ang threshold, leading to z≈2.29, which is not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me think about what the optical range is considered as. Maybe the optical is considered to start at 5000 Ang or higher? No, that can't be, because visible light is 400-700 nm.

Wait, let me see. Another approach: the Lyman-alpha line is at 1216 Ang. For it to be in the optical, it must have been redshifted beyond the Lyman break, which is about 912 Ang. Wait, no, that's the ionizing photon wavelength. Hmm, perhaps this isn't relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's light is being absorbed by the cloud. So the quasar's light at 1216 Ang is absorbed. But for that absorption to be in the optical, the quasar must have a redshift such that the cloud's absorption is in the optical.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the redshifts. Let me think about the cosmological redshift.

The quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So the quasar's light is redshifted, and any absorption caused by a cloud in front would imprint an absorption line at a wavelength that's between the quasar's redshift and the cloud's.

Wait, no. The cloud is at redshift z, and the quasar is at a higher redshift z_quasar. The Lyman-alpha emission from the quasar is at 1216*(1+z_quasar) Ang. But the cloud, at z, absorbs this light at 1216*(1+z_cloud) Ang. So the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z_cloud) Ang.

So for the absorption line to be in the optical, 4000 <= 1216*(1+z_cloud) <=7000.

Solving for the lower limit, 1216*(1+z_cloud) >=4000 → z_cloud >= (4000/1216) -1≈2.29.

But earlier I considered the atmospheric cutoff at 3000 Ang, which gives a lower z of 1.47. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, because the quasar's light is being absorbed by the cloud, and the absorption line is observed in the quasar's spectrum. So the quasar's spectrum is observed through the cloud, and the absorption line's wavelength must be in the part of the spectrum that is observed by the telescope. But the quasar's spectrum is also redshifted. So the quasar's light that we see is at longer wavelengths.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let me think again.

The quasar emits light, including the Lyman-alpha line at 1216 Ang. Light from the quasar passes through a cloud at redshift z, which absorbs at 1216*(1+z) Ang. The observed wavelength of that absorption line in our telescopes must be in the optical range (4000-7000 Ang) to be detected. So the condition is 1216*(1+z) >=4000 Ang and <=7000 Ang.

But the question is about the lower limit on z, so the smallest z for which 1216*(1+z) is >=4000.

As before, z >= (4000/1216) -1 ≈2.29.

But the options don't have 2.29. The closest is option C)2.4. So would the answer be C?

But wait, another point: why is the lower limit on the redshift? Because if the cloud is at a lower z, the absorption line would be at a shorter wavelength, possibly in the FUV or even UV, which can't be detected by ground-based optical telescopes.

So if the cloud is at z=1.2, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+1.2)=1216*2.2≈2675.2 Ang. Which is 2675 Ang, which is in the UV (since optical starts around 4000 Ang). So ground-based optical telescopes can't detect that.

But wait, no, because 2675 Ang is 267.5 nm, which is in the UV. Ground-based telescopes can't observe that because the atmosphere blocks it. So the lower limit would be when the observed wavelength is just entering the optical range, which is 4000 Ang.

So z must be >=2.29.

But again, the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is C)2.4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the Lyman break, which is at 912 Ang. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach. Let's think about the quasar's emission line. The quasar emits light at 1216 Ang. If the cloud is at redshift z, then the quasar's light we receive has the Lyman-alpha line redshifted by the quasar's redshift, say z_quasar. The cloud, at z_cloud, which is less than z_quasar, would absorb the quasar's Lyman-alpha emission at 1216*(1 + z_quasar) Ang. The absorption would appear at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Ang in the quasar's spectrum.

Wait, perhaps that's complicating it. Let me think: the quasar's Lyman-alpha emission is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). The cloud, at z_cloud, would absorb this at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in its own frame. But in our frame, the absorption line is observed at 1216*(1 + z_quasar) because the cloud is between us and the quasar. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Assuming the cloud is at redshift z, and the quasar is at redshift Z where Z > z. The Lyman-alpha emission from the quasar is at 1216*(1 + Z). The cloud, at z, would absorb this light. The absorption line would appear in our observed spectrum at 1216*(1 + z), because the cloud's effect is to absorb the quasar's light that was emitted at 1216 Ang, so in our frame, it's 1216*(1 + z).

Wait, no. I'm getting confused. Let me think about it as follows: the quasar emits light, including a Lyman-alpha photon at 1216 Ang. The photon then travels through space, passing through a cloud at redshift z. The cloud absorbs the photon if its rest wavelength is 1216 Ang. But since the photon has been redshifted due to the expansion of the universe, the cloud sees the photon's wavelength as 1216*(1 + z_cloud), because from the quasar's frame, the photon is at 1216*(1 + Z_quasar), but the cloud is at z_cloud, which is less than Z_quasar.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The photon's wavelength when it reaches the cloud is 1216 * (1 + Z_quasar), because the universe has expanded by a factor of (1 + Z_quasar) since the photon was emitted. So the cloud, which is at redshift z_cloud, would see the photon's wavelength as (1216 * (1 + Z_quasar)) / (1 + z_cloud) = 1216 * ( (1 + Z) / (1 + z) ), where Z is the quasar's redshift.

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. The photon's wavelength when it reaches the cloud is 1216 * (1 + Z_quasar). The cloud is at redshift z_cloud, so the photon's wavelength as seen by the cloud is 1216 * (1 + Z_quasar) / (1 + z_cloud).

Wait, this is getting complicated, but perhaps the correct formula is that the cloud absorbs the quasar's Lyman-alpha emission if the quasar's emission is at 1216*(1 + Z_quasar) = 1216*(1 + Z), and the cloud's frame sees this as 1216*(1 + Z) / (1 + z_cloud) = 1216. So, for the cloud to absorb the quasar's Lyman alpha, the quasar's emission must be at:

1216*(1 + Z) = 1216*(1 + z_cloud) → Z = z_cloud.

Wait, that can't be. Because the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to find another approach.

Wait, maybe the question is simpler. It says that the clouds absorb the quasar's light at Lyman alpha (1216 Ang), and we need to estimate the lower redshift z such that the absorption is in the optical (so that ground-based optical telescopes can detect it).

So, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z). We need this to be within the optical range, say >=4000 Ang.

So, 1216*(1 + z) >=4000 → (1 + z) >= 4000/1216 ≈3.29 → z >=2.29.

So the minimal z is about 2.29. So the closest option is C)2.4.

But wait, another thought: the quasar's light is redshifted. So if the cloud is at z, the quasar is at a higher z, say z_quasar = z_cloud + delta_z.

The Lyman-alpha absorption line from the cloud is observed at 1216*(1 + z_cloud).

So to be in the optical, that must be >=4000 Ang.

So, z >= (4000/1216) -1 ≈2.29.

So the answer should be C)2.4.

But wait, the options don't have 2.29. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the maximum redshift where the observed wavelength is <=7000 Ang. Then z <= (7000/1216)-1 ≈4.758. But the question is about the lower limit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is option C)2.4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To estimate the lower limit on the redshift \( z \) of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman-alpha absorption (at rest wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \)) is detectable by optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure that the observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) falls within the optical range. Optical wavelengths are approximately \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \) to \( 7000 \, \text{Å} \). The relationship between the observed wavelength and redshift is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

### Step 1: Determine the lower limit for \( z \)
For the absorption to be detectable, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) must be at least \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \), the lower bound of the optical range. Solving for \( z \):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = 4000 \, \text{Å} \implies 4000 = 1216 \cdot (1 + z)
\]

\[
1 + z = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29 \implies z \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the lower limit on \( z \) is approximately \( 2.29 \).

### Step 2: Consider atmospheric absorption
Ground-based optical telescopes cannot detect wavelengths shorter than approximately \( 3000 \, \text{Å} \) due to atmospheric absorption. If we instead consider \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 3000 \, \text{Å} \), the lower limit on \( z \) becomes:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = 3000 \, \text{Å} \implies 3000 = 1216 \cdot (1 + z)
\]

\[
1 + z = \frac{3000}{1216} \approx 2.466 \implies z \approx 2.466 - 1 = 1.466
\]

Thus, the lower limit on \( z \) would be approximately \( 1.47 \) if considering the atmospheric cutoff.

### Step 3: Compare with the options
The question specifies the lower limit on \( z \) such that the absorption is detectable. Using the stricter condition of \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 4000 \, \text{Å} \), the lower limit is \( z \approx 2.29 \). Among the given options, the closest higher value is \( z = 2.4 \) (option C). If the atmospheric cutoff at \( 3000 \, \text{Å} \) is considered, the lower limit is \( z \approx 1.47 \), but the closest higher option is \( z = 1.9 \) (option D). 

Since the question emphasizes detection in the optical range, the stricter condition of \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 4000 \, \text{Å} \) is more appropriate, making \( z = 2.4 \) the best answer.

### Final Answer:
The lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( 2.29 \), and the closest option is **C) 2.4**.

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of objects, specifically large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space, so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The absorption happens at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. So if these clouds are absorbing light at that wavelength, but we're using optical telescopes, which detect visible light, there's a problem. Because if the wavelength gets shifted into the optical range due to redshift, then maybe the absorption line would be in a part of the spectrum that optical telescopes can see. But wait, wait, no. Because if the wavelength is redshifted, the observed wavelength would be longer than 1216 Angstroms.

Wait, the question says that the clouds are absorbing the light at Lyman alpha, which is 1216 Angstroms. So that's the rest wavelength. The background quasars' light is getting absorbed at that wavelength. But for the absorption to be in the optical range (so that ground-based optical telescopes can detect it), the observed wavelength must be within the optical range. So how does that translate to redshift?

Optical wavelengths are roughly from about 400 to 700 nanometers, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So the Lyman alpha wavelength, when redshifted, must fall into this range. Because if it's redshifted beyond that, it would be in the infrared, which optical telescopes can't see.

So the formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1. So z = λ_obs / λ_rest - 1.

We need λ_obs >= 4000 Angstroms (since that's the lower end of optical). But wait, wait, higher redshift would mean a longer observed wavelength. So the minimum redshift is when the observed wavelength is as short as possible in the optical range. Wait, no. Wait, the quasar's emission is at 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud's redshift is z, then the absorption line would be at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. We need this to be in the optical range, which is up to about 7000 Angstroms. Wait, no. No, wait: optical is about 400-700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So the observed wavelength must be less than 7000 Angstroms because beyond that, it's infrared. Wait, no. Because if the observed wavelength is longer than 7000 Angstroms, it's in the IR, which optical telescopes can't see. So the maximum z would be when λ_obs is 7000. But the question is about the lower limit on redshift. Wait, no, the question says: the lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected. So the minimum z for which the absorption line is still in the optical.

Wait, but wait. The quasar's light is being absorbed at 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud is at a redshift z, then the absorption line is observed at 1216*(1 + z). For this to be in the optical range (so that it's detectable by optical telescopes), this observed wavelength must be less than or equal to 7000 Angstroms. Because if it's larger, it's in the IR and can't be detected with optical telescopes.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The quasar emits light across a broad spectrum, including the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud is at redshift z, then the Lyman alpha emission from the quasar is at 1216*(1 + z). We're looking for when that wavelength is in the optical range. So the optical range is roughly 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

So the observed wavelength λ_obs must satisfy 4000 ≤ λ_obs ≤ 7000. So λ_obs = 1216*(1 + z) must be ≥ 4000? Or wait, no. Wait, if the observed wavelength is longer than 7000, it's in the IR, which optical telescopes can't see. So the maximum z is when λ_obs is 7000. So 1216*(1 + z) ≤ 7000. Solving for z: (7000/1216) ≈ 5.758, so z ≈ 4.758. So the maximum z is about 4.76. But the question is about the lower limit. Wait, no, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected. So the minimum z would be when the observed wavelength is as small as possible in the optical. That would be 4000 Angstroms. So 1216*(1 + z) ≥ 4000. Let's compute that. 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29. So 1 + z = 3.29 → z ≈ 2.29. So the minimum redshift is about 2.29. But wait, the options don't have that exactly.

Looking at the options, the choices are A) 3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.29 is between 2.4 and 1.9, but closer to 2.4. Wait, but wait—maybe I'm making a mistake here. Because the quasar's emission is at 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud is at redshift z, then the quasar's Lyman alpha line is observed at 1216*(1 + z). But wait, the cloud is at redshift z, so the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud, right? Because the quasar's light passes through the cloud on its way to us. So the quasar's light is emitted and then gets absorbed by the cloud, which is between us and the quasar. So the quasar's redshift is higher than the cloud's redshift.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the quasar's redshift and the cloud's redshift. But the question is about the redshift of the cloud. So the cloud is at redshift z. The quasar is at a higher redshift, say z_quasar. The Lyman alpha emission from the quasar would be at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). But the cloud, being at z_cloud = z, would imprint an absorption line at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) on the quasar's spectrum. So the observed wavelength of that absorption line is 1216*(1 + z).

Wait, that's correct. So the absorption line's observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z). For this to be in the optical, it must be between 4000 and 7000 Angstroms.

So the minimum z is when 1216*(1 + z) is the smallest wavelength in the optical. That is, 4000 Angstroms.

So 1 + z = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29. So z ≈ 2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is a bit higher than 2.29. Option D is 1.9, which is lower. So the lower limit would be when the observed wavelength is 4000 Angstroms, so z ≈ 2.29. So the minimum redshift is about 2.3. But none of the options exactly match that. Wait, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm, so 2.29 is about 2.3, which is very close to option C)2.4. So perhaps the correct answer is C)2.4.

But wait, is the optical range starting at 4000 Angstroms (400 nm) or higher? Because if the optical starts at 4000 Angstroms, then the absorption line must be at least that. But if the optical range is more like starting at 5000 Angstroms (500 nm), then the calculation would be different.

Wait, maybe I should think about what's the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can detect. I think ground-based optical telescopes can detect up to about 700 nm (7000 Angstroms), but not beyond. So the Lyman alpha line, when redshifted, must be less than 7000 Angstroms to be in the optical. So the maximum z is (7000/1216) -1 ≈ 5.758 -1 =4.758. So any z less than that would have the absorption line in the optical.

But the question is about the lower limit on z. So the minimum z is when the absorption line is at the shortest wavelength in optical. But wait, no: the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z). If the cloud is at a higher redshift, the absorption line is at a longer wavelength. So the absorption line can't be shorter than 4000 Angstroms. So the minimum z is when 1216*(1+z) = 4000.

Wait, no, that gives the minimal redshift (since higher z makes λ_obs larger). Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify.

If z is lower, 1216*(1+z) would be smaller. So for the absorption line to be in the optical, the observed wavelength must be at least 4000 Angstroms. So when z is 0, the absorption is at 1216 Angstroms, which is in FUV, not visible. As z increases, the observed wavelength increases. So for the absorption line to be in the optical, the observed wavelength must be >=4000 Angstroms. Therefore, the minimal redshift is when 1216*(1 + z) = 4000.

So z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29. So z ≈2.29. So the lower limit on the redshift is about 2.29. So looking at the options, the closest higher value is 2.4 (option C). But wait, is there any consideration about the atmosphere blocking certain wavelengths?

Ah, right! The atmosphere is opaque to many wavelengths. The optical window allows certain wavelengths through. The atmospheric windows in the optical are roughly from about 300 nm (3000 Ang) to about 1000 nm (10,000 Ang), but the visible part is about 400-700 nm. Wait, so to detect the absorption line, it must be within this window. But more precisely, ground-based telescopes can't observe wavelengths shorter than about 300 nm because of atmospheric absorption (by ozone, etc.). So the Lyman alpha line, when redshifted, must be in the range that is observable, which is above 300 nm. Wait, but 1216 Ang is 121.6 nm, which is FUV. So when it's redshifted, it moves into UV or visible.

Hmm, so the Lyman-alpha forest refers to absorption lines in quasar spectra caused by intervening neutral hydrogen clouds. But if the clouds are at a redshift z, the absorption is at 1216*(1+z) Ang. For ground-based telescopes to see this line, it has to be in the part of the spectrum that isn't blocked by the atmosphere.

Wait, ground-based telescopes can't observe wavelengths below about 300 nm (3000 Ang) because of atmospheric absorption. So the observed wavelength must be >= 3000 Ang. So the minimal z is when 1216*(1+z) = 3000 Ang.

So let's compute that:

1 + z = 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.466.

z ≈ 1.466.

So about 1.47. Looking back at the options, option D is 1.9, which is higher than 1.47. Option B is 1.2, which is lower.

Wait, but then the question says "lower limit on the redshift". So the minimal z is when the observed wavelength is just entering the observable range. So if the atmosphere blocks below 3000 Ang, then the minimal z is when 1216*(1+z) = 3000 Ang.

So z = (3000/1216) -1 ≈ 2.466 -1 =1.466. So z ≈1.47.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D)1.9, which is higher than 1.47. But none of the options is exactly 1.47. Alternatively, perhaps I'm considering the wrong cutoff.

Wait, maybe the cutoff is higher. Because some sources say that the atmospheric window for ground-based telescopes is about 3000 Ang and above. So the observed wavelength must be >= 3000 Ang. So the minimal z is when 1216*(1+z) =3000.

So z= (3000/1216) -1 ≈2.466 -1 =1.466.

So z≈1.47. So the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.47.

Looking at the options, the closest lower is B)1.2 and the next is D)1.9, which is higher.

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering that the optical telescopes can only see up to a certain wavelength, but the absorption line must be in the visible part, not just beyond 3000 Ang.

Because 3000 Ang is 300 nm, which is near UV, but perhaps the optical telescopes can't detect that. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the emission and the absorption. The quasar emits light at various wavelengths, including the Lyman-alpha line at 1216 Ang. The intervening neutral hydrogen clouds absorb this light at their own redshift. So the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z). For this to be in the optical range (visible light, about 400-700 nm), the wavelength must be in that range.

So the observed wavelength needs to be between 4000 and 7000 Ang. So the minimal z is when 1216*(1+z) =4000.

So z= (4000/1216) -1 ≈3.29 -1= 2.29.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the quasar is at a redshift higher than the cloud, but the cloud's redshift z is such that the Lyman-alpha absorption is in the optical. So the cloud is at z where 1216*(1+z) is in the optical.

So to find the minimal z where the observed wavelength is in optical, that's when 1216*(1+z) >=4000.

Which gives z >= (4000/1216) -1 ≈2.29.

So the minimal z is about 2.29.

But looking at the options, the closest higher is option C)2.4, and the next is option A)3.

Wait, but another thing: perhaps the question is about the Lyman-alpha forest, which is observed in quasar spectra. The Lyman-alpha forest consists of absorption lines blueward of the quasar's emission line. But if the quasar's emission is at a wavelength longer than the Lyman-alpha line due to its own redshift.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me try to structure the approach step by step.

1. The Lyman-alpha absorption occurs at 1216 Ang (rest frame of the cloud).
2. The observed wavelength is lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z_cloud).
3. For the absorption to be in the optical range (detectable by ground-based optical telescopes), lambda_obs must be between 4000 Ang (400 nm) and 7000 Ang (700 nm).
4. The question asks for the lower limit on z_cloud such that the absorption is still in the optical. So lambda_obs must be >=4000 Ang.

So, calculate z where lambda_obs =4000 Ang.

z = (4000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29.

So the minimal z is approximately 2.29. But the options are 1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3.

So 2.29 is closest to option C)2.4.

But wait, another consideration: the atmosphere also affects what we can observe. The ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths below about 3000 Ang due to atmospheric absorption (like by ozone). So if the observed wavelength is below 3000 Ang, it's not detectable.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So the observed wavelength must be >=3000 Ang for it to be seen by ground-based telescopes.

So, let's compute the minimal z such that lambda_obs >=3000 Ang.

lambda_obs = 1216*(1+z) >=3000.

So, 1+z >= 3000/1216 ≈2.466.

z >= 1.466.

So the lower limit is approximately 1.47.

Looking at the options, the options are 1.2, 1.9, 2.4,3.

So 1.47 would require z to be more than 1.47, so the minimal z is about 1.47. So the options given don't have exactly that, but the closest higher option is D)1.9.

Wait, but let me think again. If the observed wavelength must be >=3000 Ang to be detected, then the minimal z is when 1216*(1+z)=3000, so z= (3000/1216) -1 ≈1.466.

So the lower limit is z=1.466. So any cloud with z >=1.466 would have the absorption line in the detectable range. So the lower limit on z is about 1.47.

But none of the options are exactly that. The options are B)1.2 and D)1.9.

So the minimal z is about 1.47, so the answer would be the first option that is higher than this, which is D)1.9.

Wait, but the question asks for the lower limit. So the minimal redshift is 1.47. So any cloud at z >=1.47 can be detected. So the lower limit is 1.47. So the minimal z is about 1.47, which is not exactly an option, but perhaps the question expects the 4000 Ang threshold, leading to z≈2.29, which is not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me think about what the optical range is considered as. Maybe the optical is considered to start at 5000 Ang or higher? No, that can't be, because visible light is 400-700 nm.

Wait, let me see. Another approach: the Lyman-alpha line is at 1216 Ang. For it to be in the optical, it must have been redshifted beyond the Lyman break, which is about 912 Ang. Wait, no, that's the ionizing photon wavelength. Hmm, perhaps this isn't relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's light is being absorbed by the cloud. So the quasar's light at 1216 Ang is absorbed. But for that absorption to be in the optical, the quasar must have a redshift such that the cloud's absorption is in the optical.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the redshifts. Let me think about the cosmological redshift.

The quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So the quasar's light is redshifted, and any absorption caused by a cloud in front would imprint an absorption line at a wavelength that's between the quasar's redshift and the cloud's.

Wait, no. The cloud is at redshift z, and the quasar is at a higher redshift z_quasar. The Lyman-alpha emission from the quasar is at 1216*(1+z_quasar) Ang. But the cloud, at z, absorbs this light at 1216*(1+z_cloud) Ang. So the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z_cloud) Ang.

So for the absorption line to be in the optical, 4000 <= 1216*(1+z_cloud) <=7000.

Solving for the lower limit, 1216*(1+z_cloud) >=4000 → z_cloud >= (4000/1216) -1≈2.29.

But earlier I considered the atmospheric cutoff at 3000 Ang, which gives a lower z of 1.47. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, because the quasar's light is being absorbed by the cloud, and the absorption line is observed in the quasar's spectrum. So the quasar's spectrum is observed through the cloud, and the absorption line's wavelength must be in the part of the spectrum that is observed by the telescope. But the quasar's spectrum is also redshifted. So the quasar's light that we see is at longer wavelengths.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let me think again.

The quasar emits light, including the Lyman-alpha line at 1216 Ang. Light from the quasar passes through a cloud at redshift z, which absorbs at 1216*(1+z) Ang. The observed wavelength of that absorption line in our telescopes must be in the optical range (4000-7000 Ang) to be detected. So the condition is 1216*(1+z) >=4000 Ang and <=7000 Ang.

But the question is about the lower limit on z, so the smallest z for which 1216*(1+z) is >=4000.

As before, z >= (4000/1216) -1 ≈2.29.

But the options don't have 2.29. The closest is option C)2.4. So would the answer be C?

But wait, another point: why is the lower limit on the redshift? Because if the cloud is at a lower z, the absorption line would be at a shorter wavelength, possibly in the FUV or even UV, which can't be detected by ground-based optical telescopes.

So if the cloud is at z=1.2, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+1.2)=1216*2.2≈2675.2 Ang. Which is 2675 Ang, which is in the UV (since optical starts around 4000 Ang). So ground-based optical telescopes can't detect that.

But wait, no, because 2675 Ang is 267.5 nm, which is in the UV. Ground-based telescopes can't observe that because the atmosphere blocks it. So the lower limit would be when the observed wavelength is just entering the optical range, which is 4000 Ang.

So z must be >=2.29.

But again, the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is C)2.4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the Lyman break, which is at 912 Ang. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach. Let's think about the quasar's emission line. The quasar emits light at 1216 Ang. If the cloud is at redshift z, then the quasar's light we receive has the Lyman-alpha line redshifted by the quasar's redshift, say z_quasar. The cloud, at z_cloud, which is less than z_quasar, would absorb the quasar's Lyman-alpha emission at 1216*(1 + z_quasar) Ang. The absorption would appear at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Ang in the quasar's spectrum.

Wait, perhaps that's complicating it. Let me think: the quasar's Lyman-alpha emission is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). The cloud, at z_cloud, would absorb this at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in its own frame. But in our frame, the absorption line is observed at 1216*(1 + z_quasar) because the cloud is between us and the quasar. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Assuming the cloud is at redshift z, and the quasar is at redshift Z where Z > z. The Lyman-alpha emission from the quasar is at 1216*(1 + Z). The cloud, at z, would absorb this light. The absorption line would appear in our observed spectrum at 1216*(1 + z), because the cloud's effect is to absorb the quasar's light that was emitted at 1216 Ang, so in our frame, it's 1216*(1 + z).

Wait, no. I'm getting confused. Let me think about it as follows: the quasar emits light, including a Lyman-alpha photon at 1216 Ang. The photon then travels through space, passing through a cloud at redshift z. The cloud absorbs the photon if its rest wavelength is 1216 Ang. But since the photon has been redshifted due to the expansion of the universe, the cloud sees the photon's wavelength as 1216*(1 + z_cloud), because from the quasar's frame, the photon is at 1216*(1 + Z_quasar), but the cloud is at z_cloud, which is less than Z_quasar.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The photon's wavelength when it reaches the cloud is 1216 * (1 + Z_quasar), because the universe has expanded by a factor of (1 + Z_quasar) since the photon was emitted. So the cloud, which is at redshift z_cloud, would see the photon's wavelength as (1216 * (1 + Z_quasar)) / (1 + z_cloud) = 1216 * ( (1 + Z) / (1 + z) ), where Z is the quasar's redshift.

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. The photon's wavelength when it reaches the cloud is 1216 * (1 + Z_quasar). The cloud is at redshift z_cloud, so the photon's wavelength as seen by the cloud is 1216 * (1 + Z_quasar) / (1 + z_cloud).

Wait, this is getting complicated, but perhaps the correct formula is that the cloud absorbs the quasar's Lyman-alpha emission if the quasar's emission is at 1216*(1 + Z_quasar) = 1216*(1 + Z), and the cloud's frame sees this as 1216*(1 + Z) / (1 + z_cloud) = 1216. So, for the cloud to absorb the quasar's Lyman alpha, the quasar's emission must be at:

1216*(1 + Z) = 1216*(1 + z_cloud) → Z = z_cloud.

Wait, that can't be. Because the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to find another approach.

Wait, maybe the question is simpler. It says that the clouds absorb the quasar's light at Lyman alpha (1216 Ang), and we need to estimate the lower redshift z such that the absorption is in the optical (so that ground-based optical telescopes can detect it).

So, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z). We need this to be within the optical range, say >=4000 Ang.

So, 1216*(1 + z) >=4000 → (1 + z) >= 4000/1216 ≈3.29 → z >=2.29.

So the minimal z is about 2.29. So the closest option is C)2.4.

But wait, another thought: the quasar's light is redshifted. So if the cloud is at z, the quasar is at a higher z, say z_quasar = z_cloud + delta_z.

The Lyman-alpha absorption line from the cloud is observed at 1216*(1 + z_cloud).

So to be in the optical, that must be >=4000 Ang.

So, z >= (4000/1216) -1 ≈2.29.

So the answer should be C)2.4.

But wait, the options don't have 2.29. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the maximum redshift where the observed wavelength is <=7000 Ang. Then z <= (7000/1216)-1 ≈4.758. But the question is about the lower limit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is option C)2.4.


To estimate the lower limit on the redshift \( z \) of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman-alpha absorption (at rest wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \)) is detectable by optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure that the observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) falls within the optical range. Optical wavelengths are approximately \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \) to \( 7000 \, \text{Å} \). The relationship between the observed wavelength and redshift is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

### Step 1: Determine the lower limit for \( z \)
For the absorption to be detectable, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) must be at least \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \), the lower bound of the optical range. Solving for \( z \):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = 4000 \, \text{Å} \implies 4000 = 1216 \cdot (1 + z)
\]

\[
1 + z = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29 \implies z \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the lower limit on \( z \) is approximately \( 2.29 \).

### Step 2: Consider atmospheric absorption
Ground-based optical telescopes cannot detect wavelengths shorter than approximately \( 3000 \, \text{Å} \) due to atmospheric absorption. If we instead consider \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 3000 \, \text{Å} \), the lower limit on \( z \) becomes:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = 3000 \, \text{Å} \implies 3000 = 1216 \cdot (1 + z)
\]

\[
1 + z = \frac{3000}{1216} \approx 2.466 \implies z \approx 2.466 - 1 = 1.466
\]

Thus, the lower limit on \( z \) would be approximately \( 1.47 \) if considering the atmospheric cutoff.

### Step 3: Compare with the options
The question specifies the lower limit on \( z \) such that the absorption is detectable. Using the stricter condition of \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 4000 \, \text{Å} \), the lower limit is \( z \approx 2.29 \). Among the given options, the closest higher value is \( z = 2.4 \) (option C). If the atmospheric cutoff at \( 3000 \, \text{Å} \) is considered, the lower limit is \( z \approx 1.47 \), but the closest higher option is \( z = 1.9 \) (option D). 

Since the question emphasizes detection in the optical range, the stricter condition of \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 4000 \, \text{Å} \) is more appropriate, making \( z = 2.4 \) the best answer.

### Final Answer:
The lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( 2.29 \), and the closest option is **C) 2.4**.

Answer: C
