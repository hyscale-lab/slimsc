Okay, so I have this physics problem here about magnetic fields and energy levels in a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis. And it's a paramagnetic coupling term compared to the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen with a specific wavelength. The options are about whether the expectation value of H (which I assume is the Hamiltonian) is much bigger, much smaller, or about the same as ΔE.

Wait, wait. So, I remember that in atoms, the energy levels can be split due to various factors. One of them is the Zeeman effect, which is when an external magnetic field causes the splitting. But this is about paramagnetic coupling. Oh right, paramagnetism involves the magnetic interaction of electrons with an external magnetic field.

The paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is probably the Zeeman term. The Zeeman energy is given by something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment for an electron is μ = -g * μ_B * m_s * ħ, right? Or wait, I think the orbital magnetic moment is different. Oh wait, the orbital part is μ_orbital = m_l * μ_B, but I'm not too sure. Wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is m, so for small m, maybe we can approximate something.

But the problem states small values of m, so perhaps m is 0, 1, or 2? Since m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, its magnitude can't be more than l, and l for hydrogen can be 0,1,2,... So small m might mean m is close to 0. So the orbital contribution might be small.

Wait, but the paramagnetic coupling term is probably the Zeeman term. So the energy shift due to the magnetic field is the expectation value of this Zeeman Hamiltonian.

The transition energy ΔE is given by the wavelength λ. I can find ΔE from the wavelength. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So let's compute that. The given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers. Wait, 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters, so 0.4861e-6 m.

So E_photon = hc/(0.4861e-6 m). Let me remember h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s. And c is 3e8 m/s. So hc is about 1.986e-25 J·m.

Let me compute E_photon: (1.986e-25 J·m) / (0.4861e-6 m) ≈ (1.986 / 0.4861) * 1e-19 J. 1.986 / 0.4861 is roughly about 4.1, so E_photon ≈ 4.1e-19 J. Wait, but wait, I can also convert that into eV because often atomic energies are discussed in eV. 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 4.1e-19 J is approximately 4.1 /1.602 ≈ 2.56 eV. Hmm, but wait, the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two states, so I think that's about right. For hydrogen, the Lyman series is about 10-100 eV, but wait no, wait the Balmer series is around 3 eV. Oh right, the Balmer-alpha line is about 1.89 eV, but wait I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe I should just compute it accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Rydberg constant. The Rydberg energy is about 13.6 eV, but that's the ionization energy. The Balmer series corresponds to transitions ending at n=2. So for example, the transition from n=3 to n=2 gives a wavelength about 656 nm (which is 0.656 micrometers), but the given wavelength here is 0.4861 micrometers, which is about 486 nm. I think that's the Balmer-beta line, which is n=4 to n=2. Let me check: the formula is 1/λ = R*(1/4 - 1/2)^2 = R*(1/4 - 1/2)^2 = R*(1/4 - 1/2)= R*(-1/4), so squared is 1/16. So 1/λ = R*(1/16), so λ=16/(R). The Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e4 m^-1. So 16/(1.097e4) ≈ 1.458e-3 m, which is 1458 nm. Hmm, that's not matching. Maybe I'm getting the transitions wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the given wavelength is for a different transition, but perhaps I don't need to get too bogged down here. The calculation I did earlier gives ΔE ≈ 2.56 eV.

Wait, but wait, the energy levels in hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n^2. So for n=2, E is -3.4 eV. For n=3, it's about -1.51 eV. The transition from n=3 to n=2 would give ΔE = E_2 - E_3 = (-3.4) - (-1.51) = -1.89 eV, but the energy of the photon would be positive, so 1.89 eV. So our wavelength calculation should match that. Let me compute 1.89 eV to wavelength. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1.89 eV is 1.89 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.026e-19 J. Then λ = hc/E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.026e-19) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (3.026e-19) ≈ 6.57e-7 m, which is 657 nm. But the given wavelength is 486 nm. Hmm, so perhaps the transition is from n=5 to n=2 for Balmer, which would give a higher energy. Wait, n=5 to n=2: 1/λ = R*(1/4 - 1/25) = R*( (25 -4)/100 )= R*(21/100) = 0.21 R. So λ=1/(0.21 R) ≈ 1/(0.21 * 1.097e4) ≈ 1/(2.304e3) ≈ 4.34e-4 m, which is 434 nm, close to 486. Wait, maybe the transition is n=5 to n=4? Because 486 nm is the Balmer-beta line, which is n=4 to n=2. Oh wait, I think I messed up earlier. The Balmer-beta line is indeed n=4 → n=2. Let me recompute.

Compute the wavelength for transition from n=4 to n=2. 1/λ = R*(1/2^2 - 1/4^2) = R*(1/4 - 1/16) = R*( (4 -1)/16 )= (3/16) R. So λ = 16/(3 R). Plugging R=1.097e4 m^-1, so 16/(3*1.097e4) ≈ 16/(3.291e4) ≈ 4.86e-4 m, which is 486 nm. So yeah, the transition is from n=4 to n=2, giving ΔE of 3.4 - 1.51 = 1.89 eV? Wait no, wait E_n is negative, so E_2 is -3.4 eV, E_4 is -0.875 eV (since 13.6/16 is 0.85, so E_4 is -0.85 eV approx). So the energy difference is E_4 - E_2 = (-0.85) - (-3.4) = 2.55 eV. So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Okay, so ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV.

Now the paramagnetic coupling term. The paramagnetic term is the Zeeman energy. For an atom in a magnetic field, the energy shift is given by H_Zeeman = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * μ_B * m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. Wait, but wait, orbital magnetic moment would be μ_orbital = (e/(2m_e)) * ħ * m_l, which is μ_B * m_l, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, but in the question, the magnetic field is applied, and we're looking at the paramagnetic coupling term. I think this refers to the Zeeman effect, which splits the energy levels based on the magnetic quantum number m. For hydrogen, the ground state has l=0, so m=0, but higher states have l>0.

Wait, but the problem says small values of m. So perhaps m is 0, 1, or -1. Let's think about the energy shift.

The Zeeman energy is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m. Because the expectation value of H is ⟨H⟩ = ⟨μ·B⟩ = μ_B * B * m, since μ = μ_B m for the orbital part, perhaps. Wait, no, the orbital magnetic moment is μ = m_l * μ_B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So for an electron in a state with orbital quantum number l, the magnetic quantum number m can be -l, ..., +l.

So the energy shift is ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m. But wait, wait, I think the actual formula is ΔE = μ_B * B * m, where m can be up to l. So for small m, say m=0, the shift is zero. For m=1, the shift is μ_B * B * 1.

What's the value of μ_B? The Bohr magneton is about 9.274e-24 J/T. So for B=1 T, the shift is 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * m. But m is small, like m=0,1,2?

Wait, but in hydrogen, for the 2p state (n=2, l=1), m can be -1, 0, +1. So for m=1, ΔE is about 9.274e-24 J. I need to convert that to eV because ΔE is 2.55 eV. Let me compute 9.274e-24 J in eV. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV.

So ΔE_Zeeman ≈ 5.8e-5 eV. Now compare this to ΔE of 2.55 eV. So the Zeeman term is about 5.8e-5 eV, and the transition energy is about 2.55 eV. So the Zeeman term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait, the paramagnetic term could also involve spin-orbit coupling? Or is that a different effect? Hmm, paramagnetic coupling can also include spin effects. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the orbital contribution.

Wait, but for hydrogen, since it has only one electron, the orbital magnetic moment is μ_B * m, and the spin magnetic moment is g_s * μ_B * m_s, where g_s is about 2. So for spin-up, m_s=1/2, so the spin contribution is about 2 * μ_B * (1/2) = μ_B.

So the total magnetic moment would be μ = μ_orbital + μ_spin. But in the presence of a magnetic field, perhaps the dominant term is the spin one. But the problem states that it's the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the Zeeman term. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, but in any case, the orbital contribution for m=1 and B=1 T gives a shift of about 5.8e-5 eV, which is way smaller than 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

So the expectation value <H> is the Zeeman term, which is about 5.8e-5 eV, which is much less than ΔE of 2.55 eV. So <H> << ΔE.

Looking at the options, option C is "<H>llΔE". So the correct answer would be C.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term (Zeeman energy shift) with the transition energy \( \Delta E \) of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Transition Energy \( \Delta E \):**  
   The wavelength of the transition is \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu \text{m} = 4.861 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), the energy of the photon is:  
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{4.861 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 4.1 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx \frac{4.1 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.56 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (Zeeman Energy):**  
   The Zeeman energy shift is given by \( \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m \), where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \), and \( m \) is the magnetic quantum number. For small values of \( m \) (e.g., \( m = 1 \)), the shift is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Comparison:**  
   The transition energy \( \Delta E \approx 2.56 \, \text{eV} \) is significantly larger than the Zeeman energy shift \( \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   The expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy \( \Delta E \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about magnetic fields and energy levels in a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down.

So E_photon = hc/(0.4861e-6 m). Let me remember h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s. And c is 3e8 m/s. So hc is about 1.986e-25 J·m.

Let me compute E_photon: (1.986e-25 J·m) / (0.4861e-6 m) ≈ (1.986 / 0.4861) * 1e-19 J. 1.986 / 0.4861 is roughly about 4.1, so E_photon ≈ 4.1e-19 J. Wait, but wait, I can also convert that into eV because often atomic energies are discussed in eV. 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 4.1e-19 J is approximately 4.1 /1.602 ≈ 2.56 eV. Hmm, but wait, the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two states, so I think that's about right. For hydrogen, the Lyman series is about 10-100 eV, but wait no, wait the Balmer series is around 3 eV. Oh right, the Balmer-alpha line is about 1.89 eV, but wait I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe I should just compute it accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Rydberg constant. The Rydberg energy is about 13.6 eV, but that's the ionization energy. The Balmer series corresponds to transitions ending at n=2. So for example, the transition from n=3 to n=2 gives a wavelength about 656 nm (which is 0.656 micrometers), but the given wavelength here is 0.4861 micrometers, which is about 486 nm. I think that's the Balmer-beta line, which is n=4 to n=2. Let me check: the formula is 1/λ = R*(1/4 - 1/2)^2 = R*(1/4 - 1/2)^2 = R*(1/4 - 1/2)= R*(-1/4), so squared is 1/16. So 1/λ = R*(1/16), so λ=16/(R). The Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e4 m^-1. So 16/(1.097e4) ≈ 1.458e-3 m, which is 1458 nm. Hmm, that's not matching. Maybe I'm getting the transitions wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the given wavelength is for a different transition, but perhaps I don't need to get too bogged down here. The calculation I did earlier gives ΔE ≈ 2.56 eV.

Wait, but wait, the energy levels in hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n^2. So for n=2, E is -3.4 eV. For n=3, it's about -1.51 eV. The transition from n=3 to n=2 would give ΔE = E_2 - E_3 = (-3.4) - (-1.51) = -1.89 eV, but the energy of the photon would be positive, so 1.89 eV. So our wavelength calculation should match that. Let me compute 1.89 eV to wavelength. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1.89 eV is 1.89 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.026e-19 J. Then λ = hc/E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.026e-19) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (3.026e-19) ≈ 6.57e-7 m, which is 657 nm. But the given wavelength is 486 nm. Hmm, so perhaps the transition is from n=5 to n=2 for Balmer, which would give a higher energy. Wait, n=5 to n=2: 1/λ = R*(1/4 - 1/25) = R*( (25 -4)/100 )= R*(21/100) = 0.21 R. So λ=1/(0.21 R) ≈ 1/(0.21 * 1.097e4) ≈ 1/(2.304e3) ≈ 4.34e-4 m, which is 434 nm, close to 486. Wait, maybe the transition is n=5 to n=4? Because 486 nm is the Balmer-beta line, which is n=4 to n=2. Oh wait, I think I messed up earlier. The Balmer-beta line is indeed n=4 → n=2. Let me recompute.

Compute the wavelength for transition from n=4 to n=2. 1/λ = R*(1/2^2 - 1/4^2) = R*(1/4 - 1/16) = R*( (4 -1)/16 )= (3/16) R. So λ = 16/(3 R). Plugging R=1.097e4 m^-1, so 16/(3*1.097e4) ≈ 16/(3.291e4) ≈ 4.86e-4 m, which is 486 nm. So yeah, the transition is from n=4 to n=2, giving ΔE of 3.4 - 1.51 = 1.89 eV? Wait no, wait E_n is negative, so E_2 is -3.4 eV, E_4 is -0.875 eV (since 13.6/16 is 0.85, so E_4 is -0.85 eV approx). So the energy difference is E_4 - E_2 = (-0.85) - (-3.4) = 2.55 eV. So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Okay, so ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV.

Now the paramagnetic coupling term. The paramagnetic term is the Zeeman energy. For an atom in a magnetic field, the energy shift is given by H_Zeeman = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * μ_B * m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. Wait, but wait, orbital magnetic moment would be μ_orbital = (e/(2m_e)) * ħ * m_l, which is μ_B * m_l, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, but in the question, the magnetic field is applied, and we're looking at the paramagnetic coupling term. I think this refers to the Zeeman effect, which splits the energy levels based on the magnetic quantum number m. For hydrogen, the ground state has l=0, so m=0, but higher states have l>0.

Wait, but the problem says small values of m. So perhaps m is 0, 1, or -1. Let's think about the energy shift.

The Zeeman energy is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m. Because the expectation value of H is ⟨H⟩ = ⟨μ·B⟩ = μ_B * B * m, since μ = μ_B m for the orbital part, perhaps. Wait, no, the orbital magnetic moment is μ = m_l * μ_B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So for an electron in a state with orbital quantum number l, the magnetic quantum number m can be -l, ..., +l.

So the energy shift is ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m. But wait, wait, I think the actual formula is ΔE = μ_B * B * m, where m can be up to l. So for small m, say m=0, the shift is zero. For m=1, the shift is μ_B * B * 1.

What's the value of μ_B? The Bohr magneton is about 9.274e-24 J/T. So for B=1 T, the shift is 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * m. But m is small, like m=0,1,2?

Wait, but in hydrogen, for the 2p state (n=2, l=1), m can be -1, 0, +1. So for m=1, ΔE is about 9.274e-24 J. I need to convert that to eV because ΔE is 2.55 eV. Let me compute 9.274e-24 J in eV. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV.

So ΔE_Zeeman ≈ 5.8e-5 eV. Now compare this to ΔE of 2.55 eV. So the Zeeman term is about 5.8e-5 eV, and the transition energy is about 2.55 eV. So the Zeeman term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait, the paramagnetic term could also involve spin-orbit coupling? Or is that a different effect? Hmm, paramagnetic coupling can also include spin effects. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the orbital contribution.

Wait, but for hydrogen, since it has only one electron, the orbital magnetic moment is μ_B * m, and the spin magnetic moment is g_s * μ_B * m_s, where g_s is about 2. So for spin-up, m_s=1/2, so the spin contribution is about 2 * μ_B * (1/2) = μ_B.

So the total magnetic moment would be μ = μ_orbital + μ_spin. But in the presence of a magnetic field, perhaps the dominant term is the spin one. But the problem states that it's the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the Zeeman term. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, but in any case, the orbital contribution for m=1 and B=1 T gives a shift of about 5.8e-5 eV, which is way smaller than 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

So the expectation value <H> is the Zeeman term, which is about 5.8e-5 eV, which is much less than ΔE of 2.55 eV. So <H> << ΔE.

Looking at the options, option C is "<H>llΔE". So the correct answer would be C.

   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{4.861 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 4.1 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx \frac{4.1 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.56 \, \text{eV}.

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (Zeeman Energy):**  
   The Zeeman energy shift is given by \( \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m \), where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \), and \( m \) is the magnetic quantum number. For small values of \( m \) (e.g., \( m = 1 \)), the shift is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.

   Converting to electron volts:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
