Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. It's about particles being collided in a detector and their Lorentz factor. Hmm, Lorentz factor is related to relativity, right? Yeah, it's gamma, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Got it.

The problem says that when particles collide, they produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reaches the detector's inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead.

Wait, so the initial situation is that only a third make it, and we need to find the gamma that would let two-thirds make it. I'm thinking this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls and whether they decay before that time. Because if they decay quickly, they won't reach the walls. So the particles with higher gamma would have a longer lifetime due to time dilation, allowing more of them to reach the walls.

Right, so the key here is the proper lifetime of the particles. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But from our lab frame (the detector's frame), the lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime. So if the particles live longer (because gamma increases), more of them will reach the detector walls before decaying.

So the initial condition is gamma_initial = 20, and one third reach the walls. The setup is that the decay probability depends on the time available. The number of particles that decay before reaching the wall is determined by the ratio of the time it takes to reach the wall (t) and the mean lifetime (tau) in the lab frame.

Wait, wait. The particles are moving at a speed close to c, so the time they take to reach the wall is t = R / v. Since gamma is high, beta is approximately 1, so v ≈ c. So t ≈ R / c. R is 30 meters, so t = 30 / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds? Because 3e8 m/s is the speed of light. Yeah, 30 divided by 3e8 is 1e-7 seconds. So t is about 1e-7 s.

Now, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest. So the particles' lifetime is tau_lab = gamma * tau. The probability that a particle doesn't decay before reaching the wall is exp(-t/tau_lab). So the fraction that reach the wall is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, because the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-t/tau_lab), which is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

So in the initial case, gamma is 20, and the fraction reaching the wall is 1/3. So:

1/3 = exp(-t/(20 tau)).

We need to find the gamma where 2/3 reach the wall. So:

2/3 = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

But wait, the t is the same in both cases because the detector radius is fixed. So the same t is used for both expressions.

Let me write the initial equation first:

1/3 = exp(-t/(20 tau)).

Take natural logs of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau).

Which simplifies to:

- ln(3) = - t/(20 tau).

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3) = t/(20 tau).

So, tau = t/(20 ln(3)).

Now, for the desired case, the fraction is 2/3:

2/3 = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Take ln of both sides:

ln(2/3) = - t/(gamma tau).

Multiply both sides by -1:

- ln(2/3) = t/(gamma tau).

Which is the same as ln(3/2) = t/(gamma tau).

But from earlier, tau = t/(20 ln(3)).

Substitute tau into the equation:

ln(3/2) = t/(gamma * (t/(20 ln(3)))) )

Simplify denominator:

gamma * (t/(20 ln(3))) = gamma * t / (20 ln(3)).

So the equation becomes:

ln(3/2) = t * 20 ln(3) / (gamma t).

The t's cancel out:

ln(3/2) = (20 ln(3)) / gamma.

Solve for gamma:

gamma = (20 ln(3)) / ln(3/2).

Wait, let me compute that.

First, compute ln(3) and ln(3/2). Let me think, ln(3) ≈ 1.0986, ln(3/2) is ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055.

So,

gamma ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055.

Compute numerator: 20 * 1.0986 ≈ 21.972.

Divide by 0.4055: 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ approximately 54.16.

So gamma is about 54.

Looking at the options, option A is 54. So the answer should be A.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the particles' lifetime and the time it takes for them to travel through the detector. The particles are ultra-relativistic, and their lifetime in the lab frame is given by $\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau_{\text{rest}}$, where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor and $\tau_{\text{rest}}$ is the proper lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The probability that a particle reaches the detector walls without decaying is $P = \exp(-t / \tau_{\text{lab}})$, where $t$ is the time it takes for the particle to travel through the detector.

### Step 1: Time to travel through the detector
The detector's radius is $R = 30 \, \text{m}$, and the particles travel at a speed close to $c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$. The time to travel through the detector is:
\[
t = \frac{R}{v} \approx \frac{R}{c} = \frac{30}{3 \times 10^8} = 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Initial condition
For the initial Lorentz factor $\gamma_{\text{initial}} = 20$, one-third of the particles reach the walls. This gives:
\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{initial}} \tau_{\text{rest}}}\right).
\]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{initial}} \tau_{\text{rest}}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\ln(3) = \frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{initial}} \tau_{\text{rest}}}.
\]
Rearranging for $\tau_{\text{rest}}$:
\[
\tau_{\text{rest}} = \frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{initial}} \ln(3)}.
\]

### Step 3: Desired condition
For the desired Lorentz factor $\gamma$, two-thirds of the particles reach the walls:
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau_{\text{rest}}}\right).
\]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma \tau_{\text{rest}}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{t}{\gamma \tau_{\text{rest}}}.
\]

### Step 4: Solve for $\gamma$
From Step 2, $\tau_{\text{rest}} = \frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{initial}} \ln(3)}$. Substituting this into the equation for $\gamma$:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{t}{\gamma \cdot \frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{initial}} \ln(3)}}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{\gamma_{\text{initial}} \ln(3)}{\gamma}.
\]
Solving for $\gamma$:
\[
\gamma = \frac{\gamma_{\text{initial}} \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

### Step 5: Numerical calculation
Using $\ln(3) \approx 1.0986$ and $\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055$:
\[
\gamma = \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.16.
\]

### Final Answer
The Lorentz factor needed is approximately $54$. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. It's about particles being collided in a detector and their Lorentz factor. Hmm, Lorentz factor is related to relativity, right? Yeah, it's gamma, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Got it.

The problem says that when particles collide, they produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reaches the detector's inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead.

Wait, so the initial situation is that only a third make it, and we need to find the gamma that would let two-thirds make it. I'm thinking this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls and whether they decay before that time. Because if they decay quickly, they won't reach the walls. So the particles with higher gamma would have a longer lifetime due to time dilation, allowing more of them to reach the walls.

Right, so the key here is the proper lifetime of the particles. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But from our lab frame (the detector's frame), the lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime. So if the particles live longer (because gamma increases), more of them will reach the detector walls before decaying.

So the initial condition is gamma_initial = 20, and one third reach the walls. The setup is that the decay probability depends on the time available. The number of particles that decay before reaching the wall is determined by the ratio of the time it takes to reach the wall (t) and the mean lifetime (tau) in the lab frame.

Wait, wait. The particles are moving at a speed close to c, so the time they take to reach the wall is t = R / v. Since gamma is high, beta is approximately 1, so v ≈ c. So t ≈ R / c. R is 30 meters, so t = 30 / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds? Because 3e8 m/s is the speed of light. Yeah, 30 divided by 3e8 is 1e-7 seconds. So t is about 1e-7 s.

Now, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest. So the particles' lifetime is tau_lab = gamma * tau. The probability that a particle doesn't decay before reaching the wall is exp(-t/tau_lab). So the fraction that reach the wall is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, because the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-t/tau_lab), which is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

So in the initial case, gamma is 20, and the fraction reaching the wall is 1/3. So:

1/3 = exp(-t/(20 tau)).

We need to find the gamma where 2/3 reach the wall. So:

2/3 = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

But wait, the t is the same in both cases because the detector radius is fixed. So the same t is used for both expressions.

Let me write the initial equation first:

1/3 = exp(-t/(20 tau)).

Take natural logs of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau).

Which simplifies to:

- ln(3) = - t/(20 tau).

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3) = t/(20 tau).

So, tau = t/(20 ln(3)).

Now, for the desired case, the fraction is 2/3:

2/3 = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Take ln of both sides:

ln(2/3) = - t/(gamma tau).

Multiply both sides by -1:

- ln(2/3) = t/(gamma tau).

Which is the same as ln(3/2) = t/(gamma tau).

But from earlier, tau = t/(20 ln(3)).

Substitute tau into the equation:

ln(3/2) = t/(gamma * (t/(20 ln(3)))) )

Simplify denominator:

gamma * (t/(20 ln(3))) = gamma * t / (20 ln(3)).

So the equation becomes:

ln(3/2) = t * 20 ln(3) / (gamma t).

The t's cancel out:

ln(3/2) = (20 ln(3)) / gamma.

Solve for gamma:

gamma = (20 ln(3)) / ln(3/2).

Wait, let me compute that.

First, compute ln(3) and ln(3/2). Let me think, ln(3) ≈ 1.0986, ln(3/2) is ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055.

So,

gamma ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055.

Compute numerator: 20 * 1.0986 ≈ 21.972.

Divide by 0.4055: 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ approximately 54.16.

So gamma is about 54.

Looking at the options, option A is 54. So the answer should be A.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the particles' lifetime and the time it takes for them to travel through the detector. The particles are ultra-relativistic, and their lifetime in the lab frame is given by $\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau_{\text{rest}}$, where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor and $\tau_{\text{rest}}$ is the proper lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The probability that a particle reaches the detector walls without decaying is $P = \exp(-t / \tau_{\text{lab}})$, where $t$ is the time it takes for the particle to travel through the detector.

### Step 1: Time to travel through the detector
The detector's radius is $R = 30 \, \text{m}$, and the particles travel at a speed close to $c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$. The time to travel through the detector is:
\[
t = \frac{R}{v} \approx \frac{R}{c} = \frac{30}{3 \times 10^8} = 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Initial condition
For the initial Lorentz factor $\gamma_{\text{initial}} = 20$, one-third of the particles reach the walls. This gives:
\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{initial}} \tau_{\text{rest}}}\right).
\]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{initial}} \tau_{\text{rest}}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\ln(3) = \frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{initial}} \tau_{\text{rest}}}.
\]
Rearranging for $\tau_{\text{rest}}$:
\[
\tau_{\text{rest}} = \frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{initial}} \ln(3)}.
\]

### Step 3: Desired condition
For the desired Lorentz factor $\gamma$, two-thirds of the particles reach the walls:
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau_{\text{rest}}}\right).
\]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma \tau_{\text{rest}}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{t}{\gamma \tau_{\text{rest}}}.
\]

### Step 4: Solve for $\gamma$
From Step 2, $\tau_{\text{rest}} = \frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{initial}} \ln(3)}$. Substituting this into the equation for $\gamma$:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{t}{\gamma \cdot \frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{initial}} \ln(3)}}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{\gamma_{\text{initial}} \ln(3)}{\gamma}.
\]
Solving for $\gamma$:
\[
\gamma = \frac{\gamma_{\text{initial}} \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

### Step 5: Numerical calculation
Using $\ln(3) \approx 1.0986$ and $\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055$:
\[
\gamma = \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.16.
\]

### Final Answer
The Lorentz factor needed is approximately $54$. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
