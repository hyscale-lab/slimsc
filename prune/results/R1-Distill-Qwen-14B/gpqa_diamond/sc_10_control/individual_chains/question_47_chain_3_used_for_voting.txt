Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which compound it is based on the spectral data. Let me take it step by step. 

The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 9, H is 11, N is 1, O is 2. Plugging in: 2*9 +2 =20. 20 -11 -1 (since N is 1, and I think each N is subtracted as one) + 2 (for O? Or wait, no, O doesn't count in this formula). Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, right. So X is halogens, but here there are none. So (2*9 +2 -11 - 0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (which is 4, since it's three double bonds in the ring) plus a double bond or an amide or something else. Or maybe a benzene ring plus an ester group, which has a carbonyl.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually N-H stretches. So maybe an amide or an amine. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide. 

The 1H NMR data: 
- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That's probably a CH2CH3 group. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, like in an ethyl group (CH2CH3). So maybe an ethyl ester or something else with an ethyl chain.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Hmm, broad singlet could be either NH protons or maybe some other exchangeable protons. Since in the IR we saw N-H stretches, this might be an NH2 group, but wait, if it's a singlet and broad, maybe it's adjacent to something. Wait, but in the options, some have amines or amides.

-4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet with 2H. Usually, a quartet could be CH2 next to another CH2. If the ethyl group is at 1.2 ppm as triplet, then the quartet at 4.5 could be the adjacent CH2. Like, in an ester group, the ethyl would be OCH2CH3. Wait, but wait: the ethyl ester would have the OCH2CH3. So the CH2 adjacent to O would be a quartet because it's next to the CH2CH3. So 4.5 quartet (2H) could be OCH2, and the triplet at 1.2 is CH2CH3. So that suggests an ethyl group attached via oxygen, like an ester.

Now, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets each integrating for 2H. This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and each couple with the adjacent two, giving a doublet. So the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions.

Wait, but looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Benzamide would have an amide group attached at position 3. But the substituents would be ethoxy at 3 and amide at another position? Or wait, benzamide is an amide group attached to benzene. So 3-ethoxybenzamide would have ethoxy at position 3 and amide at position 1? Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the benzamide group is at position 3, but I'm not sure.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Formamide is HCONH2, but when attached as N-substituted, it would have the formamide group attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be OCH2CH3 (ethyl ether) at position 4, and the formamide group (which is an amide) at another position. Wait, but the substituents would be ethoxy at position 4 and formamide at position 1? Or maybe the ethoxy is at position 4 and formamide is attached to the benzene ring, making the substituents in the para positions.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be PhNH2 attached to a propionyl group. Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: benzene (C6H5), then NH2 (from 4-aminophenyl), then propionate (CH2CH2COO-). So the structure would be PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be PhNH-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the propionate is as the ester. Wait, let me think: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNHCO-OCH2CH2CH3? Or maybe Ph-NH-CO-O-(CH2)2CH3? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's the amine attached to the benzene, and the propionate is the ester. Hmm.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Benzoate ester. So the benzene ring has an amino group and a benzoate ester. Wait, no, benzoate is the COOEt group. So the structure would be 4-aminophenyl benzoate ester. Wait, no. Wait, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be the ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So the structure would be PhNH2COOEt. So the substituents on benzene are NH2 and COOEt, in para positions. That would explain the aromatic signals being two doublets (because para substituents cause each set of H to be a doublet).

Wait, let's go back to the NMR. The aromatic region is two doublets each 2H. So the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions. That's either two groups in para, or a single substituent that's a di-substituted group, but I think more likely two substituents in para.

Looking at the options, option D has 4-aminobenzoate ester. So benzene has an amino group at position 4 and a COOEt group at position 1 (since it's benzoate). So that would make the substituents at positions 1 and 4. Wait, 1 and para would be position 4—no, wait, in para, substituents are at positions 1 and 4. So the ring would have substituents at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). So the benzene ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. Then the H's on the ring would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, no, if substituents are at 1 and 4, the H's would be at 2,3,5,6. For a para-substituted benzene, the H's would be in two pairs: the two ortho to substituent A and two meta to substituent B. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the splitting.

Alternatively, considering option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is:

O
||
O-C-OEt

attached to the benzene ring at position 1, and NH2 at position 4. So the ring has substituents in positions 1 and 4. Then, the H's on the ring would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Let me think about their chemical shifts.

In the NMR, the aromatic signals are at 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). For a para-substituted benzene with two groups, perhaps the substituents are electron-withdrawing and electron-donating. The amino group is strongly activating (NH2 is activating) and the ester group (COOEt) is deactivating (electron-withdrawing). So the H's ortho to NH2 would be less deshielded (lower ppm), while those ortho to COOEt would be more deshielded (higher ppm).

Wait, but in para substitution, the NH2 and COOEt are opposite each other. So the H's adjacent to NH2 (positions 2 and 6) would be ortho to NH2, and the H's adjacent to COOEt (positions 3 and 5) would be ortho to COOEt. 

The NH2 is a strong activating group, so the H's ortho and para to it would be more shielded (appear upfield). The COOEt is deactivating, so the H's ortho to it would be more deshielded (downfield, higher ppm).

So the H's ortho to NH2 (positions 2 and 6) would be more upfield, perhaps around 7.0 ppm as a doublet. The H's ortho to COOEt (positions 3 and 5) would be more downfield, maybe around 8.0 ppm as a doublet. That fits the NMR data exactly: 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d,2H). So that would make sense for option D.

Let me consider the other options. 

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C6H5CONH2. So 3-ethoxy would be OCH2CH3 at position 3. So substituents at 3 and the amide at another position, maybe 1? So the substituents would be in meta positions. The aromatic protons would not be in two doublets but perhaps as a triplet or other splitting. So the NMR would show more complex splitting than two doublets. So probably not this option.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide group is HCONH- attached to the benzene ring. So substituents at 4 (ethoxy) and the formamide at another position. Wait, but if the formamide is attached at position 1, then the substituents would be at 1 and 4, which are para. So the aromatic H's would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Then, the H's ortho to formamide (positions 2 and 6) would be near an electron-withdrawing group (formamide is deactivating), so their shifts would be downfield. The H's ortho to ethoxy (positions 3 and 5) would be upfield because ethoxy is activating. So maybe the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm would correspond to the formamide and ethoxy's H's. But wait, the formamide is an amide, which is a stronger deactivating group than ethoxy. So the H's near formamide would be more downfield than those near ethoxy. So maybe the 8.0 ppm would be for the H's next to formamide, and 7.0 for those next to ethoxy. That would match the NMR. But then, what about the other NMR signals?

The IR has strong N-H stretches, which would be for the amide. So for option B, the HCONH- group is present, so there would be N-H stretching. The 1H NMR shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). Wait, in this case, the formamide would have NH protons. Are they showing up as a broad peak? Alternatively, the ethoxy group's CH2 would be a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is what we have. The ethoxy's OCH2CH3 would have the triplet at 1.2 ppm and quartet at 4.5. So that fits. The NH in formamide would be exchange broadened, perhaps at around 4.0 ppm. Or wait, formamide's NH is typically around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak. Hmm, but the NMR given shows a singlet at 4.0 ppm. Maybe it's not the NH but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the N in the formamide isn't showing up because it's deprotonated, but I'm not sure. So this option might not fit the NMR data, especially the 4.0 ppm peak. 

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure would be PhNH2 attached to a propionate group. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure might be PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, but that would be an amide, not an ester. Or is it PhNH-COO-CH2CH2CH3? If so, then the propionate would be the ester group. So the structure is PhNH-COO-R, where R is propyl. But wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count: benzene (6C) + NH (1C?), wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, 4-aminophenyl propionate could be the amine attached to the benzene, and the propionate as an ester. So the structure would be PhNH2-COO-R. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the formula:

Ph (C6H5) + NH2 (C0H2N) + propionate (CH2CH2COO-). So the formula would be C6 + (COOEt?), but I'm not sure. Maybe the molecular formula is correct, but let's check.

The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's see:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O=C(OEt)-PhNH2. So:

Ph (C6H5) has 6 C, COOEt is (COOCH2CH3), which is 3 C. NH2 is 1 N. So total C:6+3=9. H: for Ph is 5 H (since COOEt is attached at position 1, so loses one H). Then, COOEt has (CH2CH3) which is 3 H in that group. Wait, no, the ester group is O-C-OEt. The Et is CH2CH3. So for the ethyl ester, the Et group has 5 H (two in CH2 and three in CH3). Wait, no. The ester group is O-C-OEt. So the ethyl is OCH2CH3. So in the structure, the H's are:

PhNH2COOEt: Ph has 5 H, the NH2 has 2 H, the OEt has 5 H (OCH2CH3). So let's count:

Ph (5 H) + NH2 (2 H) + OCH2CH3 (5 H) + any others? Wait, the COOEt doesn't add any H beyond the OEt. So total H would be 5 +2 +5 =12? But the formula is C9H11NO2. Wait, that's only 11 H. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the molecular formula of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is C8H9NO2. Wait, wait, let's calculate:

Benzoate is C7H5O2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but when it's the ester, it's C7H5O2 plus the ethyl group. Wait, no. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Its ethyl ester would be C7H5O2 + C2H5 (from ethyl), so the ester is C9H10O2. But with the NH2 group, the formula would be C9H11NO2. Because the amine adds one N and a H. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the structure is PhNH2COOEt. So each component:

Ph (C6H5) → 6 C, 5 H.

COOEt → COOCH2CH3 → 3 C, 5 H (from CH2 and CH3).

NH2 → 1 N, 2 H.

Total C:6 + 3=9.

H:5 (Ph) +5 (OEt) +2 (NH2) =12. But the compound is C9H11NO2. So 12 H. Hmm, that's a problem. The formula given is C9H11NO2, which has 11 H. So maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is PhNHCOOEt. Wait, no, that would make it a substituted amide, not an ester. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, let's check the other options.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 at position 4, and formamide (HCONH-) at another position. So HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3? Wait, but formamide would be HCONH2 attached to the benzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 (formamide) and 4 (ethoxy). So the structure is 4-ethoxyphenyl formamide. So the formula would be:

Ph (6 C) + HCONH2 (which is 2 O, 1 C, 3 N?) Wait, no, formamide is HCONH2. So each formamide is 2 O, 1 C (the carbonyl C), and 2 N. Wait, no, formamide is HCONH2: that's (CH=O), so molecular formula is C=O and NH2. So the molecular formula for the compound would be:

Ph (C6H5) + HCONH2 (C2H3NO) → but wait, HCONH2 is C=O plus NH2. So the formula would be C6H5 + C(O)NH2. So the total would be C7H7NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't match. Therefore, option B is probably not the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the molecular formula. Let me think again.

The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Benzoate is C7H5O2 (from benzoic acid C7H6O2, losing one H when esterified). The ethyl group is C2H5. So the ester would be C7H5O2 + C2H5, making C9H10O2. But the compound has an NH2 group, so adding NH2 (which is 1 N and 2 H) would make the formula C9H12NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, this seems to have an extra H. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait. The structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is:

Benzoate ester: the benzoic acid is C6H5COOH. When esterified with ethanol, it becomes C6H5COOEt (C7H5O2 + C2H5O2? No, wait, the ester is formed by replacing the -OH of benzoic acid with OEt. So benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Esterification replaces H from COOH with Et, so the ester becomes C7H6O2 - H + C2H5 → C9H10O2. Then, adding the NH2 group: the benzoate becomes 4-aminophenyl benzoate? No, perhaps it's 4-amino attached to the benzoate.

Wait, perhaps the actual structure is PhNHCOOEt. Wait, no, that would be a substituted amide. Alternatively, it's PhNH2COOEt? I'm getting a bit stuck on the molecular formula here. Let me compute the molecular formula for each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Benzamide is C7H7NO. So 3-ethoxy would add an ethoxy group (C2H3O). So the formula would be C9H10NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So this doesn't match. Hmm.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Ph is C6H5. Formamide is HCONH2. So the formula would be C7H7NO2. Plus ethoxy (C2H5O) → total C9H12O3. No, that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

PhNH2 is C6H5NH2 (C7H7N). Propionate is C3H5O2 (since it's CH2CH2COO-). So the ester would be PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that would be C6 + 1 (NH2) +3 (COOCH2CH2CH3) → C10? Wait, no. Let me count:

Ph (6 C) + NH2 (1 C in COO? No, wait, the propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the ester is OCOO- attached to CH2CH2CH3. So the structure is PhN(COOCH2CH2CH3)H? No, perhaps it's PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3. So the formula would be:

Ph (6 C) + NH (1 C) + COOCH2CH2CH3 (3 C and 3 O). So 6 +1 +3=10 C? But the given formula is C9. Hmm, so that's not matching. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's PhNH2 attached to a propionyl group (CH2CH2COO-) as an ester. So the structure is PhNH2-COO-R, where R is ethyl or something else. But without knowing the exact structure, this is confusing.

Let me get back to the NMR data. The aromatic region is two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Looking at all the options, only option D has substituents in the para positions: ethyl ester and amino group. But earlier calculation of the molecular formula gave me some confusion. Let's recalculate option D's formula.

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: the structure is O=C(OEt)-PhNH2. So:

Benzoate ester part: C7H5O2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, esterification replaces one H with OEt, which is C2H5O. So the benzoate would be C7H5O2 (from C7H6O2 losing one H). Then, adding the amino group (NH2): each NH2 adds one N and two H. So the full formula is:

C7 (from benzoate) + C2 (from ethyl) = C9.

Hydrogens: benzoate ester has 5 H (Ph), COOEt has 5 H (OCH2CH3). The amino group adds 2 H. So 5 +5 +2 =12 H. But the formula is C9H11NO2. So this would give 12 H, but the compound has 11. Hmm, discrepancy.

Wait, maybe the benzoate ester has 4 H. Let me think again. The benzoate ester is C6H5COOEt. So the benzene ring contributes 5 H (since one H is replaced by the COOEt group). The COOEt group is O-CO-OEt. The Et is CH2CH3, which contributes 5 H (two in CH2 and three in CH3). So 5 (Ph) +5 (Et) =10 H. Then, the amino group (NH2) adds 2 H → total 12 H. So formula would be C9H12O2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's one H off. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the amino group is in the para position to the COOEt. So maybe the structure is 4-aminophenyl benzoate. Wait, no, that would be an extra ring. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me think: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be the ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. 4-aminobenzoic acid is C7H7NO2. Its ethyl ester would replace the -OH with OEt, so the formula becomes C9H11NO2. Because 4-aminobenzoic acid is C7H7NO2 (7 C, 7 H, 1 N, 2 O). Esterifying replaces -OH (which is one H) with OEt (C2H5O). So the formula becomes C7 + C2 = C9. H: 7 -1 (from -OH) +5 (from OEt) → 7-1=6, 6+5=11 H. So the ester would be C9H11NO2. Which matches the given formula. So option D's formula is correct.

So with that, the NMR data fits option D. The 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) is the OCH2 group of the ethyl ester, the 1.20 ppm triplet is the CH2CH3. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) is the NH2 group. Wait, but NH2 protons are usually broad, but where would they appear? Amines typically show up around 1-5 ppm, but more upfield. But in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, which could be the NH2 protons. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is exchange broadened and not visible, but that's less likely.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR data, the 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. That's consistent with an NH2 group. So that would fit with option D, which has an NH2 group attached to the benzene.

So putting it all together, the IR shows N-H stretches (amide or amine), a carbonyl (ester or amide). The NMR shows the ethyl group and the aromatic protons in para positions. The only option that fits all of this is option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound has the molecular formula **C9H11NO2**, and the spectral data provided includes IR and 1H NMR. Here's the analysis:

### **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**
The degree of unsaturation is calculated as:

\[
\text{Degree of Unsaturation} = \frac{2C + 2 - H - X + N}{2} = \frac{2(9) + 2 - 11 - 0 + 1}{2} = 5
\]

This indicates the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees of unsaturation) and an additional degree from a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide.

---

### **IR Analysis**
- **Medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These are indicative of N-H stretches, suggesting the presence of an amide or amine.
- **Strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹**: This is characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide.

---

### **1H NMR Analysis**
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating for 3H, consistent with a CH2CH3 group (ethyl group).
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating for 2H, likely corresponding to NH2 protons.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating for 2H, consistent with a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen atom (e.g., OCH2 in an ethyl ester).
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating for 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.

---

### **Option Analysis**
#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- This compound has an ethoxy group at position 3 and an amide group at position 1. However, this would result in a meta-substituted benzene ring, which would not produce the observed NMR signals of two doublets (para substitution). 
- **Eliminated** due to incorrect splitting pattern.

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- This compound has an ethoxy group at position 4 and a formamide group at position 1. The para-substitution pattern matches the NMR data, but the formamide group would typically show NH protons at higher chemical shifts (8–9 ppm), not at 4.0 ppm. Additionally, the molecular formula does not match **C9H11NO2**.
- **Eliminated** due to mismatched NMR data and molecular formula.

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- This compound has an amino group at position 4 and a propionate ester group. However, the propionate group would introduce additional splitting in the NMR, inconsistent with the observed data. The molecular formula also does not match **C9H11NO2**.
- **Eliminated** due to mismatched NMR data and molecular formula.

#### **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- This compound has an amino group at position 4 and an ethyl ester group at position 1. The para-substitution pattern matches the NMR data (two doublets for the aromatic protons). The ethyl group explains the triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH2CH3) and the quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2). The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm corresponds to the NH2 protons. The molecular formula **C9H11NO2** is also consistent with this structure.
- **Matches all spectral data and molecular formula**.

---

### **Conclusion**
The compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which compound it is based on the spectral data. Let me take it step by step. 

The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 9, H is 11, N is 1, O is 2. Plugging in: 2*9 +2 =20. 20 -11 -1 (since N is 1, and I think each N is subtracted as one) + 2 (for O? Or wait, no, O doesn't count in this formula). Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, right. So X is halogens, but here there are none. So (2*9 +2 -11 - 0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (which is 4, since it's three double bonds in the ring) plus a double bond or an amide or something else. Or maybe a benzene ring plus an ester group, which has a carbonyl.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually N-H stretches. So maybe an amide or an amine. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide. 

The 1H NMR data: 
- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That's probably a CH2CH3 group. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, like in an ethyl group (CH2CH3). So maybe an ethyl ester or something else with an ethyl chain.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Hmm, broad singlet could be either NH protons or maybe some other exchangeable protons. Since in the IR we saw N-H stretches, this might be an NH2 group, but wait, if it's a singlet and broad, maybe it's adjacent to something. Wait, but in the options, some have amines or amides.

-4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet with 2H. Usually, a quartet could be CH2 next to another CH2. If the ethyl group is at 1.2 ppm as triplet, then the quartet at 4.5 could be the adjacent CH2. Like, in an ester group, the ethyl would be OCH2CH3. Wait, but wait: the ethyl ester would have the OCH2CH3. So the CH2 adjacent to O would be a quartet because it's next to the CH2CH3. So 4.5 quartet (2H) could be OCH2, and the triplet at 1.2 is CH2CH3. So that suggests an ethyl group attached via oxygen, like an ester.

Now, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets each integrating for 2H. This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and each couple with the adjacent two, giving a doublet. So the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions.

Wait, but looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Benzamide would have an amide group attached at position 3. But the substituents would be ethoxy at 3 and amide at another position? Or wait, benzamide is an amide group attached to benzene. So 3-ethoxybenzamide would have ethoxy at position 3 and amide at position 1? Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the benzamide group is at position 3, but I'm not sure.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Formamide is HCONH2, but when attached as N-substituted, it would have the formamide group attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be OCH2CH3 (ethyl ether) at position 4, and the formamide group (which is an amide) at another position. Wait, but the substituents would be ethoxy at position 4 and formamide at position 1? Or maybe the ethoxy is at position 4 and formamide is attached to the benzene ring, making the substituents in the para positions.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be PhNH2 attached to a propionyl group. Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: benzene (C6H5), then NH2 (from 4-aminophenyl), then propionate (CH2CH2COO-). So the structure would be PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be PhNH-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the propionate is as the ester. Wait, let me think: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNHCO-OCH2CH2CH3? Or maybe Ph-NH-CO-O-(CH2)2CH3? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's the amine attached to the benzene, and the propionate is the ester. Hmm.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Benzoate ester. So the benzene ring has an amino group and a benzoate ester. Wait, no, benzoate is the COOEt group. So the structure would be 4-aminophenyl benzoate ester. Wait, no. Wait, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be the ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So the structure would be PhNH2COOEt. So the substituents on benzene are NH2 and COOEt, in para positions. That would explain the aromatic signals being two doublets (because para substituents cause each set of H to be a doublet).

Wait, let's go back to the NMR. The aromatic region is two doublets each 2H. So the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions. That's either two groups in para, or a single substituent that's a di-substituted group, but I think more likely two substituents in para.

Looking at the options, option D has 4-aminobenzoate ester. So benzene has an amino group at position 4 and a COOEt group at position 1 (since it's benzoate). So that would make the substituents at positions 1 and 4. Wait, 1 and para would be position 4—no, wait, in para, substituents are at positions 1 and 4. So the ring would have substituents at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). So the benzene ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. Then the H's on the ring would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, no, if substituents are at 1 and 4, the H's would be at 2,3,5,6. For a para-substituted benzene, the H's would be in two pairs: the two ortho to substituent A and two meta to substituent B. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the splitting.

Alternatively, considering option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is:

O
||
O-C-OEt

attached to the benzene ring at position 1, and NH2 at position 4. So the ring has substituents in positions 1 and 4. Then, the H's on the ring would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Let me think about their chemical shifts.

In the NMR, the aromatic signals are at 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). For a para-substituted benzene with two groups, perhaps the substituents are electron-withdrawing and electron-donating. The amino group is strongly activating (NH2 is activating) and the ester group (COOEt) is deactivating (electron-withdrawing). So the H's ortho to NH2 would be less deshielded (lower ppm), while those ortho to COOEt would be more deshielded (higher ppm).

Wait, but in para substitution, the NH2 and COOEt are opposite each other. So the H's adjacent to NH2 (positions 2 and 6) would be ortho to NH2, and the H's adjacent to COOEt (positions 3 and 5) would be ortho to COOEt. 

The NH2 is a strong activating group, so the H's ortho and para to it would be more shielded (appear upfield). The COOEt is deactivating, so the H's ortho to it would be more deshielded (downfield, higher ppm).

So the H's ortho to NH2 (positions 2 and 6) would be more upfield, perhaps around 7.0 ppm as a doublet. The H's ortho to COOEt (positions 3 and 5) would be more downfield, maybe around 8.0 ppm as a doublet. That fits the NMR data exactly: 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d,2H). So that would make sense for option D.

Let me consider the other options. 

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C6H5CONH2. So 3-ethoxy would be OCH2CH3 at position 3. So substituents at 3 and the amide at another position, maybe 1? So the substituents would be in meta positions. The aromatic protons would not be in two doublets but perhaps as a triplet or other splitting. So the NMR would show more complex splitting than two doublets. So probably not this option.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide group is HCONH- attached to the benzene ring. So substituents at 4 (ethoxy) and the formamide at another position. Wait, but if the formamide is attached at position 1, then the substituents would be at 1 and 4, which are para. So the aromatic H's would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Then, the H's ortho to formamide (positions 2 and 6) would be near an electron-withdrawing group (formamide is deactivating), so their shifts would be downfield. The H's ortho to ethoxy (positions 3 and 5) would be upfield because ethoxy is activating. So maybe the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm would correspond to the formamide and ethoxy's H's. But wait, the formamide is an amide, which is a stronger deactivating group than ethoxy. So the H's near formamide would be more downfield than those near ethoxy. So maybe the 8.0 ppm would be for the H's next to formamide, and 7.0 for those next to ethoxy. That would match the NMR. But then, what about the other NMR signals?

The IR has strong N-H stretches, which would be for the amide. So for option B, the HCONH- group is present, so there would be N-H stretching. The 1H NMR shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). Wait, in this case, the formamide would have NH protons. Are they showing up as a broad peak? Alternatively, the ethoxy group's CH2 would be a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is what we have. The ethoxy's OCH2CH3 would have the triplet at 1.2 ppm and quartet at 4.5. So that fits. The NH in formamide would be exchange broadened, perhaps at around 4.0 ppm. Or wait, formamide's NH is typically around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak. Hmm, but the NMR given shows a singlet at 4.0 ppm. Maybe it's not the NH but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the N in the formamide isn't showing up because it's deprotonated, but I'm not sure. So this option might not fit the NMR data, especially the 4.0 ppm peak. 

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure would be PhNH2 attached to a propionate group. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure might be PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, but that would be an amide, not an ester. Or is it PhNH-COO-CH2CH2CH3? If so, then the propionate would be the ester group. So the structure is PhNH-COO-R, where R is propyl. But wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count: benzene (6C) + NH (1C?), wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, 4-aminophenyl propionate could be the amine attached to the benzene, and the propionate as an ester. So the structure would be PhNH2-COO-R. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the formula:

Ph (C6H5) + NH2 (C0H2N) + propionate (CH2CH2COO-). So the formula would be C6 + (COOEt?), but I'm not sure. Maybe the molecular formula is correct, but let's check.

The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's see:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O=C(OEt)-PhNH2. So:

Ph (C6H5) has 6 C, COOEt is (COOCH2CH3), which is 3 C. NH2 is 1 N. So total C:6+3=9. H: for Ph is 5 H (since COOEt is attached at position 1, so loses one H). Then, COOEt has (CH2CH3) which is 3 H in that group. Wait, no, the ester group is O-C-OEt. The Et is CH2CH3. So for the ethyl ester, the Et group has 5 H (two in CH2 and three in CH3). Wait, no. The ester group is O-C-OEt. So the ethyl is OCH2CH3. So in the structure, the H's are:

PhNH2COOEt: Ph has 5 H, the NH2 has 2 H, the OEt has 5 H (OCH2CH3). So let's count:

Ph (5 H) + NH2 (2 H) + OCH2CH3 (5 H) + any others? Wait, the COOEt doesn't add any H beyond the OEt. So total H would be 5 +2 +5 =12? But the formula is C9H11NO2. Wait, that's only 11 H. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the molecular formula of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is C8H9NO2. Wait, wait, let's calculate:

Benzoate is C7H5O2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but when it's the ester, it's C7H5O2 plus the ethyl group. Wait, no. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Its ethyl ester would be C7H5O2 + C2H5 (from ethyl), so the ester is C9H10O2. But with the NH2 group, the formula would be C9H11NO2. Because the amine adds one N and a H. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the structure is PhNH2COOEt. So each component:

Ph (C6H5) → 6 C, 5 H.

COOEt → COOCH2CH3 → 3 C, 5 H (from CH2 and CH3).

NH2 → 1 N, 2 H.

Total C:6 + 3=9.

H:5 (Ph) +5 (OEt) +2 (NH2) =12. But the compound is C9H11NO2. So 12 H. Hmm, that's a problem. The formula given is C9H11NO2, which has 11 H. So maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is PhNHCOOEt. Wait, no, that would make it a substituted amide, not an ester. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, let's check the other options.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 at position 4, and formamide (HCONH-) at another position. So HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3? Wait, but formamide would be HCONH2 attached to the benzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 (formamide) and 4 (ethoxy). So the structure is 4-ethoxyphenyl formamide. So the formula would be:

Ph (6 C) + HCONH2 (which is 2 O, 1 C, 3 N?) Wait, no, formamide is HCONH2. So each formamide is 2 O, 1 C (the carbonyl C), and 2 N. Wait, no, formamide is HCONH2: that's (CH=O), so molecular formula is C=O and NH2. So the molecular formula for the compound would be:

Ph (C6H5) + HCONH2 (C2H3NO) → but wait, HCONH2 is C=O plus NH2. So the formula would be C6H5 + C(O)NH2. So the total would be C7H7NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't match. Therefore, option B is probably not the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the molecular formula. Let me think again.

The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Benzoate is C7H5O2 (from benzoic acid C7H6O2, losing one H when esterified). The ethyl group is C2H5. So the ester would be C7H5O2 + C2H5, making C9H10O2. But the compound has an NH2 group, so adding NH2 (which is 1 N and 2 H) would make the formula C9H12NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, this seems to have an extra H. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait. The structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is:

Benzoate ester: the benzoic acid is C6H5COOH. When esterified with ethanol, it becomes C6H5COOEt (C7H5O2 + C2H5O2? No, wait, the ester is formed by replacing the -OH of benzoic acid with OEt. So benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Esterification replaces H from COOH with Et, so the ester becomes C7H6O2 - H + C2H5 → C9H10O2. Then, adding the NH2 group: the benzoate becomes 4-aminophenyl benzoate? No, perhaps it's 4-amino attached to the benzoate.

Wait, perhaps the actual structure is PhNHCOOEt. Wait, no, that would be a substituted amide. Alternatively, it's PhNH2COOEt? I'm getting a bit stuck on the molecular formula here. Let me compute the molecular formula for each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Benzamide is C7H7NO. So 3-ethoxy would add an ethoxy group (C2H3O). So the formula would be C9H10NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So this doesn't match. Hmm.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Ph is C6H5. Formamide is HCONH2. So the formula would be C7H7NO2. Plus ethoxy (C2H5O) → total C9H12O3. No, that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

PhNH2 is C6H5NH2 (C7H7N). Propionate is C3H5O2 (since it's CH2CH2COO-). So the ester would be PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that would be C6 + 1 (NH2) +3 (COOCH2CH2CH3) → C10? Wait, no. Let me count:

Ph (6 C) + NH2 (1 C in COO? No, wait, the propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the ester is OCOO- attached to CH2CH2CH3. So the structure is PhN(COOCH2CH2CH3)H? No, perhaps it's PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3. So the formula would be:

Ph (6 C) + NH (1 C) + COOCH2CH2CH3 (3 C and 3 O). So 6 +1 +3=10 C? But the given formula is C9. Hmm, so that's not matching. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's PhNH2 attached to a propionyl group (CH2CH2COO-) as an ester. So the structure is PhNH2-COO-R, where R is ethyl or something else. But without knowing the exact structure, this is confusing.

Let me get back to the NMR data. The aromatic region is two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Looking at all the options, only option D has substituents in the para positions: ethyl ester and amino group. But earlier calculation of the molecular formula gave me some confusion. Let's recalculate option D's formula.

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: the structure is O=C(OEt)-PhNH2. So:

Benzoate ester part: C7H5O2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, esterification replaces one H with OEt, which is C2H5O. So the benzoate would be C7H5O2 (from C7H6O2 losing one H). Then, adding the amino group (NH2): each NH2 adds one N and two H. So the full formula is:

C7 (from benzoate) + C2 (from ethyl) = C9.

Hydrogens: benzoate ester has 5 H (Ph), COOEt has 5 H (OCH2CH3). The amino group adds 2 H. So 5 +5 +2 =12 H. But the formula is C9H11NO2. So this would give 12 H, but the compound has 11. Hmm, discrepancy.

Wait, maybe the benzoate ester has 4 H. Let me think again. The benzoate ester is C6H5COOEt. So the benzene ring contributes 5 H (since one H is replaced by the COOEt group). The COOEt group is O-CO-OEt. The Et is CH2CH3, which contributes 5 H (two in CH2 and three in CH3). So 5 (Ph) +5 (Et) =10 H. Then, the amino group (NH2) adds 2 H → total 12 H. So formula would be C9H12O2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's one H off. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the amino group is in the para position to the COOEt. So maybe the structure is 4-aminophenyl benzoate. Wait, no, that would be an extra ring. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me think: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be the ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. 4-aminobenzoic acid is C7H7NO2. Its ethyl ester would replace the -OH with OEt, so the formula becomes C9H11NO2. Because 4-aminobenzoic acid is C7H7NO2 (7 C, 7 H, 1 N, 2 O). Esterifying replaces -OH (which is one H) with OEt (C2H5O). So the formula becomes C7 + C2 = C9. H: 7 -1 (from -OH) +5 (from OEt) → 7-1=6, 6+5=11 H. So the ester would be C9H11NO2. Which matches the given formula. So option D's formula is correct.

So with that, the NMR data fits option D. The 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) is the OCH2 group of the ethyl ester, the 1.20 ppm triplet is the CH2CH3. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) is the NH2 group. Wait, but NH2 protons are usually broad, but where would they appear? Amines typically show up around 1-5 ppm, but more upfield. But in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, which could be the NH2 protons. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is exchange broadened and not visible, but that's less likely.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR data, the 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. That's consistent with an NH2 group. So that would fit with option D, which has an NH2 group attached to the benzene.

So putting it all together, the IR shows N-H stretches (amide or amine), a carbonyl (ester or amide). The NMR shows the ethyl group and the aromatic protons in para positions. The only option that fits all of this is option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.


The compound has the molecular formula **C9H11NO2**, and the spectral data provided includes IR and 1H NMR. Here's the analysis:

### **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**
The degree of unsaturation is calculated as:

\[
\text{Degree of Unsaturation} = \frac{2C + 2 - H - X + N}{2} = \frac{2(9) + 2 - 11 - 0 + 1}{2} = 5
\]

This indicates the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees of unsaturation) and an additional degree from a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide.

---

### **IR Analysis**
- **Medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These are indicative of N-H stretches, suggesting the presence of an amide or amine.
- **Strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹**: This is characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide.

---

### **1H NMR Analysis**
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating for 3H, consistent with a CH2CH3 group (ethyl group).
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating for 2H, likely corresponding to NH2 protons.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating for 2H, consistent with a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen atom (e.g., OCH2 in an ethyl ester).
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating for 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.

---

### **Option Analysis**
#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- This compound has an ethoxy group at position 3 and an amide group at position 1. However, this would result in a meta-substituted benzene ring, which would not produce the observed NMR signals of two doublets (para substitution). 
- **Eliminated** due to incorrect splitting pattern.

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- This compound has an ethoxy group at position 4 and a formamide group at position 1. The para-substitution pattern matches the NMR data, but the formamide group would typically show NH protons at higher chemical shifts (8–9 ppm), not at 4.0 ppm. Additionally, the molecular formula does not match **C9H11NO2**.
- **Eliminated** due to mismatched NMR data and molecular formula.

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- This compound has an amino group at position 4 and a propionate ester group. However, the propionate group would introduce additional splitting in the NMR, inconsistent with the observed data. The molecular formula also does not match **C9H11NO2**.
- **Eliminated** due to mismatched NMR data and molecular formula.

#### **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- This compound has an amino group at position 4 and an ethyl ester group at position 1. The para-substitution pattern matches the NMR data (two doublets for the aromatic protons). The ethyl group explains the triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH2CH3) and the quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2). The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm corresponds to the NH2 protons. The molecular formula **C9H11NO2** is also consistent with this structure.
- **Matches all spectral data and molecular formula**.

### **Conclusion**
The compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.
