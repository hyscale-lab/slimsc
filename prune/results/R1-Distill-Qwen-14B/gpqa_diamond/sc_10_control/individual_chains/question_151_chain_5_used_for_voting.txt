Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that doesn't look normalized. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors. So the first thing I should probably do is normalize this state.

The observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). I need to find the probability that measuring this observable yields 0.

Wait a second, the question is about the probability of getting a certain outcome when measuring an observable. So in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the observable's matrix, and the probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state vector and the corresponding eigenvector.

But wait, wait. The observable matrix P is given. So first, I need to find its eigenvalues because the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues. Then, the probability of measuring 0 would be the squared magnitude of the component of the state vector in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Alternatively, perhaps P is a projection operator, but looking at P's structure, I'm not sure. Let me look closer.

Wait, let me think again. The observable P is a matrix, and when you measure it, you get one of its eigenvalues. So to find the probability that the measurement yields 0, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then compute the inner product of the state with each of these eigenvectors, and square their magnitudes, summing them if there are multiple orthogonal eigenvectors.

But wait, let me first find the eigenvalues of P. Let me write down matrix P.

P is a 3x3 matrix:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0.

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2.

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0.

Hmm. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

Alternatively, maybe I can notice some symmetry or pattern.

Wait, let's look at the matrix. It looks like a symmetric matrix because the element (1,2) is same as (2,1), (2,3) same as (3,2), and the rest are symmetric across the diagonal. So P is symmetric, which means it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. That's helpful.

So to find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (P - λ I), which is a 3x3 matrix. Let's set it up.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]

[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

So the determinant of this matrix is | P - λ I | = 0.

Calculating this determinant can be a bit tedious, but let's try expanding it.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or the cofactor expansion. Let's do cofactor expansion on the first row.

det = -λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] ) - (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] ) + 0 * something.

Wait, let's compute each minor.

The first term is -λ times the determinant of the submatrix:

[ -λ, 1/√2 ]

[1/√2, -λ ]

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) = λ² - (1/2).

The second term is - (1/√2) times the determinant of:

[1/√2, 1/√2 ]

[0, -λ ]

Which is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) = (-λ)/√2.

The third term is 0, so we can ignore it.

So the determinant is:

-λ * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2 )

Simplify each part.

First part: -λ(λ² - 1/2 ) = -λ³ + (λ)/2.

Second part: -(1/√2)*(-λ/√2) ) = (1/√2)(λ/√2) )= λ/(2).

So the determinant becomes:

(-λ³ + (λ)/2 ) + (λ/2) ) = -λ³ + (λ/2 + λ/2 ) = -λ³ + λ.

So the characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0.

We can factor this as λ(-λ² +1 ) = 0.

So the roots are λ=0, and λ²=1 → λ=1 and λ=-1.

Wait, wait. Wait, the equation is -λ³ + λ = 0 → λ(λ² -1) )=0?

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. So from the determinant:

det = (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)*(-λ/√2) )

Wait, the first term is -λ*(λ² - 1/2) → -λ³ + (λ/2).

The second term is - (1/√2) * [ determinant which is (1/√2)(-λ) ] → - (1/√2)*(-λ/√2) ) = (λ)/(2).

So adding them: (-λ³ + (λ/2) ) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + λ.

So the equation is -λ³ + λ = 0 → λ³ - λ = 0 → λ(λ² -1) = 0 → λ = 0, 1, -1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So when the observable P is measured, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1. The question asks for the probability of getting 0.

Now, the probability is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the state onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

But before that, I think I should normalize the state vector.

The given state vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T.

The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 + 1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So the state vector ψ is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Now, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We set up (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the system of equations is:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2 =0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → same as row 1, so v2=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 must satisfy v2=0 and v3 = -v1.

Let v1 = a, then v3 = -a. So the eigenvectors are of the form [ a, 0, -a ]^T. Which can be written as a * [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by [1, 0, -1]^T.

Wait, but wait, because eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar multiple. So any multiple of [1,0,-1]^T is an eigenvector.

Now, I need to find the projection of the state ψ onto this eigenspace.

The normalized eigenvector for λ=0 is, say, e = [1, 0, -1]^T divided by its norm.

Let me compute the norm of [1,0,-1]: sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is e = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Now, the projection of ψ onto e is the inner product of ψ and e, squared.

Wait, no. The probability is the square of the magnitude (absolute value squared) of the inner product of ψ and e.

So compute <ψ | e>:

ψ is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].

e is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

Inner product is:

(-1/sqrt(6))(1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6))(0) ) + (1/sqrt(6))(-1/sqrt(2)) )

= (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )

= (-1 -1 ) / sqrt(12) ) → (-2)/sqrt(12) ) → (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) → (-1)/sqrt(3).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)/sqrt(3) )² = 1/3.

Wait, because the inner product is a scalar, its square is (1/3).

So the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me compute the inner product again.

ψ · e = [ (-1)/sqrt(6) ] * [1/sqrt(2) ] + [2/sqrt(6)] * 0 + [1/sqrt(6)] * [ (-1)/sqrt(2) ]

= [ (-1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ] + 0 + [ (-1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ]

The denominators are sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3).

So each term is (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)), and there are two such terms, so total is [ (-1)/(2√3) ) * 2 ] → -1/(√3).

So the magnitude squared is ( -1/√3 )^2 = 1/3.

So that's correct. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

But wait, is that the only eigenvector for λ=0? Because the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so yes. So the projection is 1/3.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1/3.

So the answer should be C) 1/3.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) to yield 0 for the given state vector. Here's the analysis:

### Step 1: Normalize the state vector
The given state vector is \( \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is:

\[
\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4 + 1} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state vector is:

\[
\psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Find the eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is given as:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After calculations, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 3: Find the eigenvectors for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), solve \( P v = 0 \). The eigenvectors satisfy:

\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (v_1 + v_3) = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0.
\end{cases}
\]

From these, \( v_2 = 0 \) and \( v_3 = -v_1 \). Thus, the eigenvectors are of the form \( v = a \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \), where \( a \) is a scalar. The normalized eigenvector is:

\[
e = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the probability of measuring 0
The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the magnitude of the projection of \( \psi \) onto the eigenspace corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \). This is given by:

\[
P(0) = |\langle \psi | e \rangle|^2.
\]

Compute the inner product \( \langle \psi | e \rangle \):

\[
\langle \psi | e \rangle = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) + \left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} \cdot 0 \right) + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle \psi | e \rangle = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + 0 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The magnitude squared is:

\[
|\langle \psi | e \rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

But wait, let me first find the eigenvalues of P. Let me write down matrix P.

P is a 3x3 matrix:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0.

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2.

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0.

Hmm. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

Alternatively, maybe I can notice some symmetry or pattern.

Wait, let's look at the matrix. It looks like a symmetric matrix because the element (1,2) is same as (2,1), (2,3) same as (3,2), and the rest are symmetric across the diagonal. So P is symmetric, which means it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. That's helpful.

So to find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (P - λ I), which is a 3x3 matrix. Let's set it up.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]

[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

So the determinant of this matrix is | P - λ I | = 0.

Calculating this determinant can be a bit tedious, but let's try expanding it.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or the cofactor expansion. Let's do cofactor expansion on the first row.

det = -λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] ) - (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] ) + 0 * something.

Wait, let's compute each minor.

The first term is -λ times the determinant of the submatrix:

[ -λ, 1/√2 ]

[1/√2, -λ ]

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) = λ² - (1/2).

The second term is - (1/√2) times the determinant of:

[1/√2, 1/√2 ]

[0, -λ ]

Which is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) = (-λ)/√2.

The third term is 0, so we can ignore it.

So the determinant is:

-λ * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2 )

Simplify each part.

First part: -λ(λ² - 1/2 ) = -λ³ + (λ)/2.

Second part: -(1/√2)*(-λ/√2) ) = (1/√2)(λ/√2) )= λ/(2).

So the determinant becomes:

(-λ³ + (λ)/2 ) + (λ/2) ) = -λ³ + (λ/2 + λ/2 ) = -λ³ + λ.

So the characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0.

We can factor this as λ(-λ² +1 ) = 0.

So the roots are λ=0, and λ²=1 → λ=1 and λ=-1.

Wait, wait. Wait, the equation is -λ³ + λ = 0 → λ(λ² -1) )=0?

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. So from the determinant:

det = (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)*(-λ/√2) )

Wait, the first term is -λ*(λ² - 1/2) → -λ³ + (λ/2).

The second term is - (1/√2) * [ determinant which is (1/√2)(-λ) ] → - (1/√2)*(-λ/√2) ) = (λ)/(2).

So adding them: (-λ³ + (λ/2) ) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + λ.

So the equation is -λ³ + λ = 0 → λ³ - λ = 0 → λ(λ² -1) = 0 → λ = 0, 1, -1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So when the observable P is measured, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1. The question asks for the probability of getting 0.

Now, the probability is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the state onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

But before that, I think I should normalize the state vector.

The given state vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T.

The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 + 1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So the state vector ψ is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Now, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We set up (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the system of equations is:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2 =0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → same as row 1, so v2=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 must satisfy v2=0 and v3 = -v1.

Let v1 = a, then v3 = -a. So the eigenvectors are of the form [ a, 0, -a ]^T. Which can be written as a * [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by [1, 0, -1]^T.

Wait, but wait, because eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar multiple. So any multiple of [1,0,-1]^T is an eigenvector.

Now, I need to find the projection of the state ψ onto this eigenspace.

The normalized eigenvector for λ=0 is, say, e = [1, 0, -1]^T divided by its norm.

Let me compute the norm of [1,0,-1]: sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is e = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Now, the projection of ψ onto e is the inner product of ψ and e, squared.

Wait, no. The probability is the square of the magnitude (absolute value squared) of the inner product of ψ and e.

So compute <ψ | e>:

ψ is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].

e is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

Inner product is:

(-1/sqrt(6))(1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6))(0) ) + (1/sqrt(6))(-1/sqrt(2)) )

= (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )

= (-1 -1 ) / sqrt(12) ) → (-2)/sqrt(12) ) → (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) → (-1)/sqrt(3).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)/sqrt(3) )² = 1/3.

Wait, because the inner product is a scalar, its square is (1/3).

So the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me compute the inner product again.

ψ · e = [ (-1)/sqrt(6) ] * [1/sqrt(2) ] + [2/sqrt(6)] * 0 + [1/sqrt(6)] * [ (-1)/sqrt(2) ]

= [ (-1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ] + 0 + [ (-1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ]

The denominators are sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3).

So each term is (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)), and there are two such terms, so total is [ (-1)/(2√3) ) * 2 ] → -1/(√3).

So the magnitude squared is ( -1/√3 )^2 = 1/3.

So that's correct. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

But wait, is that the only eigenvector for λ=0? Because the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so yes. So the projection is 1/3.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1/3.

So the answer should be C) 1/3.


To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) to yield 0 for the given state vector. Here's the analysis:

### Step 1: Normalize the state vector
The given state vector is \( \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is:

\[
\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4 + 1} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state vector is:

\[
\psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Find the eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is given as:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After calculations, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 3: Find the eigenvectors for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), solve \( P v = 0 \). The eigenvectors satisfy:

\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (v_1 + v_3) = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0.
\end{cases}
\]

From these, \( v_2 = 0 \) and \( v_3 = -v_1 \). Thus, the eigenvectors are of the form \( v = a \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \), where \( a \) is a scalar. The normalized eigenvector is:

\[
e = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the probability of measuring 0
The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the magnitude of the projection of \( \psi \) onto the eigenspace corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \). This is given by:

\[
P(0) = |\langle \psi | e \rangle|^2.
\]

Compute the inner product \( \langle \psi | e \rangle \):

\[
\langle \psi | e \rangle = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) + \left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} \cdot 0 \right) + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle \psi | e \rangle = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + 0 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The magnitude squared is:

\[
|\langle \psi | e \rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

**Answer: C**
