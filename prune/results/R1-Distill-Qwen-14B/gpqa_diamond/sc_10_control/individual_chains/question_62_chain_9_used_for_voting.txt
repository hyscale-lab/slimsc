Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions. I'm a bit rusty, but let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what the target molecule looks like. The name is a bit complex. Let me parse it. The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. But the substituent is at the 1-position: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, the structure must have a cyclohexane ring attached to a carbon that's also attached to an OH group and a methyl group (since it's hydroxymethyl). Wait, no, wait—the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. Hmm, perhaps it's a methyl group where one substituent is a cyclohexyl and another is hydroxy. So the structure is likely a cyclohexane ring with a side chain that's CH(CH2OH)Cyclohexane or something along those lines. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that a cyclohexane ring is connected via a carbon that has both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexane ring. I'm getting a bit confused, but perhaps drawing it would help. But since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond to a CH2 group, maybe). So it's cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2? Or maybe the triple bond is between two carbons attached to the ring. Wait, ethynyl is CH2C≡CH? Or is it CH≡C- as a substituent. Oh, ethynyl is the substituent group where the ring is attached to a triple bond. So it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So structure is cyclohexyl-C≡CH.

So the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the target has a cyclohexane ring (the carbaldehyde is on that), and another cyclohexane ring attached via a hydroxymethyl group, perhaps. Hmm, I might be getting this wrong, but let's think about the steps.

I think the target could be made via some kind of alkyne addition or functional group transformations. Let's consider possible reactions that can convert an alkyne into the desired structure.

Looking at the options, all the reagents involve things like NaNH2, Li in liquid NH3, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4 with HgSO4, O3, NH4OH, etc. These reagents are usually for deprotonation, alkylation, hydrogenation, oxidation, or ozonolysis.

The target has both a cyclohexane ring (from the starting material?), a hydroxymethyl group, and a formyl (aldehyde) group. So perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a ketone or aldehyde, and then further functionalized.

Wait, maybe I should outline the steps needed to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target.

First, ethynylcyclohexane is an alkyne. Reacting alkynes can be done through various methods. One common approach is hydrogenation. If I hydrogenate ethynylcyclohexane, I could get either cis or trans cyclohexane with an ethylene group. But wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically give the cis-alkene. Alternatively, using Lindlar catalyst would give cis, but without, it's usually a mixture. Hmm, but the options have H2/Pd, etc.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted to a ketone via some oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach is to use the alkyne to form a carbonyl. For that, perhaps using a hydration reaction. The alkyne can be converted into a ketone via oxymercuration or hydroboration, but that's for alkynes or alkenes? Wait, for alkynes, hydration can lead to ketones.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde group. Maybe the starting alkyne is converted into an aldehyde. How?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, then oxidized. Or maybe the alkyne is used in some coupling reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent or some organometallic compound, which can then add to a carbonyl.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and another cyclohexane attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the alkyne is functionalized in a way to introduce the cyclohexyl group, the hydroxyl, and the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane undergoes some kind of alkyne alkylation or aldehyde formation.

Let me think about each step in the options.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: That's a deprotonation (strong base) followed by alkylation. Methyl chloride would act as an alkylating agent. So maybe the alkyne is deprotonated, and then methyl is added.

But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is (cyclohexyl)C≡CH. The terminal alkyne has acidic protons. So NaNH2 would deprotonate it to form the cyclohexenyl acetylide. Then, methyl chloride would alkylate it. So methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would add a methyl group to the acetylide. So the product would be (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH2Cl? Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, and in the presence of CH3Cl, the acetylide would attack CH3Cl, leading to (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH2Cl? Hmm, maybe. Then step 2 is H2/Pd. So hydrogenation of the alkyne would give a cis or trans alkane. Wait, but H2/Pd would hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds. So (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH2Cl would become (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Cl. But then step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination. If it's (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Cl, Ba(OH)2 might cause elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. So that would give (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Cl → (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2OH? Or wait, no, perhaps elimination would form (cyclohexyl)CH2-CHCl → alkene. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me look at the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So perhaps the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol.

Wait, another approach: the target has a formyl group (aldehyde), which could be formed from oxidation of a primary alcohol. So perhaps the process involves forming a secondary alcohol first, then oxidizing it to ketone, but no, that wouldn't give aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is formed from oxidation of a primary alcohol, which would require the alcohol to be in a position that can be oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should step back and think about each option's steps.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride – again, deprotonation and alkylation. Ethyl chloride would add an ethyl group to the acetylide. So (cyclohexyl)C≡CH → (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Et. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base. Li in NH3 is used for Birch reductions or for deprotonating things. Alternatively, maybe it's for elimination reactions. Hmm. Then step 3 is O3/H2O, which is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkene would cleave it into carbonyl groups. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which is ammonium hydroxide, perhaps for workup after ozonolysis.

So putting it together: Ethynylcyclohexane (Alkyne) → deprotonate with NaNH2, add ethyl group → ethyl-substituted alkyne. Then Li/NH3: perhaps for elimination, since alkyne to alkene? Or maybe for deprotonation to form a more substituted alkyne or something else. Then ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyls. So perhaps the alkyne is first converted to an alkene, then ozonized to form carbonyls.

Wait, that could make sense. Let's outline:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride: forms (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Et. Then, step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Maybe this is a deprotonation and elimination, leading to an alkene? Alternatively, it could be a reduction, but I'm not sure. Then step 3: Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. If the product after step 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexane ring, so perhaps the alkyne becomes an alkene, which upon ozonolysis forms a diketone or dialdehyde, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkene via some reaction, then ozonolysis forms carbonyl groups, and then some aldehyde is formed. Hmm. Not sure if this leads to the target.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: same as before, deprotonate and add methyl group.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenation. So the alkyne would become an alkane. So (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3 → (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, starting from ethynylcyclohexane, after step 1, it's (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Me. Then, hydrogenation would convert the triple bond to single, giving (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-Me. Wait, but that doesn't seem right; the alkyne is (cyclohexyl)C≡CH, so after alkylation, it's (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe. Then, hydrogenation would add two hydrogens, making (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me. Then step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds, but if this is a single bond, perhaps it's not applicable. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is not complete, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the steps wrong. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of the alkyne to cis-alkene. But the reagent is H2 with Pd-CaCO3, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation.

Wait, but if the alkyne is hydrogenated, it would become a cis-alkene. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. So if step 2 produces an alkene, step 3 would break it into two carbonyls. Then step 4: Ba(OH)2. Hmm, not sure. But the target has a hydroxymethyl group, so perhaps oxidation or some addition would create that.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: deprotonate the alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane) to form the acetylide, then add a methyl group from methanol? Wait, methanol is CH3OH. If we have NaNH2, a strong base, it would deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide ion. Then, adding methanol would alkylate it. So the acetylide would attack the methanol, giving (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH3? Wait, but wait, methanol is a poor electrophile. Maybe in such a case, it would form a substitution, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alkylation via a methyl group. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the reagents. Methanol is an alcohol, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but more likely, the acetylide would react with an alkyl halide. Methanol isn't an alkyl halide. So perhaps this step is not an alkylation but something else.

Wait, maybe the first step is deprotonation, and the second reagent is something else. Or perhaps the NaNH2 is for deprotonation, and methanol is a solvent or a source of methyl groups via a different mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonation of ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 to form the acetylide. Then, methanol would react with the acetylide. Acetylides are strong bases and can react with alcohols in the presence of a base? Or perhaps in the presence of a base, the acetylide would deprotonate the methanol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first step in option D is forming the acetylide, and the second step is using Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base. Li in NH3 is typically used for Birch reductions or for deprotonating things, but I'm not sure how that applies here.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this by considering the functional groups in the target molecule. The target has an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming an aldehyde and an alcohol, which then could undergo some kind of coupling or protection.

Wait, another approach: The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne. The target has an aldehyde group, so maybe the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some process. One way is through the Stephen reduction or via hydration followed by oxidation.

Wait, but hydration of a terminal alkyne typically gives a ketone. For example, using HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration) would add water across the triple bond to form a ketone: R-C≡CH + H2O → R-C(OH)-CH3. Wait, no, in the hydration of an alkyne, the triple bond adds water to form a ketone. For terminal alkynes, hydration gives a ketone. Wait, no, wait: for internal alkynes, hydration gives a ketone, but for terminal, it gives a ketone only if there's another substituent. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is (cyclohexyl)C≡CH. Adding water would give (cyclohexyl)C(OH)CH3. So that's a ketone, cyclohexylacetone.

But the target has an aldehyde group. So perhaps after forming the ketone, we can perform some kind of oxidation or reduction. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is transformed into an aldehyde. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via a different route. For example, using a hydroboration reaction on the alkyne. Alternatively, perhaps using a different functional group transformation.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent. But Grignard reagents are typically from alkyl halides, not alkynes. Unless you have a special setup.

But let's look at the options again. Let's see which options include steps that could form the aldehyde.

Option B's step 3 is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkene would break it into carbonyls. So perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an alkene, then ozonolysis cleaves it into a dialdehyde, which could then form the aldehyde in the target.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexane ring attached through a CH(OH) group. Let me think: Maybe the alkyne is converted to a substituted cyclohexane with a CH2 group, which is then oxidized or functionalized.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, then subjected to oxymercuration or some dihydroxylation, and then further processed to form the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's steps and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → forms (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenates the alkyne to cis-alkane. So (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe → (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. Wait, but the compound after step 2 is a single bond, not a double bond. Ozonolysis is for double bonds. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Ah, perhaps step 2 isn't a full hydrogenation. Maybe it's a partial hydrogenation. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation of the alkyne into an alkene. Wait, H2 over Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond. So (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe → (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me would require full hydrogenation, but perhaps I'm wrong. Wait, no, hydrogenation of triple bonds usually goes all the way to single bonds unless stopped. So step 2 would make it a single bond. Then step 3, ozonolysis, which requires a double bond, wouldn't do anything. So that might not make sense.

So perhaps option C is not the right one.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide, then react with methanol. But methanol is CH3OH. Acetylide is a strong base; perhaps it deprotonates methanol, but that's just forming methoxide. Then what? Maybe an alkylation is happening, but methanol isn't an alkylating agent. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is quenched with methanol, leading to the alkyne with a methyl group. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is treated with MeOH to form the corresponding alcohol. So (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Me-OH? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a Sonogashira coupling, but that's with a halide and a terminal alkyne. I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what each reagent does in the options.

Option A:

Steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkyne becomes (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond, giving (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond? But in what position?

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration of a triple bond? But after step 2, it's a single bond. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. If the compound after step 2 is (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Cl (but no, step 1 in option A is methyl chloride, so the product would be (cyclohexyl)C≡CMeCl?), no, wait, step 1 in option A is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, so step 1 would alkylate the acetylide. So (cyclohexyl)C≡CH → (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe after step 1.

Then step 2 is H2/Pd → (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination. So (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me → maybe (cyclohexyl)CH=CH2? But wait, that would require elimination of H2O, but where would the OH come from? Maybe the compound has a good leaving group.

Wait, but (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me doesn't have a leaving group. So perhaps Ba(OH)2 isn't for elimination but for something else. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Cl and Ba(OH)2 would cause elimination to form an alkene. But in option A, step 1 is with methyl chloride, so after step 1, the compound is (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe. Step 2 is H2, which would hydrogenate to (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me. Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Hmm, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is for epoxidation? No, that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is for dehydrohalogenation, but since there's no halide, that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the reagents wrong. Let me check each reagent.

NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonating terminal alkynes. Then, methyl chloride would provide a methyl group via alkylation. So after step 1, we have (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.

Step 2: H2/Pd. So triple bond becomes single, so (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me.

Then, step 3: Ba(OH)2. Maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination, but without a leaving group, it's unclear. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be used for oxidation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is treated with Ba(OH)2 to form a diol, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for ring-opening of an epoxide, but that doesn't fit here.

Option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Those are the conditions for oxymercuration, which adds water across a double bond to form an alcohol. But if step 3 didn't form a double bond, then step 4 wouldn't work.

Hmm, maybe none of these steps are leading to the target. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, the target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. Maybe it's formed via a cross-aldol addition or some kind of Grignard reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via hydration, and then the ketone is further functionalized.

Let me think about option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride → forms (cyclohexyl)C≡CEt.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Li in NH3 is a strong base, used for deprotonation or elimination. What's the structure after step 1? It's (cyclohexyl)C≡CEt. Then, Li/NH3 could deprotonate the alkyne, but it's already a terminal alkyne. Alternatively, perhaps it's for elimination to form a larger alkyne? Or maybe it's for a coupling reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps Li/NH3 is used to reduce the alkyne. Wait, no, Li is a strong reducing agent, but I'm not sure about this.

Then step 3: O3/H2O → ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkyne? Or of an alkene.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the alkyne is converted into an alkene. Because O3 is used for breaking double bonds. So if step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination to form an alkene, then ozonolysis would break it.

Wait, but in step 1, we have (cyclohexyl)C≡CEt. Then, step 2, Li in NH3 could deprotonate it to form a lithium acetylide, which could then eliminate to form a larger alkyne? Or perhaps, step 2 is for hydrogenation. Wait, no, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a hydrogenation, converting the alkyne into an alkene. But using Li in NH3 for hydrogenation doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the target molecule's structure again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The substituent is a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane, which also has a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane. So perhaps the structure is cyclohexane with a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a formyl group.

Wait, the numbering might be 1, so the substituent is on the same carbon as the formyl. Wait, no, the main chain is the cyclohexane with the aldehyde. The substituent is at position 1, which is attached to both the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a Grignard reagent from the alkyne, adding it to a carbonyl group, and then oxidizing or reducing as needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used in a Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling or another coupling reaction to form a larger ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via hydration, then a Grignard adds to it, forming a new carbon-carbon bond, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Let me explore this. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane:

Step 1: Hydrate the alkyne to form a ketone. So (cyclohexyl)C(O)CH3. Then, a Grignard reagent could add to the ketone. For example, adding a cyclohexyl Grignard would form a new carbon-carbon bond, leading to a larger ring.

But wait, Grignard reagents are typically prepared from alkyl halides. Maybe after forming the ketone, a cyclohexyl magnesium bromide would add to it, forming (cyclohexyl)(cyclohexyl)COCH3? Then, on workup, perhaps oxidation would form an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxymethyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol via some dihydroxylation, then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the target's hydroxymethyl group comes from a dihydroxylation of a double bond, followed by oxidation to a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then oxidized to a ketone, but that doesn't directly give an aldehyde.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the options again, focusing on the reagents.

Option D: the steps are NaNH2 and methanol, then Li in liquid NH3, then ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

So step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → forms acetylide, then reacts with MeOH. Maybe the acetylide attacks MeOH to form (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH3? But that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is protonated by MeOH to form (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OH. Then step 2 is Li in NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe this is for deprotonation again, but I'm not sure. Then step 3: ozonolysis, but without a double bond, perhaps nothing happens. Hmm.

Option B: steps are NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, Li/NH3, O3, NH4OH.

After step 1: (cyclohexyl)C≡CEt.

Step 2: Li/NH3. Maybe this is for deprotonation, forming a more substituted alkyne, or perhaps for elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation and elimination, converting the alkyne into an alkene. So (cyclohexyl)C≡CEt → (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Et via hydrogenation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a coupling reaction. For example, with Li, the alkyne could undergo a coupling, but I'm not familiar with that.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a reduction of the alkyne to an alkene, but I don't think Li in NH3 does that.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol via hydroboration, then oxidized to a ketone, but that's not directly linked to the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is subjected to a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne with a longer chain, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Let me approach this from the target's functional groups.

The target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. These could both come from oxidation of alcohols. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol from a diene, which is then oxidized.

Wait, but the starting material is an alkyne. Perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diene via some addition, then ozonolysis to form carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diketone, which is then reduced to form the diol.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about what each reagent does:

NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonating terminal alkynes to form acetylides.

H2 and Pd is for hydrogenation, converting triple bonds to single bonds (alkyne to alkane) or to cis-alkenes (if partial hydrogenation).

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used for elimination reactions, like in the formation of alkenes from alcohols or halides.

O3 is used for ozonolysis of alkenes into carbonyl compounds.

Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, used for Birch reductions (aromatic rings) or for deprotonating strong acids, such as in the formation of alkyne from alkane via dehydrogenation.

HgSO4 and H2SO4 with H2O are used for hydration of alkynes to form ketones.

Looking back, the target has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde. Aldehydes can be formed via oxidation of primary alcohols, or via partial oxidation of ketones (but that's not possible directly). Alternatively, they can be formed by the Stephen reduction (from a ketone using CH3Li and then oxidizing), but I'm not sure.

Another thought: Maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a propargyl alcohol via hydration, then into a ketone, then into a Grignard, which is then quenched with something to form the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the steps are: alkyne → ketone (via hydration), Grignard addition → secondary alcohol, oxidation → ketone again, but that doesn't directly give an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then into a ketone, which is then subjected to a Corey-Fuchs reaction to form the aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne with NaNH2 to form the acetylide.

2. Alkylate the acetylide with methyl chloride to form (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.

3. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane: (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me.

4. Ozonolysis doesn't work here because it's a single bond. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps a different approach: the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then into a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to an alkene, then ozonolyzed to form two carbonyl groups. Then, one of them is oxidized to an aldehyde.

But I'm getting too vague. Let me try to think about which option's reagents could form the necessary groups.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/NH3; then O3; then NH4OH.

So after step 1, we have (cyclohexyl)C≡CEt.

Step 2: Li/NH3. Assuming this is a deprotonation, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a more substituted alkyne via elimination. Or perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings.

Alternatively, perhaps Li/NH3 is for deprotonation to form a stronger base, which could then undergo elimination. So, perhaps (cyclohexyl)C≡CEt → upon treatment with Li/NH3, forms (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Et-Li, which could then react, but I'm not sure.

Step 3: O3. Ozonolysis usually targets double bonds, but if step 2 didn't form a double bond, then ozonolysis won't do much. So perhaps the sequence isn't right.

Alternatively, maybe the Li/NH3 is for reducing the alkyne to an alkene. But I don't think Li/NH3 does that. Wait, perhaps it's a different reaction. For example, the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol; then Li/NH3; then O3 with (CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

After step 1: (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH3? Or perhaps (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Me.

Wait, NaNH2 and methanol. Acetylide is formed, then reacts with methanol. Maybe it's quenched with methanol, giving (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OH, but that's uncertain.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is treated with methanol to form the alcohol. But I'm not sure.

Then step 2: Li/NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe this is for elimination, forming a double bond.

Then step 3: O3. So if the compound is now an alkene, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH is a mild reducing agent. Maybe it's used for workup after ozonolysis, preventing over-oxidation.

But I'm not sure how this would lead to the target molecule.

Wait, let's think about the target's structure again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group to a carbonyl.

Another approach: The alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone. Then, a Grignard reagent is added to the ketone, forming an alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure about the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to dihydroxylation (like with OsO4) to form a diol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl group.

But the options don't include OsO4 or other dihydroxylation reagents, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another thought: The target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group. Perhaps the aldehyde comes from oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the hydroxymethyl comes from a dihydroxylation followed by protection or oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol via hydration, then into a carbonyl group.

Wait, the hydration of ethynylcyclohexane with HgSO4 and H2SO4 would give (cyclohexyl)C(OH)CH3, a ketone. Then, perhaps a Grignard reagent could add to the ketone, forming a secondary alcohol, which could then be oxidized to a ketone again, but that doesn't directly form an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde. But secondary alcohols typically oxidize to ketones, not aldehydes. Primary alcohols oxidize to aldehydes.

So unless the alcohol is primary, which would require the ketone to be adjacent to a CH2 group, which would make it possible to reduce to a primary alcohol.

Wait, (cyclohexyl)C(O)CH3 → reduce to (cyclohexyl)CH(OH)CH3. Then, oxidation of the secondary alcohol won't give an aldehyde. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps after forming the ketone, a cyclohexyl Grignard adds to it, forming (cyclohexyl)C(O)CH2-Cyclohexyl? Then, after workup, it's (cyclohexyl)COH-Cyclohexyl. Then, perhaps oxidizing that would form a ketone again, but that's not helpful.

I'm getting stuck here. Given the time I've spent, maybe I should try to make an educated guess based on the reagents.

Looking at the target, it's likely that the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some oxidation, but I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reagents are NaNH2 for deprotonation, then alkylation, then hydrogenation to form an alkene, then ozonolysis.

Wait, option B's steps include NaNH2, ethyl chloride, Li/NH3, O3, NH4OH.

So, step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → (cyclohexyl)C≡CEt.

Step 2: Li in NH3. Perhaps this is a deprotonation and elimination, forming a larger alkyne. Or maybe it's a reduction of the alkyne to an alkene.

If step 2 forms an alkene, then step 3 (O3) would break it into carbonyls. Then step 4 (NH4OH) could be a workup, maybe forming aldehydes from the ozonides.

So, after step 3, perhaps the product is two carbonyl groups. If the starting alkene is a di-substituted, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes.

But then, how does that form the target molecule? Maybe it's a way to form the aldehyde group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a tri-substituted alkene, which upon ozonolysis gives a ketone and an aldehyde.

But I'm not certain.

Considering all this, I think the correct sequence is option B: NaNH2, ethyl chloride; Li/NH3; O3; NH4OH.

To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the correct sequence of reagents must achieve the following transformations:

1. **Deprotonate the terminal alkyne** to form the acetylide ion, which can then undergo alkylation.
2. **Alkylate the acetylide** to introduce a substituent, forming a longer alkyne.
3. **Convert the alkyne into an alkene** or another intermediate that can be further functionalized.
4. **Ozonolyze the intermediate** to cleave bonds and form carbonyl groups, such as aldehydes or ketones.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions. I'm a bit rusty, but let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what the target molecule looks like. The name is a bit complex. Let me parse it. The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. But the substituent is at the 1-position: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, the structure must have a cyclohexane ring attached to a carbon that's also attached to an OH group and a methyl group (since it's hydroxymethyl). Wait, no, wait—the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. Hmm, perhaps it's a methyl group where one substituent is a cyclohexyl and another is hydroxy. So the structure is likely a cyclohexane ring with a side chain that's CH(CH2OH)Cyclohexane or something along those lines. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that a cyclohexane ring is connected via a carbon that has both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexane ring. I'm getting a bit confused, but perhaps drawing it would help. But since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond to a CH2 group, maybe). So it's cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2? Or maybe the triple bond is between two carbons attached to the ring. Wait, ethynyl is CH2C≡CH? Or is it CH≡C- as a substituent. Oh, ethynyl is the substituent group where the ring is attached to a triple bond. So it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So structure is cyclohexyl-C≡CH.

So the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the target has a cyclohexane ring (the carbaldehyde is on that), and another cyclohexane ring attached via a hydroxymethyl group, perhaps. Hmm, I might be getting this wrong, but let's think about the steps.

I think the target could be made via some kind of alkyne addition or functional group transformations. Let's consider possible reactions that can convert an alkyne into the desired structure.

Looking at the options, all the reagents involve things like NaNH2, Li in liquid NH3, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4 with HgSO4, O3, NH4OH, etc. These reagents are usually for deprotonation, alkylation, hydrogenation, oxidation, or ozonolysis.

The target has both a cyclohexane ring (from the starting material?), a hydroxymethyl group, and a formyl (aldehyde) group. So perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a ketone or aldehyde, and then further functionalized.

Wait, maybe I should outline the steps needed to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target.

First, ethynylcyclohexane is an alkyne. Reacting alkynes can be done through various methods. One common approach is hydrogenation. If I hydrogenate ethynylcyclohexane, I could get either cis or trans cyclohexane with an ethylene group. But wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically give the cis-alkene. Alternatively, using Lindlar catalyst would give cis, but without, it's usually a mixture. Hmm, but the options have H2/Pd, etc.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted to a ketone via some oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach is to use the alkyne to form a carbonyl. For that, perhaps using a hydration reaction. The alkyne can be converted into a ketone via oxymercuration or hydroboration, but that's for alkynes or alkenes? Wait, for alkynes, hydration can lead to ketones.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde group. Maybe the starting alkyne is converted into an aldehyde. How?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, then oxidized. Or maybe the alkyne is used in some coupling reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent or some organometallic compound, which can then add to a carbonyl.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and another cyclohexane attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the alkyne is functionalized in a way to introduce the cyclohexyl group, the hydroxyl, and the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane undergoes some kind of alkyne alkylation or aldehyde formation.

Let me think about each step in the options.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: That's a deprotonation (strong base) followed by alkylation. Methyl chloride would act as an alkylating agent. So maybe the alkyne is deprotonated, and then methyl is added.

But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is (cyclohexyl)C≡CH. The terminal alkyne has acidic protons. So NaNH2 would deprotonate it to form the cyclohexenyl acetylide. Then, methyl chloride would alkylate it. So methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would add a methyl group to the acetylide. So the product would be (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH2Cl? Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, and in the presence of CH3Cl, the acetylide would attack CH3Cl, leading to (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH2Cl? Hmm, maybe. Then step 2 is H2/Pd. So hydrogenation of the alkyne would give a cis or trans alkane. Wait, but H2/Pd would hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds. So (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH2Cl would become (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Cl. But then step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination. If it's (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Cl, Ba(OH)2 might cause elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. So that would give (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Cl → (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2OH? Or wait, no, perhaps elimination would form (cyclohexyl)CH2-CHCl → alkene. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me look at the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So perhaps the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol.

Wait, another approach: the target has a formyl group (aldehyde), which could be formed from oxidation of a primary alcohol. So perhaps the process involves forming a secondary alcohol first, then oxidizing it to ketone, but no, that wouldn't give aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is formed from oxidation of a primary alcohol, which would require the alcohol to be in a position that can be oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should step back and think about each option's steps.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride – again, deprotonation and alkylation. Ethyl chloride would add an ethyl group to the acetylide. So (cyclohexyl)C≡CH → (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Et. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base. Li in NH3 is used for Birch reductions or for deprotonating things. Alternatively, maybe it's for elimination reactions. Hmm. Then step 3 is O3/H2O, which is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkene would cleave it into carbonyl groups. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which is ammonium hydroxide, perhaps for workup after ozonolysis.

So putting it together: Ethynylcyclohexane (Alkyne) → deprotonate with NaNH2, add ethyl group → ethyl-substituted alkyne. Then Li/NH3: perhaps for elimination, since alkyne to alkene? Or maybe for deprotonation to form a more substituted alkyne or something else. Then ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyls. So perhaps the alkyne is first converted to an alkene, then ozonized to form carbonyls.

Wait, that could make sense. Let's outline:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride: forms (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Et. Then, step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Maybe this is a deprotonation and elimination, leading to an alkene? Alternatively, it could be a reduction, but I'm not sure. Then step 3: Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. If the product after step 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexane ring, so perhaps the alkyne becomes an alkene, which upon ozonolysis forms a diketone or dialdehyde, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkene via some reaction, then ozonolysis forms carbonyl groups, and then some aldehyde is formed. Hmm. Not sure if this leads to the target.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: same as before, deprotonate and add methyl group.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenation. So the alkyne would become an alkane. So (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3 → (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, starting from ethynylcyclohexane, after step 1, it's (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Me. Then, hydrogenation would convert the triple bond to single, giving (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-Me. Wait, but that doesn't seem right; the alkyne is (cyclohexyl)C≡CH, so after alkylation, it's (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe. Then, hydrogenation would add two hydrogens, making (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me. Then step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds, but if this is a single bond, perhaps it's not applicable. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is not complete, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the steps wrong. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of the alkyne to cis-alkene. But the reagent is H2 with Pd-CaCO3, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation.

Wait, but if the alkyne is hydrogenated, it would become a cis-alkene. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. So if step 2 produces an alkene, step 3 would break it into two carbonyls. Then step 4: Ba(OH)2. Hmm, not sure. But the target has a hydroxymethyl group, so perhaps oxidation or some addition would create that.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: deprotonate the alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane) to form the acetylide, then add a methyl group from methanol? Wait, methanol is CH3OH. If we have NaNH2, a strong base, it would deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide ion. Then, adding methanol would alkylate it. So the acetylide would attack the methanol, giving (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH3? Wait, but wait, methanol is a poor electrophile. Maybe in such a case, it would form a substitution, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alkylation via a methyl group. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the reagents. Methanol is an alcohol, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but more likely, the acetylide would react with an alkyl halide. Methanol isn't an alkyl halide. So perhaps this step is not an alkylation but something else.

Wait, maybe the first step is deprotonation, and the second reagent is something else. Or perhaps the NaNH2 is for deprotonation, and methanol is a solvent or a source of methyl groups via a different mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonation of ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 to form the acetylide. Then, methanol would react with the acetylide. Acetylides are strong bases and can react with alcohols in the presence of a base? Or perhaps in the presence of a base, the acetylide would deprotonate the methanol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first step in option D is forming the acetylide, and the second step is using Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base. Li in NH3 is typically used for Birch reductions or for deprotonating things, but I'm not sure how that applies here.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this by considering the functional groups in the target molecule. The target has an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming an aldehyde and an alcohol, which then could undergo some kind of coupling or protection.

Wait, another approach: The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne. The target has an aldehyde group, so maybe the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some process. One way is through the Stephen reduction or via hydration followed by oxidation.

Wait, but hydration of a terminal alkyne typically gives a ketone. For example, using HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration) would add water across the triple bond to form a ketone: R-C≡CH + H2O → R-C(OH)-CH3. Wait, no, in the hydration of an alkyne, the triple bond adds water to form a ketone. For terminal alkynes, hydration gives a ketone. Wait, no, wait: for internal alkynes, hydration gives a ketone, but for terminal, it gives a ketone only if there's another substituent. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is (cyclohexyl)C≡CH. Adding water would give (cyclohexyl)C(OH)CH3. So that's a ketone, cyclohexylacetone.

But the target has an aldehyde group. So perhaps after forming the ketone, we can perform some kind of oxidation or reduction. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is transformed into an aldehyde. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via a different route. For example, using a hydroboration reaction on the alkyne. Alternatively, perhaps using a different functional group transformation.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent. But Grignard reagents are typically from alkyl halides, not alkynes. Unless you have a special setup.

But let's look at the options again. Let's see which options include steps that could form the aldehyde.

Option B's step 3 is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkene would break it into carbonyls. So perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an alkene, then ozonolysis cleaves it into a dialdehyde, which could then form the aldehyde in the target.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexane ring attached through a CH(OH) group. Let me think: Maybe the alkyne is converted to a substituted cyclohexane with a CH2 group, which is then oxidized or functionalized.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, then subjected to oxymercuration or some dihydroxylation, and then further processed to form the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's steps and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → forms (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenates the alkyne to cis-alkane. So (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe → (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. Wait, but the compound after step 2 is a single bond, not a double bond. Ozonolysis is for double bonds. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Ah, perhaps step 2 isn't a full hydrogenation. Maybe it's a partial hydrogenation. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation of the alkyne into an alkene. Wait, H2 over Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond. So (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe → (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me would require full hydrogenation, but perhaps I'm wrong. Wait, no, hydrogenation of triple bonds usually goes all the way to single bonds unless stopped. So step 2 would make it a single bond. Then step 3, ozonolysis, which requires a double bond, wouldn't do anything. So that might not make sense.

So perhaps option C is not the right one.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide, then react with methanol. But methanol is CH3OH. Acetylide is a strong base; perhaps it deprotonates methanol, but that's just forming methoxide. Then what? Maybe an alkylation is happening, but methanol isn't an alkylating agent. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is quenched with methanol, leading to the alkyne with a methyl group. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is treated with MeOH to form the corresponding alcohol. So (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Me-OH? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a Sonogashira coupling, but that's with a halide and a terminal alkyne. I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what each reagent does in the options.

Option A:

Steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkyne becomes (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond, giving (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond? But in what position?

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration of a triple bond? But after step 2, it's a single bond. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. If the compound after step 2 is (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Cl (but no, step 1 in option A is methyl chloride, so the product would be (cyclohexyl)C≡CMeCl?), no, wait, step 1 in option A is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, so step 1 would alkylate the acetylide. So (cyclohexyl)C≡CH → (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe after step 1.

Then step 2 is H2/Pd → (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination. So (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me → maybe (cyclohexyl)CH=CH2? But wait, that would require elimination of H2O, but where would the OH come from? Maybe the compound has a good leaving group.

Wait, but (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me doesn't have a leaving group. So perhaps Ba(OH)2 isn't for elimination but for something else. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Cl and Ba(OH)2 would cause elimination to form an alkene. But in option A, step 1 is with methyl chloride, so after step 1, the compound is (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe. Step 2 is H2, which would hydrogenate to (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me. Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Hmm, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is for epoxidation? No, that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is for dehydrohalogenation, but since there's no halide, that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the reagents wrong. Let me check each reagent.

NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonating terminal alkynes. Then, methyl chloride would provide a methyl group via alkylation. So after step 1, we have (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.

Step 2: H2/Pd. So triple bond becomes single, so (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Me.

Then, step 3: Ba(OH)2. Maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination, but without a leaving group, it's unclear. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be used for oxidation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is treated with Ba(OH)2 to form a diol, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for ring-opening of an epoxide, but that doesn't fit here.

Option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Those are the conditions for oxymercuration, which adds water across a double bond to form an alcohol. But if step 3 didn't form a double bond, then step 4 wouldn't work.

Hmm, maybe none of these steps are leading to the target. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, the target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. Maybe it's formed via a cross-aldol addition or some kind of Grignard reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via hydration, and then the ketone is further functionalized.

Let me think about option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride → forms (cyclohexyl)C≡CEt.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Li in NH3 is a strong base, used for deprotonation or elimination. What's the structure after step 1? It's (cyclohexyl)C≡CEt. Then, Li/NH3 could deprotonate the alkyne, but it's already a terminal alkyne. Alternatively, perhaps it's for elimination to form a larger alkyne? Or maybe it's for a coupling reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps Li/NH3 is used to reduce the alkyne. Wait, no, Li is a strong reducing agent, but I'm not sure about this.

Then step 3: O3/H2O → ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkyne? Or of an alkene.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the alkyne is converted into an alkene. Because O3 is used for breaking double bonds. So if step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination to form an alkene, then ozonolysis would break it.

Wait, but in step 1, we have (cyclohexyl)C≡CEt. Then, step 2, Li in NH3 could deprotonate it to form a lithium acetylide, which could then eliminate to form a larger alkyne? Or perhaps, step 2 is for hydrogenation. Wait, no, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a hydrogenation, converting the alkyne into an alkene. But using Li in NH3 for hydrogenation doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the target molecule's structure again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The substituent is a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane, which also has a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane. So perhaps the structure is cyclohexane with a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a formyl group.

Wait, the numbering might be 1, so the substituent is on the same carbon as the formyl. Wait, no, the main chain is the cyclohexane with the aldehyde. The substituent is at position 1, which is attached to both the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a Grignard reagent from the alkyne, adding it to a carbonyl group, and then oxidizing or reducing as needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used in a Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling or another coupling reaction to form a larger ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via hydration, then a Grignard adds to it, forming a new carbon-carbon bond, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Let me explore this. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane:

Step 1: Hydrate the alkyne to form a ketone. So (cyclohexyl)C(O)CH3. Then, a Grignard reagent could add to the ketone. For example, adding a cyclohexyl Grignard would form a new carbon-carbon bond, leading to a larger ring.

But wait, Grignard reagents are typically prepared from alkyl halides. Maybe after forming the ketone, a cyclohexyl magnesium bromide would add to it, forming (cyclohexyl)(cyclohexyl)COCH3? Then, on workup, perhaps oxidation would form an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxymethyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol via some dihydroxylation, then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the target's hydroxymethyl group comes from a dihydroxylation of a double bond, followed by oxidation to a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then oxidized to a ketone, but that doesn't directly give an aldehyde.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the options again, focusing on the reagents.

Option D: the steps are NaNH2 and methanol, then Li in liquid NH3, then ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

So step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → forms acetylide, then reacts with MeOH. Maybe the acetylide attacks MeOH to form (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH3? But that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is protonated by MeOH to form (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OH. Then step 2 is Li in NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe this is for deprotonation again, but I'm not sure. Then step 3: ozonolysis, but without a double bond, perhaps nothing happens. Hmm.

Option B: steps are NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, Li/NH3, O3, NH4OH.

After step 1: (cyclohexyl)C≡CEt.

Step 2: Li/NH3. Maybe this is for deprotonation, forming a more substituted alkyne, or perhaps for elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation and elimination, converting the alkyne into an alkene. So (cyclohexyl)C≡CEt → (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2Et via hydrogenation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a coupling reaction. For example, with Li, the alkyne could undergo a coupling, but I'm not familiar with that.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a reduction of the alkyne to an alkene, but I don't think Li in NH3 does that.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol via hydroboration, then oxidized to a ketone, but that's not directly linked to the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is subjected to a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne with a longer chain, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Let me approach this from the target's functional groups.

The target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. These could both come from oxidation of alcohols. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol from a diene, which is then oxidized.

Wait, but the starting material is an alkyne. Perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diene via some addition, then ozonolysis to form carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diketone, which is then reduced to form the diol.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about what each reagent does:

NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonating terminal alkynes to form acetylides.

H2 and Pd is for hydrogenation, converting triple bonds to single bonds (alkyne to alkane) or to cis-alkenes (if partial hydrogenation).

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used for elimination reactions, like in the formation of alkenes from alcohols or halides.

O3 is used for ozonolysis of alkenes into carbonyl compounds.

Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, used for Birch reductions (aromatic rings) or for deprotonating strong acids, such as in the formation of alkyne from alkane via dehydrogenation.

HgSO4 and H2SO4 with H2O are used for hydration of alkynes to form ketones.

Looking back, the target has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde. Aldehydes can be formed via oxidation of primary alcohols, or via partial oxidation of ketones (but that's not possible directly). Alternatively, they can be formed by the Stephen reduction (from a ketone using CH3Li and then oxidizing), but I'm not sure.

Another thought: Maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a propargyl alcohol via hydration, then into a ketone, then into a Grignard, which is then quenched with something to form the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the steps are: alkyne → ketone (via hydration), Grignard addition → secondary alcohol, oxidation → ketone again, but that doesn't directly give an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then into a ketone, which is then subjected to a Corey-Fuchs reaction to form the aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne with NaNH2 to form the acetylide.

2. Alkylate the acetylide with methyl chloride to form (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.

3. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane: (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me.

4. Ozonolysis doesn't work here because it's a single bond. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps a different approach: the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then into a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to an alkene, then ozonolyzed to form two carbonyl groups. Then, one of them is oxidized to an aldehyde.

But I'm getting too vague. Let me try to think about which option's reagents could form the necessary groups.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/NH3; then O3; then NH4OH.

So after step 1, we have (cyclohexyl)C≡CEt.

Step 2: Li/NH3. Assuming this is a deprotonation, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a more substituted alkyne via elimination. Or perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings.

Alternatively, perhaps Li/NH3 is for deprotonation to form a stronger base, which could then undergo elimination. So, perhaps (cyclohexyl)C≡CEt → upon treatment with Li/NH3, forms (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Et-Li, which could then react, but I'm not sure.

Step 3: O3. Ozonolysis usually targets double bonds, but if step 2 didn't form a double bond, then ozonolysis won't do much. So perhaps the sequence isn't right.

Alternatively, maybe the Li/NH3 is for reducing the alkyne to an alkene. But I don't think Li/NH3 does that. Wait, perhaps it's a different reaction. For example, the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol; then Li/NH3; then O3 with (CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

After step 1: (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH3? Or perhaps (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Me.

Wait, NaNH2 and methanol. Acetylide is formed, then reacts with methanol. Maybe it's quenched with methanol, giving (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OH, but that's uncertain.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is treated with methanol to form the alcohol. But I'm not sure.

Then step 2: Li/NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe this is for elimination, forming a double bond.

Then step 3: O3. So if the compound is now an alkene, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH is a mild reducing agent. Maybe it's used for workup after ozonolysis, preventing over-oxidation.

But I'm not sure how this would lead to the target molecule.

Wait, let's think about the target's structure again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group to a carbonyl.

Another approach: The alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone. Then, a Grignard reagent is added to the ketone, forming an alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure about the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to dihydroxylation (like with OsO4) to form a diol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl group.

But the options don't include OsO4 or other dihydroxylation reagents, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another thought: The target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group. Perhaps the aldehyde comes from oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the hydroxymethyl comes from a dihydroxylation followed by protection or oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol via hydration, then into a carbonyl group.

Wait, the hydration of ethynylcyclohexane with HgSO4 and H2SO4 would give (cyclohexyl)C(OH)CH3, a ketone. Then, perhaps a Grignard reagent could add to the ketone, forming a secondary alcohol, which could then be oxidized to a ketone again, but that doesn't directly form an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde. But secondary alcohols typically oxidize to ketones, not aldehydes. Primary alcohols oxidize to aldehydes.

So unless the alcohol is primary, which would require the ketone to be adjacent to a CH2 group, which would make it possible to reduce to a primary alcohol.

Wait, (cyclohexyl)C(O)CH3 → reduce to (cyclohexyl)CH(OH)CH3. Then, oxidation of the secondary alcohol won't give an aldehyde. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps after forming the ketone, a cyclohexyl Grignard adds to it, forming (cyclohexyl)C(O)CH2-Cyclohexyl? Then, after workup, it's (cyclohexyl)COH-Cyclohexyl. Then, perhaps oxidizing that would form a ketone again, but that's not helpful.

I'm getting stuck here. Given the time I've spent, maybe I should try to make an educated guess based on the reagents.

Looking at the target, it's likely that the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some oxidation, but I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reagents are NaNH2 for deprotonation, then alkylation, then hydrogenation to form an alkene, then ozonolysis.

Wait, option B's steps include NaNH2, ethyl chloride, Li/NH3, O3, NH4OH.

So, step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → (cyclohexyl)C≡CEt.

Step 2: Li in NH3. Perhaps this is a deprotonation and elimination, forming a larger alkyne. Or maybe it's a reduction of the alkyne to an alkene.

If step 2 forms an alkene, then step 3 (O3) would break it into carbonyls. Then step 4 (NH4OH) could be a workup, maybe forming aldehydes from the ozonides.

So, after step 3, perhaps the product is two carbonyl groups. If the starting alkene is a di-substituted, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes.

But then, how does that form the target molecule? Maybe it's a way to form the aldehyde group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a tri-substituted alkene, which upon ozonolysis gives a ketone and an aldehyde.

But I'm not certain.

Considering all this, I think the correct sequence is option B: NaNH2, ethyl chloride; Li/NH3; O3; NH4OH.


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the correct sequence of reagents must achieve the following transformations:

1. **Deprotonate the terminal alkyne** to form the acetylide ion, which can then undergo alkylation.
2. **Alkylate the acetylide** to introduce a substituent, forming a longer alkyne.
3. **Convert the alkyne into an alkene** or another intermediate that can be further functionalized.
4. **Ozonolyze the intermediate** to cleave bonds and form carbonyl groups, such as aldehydes or ketones.
5. **Workup the ozonolysis product** to yield the final target molecule with the desired functional groups.
