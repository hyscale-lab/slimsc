Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: Consider a system with a Hamiltonian operator H equal to epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Sigma is the Pauli vector, right? And n is a unit vector, and epsilon is an energy constant. The question is asking for the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, and the vector sigma is (sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z). So the dot product sigma · n would be sigma_x n_x + sigma_y n_y + sigma_z n_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. 

Wait, the Hamiltonian H is ε times this dot product. So H = ε (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z). 

I need to find the eigenvalues of H. I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix component (like sigma_x) are ±1. But wait, H isn't just one Pauli matrix; it's a linear combination of all three. So what's the eigenvalue of that?

Wait, but any linear combination of the Pauli matrices will form another matrix, and for such matrices, the eigenvalues can be found using some properties. Oh right! The square of H might help because if I can find H squared, then the eigenvalues will be the square roots of the eigenvalues of H squared. 

So H squared is ε^2 (sigma · n)^2. Let me compute (sigma · n)^2. Expanding that, it's sigma_x^2 n_x^2 + sigma_y^2 n_y^2 + sigma_z^2 n_z^2 + sigma_x sigma_y n_x n_y + sigma_x sigma_z n_x n_z + sigma_y sigma_x n_y n_x + ... etc. Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, I know that the square of a dot product of vectors is equal to the sum of squares of each component because the cross terms involve antisymmetric products, which might vanish when squared.

Wait, no, sigma_x sigma_y is not the same as sigma_y sigma_x. Instead, I think sigma_i sigma_j = Iδ_ij + iε_ijk sigma_k, where ε is the Levi-Civita symbol. But when you square (sigma · n), you get sigma_i sigma_j n_i n_j. So sigma_i sigma_j = I δ_ij + something else, but when you sum i,j, the cross terms (i≠j) would involve sigma_k for k, but upon summing, perhaps they cancel out or contribute in a certain way.

Alternatively, I remember that (sigma · n)^2 equals the identity matrix times (n · sigma)^2. Wait, no, let's think about this. Each Pauli matrix squared is identity, so sigma_x² = I, sigma_y² = I, sigma_z² = I. So when you expand (sigma · n)^2, it's sigma_x² n_x^2 + sigma_y² n_y^2 + sigma_z^2 n_z^2 + cross terms. So the cross terms are sigma_x sigma_y n_x n_y + sigma_x sigma_z n_x n_z + sigma_y sigma_x n_y n_x + sigma_y sigma_z n_y n_z + sigma_z sigma_x n_z n_x + sigma_z sigma_y n_z n_y.

But sigma_i sigma_j = sigma_j sigma_i when i=j, which is the identity for i=j. For i≠j, sigma_i sigma_j = i ε_ijk sigma_k, which is an antisymmetric term. So, when you expand (sigma ·n)^2, you get I (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) + i sum_{i≠j} epsilon_ijk n_i n_j sigma_k.

Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_y^2 +n_z^2 =1. So (sigma ·n)^2 becomes I*(1) + i (n_x n_y sigma_z + n_x n_z sigma_y + n_y n_z sigma_x + ... wait, but these terms might not cancel. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way.

Wait, I think the Pauli matrices satisfy the relation that (sigma · a)(sigma · b) = a·b I + i (sigma · (a×b)). So if a and b are vectors, then the product of their dot products with sigma is equal to (a·b)I + i sigma cross product term.

In this case, a would be the same as b? Or wait, in H squared, we have (sigma ·n)^2 = (sigma ·n)(sigma ·n) = n ·n I + i sigma · (n ×n). But wait, n cross n is zero because the cross product of any vector with itself is zero. So (sigma ·n)^2 = n^2 I. Since n is a unit vector, n^2 is 1. So (sigma ·n)^2 = I.

Whoa, that's a neat identity. So H squared is ε² (sigma ·n)^2 = ε² I. So H squared equals (ε^2) I. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H squared are ε squared times the eigenvalues of I, which for a 2x2 matrix would be 1 for each. So H squared has eigenvalues ε² and ε².

Wait, but wait, H squared is ε^2 I, so when we take square roots, the eigenvalues of H will be plus and minus ε, because sqrt(ε^2) is |ε|, but since ε is given as a constant with energy dimension, probably positive. So the eigenvalues would be plus and minus ε. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the Hamiltonian as a 2x2 matrix. Since it's a linear combination of sigma matrices multiplied by a scalar, the trace would be zero because each sigma matrix has trace zero, so H will be traceless. The determinant would be the product of the eigenvalues. For a 2x2 matrix, the trace is the sum of eigenvalues. Since trace of H is zero (as each sigma matrix is traceless and multiplied by epsilon), the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So the eigenvalues would be +a and -a for some a. 

Looking back, H squared is ε² I, so the eigenvalues of H squared are ε² and ε². Since H squared is ε² I, then the eigenvalues of H must satisfy (eigenvalue)^2 = ε². So eigenvalues are ± ε. 

So the eigenvalues are +ε and –ε. Now looking at the options, option B is +ε and –ε.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The Hamiltonian operator is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with the dimension of energy. To find the eigenvalues of \( H \), we can use the properties of the Pauli matrices.

The dot product \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) expands as \( n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z \). The eigenvalues of any linear combination of Pauli matrices can be determined by noting that the square of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is given by:

\[
(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = (\sigma_x n_x + \sigma_y n_y + \sigma_z n_z)^2.
\]

Expanding this, we use the identity \( \sigma_i \sigma_j = \delta_{ij} I + i \epsilon_{ijk} \sigma_k \), where \( \epsilon_{ijk} \) is the Levi-Civita symbol. Since \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, \( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1 \), and the cross terms involving \( \sigma_i \sigma_j \) (for \( i \neq j \)) cancel out due to the antisymmetric nature of the Levi-Civita symbol. Thus:

\[
(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I.
\]

Therefore, \( H^2 = \varepsilon^2 (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = \varepsilon^2 I \). The eigenvalues of \( H^2 \) are \( \varepsilon^2 \) and \( \varepsilon^2 \). Taking the square root, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

This result is consistent with the traceless nature of \( H \), as the trace of \( H \) is zero, and the eigenvalues must sum to zero. Additionally, the determinant of \( H \), which is the product of its eigenvalues, is \( -\varepsilon^2 \), further supporting the eigenvalues \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Wait, the Hamiltonian H is ε times this dot product. So H = ε (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z). 

I need to find the eigenvalues of H. I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix component (like sigma_x) are ±1. But wait, H isn't just one Pauli matrix; it's a linear combination of all three. So what's the eigenvalue of that?

The square of H might help because if I can find H squared, then the eigenvalues will be the square roots of the eigenvalues of H squared. 

So H squared is ε^2 (sigma · n)^2. Let me compute (sigma · n)^2. Expanding that, it's sigma_x^2 n_x^2 + sigma_y^2 n_y^2 + sigma_z^2 n_z^2 + sigma_x sigma_y n_x n_y + sigma_x sigma_z n_x n_z + sigma_y sigma_x n_y n_x + ... etc. Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, I know that the square of a dot product of vectors is equal to the sum of squares of each component because the cross terms involve antisymmetric products, which might vanish when squared.

Wait, no, sigma_x sigma_y is not the same as sigma_y sigma_x. Instead, I think sigma_i sigma_j = Iδ_ij + iε_ijk sigma_k, where ε is the Levi-Civita symbol. But when you square (sigma · n), you get sigma_i sigma_j n_i n_j. So sigma_i sigma_j = I δ_ij + something else, but when you sum i,j, the cross terms (i≠j) would involve sigma_k for k, but upon summing, perhaps they cancel out or contribute in a certain way.

So the cross terms are sigma_x sigma_y n_x n_y + sigma_x sigma_z n_x n_z + sigma_y sigma_x n_y n_x + sigma_y sigma_z n_y n_z + sigma_z sigma_x n_z n_x + sigma_z sigma_y n_z n_y.

But sigma_i sigma_j = sigma_j sigma_i when i=j, which is the identity for i=j. For i≠j, sigma_i sigma_j = i ε_ijk sigma_k, which is an antisymmetric term. So, when you expand (sigma ·n)^2, you get I (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) + i sum_{i≠j} epsilon_ijk n_i n_j sigma_k.

Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_y^2 +n_z^2 =1. So (sigma ·n)^2 becomes I*(1) + i (n_x n_y sigma_z + n_x n_z sigma_y + n_y n_z sigma_x + ... wait, but these terms might not cancel. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way.

Wait, I think the Pauli matrices satisfy the relation that (sigma · a)(sigma · b) = a·b I + i (sigma · (a×b)). So if a and b are vectors, then the product of their dot products with sigma is equal to (a·b)I + i sigma cross product term.

In this case, a would be the same as b? Or wait, in H squared, we have (sigma ·n)^2 = (sigma ·n)(sigma ·n) = n ·n I + i sigma · (n ×n). But wait, n cross n is zero because the cross product of any vector with itself is zero. So (sigma ·n)^2 = n^2 I. Since n is a unit vector, n^2 is 1. So (sigma ·n)^2 = I.

Whoa, that's a neat identity. So H squared is ε² (sigma ·n)^2 = ε² I. So H squared equals (ε^2) I. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H squared are ε squared times the eigenvalues of I, which for a 2x2 matrix would be 1 for each. So H squared has eigenvalues ε² and ε².

So the correct answer should be option B.


The Hamiltonian operator is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with the dimension of energy. To find the eigenvalues of \( H \), we can use the properties of the Pauli matrices.

The dot product \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) expands as \( n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z \). The eigenvalues of any linear combination of Pauli matrices can be determined by noting that the square of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is given by:

\[
(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = (\sigma_x n_x + \sigma_y n_y + \sigma_z n_z)^2.
\]

Expanding this, we use the identity \( \sigma_i \sigma_j = \delta_{ij} I + i \epsilon_{ijk} \sigma_k \), where \( \epsilon_{ijk} \) is the Levi-Civita symbol. Since \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, \( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1 \), and the cross terms involving \( \sigma_i \sigma_j \) (for \( i \neq j \)) cancel out due to the antisymmetric nature of the Levi-Civita symbol. Thus:

\[
(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I.
\]

Therefore, \( H^2 = \varepsilon^2 (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = \varepsilon^2 I \). The eigenvalues of \( H^2 \) are \( \varepsilon^2 \) and \( \varepsilon^2 \). Taking the square root, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

This result is consistent with the traceless nature of \( H \), as the trace of \( H \) is zero, and the eigenvalues must sum to zero. Additionally, the determinant of \( H \), which is the product of its eigenvalues, is \( -\varepsilon^2 \), further supporting the eigenvalues \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).
