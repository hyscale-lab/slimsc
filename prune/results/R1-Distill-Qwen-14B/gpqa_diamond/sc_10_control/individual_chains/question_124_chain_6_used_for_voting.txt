Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack it.

The question is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. Right, a Lorentz factor gamma is greater than 1, so these are definitely relativistic.

The setup says that on average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. So, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's walls instead.

Hmm. I remember that for particles moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So, the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) would be shorter. The time it takes for the particle to reach the detector's wall depends on their velocity and the detector's size.

Wait, the detector is spherical, so the particles are moving radially outward. Since they're produced at the center, the maximum distance any particle would need to travel is the radius of the sphere, which is 30 meters.

So, the key here is probably about the time it takes for the particle to reach the detector's wall compared to its lifetime. If the particle's lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall, then it will make it. But if the lifetime is shorter, it decays before reaching.

Wait, but wait, the problem mentions that the particles are fast-decaying. So their proper lifetime is short, but due to Lorentz gamma, their lifetime in the lab frame is extended. So the time they have to travel is their proper lifetime multiplied by gamma.

So, the time available for the particle to reach the detector is t = (proper lifetime) * gamma. The distance they need to cover is 30 meters. The velocity is v, which for relativistic particles is approximately c, but let me think more accurately.

Wait, the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, so v is approximately c. So the time taken to reach the wall is roughly (30 m) / (v ≈ c).

But the lifetime of the particle in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau): t_lab = gamma * tau.

So, for the particle to reach the wall, the time it's allowed to live (t_lab) must be at least the time it takes to reach the wall (t_move). So:

gamma * tau >= (30 m) / v.

But since v ≈ c, we can write this as:

gamma * tau >= 30 / c.

If this inequality holds, then the particle can reach the detector's wall. Otherwise, it decays before.

So the fraction of particles that reach the wall depends on how much gamma is. If gamma is just sufficient so that gamma tau = 30/c, then some fraction of them would make it, but perhaps in reality, it's more probabilistic.

Wait, but the given situation is that with a gamma of 20, on average one third reach the wall. The question asks what gamma is needed for two-thirds to reach.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Perhaps it's a matter of how much the lifetime is extended and whether the particles have enough time to reach the wall on average.

Wait, maybe the decay process is such that particles have a probability of decaying at any point in their lifetime. So the probability that a particle decays before time t is 1 - e^(-t/tau_lab), where tau_lab is gamma times tau.

Wait, the lab frame lifetime is tau_lab = gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.

So, the time t taken to reach the wall is 30 / (v), which for v ≈ c, t = 30/(3e8) seconds. Let me calculate that.

30 meters is 3e1 meters. So t = 3e1 / 3e8 = 1e-7 seconds, or 1e-7 s.

So in the lab frame, the time available is 1e-7 seconds. The particle's mean lifetime is tau_lab = gamma * tau. So the condition is whether this time is comparable to the lifetime.

But in terms of probability, the probability that the particle decays before time t is P = 1 - e^(-t/(tau_lab)). So the probability that it doesn't decay (i.e., reaches the wall) is e^(-t/(tau_lab)).

Wait, no. Let's think again. The decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle survives beyond time t is P = e^(-t/tau_lab).

So, if the time t is such that t = tau_lab, then P = 1/e ≈ 0.368. So about 36.8% survive. If t is less than tau_lab, then more survive.

In the given problem, when gamma is 20, one third (approx 0.333) reach the wall. Hmm, that's close to 1/e (≈0.368), but perhaps the actual calculation would give a more precise value.

So, perhaps the initial situation is that when gamma=20, the survival probability is about 1/3. So, when gamma is higher, the survival probability would be higher as well.

Wait, let's model this.

Let me denote that the survival probability is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

But wait, the proper lifetime is tau, so tau_lab = gamma tau.

So the survival probability is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, but t is 30 m / v.

But for ultra-relativistic speeds, v ≈ c, so t ≈ 30 c^(-1) seconds.

So, let me write:

P = e^(- (30/(c)) / (gamma tau) )

But wait, I can write this as e^(- (30) / (gamma c tau) )

Wait, but the problem states that when gamma is 20, P is 1/3.

So:

1/3 = exp( -30/(20 c tau) )

Taking natural logs on both sides:

ln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau)

ln(1/3) is approximately -1.0986.

So:

-1.0986 = -30/(20 c tau )

Multiply both sides by -1:

1.0986 = 30/(20 c tau )

Simplify 30/20 = 3/2.

So 1.0986 = (3/2) / (c tau )

Wait, wait, let's rearrange:

c tau = (3/2) / 1.0986

Calculate that:

3/2 =1.5, so 1.5 / 1.0986 ≈ 1.365.

So c tau ≈ 1.365 meters.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because tau is the proper lifetime in the particle's rest frame. So tau is in seconds, c is m/s, so c tau has units of meters. So 1.365 meters is the product of c and tau. So tau is (1.365 m) / (3e8 m/s) ) = approximately 4.55e-9 seconds.

Wait, that's a very short lifetime, which makes sense for a fast-decaying particle.

But perhaps this approach is correct.

Now, we need to find the gamma needed for the survival probability to be two-thirds, i.e., P = 2/3.

So,

2/3 = e^(-30/(gamma c tau) )

Take ln on both sides:

ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma c tau )

ln(2/3) is approximately -0.4055.

So,

-0.4055 = -30/(gamma c tau )

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.4055 = 30/(gamma c tau )

From earlier, we have c tau ≈ 1.365 m.

So,

0.4055 = 30/(gamma * 1.365 )

Solve for gamma:

gamma = 30/(0.4055 * 1.365 )

Calculate denominator: 0.4055 * 1.365 ≈ 0.4055 * 1.365 ≈ let's compute this.

0.4 * 1.365 = 0.546, 0.0055 * 1.365 ≈ 0.0075, so total approximately 0.5535.

So gamma ≈ 30 / 0.5535 ≈ let's compute that.

30 divided by 0.5535 is approximately 54.2 approximately.

Looking at the options, option A is 54, which is close.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations to ensure I didn't make any errors.

Wait, earlier step:

When gamma is 20, P=1/3.

So,

1/3 = exp( -30/(20 c tau) )

So,

- ln(3) = -30/(20 c tau )

Which gives 30/(20 c tau ) = ln(3) ≈ 1.0986.

So,

30/(20 c tau ) = 1.0986.

Multiply both sides by 20 c tau:

30 = 1.0986 * 20 c tau.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 30/(20 c tau) = 1.0986 → 30 = 1.0986 * 20 c tau.

Wait, no, wait: 30/(20 c tau ) = 1.0986 → 30 = 1.0986 * 20 c tau.

Wait, that's not correct because 30/(20 c tau) = 1.0986 → 30 = 1.0986 * 20 c tau → 30 = 21.972 c tau → c tau = 30 / 21.972 ≈ 1.365 meters.

Yes, that's correct.

So when gamma is 20, c tau is 1.365 m.

Now, for the new case where P=2/3, let's compute gamma.

P=2/3 → ln(2/3) = -0.4055.

So,

-0.4055 = -30/(gamma c tau )

So,

0.4055 = 30/(gamma * 1.365 )

Compute denominator: gamma * 1.365.

So,

gamma = 30/(0.4055 * 1.365 )

Compute 0.4055 * 1.365:

0.4 * 1.365 = 0.546.

0.0055 * 1.365 = approx 0.0075.

So total is 0.546 + 0.0075 = 0.5535.

So,

gamma = 30 / 0.5535 ≈ let's compute this.

30 divided by 0.5535.

Compute 0.5535 × 54 = 54 * 0.5535.

50 * 0.5535 = 27.675.

4 * 0.5535 = 2.214.

Total = 29.889.

But 54 * 0.5535 ≈ 29.889, which is less than 30.

So, 54 gives 29.889, but we need 30.

So 54 gives 29.889, and 30 is our numerator. So 54 gives 29.889, which is about 0.111 less than 30.

So, let's compute 54.2:

54.2 * 0.5535 = Let's compute 54 *0.5535 = 29.889 as before, plus 0.2 *0.5535=0.1107.

Total: 29.889 + 0.1107 = 30.00 (approx). So gamma is approximately 54.2.

So the closest option is A) 54.

But wait, let me check another way. Let me compute 30 / 0.5535.

0.5535 × 54 = ~29.889.

Difference: 30 -29.889 = 0.111.

0.111 / 0.5535 ≈ 0.2005.

So, total gamma is 54 + 0.2005 ≈ 54.2.

So approximately 54.2, which rounds to 54. So the correct answer would be option A) 54.

To solve the problem, we analyze the survival probability of particles traveling from the center of a spherical detector to its inner walls. The particles are fast-decaying, and their survival probability depends on the Lorentz factor $\gamma$, which determines how much their lifetime is extended in the lab frame due to time dilation. The survival probability is given by:

\[
P = e^{-t / (\gamma \tau)}
\]

where:
- $t$ is the time it takes for the particle to reach the detector's wall,
- $\tau$ is the proper lifetime of the particle in its rest frame,
- $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.

### Step 1: Time to reach the detector's wall
The detector's radius is $30 \, \text{m}$, and the particles travel at ultra-relativistic speeds ($v \approx c$). The time to reach the wall is:

\[
t = \frac{30}{c} \approx \frac{30}{3 \times 10^8} = 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Relating $\gamma$, $\tau$, and survival probability
The survival probability is $P = e^{-t / (\gamma \tau)}$. For $\gamma = 20$, the problem states that $P = \frac{1}{3}$. Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = e^{-t / (20 \tau)}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{20 \tau}.
\]

\[
-1.0986 = -\frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{20 \tau}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
1.0986 = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{20 \tau}.
\]

\[
\tau = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{20 \times 1.0986} \approx 4.55 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 3: Finding $\gamma$ for $P = \frac{2}{3}$
Now, we need to find the $\gamma$ required for $P = \frac{2}{3}$. Using the survival probability formula:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = e^{-t / (\gamma \tau)}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}.
\]

\[
-0.4055 = -\frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{\gamma \tau}.
\]

Substitute $\tau \approx 4.55 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}$:

\[
0.4055 = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{\gamma \times 4.55 \times 10^{-9}}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{0.4055 \times 4.55 \times 10^{-9}}.
\]

\[
\gamma \approx \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{1.845 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 54.2.
\]

### Step 4: Final Answer
The closest value to $\gamma \approx 54.2$ among the options is **54**.

So the fraction of particles that reach the wall depends on how much gamma is. If gamma is just sufficient so that gamma tau = 30/c, then some fraction of them would make it, but perhaps in reality, it's more probabilistic.

Wait, the lab frame lifetime is tau_lab = gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.

So, the time t taken to reach the wall is 30 / (v), which for v ≈ c, t = 30/(3e8) seconds. Let me calculate that.

30 meters is 3e1 meters. So t = 3e1 / 3e8 = 1e-7 seconds, or 1e-7 s.

So in the lab frame, the time available is 1e-7 seconds. The particle's mean lifetime is tau_lab = gamma * tau. So the condition is whether this time is comparable to the lifetime.

But in terms of probability, the probability that the particle decays before time t is P = 1 - e^(-t/(tau_lab)). So the probability that it doesn't decay (i.e., reaches the wall) is e^(-t/(tau_lab)).

Wait, no. Let's think again. The decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle survives beyond time t is P = e^(-t/tau_lab).

So, if the time t is such that t = tau_lab, then P = 1/e ≈ 0.368. So about 36.8% survive. If t is less than tau_lab, then more survive.

In the given problem, when gamma is 20, one third (approx 0.333) reach the wall. Hmm, that's close to 1/e (≈0.368), but perhaps the actual calculation would give a more precise value.

So, perhaps the initial situation is that when gamma=20, the survival probability is about 1/3. So, when gamma is higher, the survival probability would be higher as well.

Wait, let's model this.

Let me denote that the survival probability is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

But wait, the proper lifetime is tau, so tau_lab = gamma tau.

So the survival probability is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, but t is 30 m / v.

But for ultra-relativistic speeds, v ≈ c, so t ≈ 30 c^(-1) seconds.

So, let me write:

P = e^(- (30/(c)) / (gamma tau) )

But wait, I can write this as e^(- (30) / (gamma c tau) )

Wait, but the problem states that when gamma is 20, P is 1/3.

So:

1/3 = exp( -30/(20 c tau) )

Taking natural logs on both sides:

ln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau)

ln(1/3) is approximately -1.0986.

So:

-1.0986 = -30/(20 c tau )

Multiply both sides by -1:

1.0986 = 30/(20 c tau )

Simplify 30/20 = 3/2.

So 1.0986 = (3/2) / (c tau )

Wait, wait, let's rearrange:

c tau = (3/2) / 1.0986

Calculate that:

3/2 =1.5, so 1.5 / 1.0986 ≈ 1.365.

So c tau ≈ 1.365 meters.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because tau is the proper lifetime in the particle's rest frame. So tau is in seconds, c is m/s, so c tau has units of meters. So 1.365 meters is the product of c and tau. So tau is (1.365 m) / (3e8 m/s) ) = approximately 4.55e-9 seconds.

Wait, that's a very short lifetime, which makes sense for a fast-decaying particle.

But perhaps this approach is correct.

Now, we need to find the gamma needed for the survival probability to be two-thirds, i.e., P = 2/3.

So,

2/3 = e^(-30/(gamma c tau) )

Take ln on both sides:

ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma c tau )

ln(2/3) is approximately -0.4055.

So,

-0.4055 = -30/(gamma c tau )

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.4055 = 30/(gamma c tau )

From earlier, we have c tau ≈ 1.365 m.

So,

0.4055 = 30/(gamma * 1.365 )

Solve for gamma:

gamma = 30/(0.4055 * 1.365 )

Calculate denominator: 0.4055 * 1.365 ≈ 0.4055 * 1.365 ≈ let's compute this.

0.4 * 1.365 = 0.546, 0.0055 * 1.365 ≈ 0.0075, so total approximately 0.5535.

So gamma ≈ 30 / 0.5535 ≈ let's compute that.

30 divided by 0.5535 is approximately 54.2 approximately.

Looking at the options, option A is 54, which is close.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations to ensure I didn't make any errors.

Wait, earlier step:

When gamma is 20, P=1/3.

So,

1/3 = exp( -30/(20 c tau) )

So,

- ln(3) = -30/(20 c tau )

Which gives 30/(20 c tau ) = ln(3) ≈ 1.0986.

So,

30/(20 c tau ) = 1.0986.

Multiply both sides by 20 c tau:

30 = 1.0986 * 20 c tau.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 30/(20 c tau) = 1.0986 → 30 = 1.0986 * 20 c tau.

Wait, no, wait: 30/(20 c tau ) = 1.0986 → 30 = 1.0986 * 20 c tau.

Wait, that's not correct because 30/(20 c tau) = 1.0986 → 30 = 1.0986 * 20 c tau → 30 = 21.972 c tau → c tau = 30 / 21.972 ≈ 1.365 meters.

Yes, that's correct.

So when gamma is 20, c tau is 1.365 m.

Now, for the new case where P=2/3, let's compute gamma.

P=2/3 → ln(2/3) = -0.4055.

So,

-0.4055 = -30/(gamma c tau )

So,

0.4055 = 30/(gamma * 1.365 )

Compute denominator: gamma * 1.365.

So,

gamma = 30/(0.4055 * 1.365 )

Compute 0.4055 * 1.365:

0.4 * 1.365 = 0.546.

0.0055 * 1.365 = approx 0.0075.

So total is 0.546 + 0.0075 = 0.5535.

So,

gamma = 30 / 0.5535 ≈ let's compute this.

30 divided by 0.5535.

Compute 0.5535 × 54 = 54 * 0.5535.

50 * 0.5535 = 27.675.

4 * 0.5535 = 2.214.

Total = 29.889.

But 54 * 0.5535 ≈ 29.889, which is less than 30.

So, 54 gives 29.889, but we need 30.

So 54 gives 29.889, and 30 is our numerator. So 54 gives 29.889, which is about 0.111 less than 30.

So, let's compute 54.2:

54.2 * 0.5535 = Let's compute 54 *0.5535 = 29.889 as before, plus 0.2 *0.5535=0.1107.

Total: 29.889 + 0.1107 = 30.00 (approx). So gamma is approximately 54.2.

So the closest option is A) 54.

But wait, let me check another way. Let me compute 30 / 0.5535.

0.5535 × 54 = ~29.889.

Difference: 30 -29.889 = 0.111.

0.111 / 0.5535 ≈ 0.2005.

So, total gamma is 54 + 0.2005 ≈ 54.2.

So approximately 54.2, which rounds to 54. So the correct answer would be option A) 54.


To solve the problem, we analyze the survival probability of particles traveling from the center of a spherical detector to its inner walls. The particles are fast-decaying, and their survival probability depends on the Lorentz factor $\gamma$, which determines how much their lifetime is extended in the lab frame due to time dilation. The survival probability is given by:

\[
P = e^{-t / (\gamma \tau)}
\]

where:
- $t$ is the time it takes for the particle to reach the detector's wall,
- $\tau$ is the proper lifetime of the particle in its rest frame,
- $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.

### Step 1: Time to reach the detector's wall
The detector's radius is $30 \, \text{m}$, and the particles travel at ultra-relativistic speeds ($v \approx c$). The time to reach the wall is:

\[
t = \frac{30}{c} \approx \frac{30}{3 \times 10^8} = 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Relating $\gamma$, $\tau$, and survival probability
The survival probability is $P = e^{-t / (\gamma \tau)}$. For $\gamma = 20$, the problem states that $P = \frac{1}{3}$. Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = e^{-t / (20 \tau)}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{20 \tau}.
\]

\[
-1.0986 = -\frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{20 \tau}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
1.0986 = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{20 \tau}.
\]

\[
\tau = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{20 \times 1.0986} \approx 4.55 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 3: Finding $\gamma$ for $P = \frac{2}{3}$
Now, we need to find the $\gamma$ required for $P = \frac{2}{3}$. Using the survival probability formula:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = e^{-t / (\gamma \tau)}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}.
\]

\[
-0.4055 = -\frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{\gamma \tau}.
\]

Substitute $\tau \approx 4.55 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}$:

\[
0.4055 = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{\gamma \times 4.55 \times 10^{-9}}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{0.4055 \times 4.55 \times 10^{-9}}.
\]

\[
\gamma \approx \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{1.845 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 54.2.
\]

### Step 4: Final Answer
The closest value to $\gamma \approx 54.2$ among the options is **54**.
