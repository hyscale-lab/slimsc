Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula, I think, is something like T = T_earth * (L/L_sun)^(1/4) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4) * (distance_factor)^(-1/2). But wait, in this problem, all the planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out. That's good because I don't have to worry about varying albedos.

The planets are in orbital resonance, and their periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and Planet_5 has the longest. Since their orbits are circular, Kepler's third law probably applies here. The orbital period is related to the semi-major axis. Kepler's law says P² is proportional to (a³)/(M), where M is the mass of the star. But since all the planets are orbiting the same star, M is the same for all, so P² is proportional to a³.

So, the ratio of their periods is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let's assign Planet_1 a period P. Then Planet_2 has 2P, Planet_3 2.5P, Planet_4 3.5P, and Planet_5 5P.

Using Kepler's law, since P² ∝ a³, I can write a_i = (k P_i)^(2/3), where k is some constant depending on the star's mass. The important part is the relationship between the periods and the semi-major axes.

The equilibrium temperature formula simplifies because albedos are the same. So T ∝ (L^0.25) * (a^-0.5). Wait, but the problem says all have the same albedo, so the (1 - albedo) term is the same for all. So T is proportional to (L)^0.25 * (a)^-0.5. Oh, but in this problem, are we assuming the same star? I think so, because all planets are in the same system. So L is the same for all, so L cancels out. So T is proportional to a^-0.5.

So the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets is sqrt(a_j / a_i)^(-1), but wait, no, more accurately, T_i / T_j = sqrt( (a_j / a_i) )^(-1), because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T_i is proportional to 1/sqrt(a_i), meaning T_i/T_j = sqrt(a_j / a_i).

Alternatively, since T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), the ratio T_4 / T_2 would be sqrt(a_2 / a_4).

So I need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, a_4 and a_2, based on their periods.

From Kepler's law, since P² ∝ a³, a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3).

Let's compute P_2 and P_4. The ratio is P_2 : P_4 = 2 : 3.5. So P_2 is 2P, P_4 is 3.5P. So the ratio P_2 / P_4 = (2)/(3.5) = 4/7 (since 2 divided by 3.5 is the same as 4/7). Wait, 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7. So (P_2 / P_4) = 4/7.

Thus, (a_2 / a_4) = (4/7)^(2/3). Let me compute that. Hmm, (4/7)^(2/3) is the same as [ (4/7)^(1/3) ] squared. Alternatively, it's (4^(2/3)) / (7^(2/3)).

Wait, 4 is 2², so 4^(2/3) is (2²)^(2/3) = 2^(4/3) ≈ 2.5198. And 7^(2/3) is approximately e^( (2/3) ln7 ). Let's compute that. Ln7 is about 1.9459. Multiply by 2/3, gives approx 1.297. e^1.297 is about 3.659.

So 2.5198 / 3.659 ≈ approximately 0.688.

So (a_2 / a_4) is around 0.688. Then T_4 / T_2 is sqrt(a_2 / a_4) = sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829. Hmm, but wait, T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so T_4 = (a_2 / a_4)^0.5 * T_2? Or wait, no, let's think again.

Wait, T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so T_4 = k / sqrt(a_4), and T_2 = k / sqrt(a_2). So T_4 / T_2 = (sqrt(a_2) ) / (sqrt(a_4)) ) = sqrt(a_2 / a_4).

Which is what I have. So, with a_2 / a_4 ≈ 0.688, then sqrt(0.688) is around 0.829. So the ratio T_4 / T_2 is approximately 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation. Because I might have made a mistake in the exponents.

Alternative approach: a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a_2 = (P_2/P_1)^(2/3) * a_1. Similarly, a_4 = (P_4/P_1)^(2/3) * a_1. So a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3).

P_2 is 2, P_4 is 3.5. So P2/P4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7. So (4/7)^(2/3) is the same as ( (4/7) )^(2/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(0.6667).

Wait, 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. Raising that to the power of 2/3. Hmm, 0.5714^0.6667 is around 0.688, same as before.

So T_4 / T_2 = sqrt( (a_2 / a_4) ) = sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829, which is approximately 0.83. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Are the periods given in the ratio, so the actual periods are P, 2P, 2.5P, 3.5P, 5P. So for Planet_2, P=2, Planet_4, P=3.5. So the ratio P2/P4 is 2/3.5 = 4/7, as I did earlier.

So no mistake there. So the calculation seems correct.

Thus, the answer should be option C, ~0.83.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis \( a \), i.e., \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \). From Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), so \( a \propto P^{2/3} \). This allows us to relate the semi-major axes of the planets to their orbital periods.

The orbital periods of the planets are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let the period of Planet_1 be \( P \). Then, the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4 are \( 2P \) and \( 3.5P \), respectively. The ratio of their periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2P}{3.5P} = \frac{4}{7}.
\]

Using \( a \propto P^{2/3} \), the ratio of their semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3} \), we find:

\[
\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3} \approx 0.688.
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis ratio:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{0.688} \approx 0.829.
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

The equilibrium temperature formula simplifies because albedos are the same. So T ∝ (L^0.25) * (a^-0.5). Wait, but the problem says all have the same albedo, so the (1 - albedo) term is the same for all. So T is proportional to (L)^0.25 * (a)^-0.5. Oh, but in this problem, are we assuming the same star?

Alternatively, since T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), the ratio T_4 / T_2 would be sqrt(a_2 / a_4).

So I need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, a_4 and a_2, based on their periods.

From Kepler's law, since P² ∝ a³, a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3).

Let's compute P_2 and P_4. The ratio is P_2 : P_4 = 2 : 3.5. So P_2 is 2P, P_4 is 3.5P. So the ratio P_2 / P_4 = (2)/(3.5) = 4/7 (since 2 divided by 3.5 is the same as 4/7). Wait, 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7. So (P_2 / P_4) = 4/7.

Thus, (a_2 / a_4) = (4/7)^(2/3). Let me compute that. Hmm, (4/7)^(2/3) is the same as [ (4/7)^(1/3) ] squared. Alternatively, it's (4^(2/3)) / (7^(2/3)).

Wait, 4 is 2², so 4^(2/3) is (2²)^(2/3) = 2^(4/3) ≈ 2.5198. And 7^(2/3) is approximately e^( (2/3) ln7 ). Let's compute that. Ln7 is about 1.9459. Multiply by 2/3, gives approx 1.297. e^1.297 is about 3.659.

So 2.5198 / 3.659 ≈ approximately 0.688.

So (a_2 / a_4) is around 0.688. Then T_4 / T_2 is sqrt(a_2 / a_4) = sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829. Hmm, but wait, T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so T_4 = (a_2 / a_4)^0.5 * T_2? Or wait, no, let's think again.

Wait, T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so T_4 = k / sqrt(a_4), and T_2 = k / sqrt(a_2). So T_4 / T_2 = (sqrt(a_2) ) / (sqrt(a_4)) ) = sqrt(a_2 / a_4).

Which is what I have. So, with a_2 / a_4 ≈ 0.688, then sqrt(0.688) is around 0.829. So the ratio T_4 / T_2 is approximately 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation. Because I might have made a mistake in the exponents.

Alternative approach: a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a_2 = (P_2/P_1)^(2/3) * a_1. Similarly, a_4 = (P_4/P_1)^(2/3) * a_1. So a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3).

P_2 is 2, P_4 is 3.5. So P2/P4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7. So (4/7)^(2/3) is the same as ( (4/7) )^(2/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(0.6667).

Wait, 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. Raising that to the power of 2/3. Hmm, 0.5714^0.6667 is around 0.688, same as before.

So T_4 / T_2 = sqrt( (a_2 / a_4) ) = sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829, which is approximately 0.83. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Are the periods given in the ratio, so the actual periods are P, 2P, 2.5P, 3.5P, 5P. So for Planet_2, P=2, Planet_4, P=3.5. So the ratio P2/P4 is 2/3.5 = 4/7, as I did earlier.

So no mistake there. So the calculation seems correct.

Thus, the answer should be option C, ~0.83.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis \( a \), i.e., \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \). From Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), so \( a \propto P^{2/3} \). This allows us to relate the semi-major axes of the planets to their orbital periods.

The orbital periods of the planets are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let the period of Planet_1 be \( P \). Then, the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4 are \( 2P \) and \( 3.5P \), respectively. The ratio of their periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2P}{3.5P} = \frac{4}{7}.
\]

Using \( a \propto P^{2/3} \), the ratio of their semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3} \), we find:

\[
\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3} \approx 0.688.
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis ratio:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{0.688} \approx 0.829.
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:
