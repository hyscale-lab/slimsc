Okay, so I'm looking at this genetics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about gene interactions involved in disease resistance in white lupine. They did some experiments with knock-out mutants and double mutants.

So, the setup is that they found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They created knockout mutants for each, and also all possible double mutants. The resistance levels of these mutants against anthracnose are given. The goal is to figure out the gene interactions based on these results.

First, let me list out the data again to make it clear:

- g1 (single mutant): 75% resistance. So, their resistance is 75% of the wild-type. That means they're less resistant but not completely susceptible.
- g2 (single mutant): 0% resistance. So, they're completely susceptible. That's a big effect.
- g3 (single mutant): 50% resistance. So, half as resistant as wild-type.
- g1g3 (double mutant): 10% resistance. Very low.
- g2g3: 0% resistance.
- g1g2: 0% resistance.

Hmm, and in the question, it's mentioned that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, likely, one gene is a regulator (like a transcription factor) that activates other genes involved in resistance.

Let me think about what each of these results implies.

Starting with g2: since the single mutant is completely susceptible (0%), that suggests that G2 is critical for resistance. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other resistance genes. Because if G2 is knocked out, all resistance is lost. So, perhaps G2 is upstream of the other genes.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either g1 or g2. Wait, but g2 alone is 0%, so g1g2 is same as g2. Hmm, could that mean that G1 is not involved downstream of G2? Or maybe G2 is epistatic over G1? Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of another gene. If the phenotype of the double mutant is the same as one of the single mutants, that suggests that gene is epistatic.

So, g2's single mutant is 0%, and the g1g2 double is also 0%. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the presence or absence of G1 doesn't change the phenotype when G2 is knocked out. So G2 is acting upstream, perhaps.

Now, what about G3? The single mutant g3 is 50% resistance. The double mutants involving G3 are:

g1g3: 10% resistance.

g2g3: 0% resistance.

Wait, so when G3 is knocked out with G2, they're as susceptible as the g2 mutant. Because g2 and g2g3 are both 0%. But when G3 is knocked out with G1, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%.

So, let's see. If G2 is a transcription factor, maybe G2 activates G3 and possibly G1. Because in the absence of G2, all downstream genes (like G1 and G3) can't be expressed. But wait, when G2 is knocked out, G1 is also not working, but in the double mutant g1g2, it's 0%. So perhaps G1 is downstream of G2 as well.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but they have some redundant functions or additive effects.

Wait, let's consider the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% resistance. So, same as g2. So G1's knockout doesn't add anything beyond G2's knockout. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

g2g3: 0% same as g2. So G3's knockout doesn't change the resistance when G2 is already knocked out. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

And g1g3: 10% resistance. So, this is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So their combined effect is more severe than either single mutant.

Hmm. So what happens when both G1 and G3 are knocked out. Since they aren't epistatic to each other (because the double mutant is worse than either single), perhaps they contribute additively or redundantly.

Wait, redundancy would mean that each can compensate for the other. If both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either alone. That fits with g1g3's 10% resistance, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that suggests that G1 and G3 function redundantly. Because each can partially compensate for the loss of the other.

So, if both are required, but each alone can provide some resistance, then their combined loss would be worse. That's a redundancy situation.

Additionally, the double mutant g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So whether G3 is present or not doesn't matter when G2 is absent. So G2 is upstream of G3. Because G2's function is needed for G3 to function. If G2 is knocked out, G3 cannot contribute, hence the resistance is as low as g2.

Similarly, g1g2 is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is upstream of G1 as well. So G2 is the transcription factor upstream, activating both G1 and G3.

Wait, but what about the situation when G3 is knocked out along with G1? Because in that case, the resistance is 10%, which is even lower than either single (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So their combined knockout is worse. So perhaps G1 and G3 each contribute some function that, when both are missing, the resistance is even lower.

So the possible model is that G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Each of these (G1 and G3) contributes to the resistance, but they might have overlapping functions, so knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

But wait, in the absence of G2, both G1 and G3 are non-functional, but the single mutants (g1 and g3) have partial resistance. So without G2, G1 and G3 can't be expressed, which explains why g2 is 0% (no resistance).

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor for G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would prevent the expression of both. So in the g2 single mutant, G1 and G3 are not expressed, so resistance is gone. But in the double mutants where G2 is present, like in g1g3, perhaps G2 is still active, but G1 and G3 are knocked out. However, the data for g1g3 is 10% resistance, which is lower than either single.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again.

Wait, in the g1 mutant, G1 is knocked out, but G2 and G3 are presumably functional. Similarly, in g3 mutant, G3 is knocked out, but G1 and G2 are okay.

But the resistance of g1 is 75%, which is lower than the wild-type (100%), but higher than g2 (0%). So without G1, the plant is less resistant, but still has some resistance. Similarly, without G3, the resistance is 50%, so it's better than g1 but worse than wild-type.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor for G1 and G3, then in a g2 mutant, G1 and G3 shouldn't be expressed. So the g2 mutant should have the same resistance as a triple mutant (g1g2g3), which would be 0% (since all three are knocked out). But in our data, the g2 single mutant is 0%.

Wait, but the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 are also 0%. So when G2 is non-functional, regardless of the state of G1 or G3, the resistance is 0%. So that suggests that G2 is essential for the function of both G1 and G3. So G2 is upstream of both.

In the case of the double mutant g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present. So in that case, perhaps G2 can activate other genes, but without G1 and G3, the resistance is even lower than either single. So if G2 is present, but G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%. So this indicates that G1 and G3 contribute to the resistance when G2 is active.

So, the model is that G2 is the transcription factor. It activates G1 and G3. Each of these contributes to the resistance, but their functions are additive or redundant. Without G2, the resistance is 0% because neither G1 nor G3 can contribute.

Wait, no. Because when G2 is knocked out (g2), the resistance is 0%. But when G1 is knocked out (g1), the resistance is 75%, which is higher than g2. So that suggests that G2 isn't just activating G1. Because without G2, the resistance is worse than without G1 alone.

Hmm, maybe G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3, but G1 and G3 are also upstream of each other in some way. Or perhaps G2 is the main regulator, but G1 and G3 have some independent functions.

Let me try to think in terms of gene hierarchy. Suppose G2 is the master regulator. It activates G1 and G3. G1 and G3 each contribute to the resistance, but when both are missing, the effect is worse.

So, when only G2 is knocked out, all downstream genes (G1 and G3) are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. When only G1 is knocked out, G3 can still function, but perhaps not as effectively, leading to 75% resistance. Similarly, when G3 is knocked out, G1 can function to some extent (50% resistance).

But wait, that doesn't fit the data because in the absence of G2, the resistance is 0%, but in the absence of G1, it's 75% and for G3 it's 50%. That would suggest that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3, but G1 and G3 are downstream and perhaps function in a redundant or additive manner.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are both required for full resistance, but each contributes partially. So when neither is present (g1g3), resistance is even lower. Let's model this:

Wild-type: 100% resistance.

g1: 75% → so G1 contributes 25% (since 75% is left when G1 is out).

g3: 50% → G3 contributes 50% (since 50% remains when G3 is out).

But when both G1 and G3 are out (g1g3), resistance is 10%. That's less than the sum of their individual contributions (which would be 25 + 50 =75), but perhaps the functions are not additive but synergistic or something else.

Wait, but 75% (g1) + 50% (g3) doesn't directly translate to 10%, which is much lower. So maybe the presence of G1 and G3 are necessary for each other's function, but that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway, where G1 is downstream of G3 or vice versa. But then the double mutant might not be more severe than either single.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. So without G1, you lose 25% of resistance, and without G3, you lose 50%. When both are missing, you lose 75% (100% - 75% = 25%, but the data says 10%). Hmm no, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway. Redundancy means each can perform the same function, so when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than each single. For example, if each contributes 50%, then single knockout would reduce resistance by 50% (so 50% remains). But in our case, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So that suggests that their contributions aren't redundant.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but function additively. So each contributes some level, but they add up. So for example, G1 contributes 25%, G3 contributes 50%, so together they contribute 75%. If G2 is the upstream factor activating both, then in the g2 mutant, both are off → 0% resistance.

In the g1 mutant, G3 is functional, so 50% resistance. But wait, the data says g1 is 75% resistance, which is higher than g3's 50%. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Let me think again. The single mutants:

g1: 75% → so without G1, the resistance is 75% of wild-type. So G1 is not critical, but contributes to some extent.

g2: 0% → G2 is critical.

g3: 50% → G3 is somewhat important.

Hmm. So when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%, which suggests G2 is required for all resistance. So perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates the other genes.

So the model is:

G2 → G1 and G3.

In that case, without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed → 0% resistance.

With G2 present but G1 knocked out, the resistance is determined by G3's function. But in the data, when G1 is knocked out (g1), the resistance is 75%, which is higher than when G3 is knocked out (g3 is 50%). So perhaps G1 contributes more than G3.

Wait, but if G2 is the upstream, then in g2, both G1 and G3 are non-functional. But in g1, G3 is functional, but the resistance is 75%.

Hmm, perhaps G2 is not the only upstream. Maybe G2 is required for G1, but G3 is regulated by another factor. Or perhaps G2 is required for both, and G1 and G3 are not necessarily regulated only by G2.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is a transcription factor as well, but the question states that at least one is a transcription factor. So it could be G2.

Wait, the question says at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So it's possible that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are target genes.

So, G2 → G1 and G3.

In that case, without G2, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So the resistance would depend on both.

In the data:

g1: G2 and G3 are present → So G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. So the resistance is 75% (higher than g3's 50%). So perhaps G3 contributes less than G1. Or maybe G1 and G3 contribute additively.

Wait, but in the g1 mutant, G1 is knocked out, so only G3 is active. If G3 contributes 50% to resistance, then why is g1 75%? Because in that case, when only G3 is present, the resistance should be 50%, but g1 is 75%.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should think in terms of epistatic relationships.

Epistasis is when the phenotype of one gene masks the effect of another. So, in the double mutant, if the phenotype is same as one of the single mutants, that gene is epistatic.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2 → 0% (same as g2). So G2 is epistatic to G1.

g2g3 → 0% (same as g2). So G2 is epistatic to G3.

g1g3 → 10% (worse than either single). So neither is epistatic; their effects add up.

So, the epistasis here tells us that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Because the presence of a mutation in G2 masks the effect of mutations in G1 or G3.

So, the pathway is likely G2 → G1 and G2 → G3.

So, when G2 is non-functional, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute, leading to 0% resistance.

In the single mutants, when G2 is functional:

g1: G2 is okay, so G3 is expressed. So the resistance is determined by G3's contribution. But wait, the g1 mutant has 75% resistance. If G3 is functional in g1, why isn't the resistance higher? Alternatively, perhaps G1 is also contributing.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are both required for the full resistance. So, in the absence of G1, but presence of G3, the resistance is lower than in wild-type but not zero. And vice versa.

Wait, let me think about the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. That's much lower than either single. So perhaps the full resistance requires both G1 and G3.

But wait, the data for the single mutants is g1 at 75% and g3 at 50%. So when G1 is missing, but G3 is present, the resistance is 75%. When G3 is missing but G1 is present, the resistance is 50%. So perhaps G1's function is more significant than G3's.

Hmm, but that doesn't fit with the idea that both are required. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. So, without G1, the pathway through G3 is still active, but less efficient than both working together.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me try to model this with a pathway diagram.

G2 is a transcription factor. It activates both G1 and G3.

G1 and G3 each contribute to the resistance. Perhaps they activate other downstream genes or mechanisms. So G2 is upstream of both, G1 and G3 are parallel pathways.

In that case, the absence of G2 (g2) would shut down both G1 and G3, leading to 0% resistance.

In the absence of G1 (g1), G3 can still function, but perhaps only at half efficiency. So the resistance is 50% of wild-type. But in the data, g1 is 75% resistance. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway. G2 activates G1, which in turn activates G3. But then, the g1 mutant would have 0% resistance, which isn't the case (g1 is 75%).

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps G1 is a transcription factor, and G2 is as well. But the question states that at least one is a transcription factor.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1, which in turn activates G3. So, G2 → G1 → G3.

In that model:

g2: no G2 → G1 not expressed → G3 not expressed → resistance 0%.

g1: no G1 → G3 not expressed → resistance same as if G3 is missing, which would be 50% (as in the data). But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G2 activates both G1 and G3, and both G1 and G3 are transcription factors that activate other genes in the resistance pathway.

So when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 can't be expressed, so no downstream genes are activated, leading to 0% resistance.

When G1 is knocked out, but G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. G3's product activates other genes, but perhaps not as effectively as when both G1 and G3 are present. So the resistance is lower than wild-type but higher than when neither is present.

But according to the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So, when only G3 is present (g1), resistance is higher than when only G1 is present (g3). So this suggests that G3 is less important than G1.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both required for the activation of a downstream gene. So when either is missing, the downstream gene isn't activated as much, leading to lower resistance. But in that case, the double mutant would be more severe than either single.

But in the data, the single mutants have 75% (g1), 50% (g3), and the double is 10%. So the combined effect is worse than either.

So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, but perhaps their functions are additive, not redundant. Because without either, you lose some function, but without both, you lose more.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of separate pathways that contribute to the same phenotype. So each one provides some level of resistance, and together they contribute more.

Wait, but in the data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is lower than either single. So if they were in separate pathways, their combined knockout would have an additive effect. So, for example, if G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%, then their combined knockout would leave 25% (wild-type 100% - 75% = 25% remaining). But the data says 10%, which is less than 25%. So that doesn't fit.

I'm a bit stuck. Let's look at the options and see if any fit.

Options:

A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. Not sure about that. Also, if G1 is a TF, then the earlier assumption that G2 is the TF might not hold. Hmm.

B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would imply they are co-regulated. Not sure. Also, G3 being epistatic would mean that in some double mutant, the G3 mutation masks G1's effect. But in g1g3, the resistance is worse than either, so perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1? Not sure.

C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, G1 epistatic to G3 would mean that in the g1g3 double mutant, the phenotype is same as g1. But the data shows that g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%, so that doesn't fit.

D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy means that each can compensate for the other. So when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either. Which fits the g1g3 data. So G1 and G3 are redundant. But what about the epistatic part?

If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that in the g1g3 double mutant, the phenotype is same as g1. But in our data, the g1g3 is worse than both, so that's not the case. So option D may not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I got the epistatic direction wrong. Epistasis is when one gene's mutation masks the effect of another. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the double mutant, the phenotype would resemble G1 knockout. But in the data, the double mutant is worse than either. So perhaps that's not the case.

Let me look again at the options.

Option A says G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy. But earlier we thought G2 is the TF, so A is probably incorrect.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (so maybe co-regulated), G3 is epistatic to G1. If G3 is epistatic, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g3. But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse than either, so that's not how epistasis works. So B may not fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3. Pleiotropy would mean G1 affects multiple traits, but not sure. If G1 is epistatic, then the double mutant g1g3 should look like g1, but data shows worse, so C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Redundancy fits the g1g3 data. But the epistatic part? If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the double mutant, the phenotype should be same as G1. But if g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%, that doesn't fit. So maybe D isn't correct either.

Wait, perhaps the epistasis part in option D refers to another double mutant. For example, in g2g3, the phenotype is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3. But option D says G1 is epistatic to G3. So perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, let me think. In the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

g2g3: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

g1g3: 10% → worse than either. So no epistasis here; additive or redundant.

So, in this case, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

But looking at the options, none of them directly state that. Let's see the options again.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 have pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic to G1.

But if G1 were the TF, then g1 would have more severe phenotype than g2, which is not the case. So A is incorrect.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so same regulation), G3 is epistatic to G1.

Epistasis would mean that in a double mutant, the effect is same as G3's. But in g1g3, it's worse than either. So B is not correct.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic, G1 epistatic to G3.

Again, in g1g3, the resistance is worse than either, so it's not same as G1 or G3. So C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined knockout is worse than either. So that fits the g1g3 data. But the epistatic part: G1 being epistatic to G3 would mean that in the double mutant, the resistance is same as G1's, but in data, it's worse. So perhaps this option is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the epistatic relationships.

G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 since in any double mutant involving G2, the resistance is same as g2 (0%). So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So which option reflects that?

Looking at the options, none of them explicitly state that G2 is epistatic to both. But let me read the options again.

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. So that's correct for G2 over G1, but not over G3. So perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is epistatic to both.

But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Let me see:

Option A: G1 is a TF → seems unlikely because g1 has 75% resistance, which is less severe than g2's 0%, which would suggest G2 is the TF.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which genes are essential.

The g2 single mutant has 0% resistance, so G2 is essential for resistance. So G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream.

In that case, the pathway is G2 → G1 and G2 → G3.

So, when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 are non-functional → resistance 0%.

In the g1 mutant, G2 is functional, so G3 is expressed. But since G3 is not as effective as both together, the resistance is 75% → so G1 contributes more to resistance than G3.

When G3 is knocked out, G1 is functional, leading to 50% resistance.

When both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is functional, the resistance is 10% → worse than either, suggesting that their functions are additive or redundant.

But since G2 is the TF, and both G1 and G3 are downstream, how does this fit with the options?

Looking back at the options, option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would explain why knocking out both G1 and G3 leads to more severe phenotype (10%). But if G1 is epistatic to G3, their double mutant would resemble G1's phenotype, but instead it's worse than either. So that part doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, which is correct based on the data.

Looking at the options, which one fits that G2 is the TF and epistatic to both G1 and G3?

Option A: G1 is TF, which can't be correct because g1 is not as severe as g2.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (co-regulated), G3 is epistatic to G1.

So, G3 is epistatic to G1 would mean that in the g1g3 double, the resistance is same as G3's (50%). But in data, it's 10%, which is worse. So B is incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

If G1 is epistatic, the g1g3 double would look like G1 (75%), but data says 10%, which is worse. So C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 is epistatic to G3. So in the double mutant, it's worse than either, which fits redundancy. But the epistatic part doesn't fit, because the double isn't the same as G1's.

Wait, perhaps gene redundancy doesn't require the epistatic relationship. So the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

But looking at the options, only option D mentions G2 as TF and redundancy, but it says G1 is epistatic towards G3, which doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe the key is to look at which options correctly describe the data.

The data:

In double mutants involving G2, resistance is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

In the double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So G1 and G3 are additive or redundant.

So, the correct conclusion should be that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking at the options, none seem to directly state that, but let's see.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So, G1 and G3 are redundant (which fits g1g3 data), but G1 being epistatic to G3 would mean that when both are knocked out, the phenotype is same as G1, which isn't the case. So D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the term 'epistatic towards' refers to which gene is upstream. So, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, it means that G1 is upstream, and its function is required for G3's function. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A, but I'm getting confused.

Another approach: let's think about each option's validity.

Option A: G1 is TF. But g1 has 75% resistance, so if G1 is TF, why is the resistance not 0%? It suggests that G1 isn't the TF. So A is incorrect.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter. So they are co-regulated. G3 is epistatic to G1. So in the double mutant, the resistance would be same as G3. But in data, g1g3 is 10% <50% (g3's resistance). So B is incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic. G1 is epistatic to G3. So, in the double mutant g1g3, resistance is same as G1. But data shows worse. So C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 is epistatic to G3. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either, which fits. But the epistatic part doesn't, as the double isn't same as G1. So perhaps D is not correct.

Wait, maybe the key is that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway. So the correct answer would be that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is epistatic to both. But which option reflects that?

Looking at the options, none of the options state that. But option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, the redundancy part is correct, but the epistatic part is not. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the terms. Let's think about what 'show gene redundancy' means. If two genes are redundant, knocking out both leads to a worse phenotype than either single. So that fits g1g3's 10% resistance.

So, in the options, only D mentions redundancy, which is correct for g1g3.

But what about the epistatic part? If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance should be same as G1 or G3, not worse. So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm conflating the concepts. Let me think again.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then each can contribute to the same function. So when both are knocked out, the function is completely lost, leading to the worst phenotype.

In the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than both, so that fits redundancy.

So the correct conclusion is that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is epistatic to both.

But none of the options directly state this. So looking at the options, only D mentions redundancy.

Wait, option D says: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So, the redundancy part is correct, but the epistatic part may not fit. However, the other parts of option D may be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about which option has the correct epistatic relationships.

Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 are redundant, the correct option should reflect that.

But the options don't directly include that. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the only correct option is A, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another approach: the fact that in the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is 0% suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So G2 is upstream.

Which option says that G2 is a TF, which would mean it's upstream and epistatic.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF. No.

Option B: G2 is TF, and G3 is epistatic to G1. So G3 is downstream of G1, but that's conflicting with the data.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 epistatic to G3. So G1 is upstream of G3, but data shows G2 is upstream.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3. So G1 is upstream of G3.

But according to the data, G2 is upstream of both.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the hierarchy. Since G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, it must be upstream. So G2 regulates G1 and G3.

In the data:

g1: 75% → so without G1, G3 is active, giving 75% resistance.

g3: 50% → without G3, G1 is active, giving 50% resistance.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway, with G1 being upstream of G3. So G2 → G1 → G3 → resistance.

But then, in the g1 mutant, G3 wouldn't be expressed, so resistance would be 0%, but the data shows 75% in g1. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Let me try to make a conclusion based on the data.

From the data:

- G2 is essential for resistance (g2 is 0%).

- G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

- G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other, but their combined knockout leads to worse resistance than either single, so their functions are additive or redundant.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are downstream and contribute additively, and G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking at the options, option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. But I'm not sure about the epistatic part.

Wait, another way: if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would result in a worse phenotype than either single. So, that fits g1g3.

In the options, only D mentions redundancy.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D, even though the epistatic part doesn't perfectly fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: the term 'show pleiotropy' in the options. Pleiotropy refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits. It's not directly relevant here, as the question is about gene interactions in a single trait.

So, options A and C can be dismissed because they mention pleiotropy, which isn't relevant.

So, between options B and D.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so co-regulated), G3 is epistatic to G1.

If G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as G3's (50%). But the data says 10%, which is worse.

So B is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Redundancy fits g1g3, but the epistatic part doesn't fit. So perhaps D is incorrect, but it's the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I have to accept that the correct answer is D, even if the epistatic part is not perfect.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm running out of time, so I'll make an educated guess.

The question involves analyzing the interaction of three genes (G1, G2, G3) and their knock-out mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3) to determine their roles in resistance to anthracnose in white lupine. The resistance data provided is as follows:

- **g1**: 75% resistance  
- **g2**: 0% resistance  
- **g3**: 50% resistance  
- **g1g3**: 10% resistance  
- **g2g3**: 0% resistance  
- **g1g2**: 0% resistance  

### Key Observations:
1. **G2 is essential for resistance**: The single mutant **g2** has 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is critical for the resistance pathway. This suggests that G2 may act as a transcription factor upstream of other genes.

2. **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**: In the double mutants **g1g2** and **g2g3**, the resistance is 0%, the same as the single mutant **g2**. This indicates that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning G2 acts upstream of these genes.

3. **G1 and G3 contribute additively or redundantly**: The double mutant **g1g3** has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant **g1** (75%) or **g3** (50%). This suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in a redundant or additive manner, and their combined loss results in a more severe phenotype.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1. This is inconsistent with the data because G2 is the single mutant with 0% resistance, indicating G2, not G1, is the transcription factor. Additionally, there is no evidence of pleiotropy in the data. **Eliminate A**.

- **Option B**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter (co-regulated), and G3 is epistatic to G1. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, the claim that G3 is epistatic to G1 is inconsistent with the data. In the double mutant **g1g3**, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant, indicating that neither gene is epistatic to the other. **Eliminate B**.

- **Option C**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. There is no evidence of pleiotropy in the data, and the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the double mutant **g1g3**, which has a resistance of 10%, worse than either single mutant. **Eliminate C**.

- **Option D**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. While the term "gene redundancy" does not perfectly fit the data (since the combined loss of G1 and G3 results in a worse phenotype than either single mutant), this option aligns most closely with the observations. However, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant **g1g3** does not resemble the phenotype of either single mutant. Despite this, **Option D** is the best fit among the given choices.

### Conclusion:
The data supports the conclusion that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in a redundant manner, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. While the epistatic relationship between G1 and G3 is not fully consistent with the data, **Option D** is the most accurate representation of the observations.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I'm looking at this genetics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about gene interactions involved in disease resistance in white lupine. They did some experiments with knock-out mutants and double mutants.

So, the setup is that they found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They created knockout mutants for each, and also all possible double mutants. The resistance levels of these mutants against anthracnose are given. The goal is to figure out the gene interactions based on these results.

First, let me list out the data again to make it clear:

- g1 (single mutant): 75% resistance. So, their resistance is 75% of the wild-type. That means they're less resistant but not completely susceptible.
- g2 (single mutant): 0% resistance. So, they're completely susceptible. That's a big effect.
- g3 (single mutant): 50% resistance. So, half as resistant as wild-type.
- g1g3 (double mutant): 10% resistance. Very low.
- g2g3: 0% resistance.
- g1g2: 0% resistance.

Hmm, and in the question, it's mentioned that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, likely, one gene is a regulator (like a transcription factor) that activates other genes involved in resistance.

Let me think about what each of these results implies.

Starting with g2: since the single mutant is completely susceptible (0%), that suggests that G2 is critical for resistance. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other resistance genes. Because if G2 is knocked out, all resistance is lost. So, perhaps G2 is upstream of the other genes.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either g1 or g2. Wait, but g2 alone is 0%, so g1g2 is same as g2. Hmm, could that mean that G1 is not involved downstream of G2? Or maybe G2 is epistatic over G1? Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of another gene. If the phenotype of the double mutant is the same as one of the single mutants, that suggests that gene is epistatic.

So, g2's single mutant is 0%, and the g1g2 double is also 0%. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the presence or absence of G1 doesn't change the phenotype when G2 is knocked out. So G2 is acting upstream, perhaps.

Now, what about G3? The single mutant g3 is 50% resistance. The double mutants involving G3 are:

g1g3: 10% resistance.

g2g3: 0% resistance.

Wait, so when G3 is knocked out with G2, they're as susceptible as the g2 mutant. Because g2 and g2g3 are both 0%. But when G3 is knocked out with G1, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%.

So, let's see. If G2 is a transcription factor, maybe G2 activates G3 and possibly G1. Because in the absence of G2, all downstream genes (like G1 and G3) can't be expressed. But wait, when G2 is knocked out, G1 is also not working, but in the double mutant g1g2, it's 0%. So perhaps G1 is downstream of G2 as well.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but they have some redundant functions or additive effects.

Wait, let's consider the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% resistance. So, same as g2. So G1's knockout doesn't add anything beyond G2's knockout. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

g2g3: 0% same as g2. So G3's knockout doesn't change the resistance when G2 is already knocked out. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

And g1g3: 10% resistance. So, this is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So their combined effect is more severe than either single mutant.

Hmm. So what happens when both G1 and G3 are knocked out. Since they aren't epistatic to each other (because the double mutant is worse than either single), perhaps they contribute additively or redundantly.

Wait, redundancy would mean that each can compensate for the other. If both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either alone. That fits with g1g3's 10% resistance, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that suggests that G1 and G3 function redundantly. Because each can partially compensate for the loss of the other.

So, if both are required, but each alone can provide some resistance, then their combined loss would be worse. That's a redundancy situation.

Additionally, the double mutant g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So whether G3 is present or not doesn't matter when G2 is absent. So G2 is upstream of G3. Because G2's function is needed for G3 to function. If G2 is knocked out, G3 cannot contribute, hence the resistance is as low as g2.

Similarly, g1g2 is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is upstream of G1 as well. So G2 is the transcription factor upstream, activating both G1 and G3.

Wait, but what about the situation when G3 is knocked out along with G1? Because in that case, the resistance is 10%, which is even lower than either single (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So their combined knockout is worse. So perhaps G1 and G3 each contribute some function that, when both are missing, the resistance is even lower.

So the possible model is that G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Each of these (G1 and G3) contributes to the resistance, but they might have overlapping functions, so knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

But wait, in the absence of G2, both G1 and G3 are non-functional, but the single mutants (g1 and g3) have partial resistance. So without G2, G1 and G3 can't be expressed, which explains why g2 is 0% (no resistance).

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor for G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would prevent the expression of both. So in the g2 single mutant, G1 and G3 are not expressed, so resistance is gone. But in the double mutants where G2 is present, like in g1g3, perhaps G2 is still active, but G1 and G3 are knocked out. However, the data for g1g3 is 10% resistance, which is lower than either single.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again.

Wait, in the g1 mutant, G1 is knocked out, but G2 and G3 are presumably functional. Similarly, in g3 mutant, G3 is knocked out, but G1 and G2 are okay.

But the resistance of g1 is 75%, which is lower than the wild-type (100%), but higher than g2 (0%). So without G1, the plant is less resistant, but still has some resistance. Similarly, without G3, the resistance is 50%, so it's better than g1 but worse than wild-type.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor for G1 and G3, then in a g2 mutant, G1 and G3 shouldn't be expressed. So the g2 mutant should have the same resistance as a triple mutant (g1g2g3), which would be 0% (since all three are knocked out). But in our data, the g2 single mutant is 0%.

Wait, but the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 are also 0%. So when G2 is non-functional, regardless of the state of G1 or G3, the resistance is 0%. So that suggests that G2 is essential for the function of both G1 and G3. So G2 is upstream of both.

In the case of the double mutant g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present. So in that case, perhaps G2 can activate other genes, but without G1 and G3, the resistance is even lower than either single. So if G2 is present, but G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%. So this indicates that G1 and G3 contribute to the resistance when G2 is active.

So, the model is that G2 is the transcription factor. It activates G1 and G3. Each of these contributes to the resistance, but their functions are additive or redundant. Without G2, the resistance is 0% because neither G1 nor G3 can contribute.

Wait, no. Because when G2 is knocked out (g2), the resistance is 0%. But when G1 is knocked out (g1), the resistance is 75%, which is higher than g2. So that suggests that G2 isn't just activating G1. Because without G2, the resistance is worse than without G1 alone.

Hmm, maybe G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3, but G1 and G3 are also upstream of each other in some way. Or perhaps G2 is the main regulator, but G1 and G3 have some independent functions.

Let me try to think in terms of gene hierarchy. Suppose G2 is the master regulator. It activates G1 and G3. G1 and G3 each contribute to the resistance, but when both are missing, the effect is worse.

So, when only G2 is knocked out, all downstream genes (G1 and G3) are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. When only G1 is knocked out, G3 can still function, but perhaps not as effectively, leading to 75% resistance. Similarly, when G3 is knocked out, G1 can function to some extent (50% resistance).

But wait, that doesn't fit the data because in the absence of G2, the resistance is 0%, but in the absence of G1, it's 75% and for G3 it's 50%. That would suggest that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3, but G1 and G3 are downstream and perhaps function in a redundant or additive manner.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are both required for full resistance, but each contributes partially. So when neither is present (g1g3), resistance is even lower. Let's model this:

Wild-type: 100% resistance.

g1: 75% → so G1 contributes 25% (since 75% is left when G1 is out).

g3: 50% → G3 contributes 50% (since 50% remains when G3 is out).

But when both G1 and G3 are out (g1g3), resistance is 10%. That's less than the sum of their individual contributions (which would be 25 + 50 =75), but perhaps the functions are not additive but synergistic or something else.

Wait, but 75% (g1) + 50% (g3) doesn't directly translate to 10%, which is much lower. So maybe the presence of G1 and G3 are necessary for each other's function, but that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway, where G1 is downstream of G3 or vice versa. But then the double mutant might not be more severe than either single.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. So without G1, you lose 25% of resistance, and without G3, you lose 50%. When both are missing, you lose 75% (100% - 75% = 25%, but the data says 10%). Hmm no, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway. Redundancy means each can perform the same function, so when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than each single. For example, if each contributes 50%, then single knockout would reduce resistance by 50% (so 50% remains). But in our case, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So that suggests that their contributions aren't redundant.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but function additively. So each contributes some level, but they add up. So for example, G1 contributes 25%, G3 contributes 50%, so together they contribute 75%. If G2 is the upstream factor activating both, then in the g2 mutant, both are off → 0% resistance.

In the g1 mutant, G3 is functional, so 50% resistance. But wait, the data says g1 is 75% resistance, which is higher than g3's 50%. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Let me think again. The single mutants:

g1: 75% → so without G1, the resistance is 75% of wild-type. So G1 is not critical, but contributes to some extent.

g2: 0% → G2 is critical.

g3: 50% → G3 is somewhat important.

Hmm. So when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%, which suggests G2 is required for all resistance. So perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates the other genes.

So the model is:

G2 → G1 and G3.

In that case, without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed → 0% resistance.

With G2 present but G1 knocked out, the resistance is determined by G3's function. But in the data, when G1 is knocked out (g1), the resistance is 75%, which is higher than when G3 is knocked out (g3 is 50%). So perhaps G1 contributes more than G3.

Wait, but if G2 is the upstream, then in g2, both G1 and G3 are non-functional. But in g1, G3 is functional, but the resistance is 75%.

Hmm, perhaps G2 is not the only upstream. Maybe G2 is required for G1, but G3 is regulated by another factor. Or perhaps G2 is required for both, and G1 and G3 are not necessarily regulated only by G2.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is a transcription factor as well, but the question states that at least one is a transcription factor. So it could be G2.

Wait, the question says at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So it's possible that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are target genes.

So, G2 → G1 and G3.

In that case, without G2, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So the resistance would depend on both.

In the data:

g1: G2 and G3 are present → So G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. So the resistance is 75% (higher than g3's 50%). So perhaps G3 contributes less than G1. Or maybe G1 and G3 contribute additively.

Wait, but in the g1 mutant, G1 is knocked out, so only G3 is active. If G3 contributes 50% to resistance, then why is g1 75%? Because in that case, when only G3 is present, the resistance should be 50%, but g1 is 75%.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should think in terms of epistatic relationships.

Epistasis is when the phenotype of one gene masks the effect of another. So, in the double mutant, if the phenotype is same as one of the single mutants, that gene is epistatic.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2 → 0% (same as g2). So G2 is epistatic to G1.

g2g3 → 0% (same as g2). So G2 is epistatic to G3.

g1g3 → 10% (worse than either single). So neither is epistatic; their effects add up.

So, the epistasis here tells us that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Because the presence of a mutation in G2 masks the effect of mutations in G1 or G3.

So, the pathway is likely G2 → G1 and G2 → G3.

So, when G2 is non-functional, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute, leading to 0% resistance.

In the single mutants, when G2 is functional:

g1: G2 is okay, so G3 is expressed. So the resistance is determined by G3's contribution. But wait, the g1 mutant has 75% resistance. If G3 is functional in g1, why isn't the resistance higher? Alternatively, perhaps G1 is also contributing.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are both required for the full resistance. So, in the absence of G1, but presence of G3, the resistance is lower than in wild-type but not zero. And vice versa.

Wait, let me think about the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. That's much lower than either single. So perhaps the full resistance requires both G1 and G3.

But wait, the data for the single mutants is g1 at 75% and g3 at 50%. So when G1 is missing, but G3 is present, the resistance is 75%. When G3 is missing but G1 is present, the resistance is 50%. So perhaps G1's function is more significant than G3's.

Hmm, but that doesn't fit with the idea that both are required. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. So, without G1, the pathway through G3 is still active, but less efficient than both working together.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me try to model this with a pathway diagram.

G2 is a transcription factor. It activates both G1 and G3.

G1 and G3 each contribute to the resistance. Perhaps they activate other downstream genes or mechanisms. So G2 is upstream of both, G1 and G3 are parallel pathways.

In that case, the absence of G2 (g2) would shut down both G1 and G3, leading to 0% resistance.

In the absence of G1 (g1), G3 can still function, but perhaps only at half efficiency. So the resistance is 50% of wild-type. But in the data, g1 is 75% resistance. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway. G2 activates G1, which in turn activates G3. But then, the g1 mutant would have 0% resistance, which isn't the case (g1 is 75%).

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps G1 is a transcription factor, and G2 is as well. But the question states that at least one is a transcription factor.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1, which in turn activates G3. So, G2 → G1 → G3.

In that model:

g2: no G2 → G1 not expressed → G3 not expressed → resistance 0%.

g1: no G1 → G3 not expressed → resistance same as if G3 is missing, which would be 50% (as in the data). But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G2 activates both G1 and G3, and both G1 and G3 are transcription factors that activate other genes in the resistance pathway.

So when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 can't be expressed, so no downstream genes are activated, leading to 0% resistance.

When G1 is knocked out, but G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. G3's product activates other genes, but perhaps not as effectively as when both G1 and G3 are present. So the resistance is lower than wild-type but higher than when neither is present.

But according to the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So, when only G3 is present (g1), resistance is higher than when only G1 is present (g3). So this suggests that G3 is less important than G1.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both required for the activation of a downstream gene. So when either is missing, the downstream gene isn't activated as much, leading to lower resistance. But in that case, the double mutant would be more severe than either single.

But in the data, the single mutants have 75% (g1), 50% (g3), and the double is 10%. So the combined effect is worse than either.

So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, but perhaps their functions are additive, not redundant. Because without either, you lose some function, but without both, you lose more.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of separate pathways that contribute to the same phenotype. So each one provides some level of resistance, and together they contribute more.

Wait, but in the data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is lower than either single. So if they were in separate pathways, their combined knockout would have an additive effect. So, for example, if G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%, then their combined knockout would leave 25% (wild-type 100% - 75% = 25% remaining). But the data says 10%, which is less than 25%. So that doesn't fit.

I'm a bit stuck. Let's look at the options and see if any fit.

Options:

A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. Not sure about that. Also, if G1 is a TF, then the earlier assumption that G2 is the TF might not hold. Hmm.

B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would imply they are co-regulated. Not sure. Also, G3 being epistatic would mean that in some double mutant, the G3 mutation masks G1's effect. But in g1g3, the resistance is worse than either, so perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1? Not sure.

C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, G1 epistatic to G3 would mean that in the g1g3 double mutant, the phenotype is same as g1. But the data shows that g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%, so that doesn't fit.

D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy means that each can compensate for the other. So when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either. Which fits the g1g3 data. So G1 and G3 are redundant. But what about the epistatic part?

If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that in the g1g3 double mutant, the phenotype is same as g1. But in our data, the g1g3 is worse than both, so that's not the case. So option D may not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I got the epistatic direction wrong. Epistasis is when one gene's mutation masks the effect of another. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the double mutant, the phenotype would resemble G1 knockout. But in the data, the double mutant is worse than either. So perhaps that's not the case.

Let me look again at the options.

Option A says G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy. But earlier we thought G2 is the TF, so A is probably incorrect.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (so maybe co-regulated), G3 is epistatic to G1. If G3 is epistatic, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g3. But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse than either, so that's not how epistasis works. So B may not fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3. Pleiotropy would mean G1 affects multiple traits, but not sure. If G1 is epistatic, then the double mutant g1g3 should look like g1, but data shows worse, so C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Redundancy fits the g1g3 data. But the epistatic part? If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the double mutant, the phenotype should be same as G1. But if g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%, that doesn't fit. So maybe D isn't correct either.

Wait, perhaps the epistasis part in option D refers to another double mutant. For example, in g2g3, the phenotype is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3. But option D says G1 is epistatic to G3. So perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, let me think. In the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

g2g3: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

g1g3: 10% → worse than either. So no epistasis here; additive or redundant.

So, in this case, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

But looking at the options, none of them directly state that. Let's see the options again.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 have pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic to G1.

But if G1 were the TF, then g1 would have more severe phenotype than g2, which is not the case. So A is incorrect.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so same regulation), G3 is epistatic to G1.

Epistasis would mean that in a double mutant, the effect is same as G3's. But in g1g3, it's worse than either. So B is not correct.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic, G1 epistatic to G3.

Again, in g1g3, the resistance is worse than either, so it's not same as G1 or G3. So C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined knockout is worse than either. So that fits the g1g3 data. But the epistatic part: G1 being epistatic to G3 would mean that in the double mutant, the resistance is same as G1's, but in data, it's worse. So perhaps this option is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the epistatic relationships.

G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 since in any double mutant involving G2, the resistance is same as g2 (0%). So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So which option reflects that?

Looking at the options, none of them explicitly state that G2 is epistatic to both. But let me read the options again.

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. So that's correct for G2 over G1, but not over G3. So perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is epistatic to both.

But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Let me see:

Option A: G1 is a TF → seems unlikely because g1 has 75% resistance, which is less severe than g2's 0%, which would suggest G2 is the TF.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which genes are essential.

The g2 single mutant has 0% resistance, so G2 is essential for resistance. So G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream.

In that case, the pathway is G2 → G1 and G2 → G3.

So, when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 are non-functional → resistance 0%.

In the g1 mutant, G2 is functional, so G3 is expressed. But since G3 is not as effective as both together, the resistance is 75% → so G1 contributes more to resistance than G3.

When G3 is knocked out, G1 is functional, leading to 50% resistance.

When both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is functional, the resistance is 10% → worse than either, suggesting that their functions are additive or redundant.

But since G2 is the TF, and both G1 and G3 are downstream, how does this fit with the options?

Looking back at the options, option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would explain why knocking out both G1 and G3 leads to more severe phenotype (10%). But if G1 is epistatic to G3, their double mutant would resemble G1's phenotype, but instead it's worse than either. So that part doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, which is correct based on the data.

Looking at the options, which one fits that G2 is the TF and epistatic to both G1 and G3?

Option A: G1 is TF, which can't be correct because g1 is not as severe as g2.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (co-regulated), G3 is epistatic to G1.

So, G3 is epistatic to G1 would mean that in the g1g3 double, the resistance is same as G3's (50%). But in data, it's 10%, which is worse. So B is incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

If G1 is epistatic, the g1g3 double would look like G1 (75%), but data says 10%, which is worse. So C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 is epistatic to G3. So in the double mutant, it's worse than either, which fits redundancy. But the epistatic part doesn't fit, because the double isn't the same as G1's.

Wait, perhaps gene redundancy doesn't require the epistatic relationship. So the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

But looking at the options, only option D mentions G2 as TF and redundancy, but it says G1 is epistatic towards G3, which doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe the key is to look at which options correctly describe the data.

The data:

In double mutants involving G2, resistance is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

In the double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So G1 and G3 are additive or redundant.

So, the correct conclusion should be that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking at the options, none seem to directly state that, but let's see.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So, G1 and G3 are redundant (which fits g1g3 data), but G1 being epistatic to G3 would mean that when both are knocked out, the phenotype is same as G1, which isn't the case. So D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the term 'epistatic towards' refers to which gene is upstream. So, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, it means that G1 is upstream, and its function is required for G3's function. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A, but I'm getting confused.

Another approach: let's think about each option's validity.

Option A: G1 is TF. But g1 has 75% resistance, so if G1 is TF, why is the resistance not 0%? It suggests that G1 isn't the TF. So A is incorrect.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter. So they are co-regulated. G3 is epistatic to G1. So in the double mutant, the resistance would be same as G3. But in data, g1g3 is 10% <50% (g3's resistance). So B is incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic. G1 is epistatic to G3. So, in the double mutant g1g3, resistance is same as G1. But data shows worse. So C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 is epistatic to G3. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either, which fits. But the epistatic part doesn't, as the double isn't same as G1. So perhaps D is not correct.

Wait, maybe the key is that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway. So the correct answer would be that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is epistatic to both. But which option reflects that?

Looking at the options, none of the options state that. But option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, the redundancy part is correct, but the epistatic part is not. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the terms. Let's think about what 'show gene redundancy' means. If two genes are redundant, knocking out both leads to a worse phenotype than either single. So that fits g1g3's 10% resistance.

So, in the options, only D mentions redundancy, which is correct for g1g3.

But what about the epistatic part? If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance should be same as G1 or G3, not worse. So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm conflating the concepts. Let me think again.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then each can contribute to the same function. So when both are knocked out, the function is completely lost, leading to the worst phenotype.

In the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than both, so that fits redundancy.

So the correct conclusion is that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is epistatic to both.

But none of the options directly state this. So looking at the options, only D mentions redundancy.

Wait, option D says: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So, the redundancy part is correct, but the epistatic part may not fit. However, the other parts of option D may be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about which option has the correct epistatic relationships.

Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 are redundant, the correct option should reflect that.

But the options don't directly include that. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the only correct option is A, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another approach: the fact that in the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is 0% suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So G2 is upstream.

Which option says that G2 is a TF, which would mean it's upstream and epistatic.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF. No.

Option B: G2 is TF, and G3 is epistatic to G1. So G3 is downstream of G1, but that's conflicting with the data.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 epistatic to G3. So G1 is upstream of G3, but data shows G2 is upstream.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3. So G1 is upstream of G3.

But according to the data, G2 is upstream of both.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the hierarchy. Since G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, it must be upstream. So G2 regulates G1 and G3.

In the data:

g1: 75% → so without G1, G3 is active, giving 75% resistance.

g3: 50% → without G3, G1 is active, giving 50% resistance.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway, with G1 being upstream of G3. So G2 → G1 → G3 → resistance.

But then, in the g1 mutant, G3 wouldn't be expressed, so resistance would be 0%, but the data shows 75% in g1. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Let me try to make a conclusion based on the data.

From the data:

- G2 is essential for resistance (g2 is 0%).

- G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

- G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other, but their combined knockout leads to worse resistance than either single, so their functions are additive or redundant.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are downstream and contribute additively, and G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking at the options, option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. But I'm not sure about the epistatic part.

Wait, another way: if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would result in a worse phenotype than either single. So, that fits g1g3.

In the options, only D mentions redundancy.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D, even though the epistatic part doesn't perfectly fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: the term 'show pleiotropy' in the options. Pleiotropy refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits. It's not directly relevant here, as the question is about gene interactions in a single trait.

So, options A and C can be dismissed because they mention pleiotropy, which isn't relevant.

So, between options B and D.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so co-regulated), G3 is epistatic to G1.

If G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as G3's (50%). But the data says 10%, which is worse.

So B is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Redundancy fits g1g3, but the epistatic part doesn't fit. So perhaps D is incorrect, but it's the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I have to accept that the correct answer is D, even if the epistatic part is not perfect.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm running out of time, so I'll make an educated guess.


The question involves analyzing the interaction of three genes (G1, G2, G3) and their knock-out mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3) to determine their roles in resistance to anthracnose in white lupine. The resistance data provided is as follows:

- **g1**: 75% resistance  
- **g2**: 0% resistance  
- **g3**: 50% resistance  
- **g1g3**: 10% resistance  
- **g2g3**: 0% resistance  
- **g1g2**: 0% resistance  

### Key Observations:
1. **G2 is essential for resistance**: The single mutant **g2** has 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is critical for the resistance pathway. This suggests that G2 may act as a transcription factor upstream of other genes.

2. **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**: In the double mutants **g1g2** and **g2g3**, the resistance is 0%, the same as the single mutant **g2**. This indicates that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning G2 acts upstream of these genes.

3. **G1 and G3 contribute additively or redundantly**: The double mutant **g1g3** has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant **g1** (75%) or **g3** (50%). This suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in a redundant or additive manner, and their combined loss results in a more severe phenotype.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1. This is inconsistent with the data because G2 is the single mutant with 0% resistance, indicating G2, not G1, is the transcription factor. Additionally, there is no evidence of pleiotropy in the data. **Eliminate A**.

- **Option B**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter (co-regulated), and G3 is epistatic to G1. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, the claim that G3 is epistatic to G1 is inconsistent with the data. In the double mutant **g1g3**, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant, indicating that neither gene is epistatic to the other. **Eliminate B**.

- **Option C**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. There is no evidence of pleiotropy in the data, and the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the double mutant **g1g3**, which has a resistance of 10%, worse than either single mutant. **Eliminate C**.

- **Option D**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. While the term "gene redundancy" does not perfectly fit the data (since the combined loss of G1 and G3 results in a worse phenotype than either single mutant), this option aligns most closely with the observations. However, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant **g1g3** does not resemble the phenotype of either single mutant. Despite this, **Option D** is the best fit among the given choices.

### Conclusion:
The data supports the conclusion that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in a redundant manner, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. While the epistatic relationship between G1 and G3 is not fully consistent with the data, **Option D** is the most accurate representation of the observations.

**Answer: D**
