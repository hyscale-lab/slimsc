Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's read through it carefully.

So, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. Each of these compounds is labeled A1 to A5, and they have different properties.

Let me break down the information step by step.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance. It decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 20°C) into A2 and fluorine gas. The oF (I think that's the oxidation state or maybe the formula, but probably oxidation state) of A2 is given as 31.96%. Hmm, wait, oxidation states are typically in a scale where the sum is based on the compound, so 31.96% might refer to the percentage composition of fluorine in A2 by mass. So if A2 has an oF (maybe oxygen-free, but maybe it's the oxidation state of F? Wait, maybe oF stands for the oxidation state of fluorine in A2? Alternatively, maybe it's the mass percent of fluorine in A2. Let me think.

Wait, the question says "ɷF=31,96%". The comma is probably a decimal separator, so 31.96%. So, the percentage by mass of fluorine in A2 is about 31.96%. So, if A2 is a binary compound of Y and F, then we can find its formula.

Then, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so if A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, perhaps it's a high oxidation state fluoride. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so maybe Y is a metal that forms multiple oxidation states.

A3 is another binary compound that can also interact with xenon. So, A3 could be another oxidizing agent or perhaps a reducing agent, but given that A1 is an oxidizer, maybe A3 is similar. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So when Y is fluorinated, perhaps it forms YF, but since there are five binary compounds, Y must have multiple possible oxidation states. For example, if Y is chlorine, it can form ClF, ClF3, etc., but in this case, Y is a different element.

Moving on, by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated colorless solution of A4, we get A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

Wait, let's think about what A4 could be. The solution is colorless and concentrated. Common concentrated solutions of fluorine compounds include things like HClO4 (but that's not a fluorine compound), maybe H2SO4? No, perhaps it's a solution of a fluoride. Alternatively, think about hydrofluoric acid, but that's not a strong solution. Wait, maybe A4 is a binary compound of Y and F, and when Y is added, another compound is formed.

Wait, let's think about possible reactions. If A4 is, say, YF3, and adding Y (metal) might displace F, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps adding Y to a solution of A4 (maybe a salt) could cause a reaction.

Wait, when Y is added to A4 solution, A5 is formed. Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So, maybe A5 is a salt that reacts upon hydrolysis.

Wait, let's try to figure out the elements involved. Since Y forms multiple binary compounds with F, Y is probably a metal that can have several oxidation states. For example, lead can form multiple fluorides, but perhaps it's more likely something like tin or antimony.

Wait, another approach: since A1 oxidizes xenon, which is a noble gas, it's a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizer, so perhaps A1 is YF where Y is in a high oxidation state. When A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. So, the decomposition is:

A1 → A2 + F2

Since A1 is a binary compound (Y and F), and F2 is fluorine gas, perhaps A1 is YF3, which upon decomposition gives YF (A2) and F2. Let's see:

YF3 → YF + F2

Wait, but the stoichiometry would matter. Let's think about the oxidation states. In YF3, F is -1 each, so Y is +3. In A2, if it's YF, F is -1, Y is +1. So in decomposition, Y goes from +3 to +1, which is a reduction (gain of electrons). But fluorine is being produced as F2, which is 0 oxidation state, so F is being oxidized (losing electrons). Wait, that seems contradictory because if Y is reduced, F must be oxidized, which fits with decomposition into F2.

So, if A1 is YF3 (which is a binary compound), it decomposes into YF and F2. The decomposition reaction would be:

2 YF3 → 2 YF + 3 F2

But wait, let's check the fluorine balance. On the left, 2*3=6 F. On the right, 2*1 +3*2=2+6=8 F. That doesn't balance. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition is YF3 → YF2 + F2. Let's check:

YF3 → YF2 + F2

F on left: 3. On right: 2 + 2*2=6. Not balanced.

Alternatively, maybe YF5? Let's see:

2 YF5 → 2 YF + 5 F2

Left F: 2*5=10. Right: 2*1 +5*2=2+10=12. Not balanced.

Hmm, perhaps the decomposition doesn't involve just YF and F2. Alternatively, maybe A2 is another compound. Let's think about the fluorine percentage in A2.

A2 has 31.96% F by mass. Let's say A2 is YF. Then, the molar mass of A2 is M(Y) + 19 (since F is ~19 g/mol).

The percentage of F in YF is (19)/(M(Y) +19) * 100% = 31.96%.

So, let's solve for M(Y):

19/(M +19) = 0.3196
Multiply both sides by (M+19):
19 = 0.3196 * (M +19)
19 /0.3196 ≈ M +19
19 /0.3196 ≈ 59.46 → M ≈ 59.46 -19 = 40.46 g/mol.

40 g/mol is about the atomic weight of calcium (about 40). Wait, but Ca is a group 2 metal. Alternatively, perhaps it's something else. Let's see, 40 is close to Mg (24.3), but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something with a higher atomic weight. Wait, wait, 0.3196 is approximately 32%, so 19/(M+19) = 0.32.

19 /0.32 ≈ 59.375 → M = 59.375 -19 =40.375. Close to 40, which is Ca. But Ca typically forms CaF2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the calculation is off due to rounding.

Wait, 31.96% is exact. Let me compute 19/(M+19) = 0.3196.

So, M+19 = 19 / 0.3196 ≈ 59.44 → M ≈ 59.44 -19 = 40.44 g/mol.

So Y's atomic weight is about 40.44. That's very close to calcium (40.078 g/mol). So Y is calcium? But then, calcium forms CaF2, which is a binary compound. But the problem says five binary compounds are known, which suggests Y forms multiple fluorides. Calcium typically forms CaF2, so maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe Y is another element. Wait, what about lead? Lead has a high atomic weight, but let me see. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, if Y is lead, Pb. The formula of A2 is YF, so PbF. The percentage of F would be 19/(207.2 +19) = 19/226.2 ≈ 8.4%, which is way less than 31.96%. So that doesn't fit. So maybe Y isn't Pb.

Wait, what if A2 is YF3? Then, the formula would be YF3.

Percentage of F would be (3*19)/(M(Y)+3*19) = 57/(M+57) = 0.3196 → 57/(M+57) = 0.3196 → M +57 = 57/0.3196 ≈ 178 → M ≈ 178-57=121. So Y would be around 121 g/mol, which is Te (127.6) or maybe I (126.9). Hmm, but let me check.

Wait, 57/(121+57) =57/(178) =0.3196. That works. So Y would have a molar mass around 121. So perhaps Y is tellurium (Te, ~128) or maybe something else.

Alternatively, maybe A2 is YF2. So:

(2*19)/(M +38) = 0.3196 → 38/(M+38) = 0.3196 → M +38 =38 /0.3196 ≈118.8 → M≈80.8.

So Y would be around 80.8 g/mol. That's close to strontium (Sr, 87.6), but maybe not exact. Alternatively, 80 is close to Pb? No, Pb is much higher. Wait, 80 is near the atomic weight of mercury? No, Hg is 200. Maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps Y is tin (Sn), which has multiple oxidation states.

Wait, tin has several oxidation states, including +2 and +4. So perhaps Y is tin. Let me check for Y as tin.

If Y is tin (Sn, ~118.71 g/mol):

If A2 is SnF2, then the percentage of F would be (2*19)/(118.71 +38)=38/(156.71)≈24.27%, which is lower than 31.96%. So that's not matching.

If A2 is SnF4, then (4*19)/(118.71 +76)=76/(194.71)≈39.03%, which is higher than 31.96%. So that's not matching either.

Hmm, maybe Y isn't tin. Let me go back. Another approach: think about the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2.

If A1 is a binary compound of Y and F, and upon decomposition, F2 is released, maybe A1 has more F atoms than A2. So for example, if A1 is YF3 and A2 is YF, that would mean each Y loses two F (since YF3 → YF + F2). So each Y goes from +3 to +1 oxidation state, which is a reduction (gain of electrons). But F is being oxidized because it's going from -1 in YF3 to 0 in F2.

Wait, but in that case, the overall reaction would be a decomposition where Y is reduced and F is oxidized. That makes sense because F2 is a product.

So, let's write the reaction:

2 YF3 → 2 YF + 3 F2↑

Let me check the F balance:

Left: 2 *3 =6 F.

Right: 2 *1 +3*2=2+6=8 F. So it's not balanced. So that reaction isn't balanced.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is:

3 YF3 → 3 YF + 4 F2

F left: 3*3=9.

F right:3*1 +4*2=3+8=11. Not balanced.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: let's consider the formula of A1. Suppose A1 is YF5. Then, decomposition could produce YF3 and F2.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is YF4, decomposes into YF2 and F2.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about another part of the problem.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So, perhaps A3 is YF, the simplest fluoride. A3 can interact with xenon, which might imply it's a reducing agent, but I'm not sure.

Now, the next part: adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4 gives A5. Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

Hmm. When a metal is added to a solution and a reaction occurs, perhaps it's a displacement reaction or a redox reaction. If the solution is colorless, maybe it's a solution of a salt without any colored ions.

Wait, if A4 is a binary compound (Y and F), perhaps it's YF3. When Y is added, maybe it reacts to form YF and releases something else. Or maybe it's a dissolution reaction.

Wait, another possibility: A4 could be a compound that reacts with Y to form A5, which is a different compound. Then, A5 decomposes in water. Let me think about hydrolysis reactions.

If A5 is a salt that undergoes hydrolysis, like calcium carbide (CaC2) reacting with water to form acetylene and calcium hydroxide. But that's not involving fluorine.

Alternatively, what about a fluoride salt? For example, if A4 is YF3, and adding Y (as metal) could displace F, but perhaps not. Wait, Y as a metal reacting with YF3 solution. That might not make sense because Y metal would typically reduce YF3 to a lower fluoride.

Wait, for example, if Y is calcium (Ca), and A4 is CaF2. Adding Ca metal to CaF2 solution might not react. Alternatively, if A4 is CaF, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a salt of YF4, and adding Y metal produces another fluoride.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a compound that when Y is added, it forms a different compound. Then, when A5 is in water, it decomposes.

Wait, let's think about the decomposition of A5 in water. If A5 is something like YF, which is stable, maybe it doesn't decompose. Alternatively, if A5 is a more complex fluoride, maybe it decomposes into YF and HF, but that's just speculation.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a metal fluoride that reacts with water. For example, potassium fluoride (KF) doesn't react with water, but perhaps a higher fluoride like KF2 (if that exists) might decompose. Alternatively, maybe A5 is a compound that upon hydrolysis forms Y(OH)F or something similar.

Wait, perhaps A5 is YF2, which upon hydrolysis in water would form Y(OH) and HF. So, YF2 + H2O → Y(OH) + 2 HF.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's try to link this to the previous parts.

Earlier, the percentage of F in A2 is about 31.96%. If A2 is YF, and based on the calculation before, Y's atomic weight is about 40. So Y is probably calcium (Ca, ~40 g/mol). Let me test that.

If Y is Ca, then A2 would be CaF. The percentage of F is (19)/(40 +19) =19/59≈32.2%, which is very close to 31.96%. That fits well.

So Y is calcium. Now, let's see if it makes sense with the other compounds.

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into CaF and F2. So, A1 could be CaF3? Or perhaps a different formula.

Wait, Ca typically forms CaF2, which is white, not bright red. Hmm, that's a problem because the question says A1 is bright red. Maybe I'm wrong about Y being Ca.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the bright red substance is not a fluoride but a different compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a different element. Let me think. Fluorine compounds that are red? Fluorine itself is a yellow gas, but some fluorides might be colored. For example, silver fluoride is pale yellow, but perhaps in some cases, other colors.

Alternatively, what if Y is not a metal but another element. Wait, but Y forms binary compounds with F, so it's likely a metal.

Wait, another approach: the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2.

If A1 is YF3, then upon decomposition, it produces YF and F2.

So, 2 YF3 → 2 YF + 3 F2.

But wait, let's check the atomic balance:

Left: 2 Y, 6 F.
Right: 2 Y, 2 F (from YF) + 6 F (from F2) → 8 F.

So F isn't balanced. So maybe the reaction is:

3 YF3 → 3 YF + 4 F2.

F: 9 (left) → 3 + 8 =11 (right). Still not balanced.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is:

4 YF3 → 4 YF + 6 F2.

F: 12 →4 +12 =16. No, not balanced.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

YF5 → YF + 2 F2.

F:5 →1 +4=5. Balanced.

So YF5 → YF + 2 F2.

That works. So A1 would be YF5, A2 would be YF.

In that case, YF5 decomposes into YF and F2.

Then, the percentage of F in YF would be (19)/(M(Y) +19) =31.96%.

So 19/(M+19)=0.3196 → M≈40.44 g/mol.

So Y is around 40, which is Ca. So Y is calcium.

But then, CaF5? Calcium pentafluoride? Does that exist? I'm not sure. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, maybe YF3 is A1. Then, upon decomposition:

2 YF3 → 2 YF + 3 F2.

So, F:6 →2 +6=8. Doesn't balance.

Alternatively, maybe A1 is YF2. Decomposition:

YF2 → Y + F2.

But that's unlikely because Y would go from +2 to 0, and F from -1 to 0. That's a reduction for Y and oxidation for F. It would require Y to be a reducing agent, which may not fit with A1 oxidizing xenon.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is not Ca but another element with a similar atomic weight. Wait, what about titanium? No, Ti has a higher atomic weight. Alternatively, maybe Y is a transition metal with multiple valency states.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about other parts.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So, perhaps A3 is YF, the simplest fluoride. A3 can interact with xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so perhaps A3 is a reducing agent, or it could be a catalyst or something else.

Then, adding Y (metal) to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 gives A5. The solution is colorless, so it's probably not a transition metal salt. So A4 could be a salt like YF3. When Y is added, perhaps it reacts to form YF and something else.

Wait, if A4 is YF3, adding Y metal (Ca) would produce CaF and maybe release F2 or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is HF (hydrofluoric acid), but it's a weak acid and not concentrated as in strong acids. But the solution is colorless, so that's possible. However, adding Ca metal to concentrated HF might cause a reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the reaction when Y is added to A4 solution: 1:1 molar ratio. So maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a salt like CaF2. Adding Ca metal might not react because Ca is already in the compound. But perhaps, in a hot concentrated solution, some reaction occurs.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a different compound. Let me think about the decomposition of A5 in water. If A5 is CaF2, adding water might not decompose it. But perhaps it's another compound.

Wait, another thought: if A4 is a compound that upon reaction with Y produces A5, which is a compound that decomposes in water into two substances, perhaps forming an acid and a base or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe A4 is YF3. When Y is added, it reacts to form YF and HF (but HF is a weak acid). Alternatively, perhaps A5 is YF, but then A5 would just be CaF, which is a stable compound and doesn't decompose.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a more complex salt. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a different compound. Let me think about possible compounds of calcium and fluorine.

Calcium forms CaF2, which is a white solid, insoluble in water. It's a binary compound. But the problem says A4 is a solution, so maybe A4 is a soluble fluoride. Wait, but CaF2 is not very soluble in water.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is not a fluoride but another compound. But wait, the problem says all are binary compounds of fluorine and Y. So A4 must be a Y-F compound.

Wait, perhaps A4 is CaF. But CaF is not very stable; it tends to form CaF2. So maybe A4 is something else.

Another approach: the problem says that A1 is a bright-red substance. I'm not aware of any red calcium fluoride compounds. Maybe Y isn't calcium. Let me think of other elements.

Wait, if Y is potassium (K), but K typically forms KF, which is white. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something else.

Wait, what if Y is lead (Pb)? Let's see. If A2 is PbF, then the F percentage is 19/(207.2+19)=19/226.2≈8.4%, which is way below 31.96%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Another approach: think about the fluorides that are bright red. One such compound is silver(I) fluoride (AgF), which is white, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different metal.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the bright-red substance is not a simple fluoride but a complex or another form. Alternatively, maybe it's a different element entirely.

Wait, maybe Y is chlorine? No, because chlorine is a halogen, and the compounds would be ClF, ClF3, etc. But the problem states that Y is an element that forms five binary compounds with F, so perhaps Y is a transition metal with multiple oxidation states.

Wait, let me think of tin again. Sn can form SnF2 and SnF4. But that's only two compounds, not five. So perhaps Y has more possible oxidation states.

Wait, lead (Pb) can form PbF2, PbF, PbF3, PbF4? I'm not sure about the existence of those, but perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, perhaps Y is aluminum. Aluminum typically forms AlF3, but that's only one binary compound. Not enough.

Wait, perhaps Y is iron. Iron can form FeF2 (iron(II) fluoride) and FeF3 (iron(III) fluoride). That's two, but not five. So maybe Y is a transition metal with more oxidation states.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is sulfur. No, because sulfur and fluorine can form SF4, SF6, etc., but that's a different scenario.

Wait, maybe Y is iodine. I can form IF, IF3, IF5, etc. That gives multiple binary compounds.

Wait, but Y is an element that forms five binary compounds with F. So, if Y is iodine, it can form IF, I2F5, IF3, IF5, maybe others. Let's see: IF, IF3, IF5, and perhaps some others. That might make five.

But wait, the problem states that Y is an element, so it could be a halogen? But then Y would be another halogen, making fluorine compounds, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, but A1 oxidizes xenon, which is a noble gas. If A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, perhaps it's a high oxidation state fluoride. For example, IF5 is a strong oxidizing agent.

Wait, let me consider Y as iodine.

So, if Y is I, then:

A1 could be IF5. It decomposes into A2 and F2.

The reaction would be:

2 IF5 → 2 IF + 5 F2↑

Check fluorine balance: 10 F on left, 2 + 10=12 F on right. Not balanced.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition is:

4 IF5 → 4 IF + 10 F2 → F:20 on left, 4 +20=24 on right. Still not balanced.

Hmm, not working. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is IF3.

Wait, but in any case, let's think about the fluorine percentage in A2.

If Y is I, and A2 is IF, then F% is (19)/(126.9 +19)=19/145.9≈12.99%, which is lower than 31.96%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if A2 is IF3, then F% is (3*19)/(126.9+57)=57/183.9≈31.0%. Close to 31.96%. Hmm, that's close.

Wait, 31.0% vs 31.96%. Maybe it's a calculation approximation.

So if A2 is IF3, then Y is I.

So Y is I, and A2 is IF3.

Wait, but then in the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2, what would A1 be?

If A1 is IF5, then decomposition could be:

2 IF5 → 2 IF3 + F2↑ ?

Wait, let's check fluorine balance.

Left: 2*5=10 F.

Right: 2*3=6 F in IF3 and 2 F in F2 → total 8 F.

So 10 →8. Not balanced.

Hmm. Perhaps the decomposition is:

4 IF5 → 4 IF3 + 5 F2.

F on left:20. Right: 12 (from IF3) +10 (F2) →22. Not balanced.

Not matching. Another approach: perhaps A1 is I2F7, which is a known compound. Let me see:

I2F7 → 2 IF5 + F2?

No, perhaps another decomposition. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition is:

I2F7 → 2 IF3 + F2.

Let me check F:

7*2=14 on left.

Right: 3*2=6 (from 2 IF3) + 2*1=2 (from F2) → total 8.

Nope, not balanced.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a different compound.

Wait, let me think about the percentage again.

If A2 is IF3, then F% is 57/(126.9 +57) =57/183.9≈31%. Which is close to 31.96%, which could be due to rounding.

So Y is I. Then, A1 is a higher fluoride, perhaps I2F7.

When it decomposes, it could form IF3 and F2.

But I'm not sure about the exact reaction. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a different compound.

But given the time I've spent, perhaps I should consider that Y is I.

Then, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So, perhaps A3 is I2F5 or another fluoride.

Then, adding Y (I) in a 1:1 ratio to A4's solution gives A5, which decomposes in water.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the final part: the molecular weight of A4.

We need to find the range in which the molecular weight of A4 falls.

If Y is I and A4 is a binary compound, perhaps it's IF5. The molecular weight of IF5 is 126.9 +5*19=126.9 +95=221.9 g/mol. So that would fall into option B (220-240).

Alternatively, if A4 is another compound, like IF3, molecular weight is 126.9 +3*19=126.9 +57=183.9. So that's in option C (160-180).

Wait, but earlier, when Y was thought to be Ca, with A4 as CaF2, molecular weight is 40 + 2*19=78 g/mol, which falls into option D (110-130). But earlier analysis suggested Y might be Ca based on the F percentage in A2.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, let me try to piece it together again.

If Y is Ca:

A2 is CaF. F% is 32% (close to 31.96%).

A1 is a binary compound that decomposes into CaF and F2. So, A1 could be CaF3, which upon decomposition gives CaF and F2.

But CaF3 is not a common compound; perhaps it's better to think of A1 as CaF2, which doesn't fit because CaF2 is a stable compound and doesn't decompose into CaF and F2 upon heating. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a different element. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the problem says there are five binary compounds of Y and F. So Y must have five different possible combinations, which suggests multiple oxidation states. Metals like tin (Sn) can form SnF2 and SnF4, but that's only two. Lead can form PbF2, PbF, PbF3, and PbF4? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a transition metal with multiple oxidation states, like iron, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is a non-metal. Fluorine can form various compounds with other non-metals, but the problem states Y is an element that forms binary compounds with fluorine, which are five in number. So perhaps Y is O, but O forms OF2 and OF, but that's only two.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is nitrogen. It can form NF3, N2F4, etc. But again, not five.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to focus on the part where I need to find the molecular weight of A4.

If Y is Ca, and A4 is CaF2, molecular weight is 40 + 38=78, which is in option D (110-130?) No, 78 is below 110. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 140-160

B) 220-240

C) 160-180

D) 110-130

Wait, if Y is I, and A4 is IF5 (molecular weight ~222), which falls into option B.

Alternatively, if A4 is another compound like IF3 (183.9), which is option C.

But earlier, when Y was thought to be I, the percentage in A2 didn't fit perfectly, but it was close.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a different element. Let me think of another element.

Wait, what about lead (Pb)? But earlier calculations didn't fit.

Wait, another approach: the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. If A1 is YF3 and A2 is YF, then:

2 YF3 → 2 YF + 3 F2.

But F isn't balanced. So perhaps it's:

4 YF3 → 4 YF + 6 F2.

F: 12 →4 +12=16. So, 4 YF3 →4 YF + 6 F2.

That way, the F is balanced.

So, each YF3 molecule produces YF and F2.

In this case, A2 is YF, which has F% of (19)/(M(Y)+19) =31.96%.

So, M(Y)=40.44 g/mol.

So Y is about 40.44, which is Ca.

So A4 would be CaF2, which has molecular weight 40 + 2*19=78 g/mol. But that's below the lowest option (110-130). So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps Y isn't Ca. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming Y is Ca.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A2 is YF3, and the F% is (3*19)/(M(Y) +57)=57/(M+57)=0.3196.

So, 57/(M+57)=0.3196 → M+57=57/0.3196≈178 → M≈121 g/mol.

So Y is about 121, which is tellurium (Te, ~128). Close enough.

So Y is Te.

Then, A2 is TeF3.

F% is (3*19)/(128 +57)=57/185≈30.86%, which is close to 31.96%. Hmm, not exact, but perhaps acceptable.

So, Y is Te.

Then, A1 is TeF5, which upon decomposition gives TeF3 and F2.

So, the reaction would be:

2 TeF5 → 2 TeF3 + 5 F2.

Check F balance: 10 →6 +10=16. Not balanced.

Alternatively, perhaps 4 TeF5 →4 TeF3 + 10 F2.

F:20 →12 +20=32. Not balanced.

Hmm, maybe another approach: 2 TeF5 → TeF2 + 5 F2 + Te.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

TeF5 → TeF3 + F2.

But let's not get stuck on this. Let's proceed.

If Y is Te, then A4 would be a binary compound of Te and F. Let's say A4 is TeF4.

Molecular weight of TeF4: 128 +4*19=128+76=204 g/mol. That falls into option B (220-240) No, 204 is between 180 and 220, so not in the given options. Hmm.

Alternatively, if A4 is TeF6, molecular weight is 128 +6*19=128+114=242. That's in option B (220-240).

But I'm not sure what A4 is exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is TeF2. Molecular weight:128 +38=166. Which falls into option C (160-180).

But then, when Y (Te) is added in a 1:1 ratio to A4's solution, perhaps it reacts to form TeF and something else.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is TeF3. Molecular weight:128 +57=185, which is in option C.

Hmm.

But I'm not confident about this. Another approach: let's think about the hydrolysis of A5.

If A5 is a fluoride that decomposes in water into two substances, perhaps it's a salt that hydrolyzes. For example, if A5 is NaF, it doesn't react. If it's something like CaF2, it's insoluble. Alternatively, perhaps A5 is NH4F, which can hydrolyze to NH3 and HF, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A5 is a compound like AlF3, which hydrolyzes to Al(OH)3 and HF.

But without knowing A4, it's hard to say.

Given the time I've invested, I think Y is likely to be Te, leading A4 to have a molecular weight around 185 (if it's TeF3), which is in option C. Alternatively, if A4 is TeF4 (204), which is close to option B's lower end.

Wait, but the options don't include 204-220. Option B is 220-240. So 204 is below that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is another element. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, perhaps Y is lead (Pb), which has an atomic weight of ~207.

If A2 is PbF, then F% is 19/(207 +19)=19/226≈8.4%, which is way too low.

Alternatively, if A2 is PbF2, F% is 38/(207+38)=38/245≈15.5%, which is still too low.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is a transition metal with multiple fluorides. For example, molybdenum can form several fluorides, but I'm not sure about the exact count.

But without more information, perhaps the best approach is to go back to the initial calculation.

If Y is I (molecular weight ~127), and A4 is IF5 (molecular weight 222), which is in option B (220-240). Alternatively, if A4 is IF3 (183.9), which is in option C.

But earlier, when Y was I, A2 would be IF3, giving F% of 31%, which is close to 31.96%.

So, perhaps Y is I, A4 is IF5, molecular weight 222, option B.

But wait, the problem says there are five binary compounds. Iodine forms IF, I2F5, IF3, IF5, and maybe others, so that's five.

Thus, I think Y is I, A4 is IF5, molecular weight 222. So the correct option is B (220-240).


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the molecular weight range of compound A4, given that Y forms five binary compounds with fluorine. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Key Information and Initial Assumptions**:  
   - A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 (with 31.96% fluorine by mass) and fluorine gas (F₂).  
   - A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating it is a strong oxidizing agent.  
   - A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y and can also interact with xenon.  
   - A4 is a binary compound of Y and fluorine. Adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4 produces A5, which decomposes in water into two substances.  

2. **Determining Y**:  
   - The percentage of fluorine in A2 is 31.96%. Assuming A2 is YF, the formula for the percentage of fluorine is:  
     \[
     \frac{19}{M(Y) + 19} \times 100 = 31.96
     \]  
     Solving for \( M(Y) \), the atomic mass of Y is approximately 40.44 g/mol, which is close to the atomic mass of calcium (Ca, 40.078 g/mol). However, calcium forms only a few fluorides, making it less likely.  
   - Considering other elements, iodine (I) is identified as a plausible candidate. Iodine forms multiple fluorides (e.g., IF, IF₃, IF₅, I₂F₇, I₂F₉), satisfying the condition of five binary compounds with fluorine.  

3. **Verification of Y as Iodine**:  
   - If Y is iodine, A2 could be IF₃. The percentage of fluorine in IF₃ is:  
     \[
     \frac{3 \times 19}{126.9 + 57} \times 100 \approx 31\%
     \]  
     This is close to the given 31.96%, supporting the identification of Y as iodine.  

4. **Decomposition of A1**:  
   - A1 is likely a higher fluoride of iodine, such as I₂F₉ or IF₅, which decomposes into A2 (e.g., IF₃) and F₂.  

5. **Identifying A4**:  
   - A4 is a binary compound of iodine and fluorine. A plausible candidate is IF₅, with a molecular weight of:  
     \[
     M(I) + 5 \times M(F) = 126.9 + 5 \times 19 = 221.9 \, \text{g/mol}.
     \]  
     This falls within the range of 220-240.  

6. **Conclusion**:  
   - Based on the analysis, Y is identified as iodine, and A4 is likely IF₅. The molecular weight of A4 falls within the range of 220-240.

**Answer: B**

Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's read through it carefully.

So, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. Each of these compounds is labeled A1 to A5, and they have different properties.

Let me break down the information step by step.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance. It decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 20°C) into A2 and fluorine gas. The oF (I think that's the oxidation state or maybe the formula, but probably oxidation state) of A2 is given as 31.96%. Hmm, wait, oxidation states are typically in a scale where the sum is based on the compound, so 31.96% might refer to the percentage composition of fluorine in A2 by mass. So if A2 has an oF (maybe oxygen-free, but maybe it's the oxidation state of F? Wait, maybe oF stands for the oxidation state of fluorine in A2? Alternatively, maybe it's the mass percent of fluorine in A2. Let me think.

Wait, the question says "ɷF=31,96%". The comma is probably a decimal separator, so 31.96%. So, the percentage by mass of fluorine in A2 is about 31.96%. So, if A2 is a binary compound of Y and F, then we can find its formula.

Then, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so if A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, perhaps it's a high oxidation state fluoride. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so maybe Y is a metal that forms multiple oxidation states.

A3 is another binary compound that can also interact with xenon. So, A3 could be another oxidizing agent or perhaps a reducing agent, but given that A1 is an oxidizer, maybe A3 is similar. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So when Y is fluorinated, perhaps it forms YF, but since there are five binary compounds, Y must have multiple possible oxidation states. For example, if Y is chlorine, it can form ClF, ClF3, etc., but in this case, Y is a different element.

Moving on, by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated colorless solution of A4, we get A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

Wait, let's think about what A4 could be. The solution is colorless and concentrated. Common concentrated solutions of fluorine compounds include things like HClO4 (but that's not a fluorine compound), maybe H2SO4? No, perhaps it's a solution of a fluoride. Alternatively, think about hydrofluoric acid, but that's not a strong solution. Wait, maybe A4 is a binary compound of Y and F, and when Y is added, another compound is formed.

Wait, let's think about possible reactions. If A4 is, say, YF3, and adding Y (metal) might displace F, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps adding Y to a solution of A4 (maybe a salt) could cause a reaction.

Wait, when Y is added to A4 solution, A5 is formed. Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So, maybe A5 is a salt that reacts upon hydrolysis.

Wait, let's try to figure out the elements involved. Since Y forms multiple binary compounds with F, Y is probably a metal that can have several oxidation states. For example, lead can form multiple fluorides, but perhaps it's more likely something like tin or antimony.

Wait, another approach: since A1 oxidizes xenon, which is a noble gas, it's a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizer, so perhaps A1 is YF where Y is in a high oxidation state. When A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. So, the decomposition is:

A1 → A2 + F2

Since A1 is a binary compound (Y and F), and F2 is fluorine gas, perhaps A1 is YF3, which upon decomposition gives YF (A2) and F2. Let's see:

YF3 → YF + F2

Wait, but the stoichiometry would matter. Let's think about the oxidation states. In YF3, F is -1 each, so Y is +3. In A2, if it's YF, F is -1, Y is +1. So in decomposition, Y goes from +3 to +1, which is a reduction (gain of electrons). But fluorine is being produced as F2, which is 0 oxidation state, so F is being oxidized (losing electrons). Wait, that seems contradictory because if Y is reduced, F must be oxidized, which fits with decomposition into F2.

So, if A1 is YF3 (which is a binary compound), it decomposes into YF and F2. The decomposition reaction would be:

2 YF3 → 2 YF + 3 F2

But wait, let's check the fluorine balance. On the left, 2*3=6 F. On the right, 2*1 +3*2=2+6=8 F. That doesn't balance. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition is YF3 → YF2 + F2. Let's check:

YF3 → YF2 + F2

F on left: 3. On right: 2 + 2*2=6. Not balanced.

Alternatively, maybe YF5? Let's see:

2 YF5 → 2 YF + 5 F2

Left F: 2*5=10. Right: 2*1 +5*2=2+10=12. Not balanced.

Hmm, perhaps the decomposition doesn't involve just YF and F2. Alternatively, maybe A2 is another compound. Let's think about the fluorine percentage in A2.

A2 has 31.96% F by mass. Let's say A2 is YF. Then, the molar mass of A2 is M(Y) + 19 (since F is ~19 g/mol).

The percentage of F in YF is (19)/(M(Y) +19) * 100% = 31.96%.

So, let's solve for M(Y):

19/(M +19) = 0.3196
Multiply both sides by (M+19):
19 = 0.3196 * (M +19)
19 /0.3196 ≈ M +19
19 /0.3196 ≈ 59.46 → M ≈ 59.46 -19 = 40.46 g/mol.

40 g/mol is about the atomic weight of calcium (about 40). Wait, but Ca is a group 2 metal. Alternatively, perhaps it's something else. Let's see, 40 is close to Mg (24.3), but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something with a higher atomic weight. Wait, wait, 0.3196 is approximately 32%, so 19/(M+19) = 0.32.

19 /0.32 ≈ 59.375 → M = 59.375 -19 =40.375. Close to 40, which is Ca. But Ca typically forms CaF2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the calculation is off due to rounding.

Wait, 31.96% is exact. Let me compute 19/(M+19) = 0.3196.

So, M+19 = 19 / 0.3196 ≈ 59.44 → M ≈ 59.44 -19 = 40.44 g/mol.

So Y's atomic weight is about 40.44. That's very close to calcium (40.078 g/mol). So Y is calcium? But then, calcium forms CaF2, which is a binary compound. But the problem says five binary compounds are known, which suggests Y forms multiple fluorides. Calcium typically forms CaF2, so maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe Y is another element. Wait, what about lead? Lead has a high atomic weight, but let me see. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, if Y is lead, Pb. The formula of A2 is YF, so PbF. The percentage of F would be 19/(207.2 +19) = 19/226.2 ≈ 8.4%, which is way less than 31.96%. So that doesn't fit. So maybe Y isn't Pb.

Wait, what if A2 is YF3? Then, the formula would be YF3.

Percentage of F would be (3*19)/(M(Y)+3*19) = 57/(M+57) = 0.3196 → 57/(M+57) = 0.3196 → M +57 = 57/0.3196 ≈ 178 → M ≈ 178-57=121. So Y would be around 121 g/mol, which is Te (127.6) or maybe I (126.9). Hmm, but let me check.

Wait, 57/(121+57) =57/(178) =0.3196. That works. So Y would have a molar mass around 121. So perhaps Y is tellurium (Te, ~128) or maybe something else.

Alternatively, maybe A2 is YF2. So:

(2*19)/(M +38) = 0.3196 → 38/(M+38) = 0.3196 → M +38 =38 /0.3196 ≈118.8 → M≈80.8.

So Y would be around 80.8 g/mol. That's close to strontium (Sr, 87.6), but maybe not exact. Alternatively, 80 is close to Pb? No, Pb is much higher. Wait, 80 is near the atomic weight of mercury? No, Hg is 200. Maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps Y is tin (Sn), which has multiple oxidation states.

Wait, tin has several oxidation states, including +2 and +4. So perhaps Y is tin. Let me check for Y as tin.

If Y is tin (Sn, ~118.71 g/mol):

If A2 is SnF2, then the percentage of F would be (2*19)/(118.71 +38)=38/(156.71)≈24.27%, which is lower than 31.96%. So that's not matching.

If A2 is SnF4, then (4*19)/(118.71 +76)=76/(194.71)≈39.03%, which is higher than 31.96%. So that's not matching either.

Hmm, maybe Y isn't tin. Let me go back. Another approach: think about the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2.

If A1 is a binary compound of Y and F, and upon decomposition, F2 is released, maybe A1 has more F atoms than A2. So for example, if A1 is YF3 and A2 is YF, that would mean each Y loses two F (since YF3 → YF + F2). So each Y goes from +3 to +1 oxidation state, which is a reduction (gain of electrons). But F is being oxidized because it's going from -1 in YF3 to 0 in F2.

Wait, but in that case, the overall reaction would be a decomposition where Y is reduced and F is oxidized. That makes sense because F2 is a product.

So, let's write the reaction:

2 YF3 → 2 YF + 3 F2↑

Let me check the F balance:

Left: 2 *3 =6 F.

Right: 2 *1 +3*2=2+6=8 F. So it's not balanced. So that reaction isn't balanced.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is:

3 YF3 → 3 YF + 4 F2

F left: 3*3=9.

F right:3*1 +4*2=3+8=11. Not balanced.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: let's consider the formula of A1. Suppose A1 is YF5. Then, decomposition could produce YF3 and F2.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is YF4, decomposes into YF2 and F2.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about another part of the problem.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So, perhaps A3 is YF, the simplest fluoride. A3 can interact with xenon, which might imply it's a reducing agent, but I'm not sure.

Now, the next part: adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4 gives A5. Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

Hmm. When a metal is added to a solution and a reaction occurs, perhaps it's a displacement reaction or a redox reaction. If the solution is colorless, maybe it's a solution of a salt without any colored ions.

Wait, if A4 is a binary compound (Y and F), perhaps it's YF3. When Y is added, maybe it reacts to form YF and releases something else. Or maybe it's a dissolution reaction.

Wait, another possibility: A4 could be a compound that reacts with Y to form A5, which is a different compound. Then, A5 decomposes in water. Let me think about hydrolysis reactions.

If A5 is a salt that undergoes hydrolysis, like calcium carbide (CaC2) reacting with water to form acetylene and calcium hydroxide. But that's not involving fluorine.

Alternatively, what about a fluoride salt? For example, if A4 is YF3, and adding Y (as metal) could displace F, but perhaps not. Wait, Y as a metal reacting with YF3 solution. That might not make sense because Y metal would typically reduce YF3 to a lower fluoride.

Wait, for example, if Y is calcium (Ca), and A4 is CaF2. Adding Ca metal to CaF2 solution might not react. Alternatively, if A4 is CaF, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a salt of YF4, and adding Y metal produces another fluoride.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a compound that when Y is added, it forms a different compound. Then, when A5 is in water, it decomposes.

Wait, let's think about the decomposition of A5 in water. If A5 is something like YF, which is stable, maybe it doesn't decompose. Alternatively, if A5 is a more complex fluoride, maybe it decomposes into YF and HF, but that's just speculation.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a metal fluoride that reacts with water. For example, potassium fluoride (KF) doesn't react with water, but perhaps a higher fluoride like KF2 (if that exists) might decompose. Alternatively, maybe A5 is a compound that upon hydrolysis forms Y(OH)F or something similar.

Wait, perhaps A5 is YF2, which upon hydrolysis in water would form Y(OH) and HF. So, YF2 + H2O → Y(OH) + 2 HF.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's try to link this to the previous parts.

Earlier, the percentage of F in A2 is about 31.96%. If A2 is YF, and based on the calculation before, Y's atomic weight is about 40. So Y is probably calcium (Ca, ~40 g/mol). Let me test that.

If Y is Ca, then A2 would be CaF. The percentage of F is (19)/(40 +19) =19/59≈32.2%, which is very close to 31.96%. That fits well.

So Y is calcium. Now, let's see if it makes sense with the other compounds.

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into CaF and F2. So, A1 could be CaF3? Or perhaps a different formula.

Wait, Ca typically forms CaF2, which is white, not bright red. Hmm, that's a problem because the question says A1 is bright red. Maybe I'm wrong about Y being Ca.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the bright red substance is not a fluoride but a different compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a different element. Let me think. Fluorine compounds that are red? Fluorine itself is a yellow gas, but some fluorides might be colored. For example, silver fluoride is pale yellow, but perhaps in some cases, other colors.

Alternatively, what if Y is not a metal but another element. Wait, but Y forms binary compounds with F, so it's likely a metal.

Wait, another approach: the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2.

If A1 is YF3, then upon decomposition, it produces YF and F2.

So, 2 YF3 → 2 YF + 3 F2.

But wait, let's check the atomic balance:

Left: 2 Y, 6 F.
Right: 2 Y, 2 F (from YF) + 6 F (from F2) → 8 F.

So F isn't balanced. So maybe the reaction is:

3 YF3 → 3 YF + 4 F2.

F: 9 (left) → 3 + 8 =11 (right). Still not balanced.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is:

4 YF3 → 4 YF + 6 F2.

F: 12 →4 +12 =16. No, not balanced.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

YF5 → YF + 2 F2.

F:5 →1 +4=5. Balanced.

So YF5 → YF + 2 F2.

That works. So A1 would be YF5, A2 would be YF.

In that case, YF5 decomposes into YF and F2.

Then, the percentage of F in YF would be (19)/(M(Y) +19) =31.96%.

So 19/(M+19)=0.3196 → M≈40.44 g/mol.

So Y is around 40, which is Ca. So Y is calcium.

But then, CaF5? Calcium pentafluoride? Does that exist? I'm not sure. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, maybe YF3 is A1. Then, upon decomposition:

2 YF3 → 2 YF + 3 F2.

So, F:6 →2 +6=8. Doesn't balance.

Alternatively, maybe A1 is YF2. Decomposition:

YF2 → Y + F2.

But that's unlikely because Y would go from +2 to 0, and F from -1 to 0. That's a reduction for Y and oxidation for F. It would require Y to be a reducing agent, which may not fit with A1 oxidizing xenon.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is not Ca but another element with a similar atomic weight. Wait, what about titanium? No, Ti has a higher atomic weight. Alternatively, maybe Y is a transition metal with multiple valency states.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about other parts.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So, perhaps A3 is YF, the simplest fluoride. A3 can interact with xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so perhaps A3 is a reducing agent, or it could be a catalyst or something else.

Then, adding Y (metal) to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 gives A5. The solution is colorless, so it's probably not a transition metal salt. So A4 could be a salt like YF3. When Y is added, perhaps it reacts to form YF and something else.

Wait, if A4 is YF3, adding Y metal (Ca) would produce CaF and maybe release F2 or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is HF (hydrofluoric acid), but it's a weak acid and not concentrated as in strong acids. But the solution is colorless, so that's possible. However, adding Ca metal to concentrated HF might cause a reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the reaction when Y is added to A4 solution: 1:1 molar ratio. So maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a salt like CaF2. Adding Ca metal might not react because Ca is already in the compound. But perhaps, in a hot concentrated solution, some reaction occurs.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a different compound. Let me think about the decomposition of A5 in water. If A5 is CaF2, adding water might not decompose it. But perhaps it's another compound.

Wait, another thought: if A4 is a compound that upon reaction with Y produces A5, which is a compound that decomposes in water into two substances, perhaps forming an acid and a base or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe A4 is YF3. When Y is added, it reacts to form YF and HF (but HF is a weak acid). Alternatively, perhaps A5 is YF, but then A5 would just be CaF, which is a stable compound and doesn't decompose.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a more complex salt. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a different compound. Let me think about possible compounds of calcium and fluorine.

Calcium forms CaF2, which is a white solid, insoluble in water. It's a binary compound. But the problem says A4 is a solution, so maybe A4 is a soluble fluoride. Wait, but CaF2 is not very soluble in water.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is not a fluoride but another compound. But wait, the problem says all are binary compounds of fluorine and Y. So A4 must be a Y-F compound.

Wait, perhaps A4 is CaF. But CaF is not very stable; it tends to form CaF2. So maybe A4 is something else.

Another approach: the problem says that A1 is a bright-red substance. I'm not aware of any red calcium fluoride compounds. Maybe Y isn't calcium. Let me think of other elements.

Wait, if Y is potassium (K), but K typically forms KF, which is white. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something else.

Wait, what if Y is lead (Pb)? Let's see. If A2 is PbF, then the F percentage is 19/(207.2+19)=19/226.2≈8.4%, which is way below 31.96%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Another approach: think about the fluorides that are bright red. One such compound is silver(I) fluoride (AgF), which is white, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different metal.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the bright-red substance is not a simple fluoride but a complex or another form. Alternatively, maybe it's a different element entirely.

Wait, maybe Y is chlorine? No, because chlorine is a halogen, and the compounds would be ClF, ClF3, etc. But the problem states that Y is an element that forms five binary compounds with F, so perhaps Y is a transition metal with multiple oxidation states.

Wait, let me think of tin again. Sn can form SnF2 and SnF4. But that's only two compounds, not five. So perhaps Y has more possible oxidation states.

Wait, lead (Pb) can form PbF2, PbF, PbF3, PbF4? I'm not sure about the existence of those, but perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, perhaps Y is aluminum. Aluminum typically forms AlF3, but that's only one binary compound. Not enough.

Wait, perhaps Y is iron. Iron can form FeF2 (iron(II) fluoride) and FeF3 (iron(III) fluoride). That's two, but not five. So maybe Y is a transition metal with more oxidation states.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is sulfur. No, because sulfur and fluorine can form SF4, SF6, etc., but that's a different scenario.

Wait, maybe Y is iodine. I can form IF, IF3, IF5, etc. That gives multiple binary compounds.

Wait, but Y is an element that forms five binary compounds with F. So, if Y is iodine, it can form IF, I2F5, IF3, IF5, maybe others. Let's see: IF, IF3, IF5, and perhaps some others. That might make five.

But wait, the problem states that Y is an element, so it could be a halogen? But then Y would be another halogen, making fluorine compounds, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, but A1 oxidizes xenon, which is a noble gas. If A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, perhaps it's a high oxidation state fluoride. For example, IF5 is a strong oxidizing agent.

Wait, let me consider Y as iodine.

So, if Y is I, then:

A1 could be IF5. It decomposes into A2 and F2.

The reaction would be:

2 IF5 → 2 IF + 5 F2↑

Check fluorine balance: 10 F on left, 2 + 10=12 F on right. Not balanced.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition is:

4 IF5 → 4 IF + 10 F2 → F:20 on left, 4 +20=24 on right. Still not balanced.

Hmm, not working. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is IF3.

Wait, but in any case, let's think about the fluorine percentage in A2.

If Y is I, and A2 is IF, then F% is (19)/(126.9 +19)=19/145.9≈12.99%, which is lower than 31.96%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if A2 is IF3, then F% is (3*19)/(126.9+57)=57/183.9≈31.0%. Close to 31.96%. Hmm, that's close.

Wait, 31.0% vs 31.96%. Maybe it's a calculation approximation.

So if A2 is IF3, then Y is I.

So Y is I, and A2 is IF3.

Wait, but then in the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2, what would A1 be?

If A1 is IF5, then decomposition could be:

2 IF5 → 2 IF3 + F2↑ ?

Wait, let's check fluorine balance.

Left: 2*5=10 F.

Right: 2*3=6 F in IF3 and 2 F in F2 → total 8 F.

So 10 →8. Not balanced.

Hmm. Perhaps the decomposition is:

4 IF5 → 4 IF3 + 5 F2.

F on left:20. Right: 12 (from IF3) +10 (F2) →22. Not balanced.

Not matching. Another approach: perhaps A1 is I2F7, which is a known compound. Let me see:

I2F7 → 2 IF5 + F2?

No, perhaps another decomposition. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition is:

I2F7 → 2 IF3 + F2.

Let me check F:

7*2=14 on left.

Right: 3*2=6 (from 2 IF3) + 2*1=2 (from F2) → total 8.

Nope, not balanced.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a different compound.

Wait, let me think about the percentage again.

If A2 is IF3, then F% is 57/(126.9 +57) =57/183.9≈31%. Which is close to 31.96%, which could be due to rounding.

So Y is I. Then, A1 is a higher fluoride, perhaps I2F7.

When it decomposes, it could form IF3 and F2.

But I'm not sure about the exact reaction. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a different compound.

But given the time I've spent, perhaps I should consider that Y is I.

Then, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So, perhaps A3 is I2F5 or another fluoride.

Then, adding Y (I) in a 1:1 ratio to A4's solution gives A5, which decomposes in water.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the final part: the molecular weight of A4.

We need to find the range in which the molecular weight of A4 falls.

If Y is I and A4 is a binary compound, perhaps it's IF5. The molecular weight of IF5 is 126.9 +5*19=126.9 +95=221.9 g/mol. So that would fall into option B (220-240).

Alternatively, if A4 is another compound, like IF3, molecular weight is 126.9 +3*19=126.9 +57=183.9. So that's in option C (160-180).

Wait, but earlier, when Y was thought to be Ca, with A4 as CaF2, molecular weight is 40 + 2*19=78 g/mol, which falls into option D (110-130). But earlier analysis suggested Y might be Ca based on the F percentage in A2.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, let me try to piece it together again.

If Y is Ca:

A2 is CaF. F% is 32% (close to 31.96%).

A1 is a binary compound that decomposes into CaF and F2. So, A1 could be CaF3, which upon decomposition gives CaF and F2.

But CaF3 is not a common compound; perhaps it's better to think of A1 as CaF2, which doesn't fit because CaF2 is a stable compound and doesn't decompose into CaF and F2 upon heating. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a different element. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the problem says there are five binary compounds of Y and F. So Y must have five different possible combinations, which suggests multiple oxidation states. Metals like tin (Sn) can form SnF2 and SnF4, but that's only two. Lead can form PbF2, PbF, PbF3, and PbF4? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a transition metal with multiple oxidation states, like iron, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is a non-metal. Fluorine can form various compounds with other non-metals, but the problem states Y is an element that forms binary compounds with fluorine, which are five in number. So perhaps Y is O, but O forms OF2 and OF, but that's only two.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is nitrogen. It can form NF3, N2F4, etc. But again, not five.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to focus on the part where I need to find the molecular weight of A4.

If Y is Ca, and A4 is CaF2, molecular weight is 40 + 38=78, which is in option D (110-130?) No, 78 is below 110. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 140-160

B) 220-240

C) 160-180

D) 110-130

Wait, if Y is I, and A4 is IF5 (molecular weight ~222), which falls into option B.

Alternatively, if A4 is another compound like IF3 (183.9), which is option C.

But earlier, when Y was thought to be I, the percentage in A2 didn't fit perfectly, but it was close.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a different element. Let me think of another element.

Wait, what about lead (Pb)? But earlier calculations didn't fit.

Wait, another approach: the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. If A1 is YF3 and A2 is YF, then:

2 YF3 → 2 YF + 3 F2.

But F isn't balanced. So perhaps it's:

4 YF3 → 4 YF + 6 F2.

F: 12 →4 +12=16. So, 4 YF3 →4 YF + 6 F2.

That way, the F is balanced.

So, each YF3 molecule produces YF and F2.

In this case, A2 is YF, which has F% of (19)/(M(Y)+19) =31.96%.

So, M(Y)=40.44 g/mol.

So Y is about 40.44, which is Ca.

So A4 would be CaF2, which has molecular weight 40 + 2*19=78 g/mol. But that's below the lowest option (110-130). So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps Y isn't Ca. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming Y is Ca.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A2 is YF3, and the F% is (3*19)/(M(Y) +57)=57/(M+57)=0.3196.

So, 57/(M+57)=0.3196 → M+57=57/0.3196≈178 → M≈121 g/mol.

So Y is about 121, which is tellurium (Te, ~128). Close enough.

So Y is Te.

Then, A2 is TeF3.

F% is (3*19)/(128 +57)=57/185≈30.86%, which is close to 31.96%. Hmm, not exact, but perhaps acceptable.

So, Y is Te.

Then, A1 is TeF5, which upon decomposition gives TeF3 and F2.

So, the reaction would be:

2 TeF5 → 2 TeF3 + 5 F2.

Check F balance: 10 →6 +10=16. Not balanced.

Alternatively, perhaps 4 TeF5 →4 TeF3 + 10 F2.

F:20 →12 +20=32. Not balanced.

Hmm, maybe another approach: 2 TeF5 → TeF2 + 5 F2 + Te.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

TeF5 → TeF3 + F2.

But let's not get stuck on this. Let's proceed.

If Y is Te, then A4 would be a binary compound of Te and F. Let's say A4 is TeF4.

Molecular weight of TeF4: 128 +4*19=128+76=204 g/mol. That falls into option B (220-240) No, 204 is between 180 and 220, so not in the given options. Hmm.

Alternatively, if A4 is TeF6, molecular weight is 128 +6*19=128+114=242. That's in option B (220-240).

But I'm not sure what A4 is exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is TeF2. Molecular weight:128 +38=166. Which falls into option C (160-180).

But then, when Y (Te) is added in a 1:1 ratio to A4's solution, perhaps it reacts to form TeF and something else.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is TeF3. Molecular weight:128 +57=185, which is in option C.

Hmm.

But I'm not confident about this. Another approach: let's think about the hydrolysis of A5.

If A5 is a fluoride that decomposes in water into two substances, perhaps it's a salt that hydrolyzes. For example, if A5 is NaF, it doesn't react. If it's something like CaF2, it's insoluble. Alternatively, perhaps A5 is NH4F, which can hydrolyze to NH3 and HF, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A5 is a compound like AlF3, which hydrolyzes to Al(OH)3 and HF.

But without knowing A4, it's hard to say.

Given the time I've invested, I think Y is likely to be Te, leading A4 to have a molecular weight around 185 (if it's TeF3), which is in option C. Alternatively, if A4 is TeF4 (204), which is close to option B's lower end.

Wait, but the options don't include 204-220. Option B is 220-240. So 204 is below that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is another element. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, perhaps Y is lead (Pb), which has an atomic weight of ~207.

If A2 is PbF, then F% is 19/(207 +19)=19/226≈8.4%, which is way too low.

Alternatively, if A2 is PbF2, F% is 38/(207+38)=38/245≈15.5%, which is still too low.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is a transition metal with multiple fluorides. For example, molybdenum can form several fluorides, but I'm not sure about the exact count.

But without more information, perhaps the best approach is to go back to the initial calculation.

If Y is I (molecular weight ~127), and A4 is IF5 (molecular weight 222), which is in option B (220-240). Alternatively, if A4 is IF3 (183.9), which is in option C.

But earlier, when Y was I, A2 would be IF3, giving F% of 31%, which is close to 31.96%.

So, perhaps Y is I, A4 is IF5, molecular weight 222, option B.

But wait, the problem says there are five binary compounds. Iodine forms IF, I2F5, IF3, IF5, and maybe others, so that's five.

Thus, I think Y is I, A4 is IF5, molecular weight 222. So the correct option is B (220-240).


The problem involves identifying the molecular weight range of compound A4, given that Y forms five binary compounds with fluorine. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Key Information and Initial Assumptions**:  
   - A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 (with 31.96% fluorine by mass) and fluorine gas (F₂).  
   - A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating it is a strong oxidizing agent.  
   - A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y and can also interact with xenon.  
   - A4 is a binary compound of Y and fluorine. Adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4 produces A5, which decomposes in water into two substances.  

2. **Determining Y**:  
   - The percentage of fluorine in A2 is 31.96%. Assuming A2 is YF, the formula for the percentage of fluorine is:  
     \[
     \frac{19}{M(Y) + 19} \times 100 = 31.96
     \]  
     Solving for \( M(Y) \), the atomic mass of Y is approximately 40.44 g/mol, which is close to the atomic mass of calcium (Ca, 40.078 g/mol). However, calcium forms only a few fluorides, making it less likely.  
   - Considering other elements, iodine (I) is identified as a plausible candidate. Iodine forms multiple fluorides (e.g., IF, IF₃, IF₅, I₂F₇, I₂F₉), satisfying the condition of five binary compounds with fluorine.  

3. **Verification of Y as Iodine**:  
   - If Y is iodine, A2 could be IF₃. The percentage of fluorine in IF₃ is:  
     \[
     \frac{3 \times 19}{126.9 + 57} \times 100 \approx 31\%
     \]  
     This is close to the given 31.96%, supporting the identification of Y as iodine.  

4. **Decomposition of A1**:  
   - A1 is likely a higher fluoride of iodine, such as I₂F₉ or IF₅, which decomposes into A2 (e.g., IF₃) and F₂.  

5. **Identifying A4**:  
   - A4 is a binary compound of iodine and fluorine. A plausible candidate is IF₅, with a molecular weight of:  
     \[
     M(I) + 5 \times M(F) = 126.9 + 5 \times 19 = 221.9 \, \text{g/mol}.
     \]  
     This falls within the range of 220-240.  

6. **Conclusion**:  
   - Based on the analysis, Y is identified as iodine, and A4 is likely IF₅. The molecular weight of A4 falls within the range of 220-240.

**Answer: B**
