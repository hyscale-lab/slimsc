Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about an enamine reaction, right? I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me parse that. The structure would have an ethanaminium group, which is like a secondary amine with a positive charge, probably from some kind of quaternization. The substituents are methyl and pentan-2-ylidene. Wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be a five-carbon chain where the substituent is on the second carbon, and it's a double bond. So maybe the structure is something like a secondary amine with a substituent that's a double bond to a pentyl group.

The reaction is adding reagent A to produce product B. The options give different reagent sequences and products.

So, enamine reactions usually involve a secondary amine reacting with a carbonyl compound to form an imine (enamine) intermediate, which can then undergo various reactions like addition or alkylation. Wait, but the starting material here is already an enamine, right? Because it's N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene), which suggests a substituted amine with a double bond.

Wait, another thought: Enamine synthesis typically involves two steps. First, a ketone reacts with a secondary amine to form an iminium ion, which then can be deprotonated to form the enamine. Alternatively, sometimes the amine is deprotonated first to form a better nucleophile. 

But looking at the starting material, maybe this is a pre-formed imine or enamine. So what reactions follow that?

Enamines are good for alkylation. So maybe the starting enamine will undergo alkylation. The reagents in the options involve LDA, DME, CH3CH2I, and H3O+. 

Wait, LDA is a strong base, a lithium amide. DME is a solvent, dimethoxyethane. CH3CH2I is ethyl iodide, a good alkylating agent. H3O+ is acid workup.

So the process might be: deprotonate the enamine to form a strong base, then alkylate, then protonate.

Wait, but the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Let me think about its structure. The ethanaminium suggests a positively charged amine. So maybe it's a quaternary ammonium salt. The substituents are methyl and a pentan-2-ylidene group.

Wait, enamine structure is R2N-CH2-CH2-something? Or perhaps it's more like R2N=CH-R', but as a conjugate base.

No, perhaps the starting material is an iminium ion. Because enamine is R2N-CH2-CH2-... but if it's a conjugated system, maybe it's R2N=CH-R'.

Wait, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the ethanaminium is CH2NH+. The substituents on the nitrogen are methyl and a pentan-2-ylidene group, which is a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond at position 2. Wait, no, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that doesn't make sense. Wait, pentan-2-ylidene is probably CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond at position 2. Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituent is a CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3 group attached to the N?

Wait, maybe the structure is better drawn as N-methyl attached to a group where the nitrogen is connected to a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 chain with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So the enamine part is the N connected to the CH2-CH2 group with a double bond.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about the reaction steps.

Looking at the options, the possible reagents are:

Option A: (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ → B is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Option C: A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ → B is heptan-4-one.

Wait, option C's reagents are same as A's, but product is different.

Wait, but in the reaction, the starting material is (E)-something. So when reagent A is added, which is a sequence of steps, it produces B.

So what's the product?

If the starting material is an enamine, perhaps the reaction is a Michael addition or alkylation. Wait, but LDA is a strong base. So perhaps deprotonation occurs.

Wait, LDA is used to deprotonate amides or other compounds to form enolates. But in this case, maybe the enamine can be deprotonated to form a stronger base.

Alternatively, maybe the enamine acts as a nucleophile. Let me think.

Enamine formation steps: Usually, a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a secondary amine to form an imine, then loses water to form the enamine. Alternatively, the amine may be treated with a base first.

But in this problem, the starting material is already an enamine, perhaps in a protonated form (the ethanaminium suggests it's positively charged, so maybe it's an iminium ion).

So, what reactions can happen from here?

If we use a base like LDA, maybe the enamine's proton is abstracted, forming a more nucleophilic species. Then, alkylation with CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide) would add an ethyl group. Finally, acid workup would hydrolyze the enamine back to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, that sounds like the typical enamine alkylation reaction. So the steps would be:

1. Deprotonate the enamine to form a strong base.
2. Alkylation (add an ethyl group)
3. Acid workup to hydrolyze the enamine back to a carbonyl compound.

So for the product, we would get a new carbonyl compound with an additional ethyl group.

Let me think about the structure. The starting enamine is N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the enamine is (E)-configured. So when we add ethyl iodide, perhaps the enamine's double bond (the imine part) is where the alkylation occurs.

Wait, when an enamine is treated with an alkyl halide, the alkylation occurs at the less substituted position of the double bond. Because the enamine has a conjugated system, the addition would be regioselective.

Wait, but maybe that's not right. Alternatively, the base deprotonates to form a strong base, which then attacks the ethyl iodide as an SN2 reaction, adding an ethyl group to the nitrogen.

Wait, no. Enamine alkylation typically adds the alkyl group to the alpha position of the carbonyl. So perhaps the enamine is part of a conjugated system, and adding ethyl would extend the carbon chain.

Wait, the starting enamine has a structure where the nitrogen is attached to a CH2 group that is part of a double bond. So, perhaps it's something like NMe-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond.

Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. Let's say the enamine is R2N-CH2-CH2-..., but the double bond is in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic enamine? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a substituted ethylamine with a conjugated double bond. For example, maybe it's N-methyl-N-(pent-2-enyl)ethanaminium. So the structure is CH2N+(CH3)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3), but with a double bond at the 2 position.

Wait, perhaps the enamine is part of a larger system. Then, when we alkylate, we add an ethyl group somewhere.

Wait, but looking at the options, the product B could be either pentan-2-one plus another amine, or heptan-4-one.

So, for option C, B is heptan-4-one. Let me think about how that would form.

If the starting enamine is pentan-2-ylidene-based, adding an ethyl group via alkylation would increase the chain length. So, for example, if the starting chain is five carbons (pentan), adding two more from the ethyl would make seven, but maybe that's not how it works.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a four-carbon chain, and adding an ethyl would make it six. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is part of a five-membered ring. Let me think differently.

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C2 and C3, making it CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 with the double bond at position 2, so it's CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So the substituent on the N is a CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3 group.

Wait, the ethanaminium is CH2NH+, with N attached to a methyl group and the pentan-2-ylidene group. So the structure is CH2N+(CH3)(CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3?), but with a double bond in the substituent.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like:

The N is attached to a CH2 group (from ethanaminium) and two substituents: methyl and pentan-2-ylidene. So, the pentan-2-ylidene is a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 group with a double bond. So perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond at C2, making it CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that would be 2-pentenyl. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C2 and C3, so pent-2-enyl.

So the starting material is N-methyl-N-(pent-2-enyl)ethanaminium. So the structure is CH2NH+ (CH3)(pent-2-enyl).

Now, when you add LDA (a strong base), perhaps it deprotonates the alpha position (the CH2 group next to N) to form an enolate-like species, making it more nucleophilic. Then, CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide) would act as an alkylating agent. The enolate would attack the ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha carbon.

Wait, but in enamine alkylation, the alkyl group is added to the beta position, which is the position adjacent to the carbonyl (but in this case, the enamine is already part of a conjugated system).

Wait, perhaps the enamine is deprotonated, making a strong base. Then, ethyl iodide would alkylate the alpha position (the CH2 next to N). Adding an ethyl group would extend the carbon chain.

After alkylation, the product might be a new enamine with a longer chain. But then, after acid workup (H3O+), the enamine would hydrolyze back to a ketone.

Wait, but the starting material is a substituted enamine. If the enamine is part of a longer chain, adding an ethyl group would make the chain longer. Let me think about the possible product.

Suppose the starting enamine has a structure where the double bond is between C2 and C3 of a five-carbon chain. After alkylation, perhaps the chain becomes longer. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone.

Wait, looking at the options, option C says B is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3, a seven-carbon chain with a ketone at position 4.

The starting material has a pentan-2-ylidene group, which is five carbons with a double bond. So when ethyl is added, perhaps the chain becomes seven carbons in total.

Let me think about the process. The enamine has a structure where the N is attached to CH2, methyl, and a pent-2-enyl group. So when LDA deprotonates the alpha position, then ethyl iodide adds an ethyl group to that position. Then, during acid workup, the enamine is hydrolyzed back to a carbonyl compound.

Wait, but hydrolysis of an enamine would typically give a ketone or aldehyde. Since the starting enamine is derived from an aldehyde or ketone, the product after hydrolysis would depend on where the ethyl group was added.

If the starting enamine is part of a five-carbon chain, adding two more carbons (from ethyl) would make it seven. So the product would be heptan-4-one.

Wait, let me count. Suppose the starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one. Then, after alkylation and hydrolysis, the product would be a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the enamine initially is from a ketone. For example, if the starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine, then alkylation would add an ethyl group at the alpha position, and upon hydrolysis, we'd get a longer ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the enamine is formed from pentan-2-one and N-methylethanamine (maybe).

When you alkylate the enamine, you add an ethyl group to the alpha position. So, the product would have a longer chain.

Wait, another way: The enamine is a conjugated system, so when you add ethyl, it's adding to the alpha position relative to the nitrogen.

Wait, perhaps the process is:

Enamine (from pentan-2-one and N-methylethanamine) → alkylate → new enamine → hydrolysis → ketone.

So the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one, which has a five-carbon chain. Adding an ethyl group would make it seven carbons. Let's see:

Pentan-2-one is (CH3)C(O)CH2CH2CH3. No, wait, pentan-2-one is CH3CH2COCH2CH3.

Wait, but that's not right. Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons. No, wait:

No, I think I'm getting confused. Let me correct that. Pentan-2-one is CH3CH2COCH2CH3. Wait, that's actually pentan-3-one. Oh, wait. Let me be precise.

The formula for pentan-2-one is CH2=C(O)CH2CH2CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, no. The structure of pentan-2-one is CH3CH2COCH2CH3? No, wait, no. Correct formula is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would be pentan-1-one. Wait, no, perhaps it's (CH3)2CHCOCH3? No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the nomenclature. The position of the ketone is determined by the numbering. So pentan-2-one would be a five-carbon chain with the ketone on C2. So it's CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3? No, that's impossible because the ketone can't be on C2 in a five-carbon chain without more carbons.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing it up. Let me count. For pentan-2-one, the structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons with the ketone on C2.

Yes, that's correct. So pentan-2-one has the structure CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, no. Let's see: Numbering from left to right, the carbons are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

So pentan-2-one is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's correct. So the starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine. So the enamine would have a structure that reflects that.

When you alkylate the enamine with ethyl iodide, the ethyl group would add to the alpha position (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl). After alkylation, upon hydrolysis, you would get a new ketone with the ethyl group added.

Wait, no, the hydrolysis of the enamine would produce a ketone. But the position of the ethyl group depends on where it was added during alkylation.

So let me think about the steps:

1. The starting enamine is from pentan-2-one and N-methyl ethanamine.

2. Treating with LDA: deprotonates the alpha position, making a strong base.

3. Alkylium with CH3CH2I: the ethyl group adds to the alpha position.

4. Hydrolysis with H3O+: breaks the enamine, releasing the ketone.

So the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one, adding ethyl would make the new ketone with an ethyl group in the alpha position.

Wait, but pentan-2-one has the structure CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3. So the alpha carbons are the CH2 groups adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, no. The alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl group. So in pentan-2-one, which is CH3-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, the carbonyl is on C2, so the alpha carbons are C1 and C3.

So when we add ethyl to the alpha position, say C3, then upon hydrolysis, the new ketone would be longer.

Wait, but how? If the enamine is derived from pentan-2-one, then adding ethyl to the alpha position (C3) would make it a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it out.

Enamine structure: R2N-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is part of a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps the enamine structure is:

NMe-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting enamine is ethanaminium (CH2NH+) connected to a methyl group and a pentenyl group. So when the alkylation occurs, the ethyl group is added to the CH2, making it CH2CH2(ethyl), but I'm not following.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's structure is such that when we add an ethyl group, the resulting product after hydrolysis is heptan-4-one.

Heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3, which is seven carbons with the ketone on C4.

So the starting enamine is derived from a four-carbon ketone, which upon alkylation and hydrolysis becomes seven carbons. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options, option C's product is heptan-4-one. So the starting material must have a chain that, when an ethyl group is added, results in seven carbons.

Wait, the starting material is pentan-2-ylidene, which is five carbons. Adding ethyl would make it seven? No, because the starting substituent is five carbons, adding two more would be seven. So the product would have a seven-carbon chain.

So the product would be heptan-4-one.

Now, let's think about the reagent sequence.

The reagents are LDA, DME, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+.

So step (i) is LDA in DME. LDA is a strong base, so it deprotonates the enamine to form a strong base.

Step (ii) is CH3CH2I in DME. The ethyl iodide is the alkylating agent.

Step (iii) is H3O+ for workup, which would protonate and hydrolyze the enamine to the ketone.

So the product after all steps would be a ketone, either pentan-2-one or heptan-4-one, depending on where the ethyl was added.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Sequence A is (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ → B is heptan-4-one.

Option A: B is pentan-2-one and another amine. So maybe that's a different pathway.

So why would the product be heptan-4-one?

If the starting material is N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, which has a five-carbon substituent, then adding an ethyl group would make it seven carbons. Wait, but the substituent is pentan-2-ylidene, which is five carbons. So adding ethyl would make seven?

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is derived from a four-carbon ketone and a secondary amine. Then, adding ethyl and hydrolysis would make a six-carbon ketone.

No, I'm getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think in terms of the product.

If the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, which is a five-carbon substituent. Then, adding ethyl via alkylation would make it seven carbons. So the product after hydrolysis is heptan-4-one.

Which matches option C.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C: (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ → B is heptan-4-one.

Yes, so the correct sequence is LDA, then ethyl iodide, then acid. So the product is heptan-4-one.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves an enamine derived from (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Enamines are typically formed from a ketone or aldehyde and a secondary amine, and they are useful for alkylation reactions. The reagents provided in the options suggest a sequence of deprotonation, alkylation, and hydrolysis.

1. **Reagent Analysis**:  
   - LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong base used to deprotonate the enamine, forming a nucleophilic species.  
   - DME (dimethoxyethane) is a solvent.  
   - CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide) is an alkylating agent that reacts with the deprotonated enamine.  
   - H₃O⁺ is used for acid workup, hydrolyzing the enamine back to a carbonyl compound.

2. **Reaction Pathway**:  
   - The starting material is an enamine with a pentan-2-ylidene substituent, which is a five-carbon chain with a double bond at position 2.  
   - LDA deprotonates the enamine, making it nucleophilic.  
   - The enamine attacks CH₃CH₂I, adding an ethyl group during alkylation.  
   - Acid workup hydrolyzes the enamine, yielding a ketone.

3. **Product Determination**:  
   - The starting material has a five-carbon chain. Adding an ethyl group (two carbons) results in a seven-carbon chain.  
   - The ketone formed after hydrolysis is heptan-4-one, which has a seven-carbon chain with the carbonyl group at position 4.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Suggests the product is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine, which does not align with the reaction pathway.  
   - **Option B**: Incorrect because it does not account for the correct sequence of reagents.  
   - **Option C**: Correct. The sequence (i) LDA, (ii) CH₃CH₂I, (iii) H₃O⁺ produces heptan-4-one as the final product.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect because it does not match the correct sequence of reagents.

Thus, the correct sequence of reagents is (i) LDA, (ii) CH₃CH₂I, (iii) H₃O⁺, and the product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the ethanaminium is CH2NH+. The substituents on the nitrogen are methyl and a pentan-2-ylidene group, which is a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond at position 2. Wait, no, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that doesn't make sense. Wait, pentan-2-ylidene is probably CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond at position 2. Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituent is a CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3 group attached to the N?

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C2 and C3, making it CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 with the double bond at position 2, so it's CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So the substituent on the N is a CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3 group.

Wait, the ethanaminium is CH2NH+, with N attached to a methyl group and the pentan-2-ylidene group. So the structure is CH2N+(CH3)(CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3?), but with a double bond in the substituent.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like:

The N is attached to a CH2 group (from ethanaminium) and two substituents: methyl and pentan-2-ylidene. So, the pentan-2-ylidene is a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 group with a double bond. So perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond at C2, making it CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that would be 2-pentenyl. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C2 and C3, so pent-2-enyl.

So the starting material is N-methyl-N-(pent-2-enyl)ethanaminium. So the structure is CH2NH+ (CH3)(pent-2-enyl).

Now, when you add LDA (a strong base), perhaps it deprotonates the alpha position (the CH2 group next to N) to form an enolate-like species, making it more nucleophilic. Then, CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide) would act as an alkylating agent. The enolate would attack the ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha carbon.

Wait, but in enamine alkylation, the alkyl group is added to the beta position, which is the position adjacent to the carbonyl (but in this case, the enamine is already part of a conjugated system).

Wait, perhaps the enamine is deprotonated, making a strong base. Then, ethyl iodide would alkylate the alpha position (the CH2 next to N). Adding an ethyl group would extend the carbon chain.

After alkylation, the product might be a new enamine with a longer chain. But then, after acid workup (H3O+), the enamine would hydrolyze back to a ketone.

Wait, but the starting material is a substituted enamine. If the enamine is part of a longer chain, adding an ethyl group would make the chain longer. Let me think about the possible product.

Suppose the starting enamine has a structure where the double bond is between C2 and C3 of a five-carbon chain. After alkylation, perhaps the chain becomes longer. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone.

Wait, looking at the options, option C says B is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3, a seven-carbon chain with a ketone at position 4.

The starting material has a pentan-2-ylidene group, which is five carbons with a double bond. So when ethyl is added, perhaps the chain becomes seven carbons in total.

Let me think about the process. The enamine has a structure where the N is attached to CH2, methyl, and a pent-2-enyl group. So when LDA deprotonates the alpha position, then ethyl iodide adds an ethyl group to that position. Then, during acid workup, the enamine is hydrolyzed back to a carbonyl compound.

Wait, but hydrolysis of an enamine would typically give a ketone or aldehyde. Since the starting enamine is derived from an aldehyde or ketone, the product after hydrolysis would depend on where the ethyl group was added.

If the starting enamine is part of a five-carbon chain, adding two more carbons (from ethyl) would make it seven. So the product would be heptan-4-one.

Wait, let me count. Suppose the starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one. Then, after alkylation and hydrolysis, the product would be a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the enamine initially is from a ketone. For example, if the starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine, then alkylation would add an ethyl group at the alpha position, and upon hydrolysis, we'd get a longer ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the enamine is formed from pentan-2-one and N-methylethanamine (maybe).

When you alkylate the enamine, you add an ethyl group to the alpha position. So, the product would have a longer chain.

Wait, another way: The enamine is a conjugated system, so when you add ethyl, it's adding to the alpha position relative to the nitrogen.

Wait, perhaps the process is:

Enamine (from pentan-2-one and N-methylethanamine) → alkylate → new enamine → hydrolysis → ketone.

So the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one, which has a five-carbon chain. Adding an ethyl group would make it seven carbons. Let's see:

Pentan-2-one is (CH3)C(O)CH2CH2CH3. No, wait, pentan-2-one is CH3CH2COCH2CH3.

Wait, but that's not right. Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons. No, wait:

No, I think I'm getting confused. Let me correct that. Pentan-2-one is CH3CH2COCH2CH3. Wait, that's actually pentan-3-one. Oh, wait. Let me be precise.

The formula for pentan-2-one is CH2=C(O)CH2CH2CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, no. The structure of pentan-2-one is CH3CH2COCH2CH3? No, wait, no. Correct formula is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would be pentan-1-one. Wait, no, perhaps it's (CH3)2CHCOCH3? No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the nomenclature. The position of the ketone is determined by the numbering. So pentan-2-one would be a five-carbon chain with the ketone on C2. So it's CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3? No, that's impossible because the ketone can't be on C2 in a five-carbon chain without more carbons.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing it up. Let me count. For pentan-2-one, the structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons with the ketone on C2.

Yes, that's correct. So pentan-2-one has the structure CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, no. Let's see: Numbering from left to right, the carbons are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

So pentan-2-one is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's correct. So the starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine. So the enamine would have a structure that reflects that.

When you alkylate the enamine with ethyl iodide, the ethyl group would add to the alpha position (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl). After alkylation, upon hydrolysis, you would get a new ketone with the ethyl group added.

Wait, no, the hydrolysis of the enamine would produce a ketone. But the position of the ethyl group depends on where it was added during alkylation.

So let me think about the steps:

1. The starting enamine is from pentan-2-one and N-methyl ethanamine.

2. Treating with LDA: deprotonates the alpha position, making a strong base.

3. Alkylium with CH3CH2I: the ethyl group adds to the alpha position.

4. Hydrolysis with H3O+: breaks the enamine, releasing the ketone.

So the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one, adding ethyl would make the new ketone with an ethyl group in the alpha position.

Wait, but pentan-2-one has the structure CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3. So the alpha carbons are the CH2 groups adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, no. The alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl group. So in pentan-2-one, which is CH3-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, the carbonyl is on C2, so the alpha carbons are C1 and C3.

So when we add ethyl to the alpha position, say C3, then upon hydrolysis, the new ketone would be longer.

Wait, but how? If the enamine is derived from pentan-2-one, then adding ethyl to the alpha position (C3) would make it a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it out.

Enamine structure: R2N-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is part of a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps the enamine structure is:

NMe-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting enamine is ethanaminium (CH2NH+) connected to a methyl group and a pentenyl group. So when the alkylation occurs, the ethyl group is added to the CH2, making it CH2CH2(ethyl), but I'm not following.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's structure is such that when we add an ethyl group, the resulting product after hydrolysis is heptan-4-one.

Heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3, which is seven carbons with the ketone on C4.

So the starting enamine is derived from a four-carbon ketone, which upon alkylation and hydrolysis becomes seven carbons. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options, option C's product is heptan-4-one. So the starting material must have a chain that, when an ethyl group is added, results in seven carbons.

Wait, the starting material is pentan-2-ylidene, which is five carbons. Adding ethyl would make it seven? No, because the starting substituent is five carbons, adding two more would be seven. So the product would have a seven-carbon chain.

So the product would be heptan-4-one.

Now, let's think about the reagent sequence.

The reagents are LDA, DME, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+.

So step (i) is LDA in DME. LDA is a strong base, so it deprotonates the enamine to form a strong base.

Step (ii) is CH3CH2I in DME. The ethyl iodide is the alkylating agent.

Step (iii) is H3O+ for workup, which would protonate and hydrolyze the enamine to the ketone.

So the product after all steps would be a ketone, either pentan-2-one or heptan-4-one, depending on where the ethyl was added.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Sequence A is (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ → B is heptan-4-one.

Option A: B is pentan-2-one and another amine. So maybe that's a different pathway.

So why would the product be heptan-4-one?

If the starting material is N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, which has a five-carbon substituent, then adding an ethyl group would make it seven carbons. Wait, but the substituent is pentan-2-ylidene, which is five carbons. So adding ethyl would make seven?

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is derived from a four-carbon ketone and a secondary amine. Then, adding ethyl and hydrolysis would make a six-carbon ketone.

No, I'm getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think in terms of the product.

If the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, which is a five-carbon substituent. Then, adding ethyl via alkylation would make it seven carbons. So the product after hydrolysis is heptan-4-one.

Which matches option C.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C: (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ → B is heptan-4-one.

Yes, so the correct sequence is LDA, then ethyl iodide, then acid. So the product is heptan-4-one.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.


The reaction involves an enamine derived from (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Enamines are typically formed from a ketone or aldehyde and a secondary amine, and they are useful for alkylation reactions. The reagents provided in the options suggest a sequence of deprotonation, alkylation, and hydrolysis.

1. **Reagent Analysis**:  
   - LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong base used to deprotonate the enamine, forming a nucleophilic species.  
   - DME (dimethoxyethane) is a solvent.  
   - CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide) is an alkylating agent that reacts with the deprotonated enamine.  
   - H₃O⁺ is used for acid workup, hydrolyzing the enamine back to a carbonyl compound.

2. **Reaction Pathway**:  
   - The starting material is an enamine with a pentan-2-ylidene substituent, which is a five-carbon chain with a double bond at position 2.  
   - LDA deprotonates the enamine, making it nucleophilic.  
   - The enamine attacks CH₃CH₂I, adding an ethyl group during alkylation.  
   - Acid workup hydrolyzes the enamine, yielding a ketone.

3. **Product Determination**:  
   - The starting material has a five-carbon chain. Adding an ethyl group (two carbons) results in a seven-carbon chain.  
   - The ketone formed after hydrolysis is heptan-4-one, which has a seven-carbon chain with the carbonyl group at position 4.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Suggests the product is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine, which does not align with the reaction pathway.  
   - **Option B**: Incorrect because it does not account for the correct sequence of reagents.  
   - **Option C**: Correct. The sequence (i) LDA, (ii) CH₃CH₂I, (iii) H₃O⁺ produces heptan-4-one as the final product.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect because it does not match the correct sequence of reagents.

Thus, the correct sequence of reagents is (i) LDA, (ii) CH₃CH₂I, (iii) H₃O⁺, and the product is heptan-4-one.
