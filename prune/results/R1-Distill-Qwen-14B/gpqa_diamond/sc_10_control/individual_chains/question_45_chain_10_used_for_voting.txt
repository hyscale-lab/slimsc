Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels depend on the quantum number n. The formula given is E = (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²), and each energy level is a multiple of this E. So each particle's energy is n² times E, right? So the energy for each particle is E_n = n² * E.

Wait, but the question says the particles are spin-1/2, which means each can have two possible spin states, up or down. But wait, since it's a one-dimensional box, the spin doesn't affect the energy levels. So maybe the spin here just tells me about the possible degeneracy in the system. Oh, right, because for identical particles, the Pauli exclusion principle applies. They have to have unique quantum states, so their overall wavefunction has to be antisymmetric if they're fermions.

Wait, the problem states that the particles are spin-1/2, which are fermions. So each particle must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So, when placing multiple fermions in the well, each must have a unique set of quantum numbers, considering their spin.

So the setup is four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite well. We need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states.

First, I should figure out how the particles fill up the energy levels. Since it's a 1D box, each state is determined by the principal quantum number n. Each n can accommodate 2 particles because of the spin (each can be either up or down). Because for each n, the state can have two different spin states.

So the energy levels are n² * E. The ground state would have the lowest possible n, then n=2, etc.

Let's think about the ground state first. We have four particles. The first level, n=1, can hold 2 particles (since two spin states). The next level, n=2, can also hold 2 particles. So in the ground state, the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) are filled, each with two particles. So each particle in n=1 has energy 1²E = E. Each in n=2 has energy 4E. So the total energy would be 2 * E + 2 * 4E = 2E + 8E = 10E? Wait wait, but wait, let me double-check.

Wait, no. The particles are identical fermions, so the ground state is the lowest possible arrangement where each has a unique quantum state. For four particles, the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) are filled, each with two particles. So the total energy is (2 * 1²E) + (2 * 2²E) )= 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E? But wait, looking at the options, option C has 4E as the first option. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, wait. Each particle in the same n level has the same energy. So when n=1, two particles contribute 2 * E each. Wait no, each has energy E, so two particles contribute 2 * E. Similarly, n=2 contributes 2 * 4E. So total is 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E. But none of the options have 10E as the ground state, except maybe option C, which has 4E, 10E, 15E. Oh wait no, option C starts with 4E.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the question is not about the total energy of all four particles, but the energy per particle, but that doesn't make sense because the question says "energies of the states" or perhaps the total energy of the system. Let me read the question again.

"Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E."

So E is given as the base unit. So the question is asking for the total energy of the system in each state. So for the ground state, it's 10E, as I thought. Then for the first excited state, what's next? Let's think.

Wait, but are the particles arranged in the ground state as n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles)? So the next state (first excited state) would involve the next available configuration. What's the next possible configuration? Let's think about the possible arrangements.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible states. For four particles, the ground state is all the lowest possible n's filled, considering the Pauli exclusion. So n=1 has two particles, each with spin up and down. n=2 can also have two particles, spin up and down. So that's all four particles in the first two n levels.

Now, the first excited state would be the next possible configuration. In that case, perhaps one particle moves up to a higher n. But how? Let's think about the order. The ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible n's. The first excited state would be when one of the particles moves to a higher n, but we have to follow the Pauli principle.

Wait, perhaps the next available state is when one particle moves from the n=1 level to n=3. Because n=2 is already filled with two particles. So n=3 can hold two particles as well. So for the first excited state, maybe one of the n=1 particles moves to n=3. But wait, no, because you can only add one particle to a higher n if you have space. Wait, no, because the Pauli exclusion requires each state (n, spin) to be unique.

Wait, maybe I should consider the possible ways the four particles can be arranged in the levels. Let's list the possible configurations.

The ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So n=1: 2 particles, n=2: 2 particles.

The first excited state would be when one of the particles from n=1 moves to n=3. But wait, can that happen? Because n=3 is higher than n=2, but all lower n's are filled. So in the ground state, the lowest possible configuration is when the particles are in the lowest available ns.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is where one particle from n=2 moves to n=3. But wait, n=2 is filled with two particles. So adding another particle to n=3 would require that we have a state with n=3, but that's higher in energy.

Wait, but wait, maybe the next available state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, leaving room for another in n=2. Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think about the possible order of energies.

The energy levels are E, 4E, 9E, 16E, etc. So for four particles, the possible arrangements are:

Ground state: 2 particles in n=1 (E each), 2 in n=2 (4E each). Total energy 10E.

First excited state: perhaps one particle from n=2 moves up to n=3. So now, the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. So the total energy would be 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Wait, but that's only three particles. Wait, no, because four particles in total. Wait, 2 + 1 +1 is 4? No, 2+1+1 is 4? Wait, no, 2+1+1 is 4 particles? No, 2+1+1=4? Yes, 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. So total energy is (2*1) + (1*4) + (1*9) = 2 +4 +9= 15E.

Wait, but wait, that would be the first excited state.

Wait, but maybe the first excited state is when you promote a particle from n=1 to n=2, but n=2 is already filled. No, because you can't have more than two particles in n=2 because of spin.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3. But wait, that would involve one particle in n=3, but how does that change the configuration?

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the energy would be 2*1 + 1*4 + 1*9 = 15E.

Wait, but let's think about the order. The ground state is 10E. The next possible state would be when the next lowest energy configuration is achieved, which would involve the lowest possible higher energy. So 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. But wait, is that correct? Or is there another way?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the first excited state is when the last particle is in n=3, but that would be 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. Wait, no, because n=2 can hold two particles. So perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but that would leave n=2 with only one particle. So the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. Total energy 2*1 +1*4 +1*9 = 15E.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way to think about the states is to consider the possible combinations of n's for four particles, considering that each n can hold up to 2 particles.

Let me list all possible configurations of four particles:

1. n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → Total energy 10E. Ground state.
2. n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → Energy 2 +4 +9=15E.
3. n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → But wait, can n=3 hold two particles? Yes, because each n can have two spins. So this configuration would have all four particles in n=1 and n=3. The total energy would be 2*1 +2*9 = 2 +18=20E. Is this a higher energy state than the previous one?

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the possible energies. The first excited state would have the next lowest energy after the ground state. So between the two configurations, 15E is lower than 20E. So 15E would be the first excited state.

But wait, wait a second. Another possibility: the first excited state might involve two particles in n=1, and two in n=2. But that's the ground state. So what's the next step?

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, and another is promoted from n=2 to n=3. But wait, n=2 can only hold two particles. So if two particles are in n=2, you can't promote them both to n=3 because n=3 can hold two as well. So the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, and 2 in n=3. But wait, that would be a total of 2+2=4 particles. The energy would be 2*1 + 2*9= 2+18=20E. But wait, is that a higher energy than the 15E case? So that's higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, making the energy 15E.

Wait, but how do we know which configuration is lower in energy? The configuration where 2 particles are in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. So their energies would be 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=15E.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when the fourth particle is placed in n=3, but the others are in n=1 and n=2. Wait, but that's the same as 2+1+1, which gives 15E.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about what the possible states are in terms of their energy levels.

The ground state is when the four particles are filled in the lowest possible n's, which is n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So that's 2(1) + 2(4) = 10E.

The first excited state would be the next possible lowest energy arrangement. So the next available is when one of the particles moves up to n=3. But since each n can take up to two particles, perhaps moving a particle from n=2 to n=3. So the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. So the energy would be 2*1 +1*4 +1*9 = 15E.

The second excited state would be higher than the first excited state. So what's next? The next configuration would be when another particle is promoted to n=3 or maybe n=4.

Wait, let's think. After the first excited state, which is 2,1,1, the next would be when two particles are in n=3. So configuration 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. So energy is 2*1 + 2 *9= 2 +18=20E.

But wait, is that the next possible state? Or is there a lower state?

Wait, another possibility is moving a particle from n=1 to n=3. Because n=1 is lower, but once you move a particle up, you can have another arrangement.

Wait, for four particles: moving one from n=1 to n=3, so configuration becomes 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. The energy would be 1*1 + 2*4 +1*9=1 +8 +9=18E.

Hmm, 18E is lower than 20E. So perhaps the second excited state is 18E.

Wait, but how does that fit into the order of energies? Let's list the possibilities:

- 10E (ground)
- 15E (first excited)
- 18E (second excited)
- 20E (third excited? Or maybe second?)

Wait, but I'm not sure about the order. Let me think about all possible configurations and their energies.

Possible configurations for four particles:

1. n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → 10E → ground state.
2. n=1(2), n=2(1), n=3(1) → 15E → first excited.
3. n=1(1), n=2(2), n=3(1) → 1 + 8 +9=18E → second excited.
4. n=1(0), n=2(2), n=3(2) → 0 +8 + 18=26E → third excited.
5. n=1(2), n=2(0), n=3(2) →2 +0 +18=20E → maybe second excited.
Wait, but 20E is higher than 18E.

So the order of energies for the states would be:

10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited), 20E (third excited?), etc.

Wait, but this depends on which configuration is lower. So the second excited state is 18E, and the third would be 20E. But the question only asks up to the second excited state.

So the energies would be:

Ground state:10E,

First excited:15E,

Second excited:18E.

But looking at the options, option D is 10E, 15E, 18E. Which matches this.

Wait, but the question is about four particles, so perhaps the ordering is different.

Wait another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are promoted to n=3, but that would require more energy.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Another approach is to think about the possible total energies of the system for the different states.

Another way: the ground state is 10E. The first excited state would be the next possible energy. So if the next configuration after the ground state is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3, that's 15E.

Then the second excited state would be the next possible, perhaps 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → 2 + 0 + 18=20E. Or perhaps 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 1 in n=3: 1 +8 +9=18E.

Which of these is lower? 18E is lower than 20E, so the second excited state would be 18E. So the energies are 10E, 15E, 18E, which is option D.

But wait, let me make sure. Another way is to think about the possible ways to arrange four particles in the well, considering the Pauli exclusion.

Each n can hold 2 particles (spin up and down). So the first two n levels (n=1 and n=2) can hold 4 particles. So the ground state is entirely filled with n=1 and n=2.

The first excited state can't be higher than that, but wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3. But how?

Wait, no. Because if you move a particle from n=2 to n=3, that would require that the state in n=3 is available, but n=3 can hold two particles. So in the first excited state, perhaps one particle is in n=3, and another in n=2. But wait, no, that would make the configuration 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. So total energy is 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=15E. Which is higher than the ground state.

Then the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted. Now, what's the next possible promotion? Either promote another particle from n=2 to n=3, making 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3, which gives 2*1 +0 + 2*9= 2+18=20E. Or promote one from n=1 to n=3, making 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → 1 +8 +9=18E.

Which is lower? 18E is lower than 20E. So the second excited state would be 18E.

So the energies for the ground, first, and second excited states are 10E, 15E, and 18E, which corresponds to option D.

Wait, but the options don't have D as the first option. Let me look again. The options are:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

So option D is 10E,15E,18E. That matches what I've calculated.

Wait, but I thought the ground state was 10E, which is option D's first option. So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

So the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the energy levels of four identical spin-1/2 fermions in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The energy levels for a particle in such a well are given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Since the particles are fermions, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning each quantum state (defined by \( n \) and spin) can hold at most two particles.

### Ground State:
The lowest energy configuration occurs when the particles fill the lowest available energy levels. Each level \( n \) can hold two particles due to spin. Thus:
- \( n = 1 \): 2 particles, contributing \( 2 \cdot 1^2 E = 2E \),
- \( n = 2 \): 2 particles, contributing \( 2 \cdot 2^2 E = 8E \).

The total energy of the ground state is:
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State:
The first excited state is the next lowest energy configuration. This occurs when one particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 3 \), leaving \( n = 2 \) with one particle. The configuration is:
- \( n = 1 \): 2 particles, contributing \( 2 \cdot 1^2 E = 2E \),
- \( n = 2 \): 1 particle, contributing \( 1 \cdot 2^2 E = 4E \),
- \( n = 3 \): 1 particle, contributing \( 1 \cdot 3^2 E = 9E \).

The total energy of the first excited state is:
\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State:
The second excited state is the next higher energy configuration. This occurs when another particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 3 \), leaving \( n = 2 \) empty and \( n = 3 \) with two particles. The configuration is:
- \( n = 1 \): 2 particles, contributing \( 2 \cdot 1^2 E = 2E \),
- \( n = 3 \): 2 particles, contributing \( 2 \cdot 3^2 E = 18E \).

The total energy of the second excited state is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E + 18E = 20E.
\]

### Final Answer:
The calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \( 10E \), \( 15E \), and \( 18E \), respectively. Comparing these results with the given options, the correct choice is:

**Option D: \( 10E, 15E, 18E \).**

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels depend on the quantum number n. The formula given is E = (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²), and each energy level is a multiple of this E. So each particle's energy is n² times E, right? So the energy for each particle is E_n = n² * E.

Oh, right, because for identical particles, the Pauli exclusion principle applies. They have to have unique quantum states, so their overall wavefunction has to be antisymmetric if they're fermions.

Wait, the problem states that the particles are spin-1/2, which are fermions. So each particle must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So, when placing multiple fermions in the well, each must have a unique set of quantum numbers, considering their spin.

So the setup is four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite well. We need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states.

So in the ground state, the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) are filled, each with two particles. So each particle in n=1 has energy 1²E = E. Each in n=2 has energy 4E. So the total energy would be 2 * E + 2 * 4E = 2E + 8E = 10E? Wait wait, but wait, let me double-check.

Wait, no. The particles are identical fermions, so the ground state is the lowest possible arrangement where each has a unique quantum state. For four particles, the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) are filled, each with two particles. So the total energy is (2 * 1²E) + (2 * 2²E) )= 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E? But wait, looking at the options, option C has 4E as the first option. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, wait. Each particle in the same n level has the same energy. So when n=1, two particles contribute 2 * E each. Wait no, each has energy E, so two particles contribute 2 * E. Similarly, n=2 contributes 2 * 4E. So total is 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E. But none of the options have 10E as the ground state, except maybe option C, which has 4E, 10E, 15E. Oh wait no, option C starts with 4E.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the question is not about the total energy of all four particles, but the energy per particle, but that doesn't make sense because the question says "energies of the states" or perhaps the total energy of the system. Let me read the question again.

"Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E."

So E is given as the base unit. So the question is asking for the total energy of the system in each state. So for the ground state, it's 10E, as I thought. Then for the first excited state, what's next? Let's think.

Wait, but are the particles arranged in the ground state as n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles)? So the next state (first excited state) would involve the next available configuration. What's the next possible configuration? Let's think about the possible arrangements.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible states. For four particles, the ground state is all the lowest possible n's filled, considering the Pauli exclusion. So n=1 has two particles, each with spin up and down. n=2 can also have two particles, spin up and down. So that's all four particles in the first two n levels.

Now, the first excited state would be the next possible configuration. In that case, perhaps one particle moves up to a higher n. But how? Let's think about the order. The ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible n's. The first excited state would be when one of the particles moves to a higher n, but we have to follow the Pauli principle.

Wait, perhaps the next available state is when one particle moves from the n=1 level to n=3. Because n=2 is already filled with two particles. So n=3 can hold two particles as well. So for the first excited state, maybe one of the n=1 particles moves to n=3. But wait, no, because you can only add one particle to a higher n if you have space. Wait, no, because the Pauli exclusion requires each state (n, spin) to be unique.

Wait, maybe I should consider the possible ways the four particles can be arranged in the levels. Let's list the possible configurations.

The ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So n=1: 2 particles, n=2: 2 particles.

The first excited state would be when one of the particles from n=1 moves to n=3. But wait, can that happen? Because n=3 is higher than n=2, but all lower n's are filled. So in the ground state, the lowest possible configuration is when the particles are in the lowest available ns.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is where one particle from n=2 moves to n=3. But wait, n=2 is filled with two particles. So adding another particle to n=3 would require that we have a state with n=3, but that's higher in energy.

Wait, but wait, maybe the next available state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, leaving room for another in n=2. Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think about the possible order of energies.

The energy levels are E, 4E, 9E, 16E, etc. So for four particles, the possible arrangements are:

Ground state: 2 particles in n=1 (E each), 2 in n=2 (4E each). Total energy 10E.

First excited state: perhaps one particle from n=2 moves up to n=3. So now, the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. So the total energy would be 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Wait, but that's only three particles. Wait, no, because four particles in total. Wait, 2 + 1 +1 is 4? No, 2+1+1 is 4? Wait, no, 2+1+1 is 4 particles? No, 2+1+1=4? Yes, 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. So total energy is (2*1) + (1*4) + (1*9) = 2 +4 +9= 15E.

Wait, but wait, that would be the first excited state.

Wait, but maybe the first excited state is when you promote a particle from n=1 to n=2, but n=2 is already filled. No, because you can't have more than two particles in n=2 because of spin.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3. But wait, that would involve one particle in n=3, but how does that change the configuration?

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the energy would be 2*1 + 1*4 + 1*9 = 15E.

Wait, but let's think about the order. The ground state is 10E. The next possible state would be when the next lowest energy configuration is achieved, which would involve the lowest possible higher energy. So 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. But wait, is that correct? Or is there another way?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the first excited state is when the last particle is in n=3, but that would be 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. Wait, no, because n=2 can hold two particles. So perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but that would leave n=2 with only one particle. So the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. Total energy 2*1 +1*4 +1*9 = 15E.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way to think about the states is to consider the possible combinations of n's for four particles, considering that each n can hold up to 2 particles.

Let me list all possible configurations of four particles:

1. n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → Total energy 10E. Ground state.
2. n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → Energy 2 +4 +9=15E.
3. n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → But wait, can n=3 hold two particles? Yes, because each n can have two spins. So this configuration would have all four particles in n=1 and n=3. The total energy would be 2*1 +2*9 = 2 +18=20E. Is this a higher energy state than the previous one?

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the possible energies. The first excited state would have the next lowest energy after the ground state. So between the two configurations, 15E is lower than 20E. So 15E would be the first excited state.

But wait, wait a second. Another possibility: the first excited state might involve two particles in n=1, and two in n=2. But that's the ground state. So what's the next step?

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, and another is promoted from n=2 to n=3. But wait, n=2 can only hold two particles. So if two particles are in n=2, you can't promote them both to n=3 because n=3 can hold two as well. So the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, and 2 in n=3. But wait, that would be a total of 2+2=4 particles. The energy would be 2*1 + 2*9= 2+18=20E. But wait, is that a higher energy than the 15E case? So that's higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, making the energy 15E.

Wait, but how do we know which configuration is lower in energy? The configuration where 2 particles are in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. So their energies would be 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=15E.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when the fourth particle is placed in n=3, but the others are in n=1 and n=2. Wait, but that's the same as 2+1+1, which gives 15E.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about what the possible states are in terms of their energy levels.

The ground state is when the four particles are filled in the lowest possible n's, which is n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So that's 2(1) + 2(4) = 10E.

The first excited state would be the next possible lowest energy arrangement. So the next available is when one of the particles moves up to n=3. But since each n can take up to two particles, perhaps moving a particle from n=2 to n=3. So the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. So the energy would be 2*1 +1*4 +1*9 = 15E.

The second excited state would be higher than the first excited state. So what's next? The next configuration would be when another particle is promoted to n=3 or maybe n=4.

Wait, let's think. After the first excited state, which is 2,1,1, the next would be when two particles are in n=3. So configuration 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. So energy is 2*1 + 2 *9= 2 +18=20E.

But wait, is that the next possible state? Or is there a lower state?

Wait, another possibility is moving a particle from n=1 to n=3. Because n=1 is lower, but once you move a particle up, you can have another arrangement.

Wait, for four particles: moving one from n=1 to n=3, so configuration becomes 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. The energy would be 1*1 + 2*4 +1*9=1 +8 +9=18E.

Hmm, 18E is lower than 20E. So perhaps the second excited state is 18E.

Wait, but how does that fit into the order of energies? Let's list the possibilities:

- 10E (ground)
- 15E (first excited)
- 18E (second excited)
- 20E (third excited? Or maybe second?)

Wait, but I'm not sure about the order. Let me think about all possible configurations and their energies.

Possible configurations for four particles:

1. n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → 10E → ground state.
2. n=1(2), n=2(1), n=3(1) → 15E → first excited.
3. n=1(1), n=2(2), n=3(1) → 1 + 8 +9=18E → second excited.
4. n=1(0), n=2(2), n=3(2) → 0 +8 + 18=26E → third excited.
5. n=1(2), n=2(0), n=3(2) →2 +0 +18=20E → maybe second excited.
Wait, but 20E is higher than 18E.

So the order of energies for the states would be:

10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited), 20E (third excited?), etc.

Wait, but this depends on which configuration is lower. So the second excited state is 18E, and the third would be 20E. But the question only asks up to the second excited state.

So the energies would be:

Ground state:10E,

First excited:15E,

Second excited:18E.

But looking at the options, option D is 10E, 15E, 18E. Which matches this.

Wait, but the question is about four particles, so perhaps the ordering is different.

Wait another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are promoted to n=3, but that would require more energy.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Another approach is to think about the possible total energies of the system for the different states.

Another way: the ground state is 10E. The first excited state would be the next possible energy. So if the next configuration after the ground state is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3, that's 15E.

Then the second excited state would be the next possible, perhaps 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → 2 + 0 + 18=20E. Or perhaps 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 1 in n=3: 1 +8 +9=18E.

Which of these is lower? 18E is lower than 20E, so the second excited state would be 18E. So the energies are 10E, 15E, 18E, which is option D.

But wait, let me make sure. Another way is to think about the possible ways to arrange four particles in the well, considering the Pauli exclusion.

Each n can hold 2 particles (spin up and down). So the first two n levels (n=1 and n=2) can hold 4 particles. So the ground state is entirely filled with n=1 and n=2.

The first excited state can't be higher than that, but wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3. But how?

Wait, no. Because if you move a particle from n=2 to n=3, that would require that the state in n=3 is available, but n=3 can hold two particles. So in the first excited state, perhaps one particle is in n=3, and another in n=2. But wait, no, that would make the configuration 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. So total energy is 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=15E. Which is higher than the ground state.

Then the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted. Now, what's the next possible promotion? Either promote another particle from n=2 to n=3, making 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3, which gives 2*1 +0 + 2*9= 2+18=20E. Or promote one from n=1 to n=3, making 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → 1 +8 +9=18E.

Which is lower? 18E is lower than 20E. So the second excited state would be 18E.

So the energies for the ground, first, and second excited states are 10E, 15E, and 18E, which corresponds to option D.

Wait, but the options don't have D as the first option. Let me look again. The options are:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

So option D is 10E,15E,18E. That matches what I've calculated.

Wait, but I thought the ground state was 10E, which is option D's first option. So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

So the correct answer is option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the energy levels of four identical spin-1/2 fermions in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The energy levels for a particle in such a well are given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Since the particles are fermions, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning each quantum state (defined by \( n \) and spin) can hold at most two particles.

### Ground State:
The lowest energy configuration occurs when the particles fill the lowest available energy levels. Each level \( n \) can hold two particles due to spin. Thus:
- \( n = 1 \): 2 particles, contributing \( 2 \cdot 1^2 E = 2E \),
- \( n = 2 \): 2 particles, contributing \( 2 \cdot 2^2 E = 8E \).

The total energy of the ground state is:
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State:
The first excited state is the next lowest energy configuration. This occurs when one particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 3 \), leaving \( n = 2 \) with one particle. The configuration is:
- \( n = 1 \): 2 particles, contributing \( 2 \cdot 1^2 E = 2E \),
- \( n = 2 \): 1 particle, contributing \( 1 \cdot 2^2 E = 4E \),
- \( n = 3 \): 1 particle, contributing \( 1 \cdot 3^2 E = 9E \).

The total energy of the first excited state is:
\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State:
The second excited state is the next higher energy configuration. This occurs when another particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 3 \), leaving \( n = 2 \) empty and \( n = 3 \) with two particles. The configuration is:
- \( n = 1 \): 2 particles, contributing \( 2 \cdot 1^2 E = 2E \),
- \( n = 3 \): 2 particles, contributing \( 2 \cdot 3^2 E = 18E \).

The total energy of the second excited state is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E + 18E = 20E.
\]

### Final Answer:
The calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \( 10E \), \( 15E \), and \( 18E \), respectively. Comparing these results with the given options, the correct choice is:

**Option D: \( 10E, 15E, 18E \).**
