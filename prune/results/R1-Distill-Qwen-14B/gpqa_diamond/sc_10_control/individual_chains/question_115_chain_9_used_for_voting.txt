Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons, positrons, and photon emission after annihilation. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. And a positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured as one upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So the electron has gamma_e =4 and the positron has gamma_p =2.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about positron movement. Positrons are antimatter, so they have the same mass as electrons but opposite charge. But in terms of motion, I think it's similar to an electron moving in the opposite direction. So the positron is moving to the right, and the electron to the left.

Now, when they annihilate, they produce two photons. Since they are moving along the same line (the horizontal axis), the total momentum before annihilation must be conserved in the system. Also, energy must be conserved.

So, let's think about the system's initial momentum and energy.

Wait, but in the center of momentum frame, things might be easier. Because the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So if their energies are equal, their momenta might have equal magnitudes but opposite directions? Or maybe not, because direction affects the sign.

Wait, but photons have momentum p = E/c, right? Since their speed is c and for photons, E = pc.

So let me think about conservation of momentum. Because the system before collision has some momentum, the photons after collision must have a combined momentum equal to that.

Let me calculate the initial momentum.

The electron's momentum: p_e = gamma * m_e * v_e. But wait, gamma is 4, and for electrons, m_e is the rest mass. But since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), maybe it's easier to compute the momentum in terms of gamma. Oh, right, because p = gamma m_e v, and since gamma = 4, we can write p_e = gamma_e * m_e * (c) * (v/(c)) ). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to express in terms of gamma and momentum.

Wait, another approach: the total energy of the system is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies. And the total momentum is the sum of their momenta.

But wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

Wait, let me get the directions straight. The electron is moving from left to right (along positive x direction) with gamma_e=4. The positron is moving from right to left (so along negative x direction) with gamma_p=2. Or wait, the problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal from the right. So perhaps the positron is moving to the left, along the same axis as the electron is moving to the right.

Wait, no. The problem says "the positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right". So I think the positron is moving to the left (since from right, moving along the axis towards the left), while the electron is moving to the right (from the left towards the right). So their momenta are in opposite directions.

So initial momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p. But since m_e = m_p (they have the same mass), and the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so p_p would be negative if we take the electron's direction as positive.

Wait, but how do their velocities compare? Because gamma depends on velocity. Let me think: gamma_e =4, so gamma_e = 1/sqrt(1 - v_e^2/c^2) =4. Let's solve for v_e.

Gamma_e =4 → 1 - v_e²/c² = 1/16 → v_e²/c² =15/16 → v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4) ≈ 0.9682c.

Similarly, gamma_p=2 → 1 - v_p²/c² =1/4 → v_p^2/c^2 =3/4 → v_p = c*sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866c.

But wait, since the positron is moving from the right, let's say its velocity is to the left, so v_p is negative. So the directions are opposite.

So, the initial momenta are:

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e (positive, since electron moves right)
p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p (negative, since v_p is negative, as positron moves left)

So the total initial momentum is p_total = p_e + p_p.

Substituting:

p_total = (4 * m_e * (c * sqrt(15)/4)) ) + (2 * m_e * (-c * sqrt(3)/2)) )

Simplify each term:

First term: 4 * m_e * (c * sqrt(15)/4) = m_e c sqrt(15)
Second term: 2 * m_e * (-c * sqrt(3)/2) = - m_e c sqrt(3)

So total p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Hmm, that's the initial momentum.

Now, after annihilation, two photons are produced. Both photons have the same energy, E_photon = E.

Photons have momentum p_photon = E/c, and their direction can be determined by their angles.

Wait, but each photon's momentum is a vector. So the sum of the two photons' momenta must equal the initial total momentum.

Let me define the direction: the initial total momentum is in the positive x direction (since sqrt(15) is larger than sqrt(3), so p_total is positive).

The two photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So both are moving in the positive x direction, but one has a positive y component, the other negative.

Wait, no. Because the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So both have positive x components, but one has positive y and the other negative, but both in the right direction.

Wait, but upper-right would have positive y, lower-right negative y. So in terms of momentum vectors, each photon's momentum has an x component and a y component.

Let me denote photon 1 as moving in the upper-right, so its momentum vector is (p1_x, p1_y). Photon 2 is moving in the lower-right, so (p2_x, p2_y), with p2_y negative.

Since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are the same because E = pc, so |p1| = |p2| = E/c.

Wait, but in this case, E is the same for both photons, so their momenta magnitudes are equal. Let me denote each as p_photon = E/c.

So, the total momentum after annihilation is the sum of the two photons' momenta.

So, sum of x-components: p1_x + p2_x = P_total_x
Sum of y-components: p1_y + p2_y = P_total_y

But wait, the initial system has no momentum in the y-direction, so the total y-momentum after must be zero. So:

p1_y + p2_y = 0 → p2_y = -p1_y.

But each photon's momentum is a vector. Let me think about the angles.

Let’s denote theta as the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. Photon 1 is moving at theta above the x-axis (upper right), and photon 2 is moving at theta below the x-axis (lower right), but maybe not the same angle. Wait, but the problem says the directions are upper-right and lower-right, but not necessarily symmetric.

Wait, but perhaps the two angles are symmetric about the x-axis. So, if photon 1 makes an angle alpha above the x-axis, photon 2 makes angle alpha below. But not necessarily, since the system's total momentum is along x.

Wait, but the initial momentum is along x, so the sum of the y-components must be zero. So if the photons are emitted symmetrically, their y-components cancel.

But in this problem, both photons are moving in the right direction. So their x-components are positive.

So, their momentum vectors are:

Photon 1: (p1x, p1y)
Photon 2: (p2x, p2y)

But p1y = -p2y, so that their sum is zero.

Also, the sum of the x-components must equal the initial total momentum, which is positive.

So,

p1x + p2x = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But each photon's momentum is E_photon/c. Since both have the same energy E, their magnitudes are same.

So, for each photon, sqrt(p1x^2 + p1y^2) = p_photon = E/c.

Similarly for the second.

But because the directions are symmetric, perhaps the angles are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

Wait, let me think. Let me say that photon 1 has an angle θ above the x-axis, and photon 2 has an angle θ below. Then their y-components would be p_photon sinθ and -p_photon sinθ. So their sum is zero, satisfying the y-momentum conservation.

In that case, the x-components are p_photon cosθ each. So total x momentum is 2 p_photon cosθ.

But the initial x momentum is m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).

So,

2 p_photon cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But p_photon is E/c, and since E is the energy of each photon, we can write:

2 (E/c) cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but what is E?

The total energy of the system before annihilation is the sum of the electron and positron's energies. Each has a rest mass energy of m_e c². So,

Total energy before = gamma_e m_e c² + gamma_p m_e c² = (4 + 2) m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

But after annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the two photons' energies. Since each has energy E, total energy is 2 E.

Conservation of energy gives:

2 E = 6 m_e c² → E = 3 m_e c².

So, substituting E into the momentum equation:

2 (3 m_e c² / c) cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Simplify:

2 * 3 m_e c cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Compute sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872, sqrt(3)≈1.732. So sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) ≈2.14.

So,

6 cosθ ≈2.14 → cosθ ≈2.14/6 ≈0.3567.

So θ ≈ arccos(0.3567) ≈69 degrees.

Wait, but that's the angle each photon makes with the x-axis, right? So photon 1 is at +θ, photon 2 at -θ. So the angle between them is 2θ.

So, 2 * 69 = 138 degrees. That's option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps in case I made a mistake.

Wait, when I calculated the initial momentum, I assumed the positron was moving to the left. So the electron's momentum is positive, the positron's negative. So p_e =4 m_e v_e, and v_e is to the right. The positron's momentum is p_p =2 m_e v_p, but v_p is to the left, so p_p is negative.

Wait, but in the calculation, I wrote:

p_e =4 m_e v_e (since v_e is positive)
p_p =2 m_e v_p (but v_p is negative, so p_p is negative)

So total p_total =4 m_e v_e + 2 m_e v_p.

But wait, v_e is (c sqrt(15)/4) ≈0.968c. v_p is (sqrt(3)/2 c) ≈0.866c, but since it's moving to the left, v_p is negative. So p_p =2 m_e (-0.866 c) = -1.732 m_e c.

So,

p_e =4 m_e (0.968 c) = 3.872 m_e c,

p_p =2 m_e (-0.866 c) = -1.732 m_e c.

Total p_total =3.872 -1.732 = 2.14 m_e c.

Wait, that's a positive value, so the initial momentum is along the x-axis and positive.

So, the sum of the photons' x-components must be 2.14 m_e c.

Each photon contributes p_photon_x = p_photon * cosθ.

But p_photon = E/c. Since E =3 m_e c²,

p_photon =3 m_e c² /c =3 m_e c.

So each photon's x-component is 3 m_e c cosθ.

Sum of the two photons' x-components: 2 *3 m_e c cosθ =6 m_e c cosθ.

Set equal to initial p_total:

6 m_e c cosθ =2.14 m_e c → 6 cosθ =2.14 → cosθ=0.3567 → θ≈69 degrees.

So each photon is at 69 degrees above and below the x-axis. The angle between them is 2θ=138 degrees.

So the angle is 138 degrees. Looking at the options, option C is 138.

Wait, but the problem says that the two photons have the same energy. So their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in y-direction. So that part seems correct.

Hmm, but another thought: wait, when two particles annihilate, the photons must move in opposite directions if the system is at rest, but in this case, the system has some initial momentum, so photons can't be back-to-back.

Wait, but in this case, the initial system is moving along the x-axis, so the photons are emitted in the same general direction but at different angles.

But according to our calculation, each photon makes an angle of about 69 degrees with the x-axis, one above and one below, so the angle between them is 138 degrees.

So the answer should be option C) 138.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation process using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron collide with Lorentz factors of 4 and 2, respectively. The total energy and momentum of the system before annihilation are calculated, and these must equal the total energy and momentum of the two photons after annihilation.

### Step 1: Initial Energy and Momentum
- The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
  \[
  E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = (4 + 2)m_e c^2 = 6m_e c^2.
  \]
- The total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. The electron moves to the right with momentum \(p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e\), and the positron moves to the left with momentum \(p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p\). Using \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\), the velocities are calculated as:
  \[
  v_e = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{16}} = c \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}, \quad v_p = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = c \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
  \]
  Substituting these into the momentum expressions:
  \[
  p_e = 4m_e v_e = 4m_e \cdot c \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} = m_e c \sqrt{15}, \quad p_p = 2m_e v_p = 2m_e \cdot c \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = m_e c \sqrt{3}.
  \]
  Since the positron moves to the left, its momentum is negative:
  \[
  p_{\text{total}} = p_e + p_p = m_e c \sqrt{15} - m_e c \sqrt{3} = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
  \]

### Step 2: Photon Energies and Momentum
After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies \(E\). Since \(E = pc\) for photons, the magnitude of the momentum of each photon is:
\[
p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E}{c}.
\]
The total energy after annihilation is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = 2E = 6m_e c^2 \implies E = 3m_e c^2.
\]
Thus, the momentum of each photon is:
\[
p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{3m_e c^2}{c} = 3m_e c.
\]

### Step 3: Conservation of Momentum
The photons move in the upper-right and lower-right directions, making angles \(\theta\) and \(-\theta\) with the x-axis, respectively. The total momentum in the x-direction is:
\[
p_{\text{total},x} = p_{\text{photon},x,1} + p_{\text{photon},x,2} = 3m_e c \cos\theta + 3m_e c \cos\theta = 6m_e c \cos\theta.
\]
The total momentum in the y-direction is:
\[
p_{\text{total},y} = p_{\text{photon},y,1} + p_{\text{photon},y,2} = 3m_e c \sin\theta - 3m_e c \sin\theta = 0.
\]
From conservation of momentum, the total x-momentum after annihilation must equal the total x-momentum before annihilation:
\[
6m_e c \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
\]
Using \(\sqrt{15} \approx 3.872\) and \(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\):
\[
6 \cos\theta \approx 3.872 - 1.732 = 2.14 \implies \cos\theta \approx \frac{2.14}{6} \approx 0.3567.
\]
Thus:
\[
\theta \approx \arccos(0.3567) \approx 69^\circ.
\]

### Step 4: Angle Between the Photons
The two photons are emitted symmetrically about the x-axis, one at \(+\theta\) and the other at \(-\theta\). The angle between them is:
\[
\phi = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons, positrons, and photon emission after annihilation. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. And a positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured as one upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So the electron has gamma_e =4 and the positron has gamma_p =2.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about positron movement. Positrons are antimatter, so they have the same mass as electrons but opposite charge. But in terms of motion, I think it's similar to an electron moving in the opposite direction. So the positron is moving to the right, and the electron to the left.

Now, when they annihilate, they produce two photons. Since they are moving along the same line (the horizontal axis), the total momentum before annihilation must be conserved in the system. Also, energy must be conserved.

So, let's think about the system's initial momentum and energy.

Wait, but in the center of momentum frame, things might be easier. Because the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So if their energies are equal, their momenta might have equal magnitudes but opposite directions? Or maybe not, because direction affects the sign.

Wait, but photons have momentum p = E/c, right? Since their speed is c and for photons, E = pc.

So let me think about conservation of momentum. Because the system before collision has some momentum, the photons after collision must have a combined momentum equal to that.

Let me calculate the initial momentum.

The electron's momentum: p_e = gamma * m_e * v_e. But wait, gamma is 4, and for electrons, m_e is the rest mass. But since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), maybe it's easier to compute the momentum in terms of gamma. Oh, right, because p = gamma m_e v, and since gamma = 4, we can write p_e = gamma_e * m_e * (c) * (v/(c)) ). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to express in terms of gamma and momentum.

Wait, another approach: the total energy of the system is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies. And the total momentum is the sum of their momenta.

But wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

Wait, let me get the directions straight. The electron is moving from left to right (along positive x direction) with gamma_e=4. The positron is moving from right to left (so along negative x direction) with gamma_p=2. Or wait, the problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal from the right. So perhaps the positron is moving to the left, along the same axis as the electron is moving to the right.

Wait, no. The problem says "the positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right". So I think the positron is moving to the left (since from right, moving along the axis towards the left), while the electron is moving to the right (from the left towards the right). So their momenta are in opposite directions.

So initial momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p. But since m_e = m_p (they have the same mass), and the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so p_p would be negative if we take the electron's direction as positive.

Wait, but how do their velocities compare? Because gamma depends on velocity. Let me think: gamma_e =4, so gamma_e = 1/sqrt(1 - v_e^2/c^2) =4. Let's solve for v_e.

Gamma_e =4 → 1 - v_e²/c² = 1/16 → v_e²/c² =15/16 → v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4) ≈ 0.9682c.

Similarly, gamma_p=2 → 1 - v_p²/c² =1/4 → v_p^2/c^2 =3/4 → v_p = c*sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866c.

But wait, since the positron is moving from the right, let's say its velocity is to the left, so v_p is negative. So the directions are opposite.

So, the initial momenta are:

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e (positive, since electron moves right)
p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p (negative, since v_p is negative, as positron moves left)

So the total initial momentum is p_total = p_e + p_p.

Substituting:

p_total = (4 * m_e * (c * sqrt(15)/4)) ) + (2 * m_e * (-c * sqrt(3)/2)) )

Simplify each term:

First term: 4 * m_e * (c * sqrt(15)/4) = m_e c sqrt(15)
Second term: 2 * m_e * (-c * sqrt(3)/2) = - m_e c sqrt(3)

So total p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Hmm, that's the initial momentum.

Now, after annihilation, two photons are produced. Both photons have the same energy, E_photon = E.

Photons have momentum p_photon = E/c, and their direction can be determined by their angles.

Wait, but each photon's momentum is a vector. So the sum of the two photons' momenta must equal the initial total momentum.

Let me define the direction: the initial total momentum is in the positive x direction (since sqrt(15) is larger than sqrt(3), so p_total is positive).

The two photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So both are moving in the positive x direction, but one has a positive y component, the other negative.

Wait, no. Because the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So both have positive x components, but one has positive y and the other negative, but both in the right direction.

Wait, but upper-right would have positive y, lower-right negative y. So in terms of momentum vectors, each photon's momentum has an x component and a y component.

Let me denote photon 1 as moving in the upper-right, so its momentum vector is (p1_x, p1_y). Photon 2 is moving in the lower-right, so (p2_x, p2_y), with p2_y negative.

Since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are the same because E = pc, so |p1| = |p2| = E/c.

Wait, but in this case, E is the same for both photons, so their momenta magnitudes are equal. Let me denote each as p_photon = E/c.

So, the total momentum after annihilation is the sum of the two photons' momenta.

So, sum of x-components: p1_x + p2_x = P_total_x
Sum of y-components: p1_y + p2_y = P_total_y

But wait, the initial system has no momentum in the y-direction, so the total y-momentum after must be zero. So:

p1_y + p2_y = 0 → p2_y = -p1_y.

But each photon's momentum is a vector. Let me think about the angles.

Let’s denote theta as the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. Photon 1 is moving at theta above the x-axis (upper right), and photon 2 is moving at theta below the x-axis (lower right), but maybe not the same angle. Wait, but the problem says the directions are upper-right and lower-right, but not necessarily symmetric.

Wait, but perhaps the two angles are symmetric about the x-axis. So, if photon 1 makes an angle alpha above the x-axis, photon 2 makes angle alpha below. But not necessarily, since the system's total momentum is along x.

Wait, but the initial momentum is along x, so the sum of the y-components must be zero. So if the photons are emitted symmetrically, their y-components cancel.

But in this problem, both photons are moving in the right direction. So their x-components are positive.

So, their momentum vectors are:

Photon 1: (p1x, p1y)
Photon 2: (p2x, p2y)

But p1y = -p2y, so that their sum is zero.

Also, the sum of the x-components must equal the initial total momentum, which is positive.

So,

p1x + p2x = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But each photon's momentum is E_photon/c. Since both have the same energy E, their magnitudes are same.

So, for each photon, sqrt(p1x^2 + p1y^2) = p_photon = E/c.

Similarly for the second.

But because the directions are symmetric, perhaps the angles are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

Wait, let me think. Let me say that photon 1 has an angle θ above the x-axis, and photon 2 has an angle θ below. Then their y-components would be p_photon sinθ and -p_photon sinθ. So their sum is zero, satisfying the y-momentum conservation.

In that case, the x-components are p_photon cosθ each. So total x momentum is 2 p_photon cosθ.

But the initial x momentum is m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).

So,

2 p_photon cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But p_photon is E/c, and since E is the energy of each photon, we can write:

2 (E/c) cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but what is E?

The total energy of the system before annihilation is the sum of the electron and positron's energies. Each has a rest mass energy of m_e c². So,

Total energy before = gamma_e m_e c² + gamma_p m_e c² = (4 + 2) m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

But after annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the two photons' energies. Since each has energy E, total energy is 2 E.

Conservation of energy gives:

2 E = 6 m_e c² → E = 3 m_e c².

So, substituting E into the momentum equation:

2 (3 m_e c² / c) cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Simplify:

2 * 3 m_e c cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Compute sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872, sqrt(3)≈1.732. So sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) ≈2.14.

So,

6 cosθ ≈2.14 → cosθ ≈2.14/6 ≈0.3567.

So θ ≈ arccos(0.3567) ≈69 degrees.

Wait, but that's the angle each photon makes with the x-axis, right? So photon 1 is at +θ, photon 2 at -θ. So the angle between them is 2θ.

So, 2 * 69 = 138 degrees. That's option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps in case I made a mistake.

Wait, when I calculated the initial momentum, I assumed the positron was moving to the left. So the electron's momentum is positive, the positron's negative. So p_e =4 m_e v_e, and v_e is to the right. The positron's momentum is p_p =2 m_e v_p, but v_p is to the left, so p_p is negative.

Wait, but in the calculation, I wrote:

p_e =4 m_e v_e (since v_e is positive)
p_p =2 m_e v_p (but v_p is negative, so p_p is negative)

So total p_total =4 m_e v_e + 2 m_e v_p.

But wait, v_e is (c sqrt(15)/4) ≈0.968c. v_p is (sqrt(3)/2 c) ≈0.866c, but since it's moving to the left, v_p is negative. So p_p =2 m_e (-0.866 c) = -1.732 m_e c.

So,

p_e =4 m_e (0.968 c) = 3.872 m_e c,

p_p =2 m_e (-0.866 c) = -1.732 m_e c.

Total p_total =3.872 -1.732 = 2.14 m_e c.

Wait, that's a positive value, so the initial momentum is along the x-axis and positive.

So, the sum of the photons' x-components must be 2.14 m_e c.

Each photon contributes p_photon_x = p_photon * cosθ.

But p_photon = E/c. Since E =3 m_e c²,

p_photon =3 m_e c² /c =3 m_e c.

So each photon's x-component is 3 m_e c cosθ.

Sum of the two photons' x-components: 2 *3 m_e c cosθ =6 m_e c cosθ.

Set equal to initial p_total:

6 m_e c cosθ =2.14 m_e c → 6 cosθ =2.14 → cosθ=0.3567 → θ≈69 degrees.

So each photon is at 69 degrees above and below the x-axis. The angle between them is 2θ=138 degrees.

So the angle is 138 degrees. Looking at the options, option C is 138.

Wait, but the problem says that the two photons have the same energy. So their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in y-direction. So that part seems correct.

Hmm, but another thought: wait, when two particles annihilate, the photons must move in opposite directions if the system is at rest, but in this case, the system has some initial momentum, so photons can't be back-to-back.

Wait, but in this case, the initial system is moving along the x-axis, so the photons are emitted in the same general direction but at different angles.

But according to our calculation, each photon makes an angle of about 69 degrees with the x-axis, one above and one below, so the angle between them is 138 degrees.

So the answer should be option C) 138.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation process using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron collide with Lorentz factors of 4 and 2, respectively. The total energy and momentum of the system before annihilation are calculated, and these must equal the total energy and momentum of the two photons after annihilation.

### Step 1: Initial Energy and Momentum
- The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
  \[
  E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = (4 + 2)m_e c^2 = 6m_e c^2.
  \]
- The total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. The electron moves to the right with momentum \(p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e\), and the positron moves to the left with momentum \(p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p\). Using \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\), the velocities are calculated as:
  \[
  v_e = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{16}} = c \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}, \quad v_p = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = c \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
  \]
  Substituting these into the momentum expressions:
  \[
  p_e = 4m_e v_e = 4m_e \cdot c \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} = m_e c \sqrt{15}, \quad p_p = 2m_e v_p = 2m_e \cdot c \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = m_e c \sqrt{3}.
  \]
  Since the positron moves to the left, its momentum is negative:
  \[
  p_{\text{total}} = p_e + p_p = m_e c \sqrt{15} - m_e c \sqrt{3} = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
  \]

### Step 2: Photon Energies and Momentum
After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies \(E\). Since \(E = pc\) for photons, the magnitude of the momentum of each photon is:
\[
p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E}{c}.
\]
The total energy after annihilation is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = 2E = 6m_e c^2 \implies E = 3m_e c^2.
\]
Thus, the momentum of each photon is:
\[
p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{3m_e c^2}{c} = 3m_e c.
\]

### Step 3: Conservation of Momentum
The photons move in the upper-right and lower-right directions, making angles \(\theta\) and \(-\theta\) with the x-axis, respectively. The total momentum in the x-direction is:
\[
p_{\text{total},x} = p_{\text{photon},x,1} + p_{\text{photon},x,2} = 3m_e c \cos\theta + 3m_e c \cos\theta = 6m_e c \cos\theta.
\]
The total momentum in the y-direction is:
\[
p_{\text{total},y} = p_{\text{photon},y,1} + p_{\text{photon},y,2} = 3m_e c \sin\theta - 3m_e c \sin\theta = 0.
\]
From conservation of momentum, the total x-momentum after annihilation must equal the total x-momentum before annihilation:
\[
6m_e c \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
\]
Using \(\sqrt{15} \approx 3.872\) and \(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\):
\[
6 \cos\theta \approx 3.872 - 1.732 = 2.14 \implies \cos\theta \approx \frac{2.14}{6} \approx 0.3567.
\]
Thus:
\[
\theta \approx \arccos(0.3567) \approx 69^\circ.
\]

### Step 4: Angle Between the Photons
The two photons are emitted symmetrically about the x-axis, one at \(+\theta\) and the other at \(-\theta\). The angle between them is:
\[
\phi = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
