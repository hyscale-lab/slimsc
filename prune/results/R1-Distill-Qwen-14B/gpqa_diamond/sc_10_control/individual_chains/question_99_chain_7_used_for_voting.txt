Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's see. The question mentions the compound's FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. I'll have to break down the information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Oh wait, that's typically an O-H stretch, especially in carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids have a broad peak because the O-H bonds are hydrogen-bonded, leading to a broader absorption. So that makes me think the compound has a carboxylic acid group, which matches the options given because all of them end with COOH.

Next, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. That's a carbonyl group. In a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm^-1, so that fits. So the compound must have a COOH group and a carbonyl, which aligns with the options.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several peaks, but none correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those in double bonds, but since none are present, that suggests the compound doesn't have any double bonds, which all the options here have single bonds except maybe in the substituents. Wait, no, all the options have structures without double bonds, so that's consistent.

In the NMR, there's a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, this suggests some complex splitting due to neighboring protons. Let me think about the splitting patterns.

Let's look at each option and figure out their structures.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.
So, the structure would be something like CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. Wait, that would be a structure where each H on the central carbons is connected to a C2H5 group and a CH3 or another group. Let me draw it out mentally.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.
So, that's CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the central carbons each have a CH2CH3 and a C2H5 group attached.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.
So, that's CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH. Each central H is attached to a CH3 group.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.
So, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the central carbons each have a CH3 and a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, let me try to figure out the splitting patterns. In NMR, the number of neighboring H's determines the splitting. Each proton's signal splits into a number of peaks equal to n+1, where n is the number of neighboring equivalent H's.

The first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Let's break that down. A doublet (n=1), then each of those splits into a triplet (n=2), and each of those splits into a quartet (n=3). So the splitting could be due to three different sets of neighboring protons.

Similarly, the other signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets, meaning it's split into a doublet (n=1), then each of those into triplets (n=2), and then each into triplets again (n=2) perhaps.

Wait, maybe each of these signals is from a proton that's next to different groups of protons.

Let me think about each option's structure and the possible neighboring H's.

Take option A: The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH.

Wait, the central two CH groups each have a C2H5 and a CH3 attached. So each H on the central carbons would be next to the other CH group's H's. Let me see: each H on the central C would be adjacent to a certain number of H's.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about symmetry. For example, in option C, the central H's might be identical due to symmetry.

Wait, let's consider each option's structure in more detail.

Option A: Each central C has a C2H5 (ethyl) and a CH3 group. So each H on the central C is connected to C2H5 and CH3. But wait, no, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So both central Cs have a CH3 and an ethyl group? Or wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, the formula for option A is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, the main chain is CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the two central CH groups each have a C2H5 and a CH3 attached? No, wait, CH3 is at the first carbon, then CH(C2H5), then another CH(C2H5), then CH2COOH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is: CH3 connected to C1, which is connected to C2 (CH), which has a C2H5 group. Then C2 is connected to C3 (another CH) with another C2H5, and then C3 is connected to CH2COOH.

Hmm, in that case, the two central CH groups each have two different substituents: one C2H5 and another CH3 (from C1 and C3, respectively). Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure might be: the first carbon is CH3, the second is CH(C2H5), the third is CH(C2H5), and the fourth is CH2COOH. So the two central CH groups each have a C2H5 attached, and the other substituents are from adjacent carbons.

In that case, each of the H's on the central carbons (C2 and C3) would be adjacent to the H's on the neighboring carbons. For C2, the H's are attached to a CH(C2H5) group. The neighboring carbons are C1 (CH3) and C3 (CH(C2H5)). So the H's on C2 would be next to the H's on C1 and C3.

Wait, but the CH3 group is on C1, which is adjacent to C2. So the H on C2 would be next to the H's on C1 (which is a CH3 group; but wait, CH3 doesn't have any H's attached to the same C, so the H on C2 would see the H's on C3.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about each option's symmetry and the NMR signals.

The NMR shows that none of the peaks are vinyl, which we've already considered.

Looking for the splitting patterns. Let's take a proton and see how many neighboring H's it has.

In option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

So the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH. So each central H (on C2 and C3) is attached to a CH3 group.

Each H on C2 would be adjacent to H's on C1 and C3.

Wait, no. C2 is CH(CH3), so the H on C2 is attached to C1 (which is CH3, so no H on that C), and C3 (which is CH(CH3)).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on C3. How many H's are on C3? The C3 is CH(CH3), so there's one H attached. So would the H on C2 be adjacent to that one H on C3?

Wait, but in the structure, C2 is connected to C3, so the H's on C2 are next to the H on C3. So each H on C2 has one neighboring H (from C3), and perhaps any others? Wait, but C2 is CH(CH3), so the H on C2 is attached to C2, which is connected to C1 (CH3) and C3 (CH(CH3)). So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3.

Wait, but C3 is CH(CH3), so the H on C3 is attached to C3, which is connected to C2 (CH(CH3)) and C4 (CH2COOH). So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3.

But wait, each of the H's on C2 would be next to one H on C3. So each H on C2 would split into a doublet (n=1). But in the NMR, there's a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more complex, with multiple substituents leading to more neighboring H's.

Wait, perhaps the central carbons are each attached to two different groups, creating more neighboring H environments.

Let me think about the splitting for each option.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

So the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Each H on the central C (C2 and C3) is attached to a CH2CH3 and a CH3 group.

So for C2, the H is attached to a C which is connected to C1 (CH2CH3), and C3 (C(H)(CH3)). So the H on C2 would be next to the H's on C3.

C3 has a CH group with a CH3 attached. So the H on C3 is attached to a C which is connected to C2 (C(H)(CH3)) and C4 (COOH).

So for the H on C2, it's adjacent to the H on C3. So each H on C2 is next to one H on C3. So that would split into a doublet.

But wait, are there any other neighboring H's?

C1 has a CH2CH3 group. The H's on C1 are two H's on the CH2. But the H on C2 isn't adjacent to them, since they're on the same C.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on C3 and also to any H's on adjacent substituents.

Alternatively, maybe each H on the central C is adjacent to multiple sets of H's.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the number of neighboring non-equivalent H's each proton has.

Wait, in option D, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So the two central C's (C2 and C3) each have a CH(CH3) group. So the H on C2 is attached to C2, which is connected to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (CH(CH3)).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3. So that's one set of neighboring H's (n=1), leading to a doublet.

But what about any other neighboring H's? For example, are there any H's on the same C as C2 that are adjacent? No, because the C2 is CH, so only one H.

Wait, but the C2 is connected to C1 (CH2CH3), which has two H's on the CH2 group. But these H's are on C1, not directly connected to C2's H. So the H's on C1 (CH2CH3) are two groups of two H's each, but the H on C2 isn't adjacent to them. So they wouldn't split the signal of the H on C2.

Hmm, but in the NMR, there's a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets. That suggests a more complex splitting than just a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each H is adjacent to more than one set of H's. Let me think about option B.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

So the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

So each central C (C2 and C3) has a C2H5 group attached. So the H's on C2 and C3 would be each connected to a C2H5 and a COOH group (for C3) or a CH2CH3 (for C2).

The H on C2 is attached to a C which is connected to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (C(H)(C2H5)).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3. But C3's H is attached to a C which is connected to C2 (CH2CH3) and COOH.

Wait, but the H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 and the H's from where?

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3, and perhaps the H's on the adjacent substituents.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is next to the H on C3 (n=1), and also next to the H's on the C2H5 groups attached to C2 and C3.

Wait, no. The C2H5 groups are attached to C2 and C3. The H's on those C2H5 groups are not directly adjacent to the H on C2. So perhaps the H on C2 is only next to the H on C3.

Wait, but that would only give a doublet, as before.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the possible splitting patterns again.

The first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's a complex pattern. Let's think: a doublet (n=1), then each peak splits into a triplet (n=2), and then each of those splits into a quartet (n=3). So each step is due to a different set of neighboring H's.

Similarly, the other signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (n=1, then n=2, then n=2).

So the proton must be adjacent to three different sets of H's, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: the splitting arises from neighboring H's on adjacent carbons. So the proton's environment might be such that it's next to three different groups, each contributing 1, 2, and 3 neighboring H's.

Let me take option D again: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1). But what about the substituents on C2 and C3? The C2 has a CH2CH3 group, and the C3 has a CH3 group. Are the H's on these substituents adjacent to the H on C2? For example, the CH2CH3 on C1 has two H's on the CH2 group. Are these H's adjacent to the H on C2? Since the H on C2 is attached to C2, the CH2CH3 is on C1, so the H's on CH2CH3 are not directly adjacent to the H on C2.

So perhaps the H on C2 is only adjacent to the H on C3, leading to a doublet.

Wait, but then the NMR data shows more complex splitting, so maybe I'm looking for a structure where each H is adjacent to multiple different H environments.

Another approach: perhaps the compound has symmetry, leading to equivalent protons, which would reduce the number of signals. But the question says "several peaks were observed," so perhaps not a lot of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on the central carbons have more H's, leading to more splitting.

Let me think about option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH.

So the H's on C2 and C3 are each attached to a CH3 group. The H on C2 is attached to C which is connected to C1 (CH3) and C3 (CH(CH3)).

The H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), but perhaps also to the H's on the CH3 groups attached to C2 and C3.

Wait, but CH3 groups are on C1, C2, C3, and C4 (the CH2COOH). The H's on the CH3 groups are not directly adjacent to the H on C2. For example, the H on C2 is attached to C2, which has a CH3 group. The H's on that CH3 are three H's, but they're on the same C as C2's H. So they are not adjacent, but vicinal? No, they're on the same C. So they wouldn't split the signal of the H on C2.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on C3 and also the H's on the CH2 group of the CH2COOH. But the CH2 is on C4, which is two carbons away from C2. So that might not contribute to splitting.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the possibility of geminal protons. Wait, geminal protons are on the same C as the proton in question. In that case, they would not split the NMR signal because they don't cause splitting. So geminal H's are not a factor here.

Wait, another thought: the splitting patterns might be due to coupling with two different sets of H's, each with different numbers of neighboring H's.

For example, a proton could be split by one set of two H's (n=2, triplet) and another set of one H (n=1, doublet), leading to a triplet of doublets, or a doublet of triplets. But in the problem, the signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which implies three different coupling partners.

Wait, perhaps the proton is coupled to three different groups, each contributing their own splitting. Let's think of a scenario where a proton is next to three different types of H's, each contributing one, two, and three neighboring H's.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting arises from two different neighboring H environments, each with multiple H's. For example, if a proton is adjacent to two sets of H's, one with 1 H and another with 2 H's, the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a central CH group that's connected to two different substituents, each with their own H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each central H is adjacent to two different types of substituents, each with their own number of H's.

Hmm, maybe I should think about each option's possible splitting patterns.

Option D: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Each H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3. But the substituents on C2 and C3 are a CH2CH3 and a CH3, respectively.

So the H on C2 is attached to C2, which is connected to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (CH(CH3)).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.

But what about the H's on the substituent groups? The CH2CH3 on C1 has two H's on the CH2 group. Are these H's adjacent to the H on C2? They are on C1, which is connected to C2. So the H on C2 is adjacent not to the H's on C1, but to the H on C3.

So the splitting from C3 would give a doublet. But where do the quartets come into play?

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is also adjacent to the H's on the CH3 groups attached to C2 and C3. But those are on the same C as the H on C2, so they wouldn't split it.

Alternatively, maybe the H on C2 is coupled with the H's on the adjacent CH3 groups, but that wouldn't make sense since they're not adjacent.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an option where each H is adjacent to more than one set of H's.

Wait, option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Each central H is on a C connected to a CH2CH3 (C1) and a C2H5 (C2) group, and the other C is connected to another C2H5 (C3) and COOH.

Wait, the H on C2 is attached to a C connected to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (C(H)(C2H5)).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.

But C3 is CH(C2H5), so the H on C3 is attached to a C which is connected to C2 (CH(CH2CH3)) and COOH.

Wait, maybe the H on C2 is also adjacent to the H's on the C2H5 groups attached to C2 and C3. But each C2H5 is an ethyl group, so each has two H's on the CH2 part.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on the ethyl groups attached to the neighboring carbons. But ethyl groups are on C2 and C3. Wait, no, the H on C2 is attached to C2, which has a C2H5 group. The H on C2 is connected to C2, which is connected to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (CH(C2H5)).

But the H's on the ethyl groups (C2H5) are on C2 and C3, but their H's are not adjacent to the H on C2.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is also adjacent to the H's on the ethyl groups attached to C3. Or maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on the ethyl group attached to C3. Let me think. C3's ethyl group is attached to C3, which is connected to C2. So the H on C3's ethyl group is two carbons away from C2. So perhaps their H's are not adjacent.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures again.

Looking for the splitting pattern of a doublet of triplets of quartets. That suggests three levels of splitting: first into a doublet (n=1), then each of those into triplets (n=2), and then each into quartets (n=3). So the H must be adjacent to three different sets of H's, each with 1, 2, and 3 neighboring H's, respectively.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is adjacent to a set of 1 H, then a set of 2 H's, and then another set of 3 H's, leading to the complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the H is on a central carbon that's connected to three different groups, each with their own H's.

Alternatively, maybe the H is on a carbon that's next to another carbon with multiple substituents, leading to multiple coupling.

Wait, another possibility: the compound has a gem-dimethyl group, but that doesn't seem to fit the options.

Wait, think about option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Each H on the central C's (C2 and C3) is attached to a C2H5 group and a CH3 group.

So the H on C2 is attached to C2, which is connected to C1 (CH3) and C3 (CH(C2H5)).

So the H on C2 would be adjacent to the H on C3.

But C3 has a CH(C2H5) group, so the H on C3 is attached to a C which is connected to C2 (CH(CH3)) and C4 (CH2COOH).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1).

But what about the substituents on C2 and C3? On C2, there's a CH3 group; on C3, a C2H5 group. The H's on these substituents are not adjacent to the H on C2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible structures again.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

The structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH.

So each H on C2 and C3 is attached to a CH3 group. The H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.

But perhaps there's more to it. The CH2COOH group is on C4. The H's on the CH2 would each be adjacent to the H on C3.

Wait, the H on C3 is attached to C3, which is connected to C2 (CH(CH3)) and C4 (CH2COOH).

So the H on C3 is adjacent to the H's on C4's CH2 group. Each CH2 has two H's, and they're on adjacent C.

So for the H on C3: it's adjacent to the H on C2 (n=1) and the two H's on C4's CH2 group (n=2).

That would mean the H on C3 would be split into a triplet of doublets, perhaps.

Alternatively, the H on C3 is next to C2 (one H) and next to C4's CH2 (two H's), so the splitting would be a quartet (n=3: 1 from C2 and 2 from C4's CH2? Wait, no, because it's two separate couplings.

Wait, the H on C3 would be split by the H on C2 (n=1) and the two H's on C4's CH2 (n=2). So the splitting would be a doublet of triplets, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the H on C3 is next to the H on C2 (n=1) and the two H's on C4's CH2 (n=2). So the total splitting would be (n+1) for each coupling. So for n=1, it's a doublet, then each of those splits into a triplet (n=2), leading to a doublet of triplets.

But wait, the problem states one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a more complex splitting. So maybe that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 (n=1) and the two H's on C4's CH2 (n=2), leading to a triplet of doublets, which would be a doublet of triplets. But that doesn't account for the quartets.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the splitting as each coupling step.

If a proton is split by three different sets of H's, each with n=1, n=2, and n=3, the total number of peaks would be (1+1)(2+1)(3+1) = 2*3*4=24 peaks, which is a lot. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a specific order, so perhaps it's a step-wise splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is from two different couplings: first a doublet (n=1), then each of those splits into triplets (n=2), and then each of those into quartets (n=3), leading to a complex pattern.

So, the proton must be coupled to three different sets of H's, each with 1, 2, and 3 neighboring H's.

Wait, maybe the central H is attached to a carbon that is connected to three different groups, each with their own H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the central carbon each have H's that are adjacent, leading to more splitting.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures again.

Looking at the options, perhaps option D has a structure where the central H's are each attached to a CH2CH3 and a CH3 group. So for option D, the H's on the central carbons (C2 and C3) would be adjacent to each other and also to the H's on the substituents.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), and also to the H's on the substituent groups. But substituent groups on C2 and C3 are CH2CH3 and CH3, respectively. The H's on these substituents are not directly adjacent to the H on C2.

Wait, maybe the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on the substituent groups, but that seems unlikely as they're on the same carbon.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the substituents' influence on splitting. For example, if a substituent has multiple H's, it could lead to more splitting.

Wait, let me think about the ethyl groups in option B. Each central H is connected to a C2H5 group. So the H on C2 is attached to a C which is connected to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (CH(C2H5)).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3, giving a doublet. But perhaps the CH2CH3 group on C1 has two H's on the CH2, which are vicinal to the H on C2. So the H on C2 could be coupled with these two H's, leading to a triplet (n=2). Then, perhaps the H on C3's substituent (another C2H5) has more H's adjacent.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another approach: the presence of a broad O-H peak in IR suggests it's a carboxylic acid, which all options have. The strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 is the carbonyl, which is also present.

In the NMR, the absence of vinyl protons indicates no double bonds, which all options have single bonds. So that's not an issue.

The NMR shows a complex splitting pattern, which suggests a proton that's coupled with multiple neighboring H's from different environments.

Perhaps the correct structure is option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

In this structure, each central H is attached to a CH2CH3 and a CH3 group. The H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.

Additionally, the CH2CH3 group on C1 has two H's on the CH2. The H on C2 is connected to C2, which is connected to C1. So the H on C2 is adjacent to the two H's on the CH2 of C1. Wait, no. The H on C2 is on C2; the CH2 is on C1, which is adjacent to C2. So the H's on C1's CH2 are vicinal to the H on C2, but not directly adjacent. Vicinal coupling (J) can still cause splitting, but it's usually smaller and sometimes not observed, especially in more complex structures.

But if the splitting from C3's H (n=1) and the CH2's H's (n=2) are both present, then the H on C2 would first be split into a doublet (from C3), then each of those peaks would be split into triplets (from the two H's on CH2), leading to a doublet of triplets. Then, perhaps another splitting from another source, leading to a quartet.

Wait, but where would that quartet come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is also adjacent to the H's on the substituent groups of C3. For example, C3 has a CH3 group. The H on C2 might be adjacent to the H's on C3's substituent, but that's not directly connected.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The problem mentions that one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Looking at option D: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So the H's on C2 and C3 would each have similar environments. Let's focus on the H on C2.

The H on C2 is attached to C2, which is connected to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (CH(CH3)).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.

The CH2CH3 group on C1 has two H's on the CH2, which are adjacent to C2. So the H on C2 is adjacent to these two H's as well. So that's n=2.

So the splitting would first be a doublet (n=1 from C3), then each peak would split into a triplet (n=2 from CH2CH3), leading to a doublet of triplets.

But where does the quartet come into play? Maybe I'm missing another coupling.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is also adjacent to the H's on the CH3 group attached to C3. The CH3 on C3 is attached to C3, which is connected to C2. So the H's on C3's CH3 are on the same C as C3. The H on C2 is attached to C2, which is connected to C3. So the H on C2 is adjacent to the three H's on C3's CH3. Wait, no, because the H's on CH3 are on the same C as C3, which is connected to C2. So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on C3's CH3 group, but that's three H's. So n=3, leading to a quartet.

Wait, that would mean the H on C2 is split by three H's (from C3's CH3), leading to a quartet. But earlier, it was split by the H on C3 (n=1) and the two H's from C1's CH2 (n=2).

Wait, no, because the H on C2 is attached to C2, which is connected to C3. The CH3 on C3 is attached to C3, so the H on C2 is adjacent to the three H's on C3's CH3 group. So n=3, leading to a quartet.

But earlier, the H on C2 is also adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1) and the two H's on C1's CH2 (n=2). So the splitting would be a combination of these.

Wait, but the H on C2 can't be adjacent to both the H on C3 and the three H's on C3's CH3 group. Because the CH3 is on C3, and the H on C3 is one H. So maybe the H on C2 is adjacent to the three H's on C3's CH3 group, giving a quartet. Then, this quartet would be further split by the H on C3 (n=1), leading to a quartet of doublets. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a different order.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on C3's CH3 group. That would be three H's, n=3, leading to a quartet. But it's also adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet. So the splitting would be a quartet of doublets.

But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a more complex pattern. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

In this structure, each H on C2 and C3 is attached to a C2H5 group.

So, the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.

Additionally, the C2H5 groups on C2 and C3 have two H's each on their CH2 groups. The H on C2 is adjacent to the two H's on C3's C2H5 group (n=2), leading to a triplet.

Then, perhaps the H on C2 is also adjacent to the two H's on C1's CH2CH3 group (n=2), leading to another triplet.

So the splitting would be a doublet (from C3) → each splits into a triplet (from C3's C2H5) → then each of those splits into another triplet (from C1's CH2CH3), leading to a doublet of triplets of triplets, which doesn't match the quartet in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the two H's on C3's C2H5 (n=2, triplet) and the two H's on C1's CH2CH3 (n=2, triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets, which is a more complex pattern.

Hmm, but the problem states one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So perhaps option B isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D. Let me try again.

In option D, each central H is attached to a CH2CH3 and a CH3 group.

The H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1, doublet).

Additionally, the CH2CH3 on C1 has two H's on the CH2, which are adjacent to C2. So the H on C2 is adjacent to these two H's (n=2, triplet).

Then, perhaps the H on C3's CH3 group has three H's, but the H on C2 is not directly adjacent to them. So maybe that's not a factor.

Wait, but if the H on C2 is adjacent to the two H's on C1's CH2 (n=2), then the splitting would be a triplet. But the initial splitting is a doublet from C3.

So the initial split is a doublet (n=1), then each of those splits into a triplet (n=2), leading to a doublet of triplets.

But the problem has a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets, which implies an additional split.

Ah, perhaps the H on C2 is also adjacent to the three H's on the CH3 group attached to C2 (n=3, quartet). So the order of splitting would be:

- Doublet (n=1 from C3)
- Each peak splits into a triplet (n=2 from C1's CH2)
- Each of those splits into a quartet (n=3 from C2's CH3)

So the total splitting would be a doublet of triplets of quartets, which matches the description.

Wait, but wait. The H on C2 is attached to a CH3 group. Are the H's on that CH3 group adjacent to the H on C2? No, because they're on the same C. So they're geminal and don't split the signal.

Hmm, that's a problem. So that can't be the case. So perhaps the quartet comes from another source.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the three H's on C3's CH3 group. If C3's CH3 is attached to C3, which is connected to C2, then the H on C2 is adjacent to the three H's on C3's CH3. So n=3, leading to a quartet.

So the H on C2 is adjacent to:

1. The H on C3 (n=1, doublet)
2. The two H's on C1's CH2CH3 (n=2, triplet)
3. The three H's on C3's CH3 (n=3, quartet)

Wait, but that would require the H on C2 to be adjacent to three different sets of H's, each with n=1, 2, and 3. That would lead to a splitting pattern of (1+1)(2+1)(3+1) = 2*3*4 = 24 peaks, which is a lot and may not be observed as such. But the problem states it's a doublet of triplets of quartets, which suggests the splitting occurs step-wise, perhaps in a specific order.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to:

- One H (n=1, doublet)
- Two H's (n=2, triplet)
- Three H's (n=3, quartet)

But how would that happen in the structure?

Wait, maybe the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), the two H's on C1's CH2 (n=2), and the three H's on C3's CH3 (n=3). But I'm not sure if this is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), the two H's on the ethyl group attached to C3 (n=2), and the three H's on C3's CH3 (n=3). But then, the ethyl group is on C3, so the H on C2 is adjacent to their H's.

Wait, but the ethyl group is on C3, so the H on C2 would be adjacent to the two H's on the CH2 of the ethyl group attached to C3. So n=2, leading to a triplet.

Then, the H on C2 is adjacent to the three H's on C3's CH3 group, leading to a quartet.

So the splitting would be:

1. Doublet (n=1 from C3)
2. Each peak splits into a triplet (n=2 from C3's ethyl CH2)
3. Each of those splits into a quartet (n=3 from C3's CH3)

So the overall pattern is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which matches the problem's description.

If that's the case, then the structure would be option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Wait, but looking back, option D is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So C3 is connected to COOH, which is CH2COOH. No, wait, in option D, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH, so the last group is COOH. So the C3 is attached to COOH.

Wait, so the H on C3 is attached to a C which is connected to C2 (CH(CH3)) and COOH.

So the H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 (n=1), and perhaps the H's on the substituents attached to C3.

But in option D, the substituents on C3 are a CH3 and a COOH group. The COOH is -COOH, which has an OOH group but no H's attached to C3.

So the H on C3 is only adjacent to the H on C2 (n=1), leading to a doublet.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated, and I'm not making progress. Let me try to summarize.

The key points from the NMR data are:

- No vinyl protons → structure has no double bonds.
- Splitting patterns suggest multiple coupling partners.
- One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets → three levels of splitting with n=1, 2, 3.
- Another signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets → three levels with n=1, 2, 2.

Looking at the options, option D seems to have a structure where the central H's are each attached to a CH2CH3 and a CH3 group, leading to multiple coupling possibilities.

I think the correct answer is option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying a compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid, and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹, corresponding to a carbonyl group. The 1H NMR spectrum reveals several peaks, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, and two complex splitting patterns: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**  
   - The structure has two central CH groups, each attached to a CH₃ and a C₂H₅ group.  
   - The H on the central CH groups would be adjacent to the H on the other CH group (n=1, doublet) and the two H's on the CH₂ of the C₂H₅ group (n=2, triplet).  
   - This would result in a doublet of triplets, but it does not account for the quartet splitting observed in the NMR data.  

2. **Option B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**  
   - The structure has two central CH groups, each attached to a CH₂CH₃ and a C₂H₅ group.  
   - The H on the central CH groups would be adjacent to the H on the other CH group (n=1, doublet) and the two H's on the C₂H₅ group (n=2, triplet).  
   - This would result in a doublet of triplets of triplets, but it does not match the doublet of triplets of quartets observed in the NMR data.  

3. **Option C: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**  
   - The structure has two central CH groups, each attached to two CH₃ groups.  
   - The H on the central CH groups would be adjacent to the H on the other CH group (n=1, doublet) and the two H's on the CH₂ of the CH₂COOH group (n=2, triplet).  
   - This would result in a doublet of triplets, but it does not account for the quartet splitting observed in the NMR data.  

4. **Option D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**  
   - The structure has two central CH groups, each attached to a CH₂CH₃ and a CH₃ group.  
   - The H on the central CH groups would be adjacent to the H on the other CH group (n=1, doublet), the two H's on the CH₂ of the CH₂CH₃ group (n=2, triplet), and the three H's on the CH₃ group (n=3, quartet).  
   - This results in the observed splitting pattern of a doublet of triplets of quartets.  

### Conclusion:
Option D matches the spectroscopic data, including the splitting patterns observed in the 1H NMR spectrum.  

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's see. The question mentions the compound's FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. I'll have to break down the information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Oh wait, that's typically an O-H stretch, especially in carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids have a broad peak because the O-H bonds are hydrogen-bonded, leading to a broader absorption. So that makes me think the compound has a carboxylic acid group, which matches the options given because all of them end with COOH.

Next, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. That's a carbonyl group. In a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm^-1, so that fits. So the compound must have a COOH group and a carbonyl, which aligns with the options.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several peaks, but none correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those in double bonds, but since none are present, that suggests the compound doesn't have any double bonds, which all the options here have single bonds except maybe in the substituents. Wait, no, all the options have structures without double bonds, so that's consistent.

In the NMR, there's a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, this suggests some complex splitting due to neighboring protons. Let me think about the splitting patterns.

Let's look at each option and figure out their structures.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.
So, the structure would be something like CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. Wait, that would be a structure where each H on the central carbons is connected to a C2H5 group and a CH3 or another group. Let me draw it out mentally.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.
So, that's CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the central carbons each have a CH2CH3 and a C2H5 group attached.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.
So, that's CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH. Each central H is attached to a CH3 group.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.
So, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the central carbons each have a CH3 and a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, let me try to figure out the splitting patterns. In NMR, the number of neighboring H's determines the splitting. Each proton's signal splits into a number of peaks equal to n+1, where n is the number of neighboring equivalent H's.

The first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Let's break that down. A doublet (n=1), then each of those splits into a triplet (n=2), and each of those splits into a quartet (n=3). So the splitting could be due to three different sets of neighboring protons.

Similarly, the other signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets, meaning it's split into a doublet (n=1), then each of those into triplets (n=2), and then each into triplets again (n=2) perhaps.

Wait, maybe each of these signals is from a proton that's next to different groups of protons.

Let me think about each option's structure and the possible neighboring H's.

Take option A: The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH.

Wait, the central two CH groups each have a C2H5 and a CH3 attached. So each H on the central carbons would be next to the other CH group's H's. Let me see: each H on the central C would be adjacent to a certain number of H's.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about symmetry. For example, in option C, the central H's might be identical due to symmetry.

Wait, let's consider each option's structure in more detail.

Option A: Each central C has a C2H5 (ethyl) and a CH3 group. So each H on the central C is connected to C2H5 and CH3. But wait, no, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So both central Cs have a CH3 and an ethyl group? Or wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, the formula for option A is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, the main chain is CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the two central CH groups each have a C2H5 and a CH3 attached? No, wait, CH3 is at the first carbon, then CH(C2H5), then another CH(C2H5), then CH2COOH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is: CH3 connected to C1, which is connected to C2 (CH), which has a C2H5 group. Then C2 is connected to C3 (another CH) with another C2H5, and then C3 is connected to CH2COOH.

Hmm, in that case, the two central CH groups each have two different substituents: one C2H5 and another CH3 (from C1 and C3, respectively). Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure might be: the first carbon is CH3, the second is CH(C2H5), the third is CH(C2H5), and the fourth is CH2COOH. So the two central CH groups each have a C2H5 attached, and the other substituents are from adjacent carbons.

In that case, each of the H's on the central carbons (C2 and C3) would be adjacent to the H's on the neighboring carbons. For C2, the H's are attached to a CH(C2H5) group. The neighboring carbons are C1 (CH3) and C3 (CH(C2H5)). So the H's on C2 would be next to the H's on C1 and C3.

Wait, but the CH3 group is on C1, which is adjacent to C2. So the H on C2 would be next to the H's on C1 (which is a CH3 group; but wait, CH3 doesn't have any H's attached to the same C, so the H on C2 would see the H's on C3.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about each option's symmetry and the NMR signals.

The NMR shows that none of the peaks are vinyl, which we've already considered.

Looking for the splitting patterns. Let's take a proton and see how many neighboring H's it has.

In option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

So the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH. So each central H (on C2 and C3) is attached to a CH3 group.

Each H on C2 would be adjacent to H's on C1 and C3.

Wait, no. C2 is CH(CH3), so the H on C2 is attached to C1 (which is CH3, so no H on that C), and C3 (which is CH(CH3)).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on C3. How many H's are on C3? The C3 is CH(CH3), so there's one H attached. So would the H on C2 be adjacent to that one H on C3?

Wait, but in the structure, C2 is connected to C3, so the H's on C2 are next to the H on C3. So each H on C2 has one neighboring H (from C3), and perhaps any others? Wait, but C2 is CH(CH3), so the H on C2 is attached to C2, which is connected to C1 (CH3) and C3 (CH(CH3)). So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3.

Wait, but C3 is CH(CH3), so the H on C3 is attached to C3, which is connected to C2 (CH(CH3)) and C4 (CH2COOH). So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3.

But wait, each of the H's on C2 would be next to one H on C3. So each H on C2 would split into a doublet (n=1). But in the NMR, there's a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more complex, with multiple substituents leading to more neighboring H's.

Wait, perhaps the central carbons are each attached to two different groups, creating more neighboring H environments.

Let me think about the splitting for each option.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

So the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Each H on the central C (C2 and C3) is attached to a CH2CH3 and a CH3 group.

So for C2, the H is attached to a C which is connected to C1 (CH2CH3), and C3 (C(H)(CH3)). So the H on C2 would be next to the H's on C3.

C3 has a CH group with a CH3 attached. So the H on C3 is attached to a C which is connected to C2 (C(H)(CH3)) and C4 (COOH).

So for the H on C2, it's adjacent to the H on C3. So each H on C2 is next to one H on C3. So that would split into a doublet.

But wait, are there any other neighboring H's?

C1 has a CH2CH3 group. The H's on C1 are two H's on the CH2. But the H on C2 isn't adjacent to them, since they're on the same C.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on C3 and also to any H's on adjacent substituents.

Alternatively, maybe each H on the central C is adjacent to multiple sets of H's.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the number of neighboring non-equivalent H's each proton has.

Wait, in option D, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So the two central C's (C2 and C3) each have a CH(CH3) group. So the H on C2 is attached to C2, which is connected to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (CH(CH3)).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3. So that's one set of neighboring H's (n=1), leading to a doublet.

But what about any other neighboring H's? For example, are there any H's on the same C as C2 that are adjacent? No, because the C2 is CH, so only one H.

Wait, but the C2 is connected to C1 (CH2CH3), which has two H's on the CH2 group. But these H's are on C1, not directly connected to C2's H. So the H's on C1 (CH2CH3) are two groups of two H's each, but the H on C2 isn't adjacent to them. So they wouldn't split the signal of the H on C2.

Hmm, but in the NMR, there's a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets. That suggests a more complex splitting than just a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each H is adjacent to more than one set of H's. Let me think about option B.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

So the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

So each central C (C2 and C3) has a C2H5 group attached. So the H's on C2 and C3 would be each connected to a C2H5 and a COOH group (for C3) or a CH2CH3 (for C2).

The H on C2 is attached to a C which is connected to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (C(H)(C2H5)).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3. But C3's H is attached to a C which is connected to C2 (CH2CH3) and COOH.

Wait, but the H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 and the H's from where?

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3, and perhaps the H's on the adjacent substituents.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is next to the H on C3 (n=1), and also next to the H's on the C2H5 groups attached to C2 and C3.

Wait, no. The C2H5 groups are attached to C2 and C3. The H's on those C2H5 groups are not directly adjacent to the H on C2. So perhaps the H on C2 is only next to the H on C3.

Wait, but that would only give a doublet, as before.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the possible splitting patterns again.

The first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's a complex pattern. Let's think: a doublet (n=1), then each peak splits into a triplet (n=2), and then each of those splits into a quartet (n=3). So each step is due to a different set of neighboring H's.

Similarly, the other signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (n=1, then n=2, then n=2).

So the proton must be adjacent to three different sets of H's, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: the splitting arises from neighboring H's on adjacent carbons. So the proton's environment might be such that it's next to three different groups, each contributing 1, 2, and 3 neighboring H's.

Let me take option D again: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1). But what about the substituents on C2 and C3? The C2 has a CH2CH3 group, and the C3 has a CH3 group. Are the H's on these substituents adjacent to the H on C2? For example, the CH2CH3 on C1 has two H's on the CH2 group. Are these H's adjacent to the H on C2? Since the H on C2 is attached to C2, the CH2CH3 is on C1, so the H's on CH2CH3 are not directly adjacent to the H on C2.

So perhaps the H on C2 is only adjacent to the H on C3, leading to a doublet.

Wait, but then the NMR data shows more complex splitting, so maybe I'm looking for a structure where each H is adjacent to multiple different H environments.

Another approach: perhaps the compound has symmetry, leading to equivalent protons, which would reduce the number of signals. But the question says "several peaks were observed," so perhaps not a lot of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on the central carbons have more H's, leading to more splitting.

Let me think about option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH.

So the H's on C2 and C3 are each attached to a CH3 group. The H on C2 is attached to C which is connected to C1 (CH3) and C3 (CH(CH3)).

The H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), but perhaps also to the H's on the CH3 groups attached to C2 and C3.

Wait, but CH3 groups are on C1, C2, C3, and C4 (the CH2COOH). The H's on the CH3 groups are not directly adjacent to the H on C2. For example, the H on C2 is attached to C2, which has a CH3 group. The H's on that CH3 are three H's, but they're on the same C as C2's H. So they are not adjacent, but vicinal? No, they're on the same C. So they wouldn't split the signal of the H on C2.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on C3 and also the H's on the CH2 group of the CH2COOH. But the CH2 is on C4, which is two carbons away from C2. So that might not contribute to splitting.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the possibility of geminal protons. Wait, geminal protons are on the same C as the proton in question. In that case, they would not split the NMR signal because they don't cause splitting. So geminal H's are not a factor here.

Wait, another thought: the splitting patterns might be due to coupling with two different sets of H's, each with different numbers of neighboring H's.

For example, a proton could be split by one set of two H's (n=2, triplet) and another set of one H (n=1, doublet), leading to a triplet of doublets, or a doublet of triplets. But in the problem, the signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which implies three different coupling partners.

Wait, perhaps the proton is coupled to three different groups, each contributing their own splitting. Let's think of a scenario where a proton is next to three different types of H's, each contributing one, two, and three neighboring H's.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting arises from two different neighboring H environments, each with multiple H's. For example, if a proton is adjacent to two sets of H's, one with 1 H and another with 2 H's, the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a central CH group that's connected to two different substituents, each with their own H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each central H is adjacent to two different types of substituents, each with their own number of H's.

Hmm, maybe I should think about each option's possible splitting patterns.

Option D: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Each H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3. But the substituents on C2 and C3 are a CH2CH3 and a CH3, respectively.

So the H on C2 is attached to C2, which is connected to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (CH(CH3)).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.

But what about the H's on the substituent groups? The CH2CH3 on C1 has two H's on the CH2 group. Are these H's adjacent to the H on C2? They are on C1, which is connected to C2. So the H on C2 is adjacent not to the H's on C1, but to the H on C3.

So the splitting from C3 would give a doublet. But where do the quartets come into play?

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is also adjacent to the H's on the CH3 groups attached to C2 and C3. But those are on the same C as the H on C2, so they wouldn't split it.

Alternatively, maybe the H on C2 is coupled with the H's on the adjacent CH3 groups, but that wouldn't make sense since they're not adjacent.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an option where each H is adjacent to more than one set of H's.

Wait, option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Each central H is on a C connected to a CH2CH3 (C1) and a C2H5 (C2) group, and the other C is connected to another C2H5 (C3) and COOH.

Wait, the H on C2 is attached to a C connected to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (C(H)(C2H5)).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.

But C3 is CH(C2H5), so the H on C3 is attached to a C which is connected to C2 (CH(CH2CH3)) and COOH.

Wait, maybe the H on C2 is also adjacent to the H's on the C2H5 groups attached to C2 and C3. But each C2H5 is an ethyl group, so each has two H's on the CH2 part.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on the ethyl groups attached to the neighboring carbons. But ethyl groups are on C2 and C3. Wait, no, the H on C2 is attached to C2, which has a C2H5 group. The H on C2 is connected to C2, which is connected to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (CH(C2H5)).

But the H's on the ethyl groups (C2H5) are on C2 and C3, but their H's are not adjacent to the H on C2.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is also adjacent to the H's on the ethyl groups attached to C3. Or maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on the ethyl group attached to C3. Let me think. C3's ethyl group is attached to C3, which is connected to C2. So the H on C3's ethyl group is two carbons away from C2. So perhaps their H's are not adjacent.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures again.

Looking for the splitting pattern of a doublet of triplets of quartets. That suggests three levels of splitting: first into a doublet (n=1), then each of those into triplets (n=2), and then each into quartets (n=3). So the H must be adjacent to three different sets of H's, each with 1, 2, and 3 neighboring H's, respectively.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is adjacent to a set of 1 H, then a set of 2 H's, and then another set of 3 H's, leading to the complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the H is on a central carbon that's connected to three different groups, each with their own H's.

Alternatively, maybe the H is on a carbon that's next to another carbon with multiple substituents, leading to multiple coupling.

Wait, another possibility: the compound has a gem-dimethyl group, but that doesn't seem to fit the options.

Wait, think about option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Each H on the central C's (C2 and C3) is attached to a C2H5 group and a CH3 group.

So the H on C2 is attached to C2, which is connected to C1 (CH3) and C3 (CH(C2H5)).

So the H on C2 would be adjacent to the H on C3.

But C3 has a CH(C2H5) group, so the H on C3 is attached to a C which is connected to C2 (CH(CH3)) and C4 (CH2COOH).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1).

But what about the substituents on C2 and C3? On C2, there's a CH3 group; on C3, a C2H5 group. The H's on these substituents are not adjacent to the H on C2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible structures again.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

The structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH.

So each H on C2 and C3 is attached to a CH3 group. The H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.

But perhaps there's more to it. The CH2COOH group is on C4. The H's on the CH2 would each be adjacent to the H on C3.

Wait, the H on C3 is attached to C3, which is connected to C2 (CH(CH3)) and C4 (CH2COOH).

So the H on C3 is adjacent to the H's on C4's CH2 group. Each CH2 has two H's, and they're on adjacent C.

So for the H on C3: it's adjacent to the H on C2 (n=1) and the two H's on C4's CH2 group (n=2).

That would mean the H on C3 would be split into a triplet of doublets, perhaps.

Alternatively, the H on C3 is next to C2 (one H) and next to C4's CH2 (two H's), so the splitting would be a quartet (n=3: 1 from C2 and 2 from C4's CH2? Wait, no, because it's two separate couplings.

Wait, the H on C3 would be split by the H on C2 (n=1) and the two H's on C4's CH2 (n=2). So the splitting would be a doublet of triplets, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the H on C3 is next to the H on C2 (n=1) and the two H's on C4's CH2 (n=2). So the total splitting would be (n+1) for each coupling. So for n=1, it's a doublet, then each of those splits into a triplet (n=2), leading to a doublet of triplets.

But wait, the problem states one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a more complex splitting. So maybe that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 (n=1) and the two H's on C4's CH2 (n=2), leading to a triplet of doublets, which would be a doublet of triplets. But that doesn't account for the quartets.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the splitting as each coupling step.

If a proton is split by three different sets of H's, each with n=1, n=2, and n=3, the total number of peaks would be (1+1)(2+1)(3+1) = 2*3*4=24 peaks, which is a lot. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a specific order, so perhaps it's a step-wise splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is from two different couplings: first a doublet (n=1), then each of those splits into triplets (n=2), and then each of those into quartets (n=3), leading to a complex pattern.

So, the proton must be coupled to three different sets of H's, each with 1, 2, and 3 neighboring H's.

Wait, maybe the central H is attached to a carbon that is connected to three different groups, each with their own H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the central carbon each have H's that are adjacent, leading to more splitting.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures again.

Looking at the options, perhaps option D has a structure where the central H's are each attached to a CH2CH3 and a CH3 group. So for option D, the H's on the central carbons (C2 and C3) would be adjacent to each other and also to the H's on the substituents.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), and also to the H's on the substituent groups. But substituent groups on C2 and C3 are CH2CH3 and CH3, respectively. The H's on these substituents are not directly adjacent to the H on C2.

Wait, maybe the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on the substituent groups, but that seems unlikely as they're on the same carbon.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the substituents' influence on splitting. For example, if a substituent has multiple H's, it could lead to more splitting.

Wait, let me think about the ethyl groups in option B. Each central H is connected to a C2H5 group. So the H on C2 is attached to a C which is connected to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (CH(C2H5)).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3, giving a doublet. But perhaps the CH2CH3 group on C1 has two H's on the CH2, which are vicinal to the H on C2. So the H on C2 could be coupled with these two H's, leading to a triplet (n=2). Then, perhaps the H on C3's substituent (another C2H5) has more H's adjacent.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another approach: the presence of a broad O-H peak in IR suggests it's a carboxylic acid, which all options have. The strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 is the carbonyl, which is also present.

In the NMR, the absence of vinyl protons indicates no double bonds, which all options have single bonds. So that's not an issue.

The NMR shows a complex splitting pattern, which suggests a proton that's coupled with multiple neighboring H's from different environments.

Perhaps the correct structure is option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

In this structure, each central H is attached to a CH2CH3 and a CH3 group. The H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.

Additionally, the CH2CH3 group on C1 has two H's on the CH2. The H on C2 is connected to C2, which is connected to C1. So the H on C2 is adjacent to the two H's on the CH2 of C1. Wait, no. The H on C2 is on C2; the CH2 is on C1, which is adjacent to C2. So the H's on C1's CH2 are vicinal to the H on C2, but not directly adjacent. Vicinal coupling (J) can still cause splitting, but it's usually smaller and sometimes not observed, especially in more complex structures.

But if the splitting from C3's H (n=1) and the CH2's H's (n=2) are both present, then the H on C2 would first be split into a doublet (from C3), then each of those peaks would be split into triplets (from the two H's on CH2), leading to a doublet of triplets. Then, perhaps another splitting from another source, leading to a quartet.

Wait, but where would that quartet come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is also adjacent to the H's on the substituent groups of C3. For example, C3 has a CH3 group. The H on C2 might be adjacent to the H's on C3's substituent, but that's not directly connected.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The problem mentions that one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Looking at option D: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So the H's on C2 and C3 would each have similar environments. Let's focus on the H on C2.

The H on C2 is attached to C2, which is connected to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (CH(CH3)).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.

The CH2CH3 group on C1 has two H's on the CH2, which are adjacent to C2. So the H on C2 is adjacent to these two H's as well. So that's n=2.

So the splitting would first be a doublet (n=1 from C3), then each peak would split into a triplet (n=2 from CH2CH3), leading to a doublet of triplets.

But where does the quartet come into play? Maybe I'm missing another coupling.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is also adjacent to the H's on the CH3 group attached to C3. The CH3 on C3 is attached to C3, which is connected to C2. So the H's on C3's CH3 are on the same C as C3. The H on C2 is attached to C2, which is connected to C3. So the H on C2 is adjacent to the three H's on C3's CH3. Wait, no, because the H's on CH3 are on the same C as C3, which is connected to C2. So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on C3's CH3 group, but that's three H's. So n=3, leading to a quartet.

Wait, that would mean the H on C2 is split by three H's (from C3's CH3), leading to a quartet. But earlier, it was split by the H on C3 (n=1) and the two H's from C1's CH2 (n=2).

Wait, no, because the H on C2 is attached to C2, which is connected to C3. The CH3 on C3 is attached to C3, so the H on C2 is adjacent to the three H's on C3's CH3 group. So n=3, leading to a quartet.

But earlier, the H on C2 is also adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1) and the two H's on C1's CH2 (n=2). So the splitting would be a combination of these.

Wait, but the H on C2 can't be adjacent to both the H on C3 and the three H's on C3's CH3 group. Because the CH3 is on C3, and the H on C3 is one H. So maybe the H on C2 is adjacent to the three H's on C3's CH3 group, giving a quartet. Then, this quartet would be further split by the H on C3 (n=1), leading to a quartet of doublets. But the problem states a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a different order.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on C3's CH3 group. That would be three H's, n=3, leading to a quartet. But it's also adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet. So the splitting would be a quartet of doublets.

But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a more complex pattern. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

In this structure, each H on C2 and C3 is attached to a C2H5 group.

So, the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), leading to a doublet.

Additionally, the C2H5 groups on C2 and C3 have two H's each on their CH2 groups. The H on C2 is adjacent to the two H's on C3's C2H5 group (n=2), leading to a triplet.

Then, perhaps the H on C2 is also adjacent to the two H's on C1's CH2CH3 group (n=2), leading to another triplet.

So the splitting would be a doublet (from C3) → each splits into a triplet (from C3's C2H5) → then each of those splits into another triplet (from C1's CH2CH3), leading to a doublet of triplets of triplets, which doesn't match the quartet in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the two H's on C3's C2H5 (n=2, triplet) and the two H's on C1's CH2CH3 (n=2, triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets, which is a more complex pattern.

Hmm, but the problem states one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So perhaps option B isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D. Let me try again.

In option D, each central H is attached to a CH2CH3 and a CH3 group.

The H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1, doublet).

Additionally, the CH2CH3 on C1 has two H's on the CH2, which are adjacent to C2. So the H on C2 is adjacent to these two H's (n=2, triplet).

Then, perhaps the H on C3's CH3 group has three H's, but the H on C2 is not directly adjacent to them. So maybe that's not a factor.

Wait, but if the H on C2 is adjacent to the two H's on C1's CH2 (n=2), then the splitting would be a triplet. But the initial splitting is a doublet from C3.

So the initial split is a doublet (n=1), then each of those splits into a triplet (n=2), leading to a doublet of triplets.

But the problem has a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets, which implies an additional split.

Ah, perhaps the H on C2 is also adjacent to the three H's on the CH3 group attached to C2 (n=3, quartet). So the order of splitting would be:

- Doublet (n=1 from C3)
- Each peak splits into a triplet (n=2 from C1's CH2)
- Each of those splits into a quartet (n=3 from C2's CH3)

So the total splitting would be a doublet of triplets of quartets, which matches the description.

Wait, but wait. The H on C2 is attached to a CH3 group. Are the H's on that CH3 group adjacent to the H on C2? No, because they're on the same C. So they're geminal and don't split the signal.

Hmm, that's a problem. So that can't be the case. So perhaps the quartet comes from another source.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the three H's on C3's CH3 group. If C3's CH3 is attached to C3, which is connected to C2, then the H on C2 is adjacent to the three H's on C3's CH3. So n=3, leading to a quartet.

So the H on C2 is adjacent to:

1. The H on C3 (n=1, doublet)
2. The two H's on C1's CH2CH3 (n=2, triplet)
3. The three H's on C3's CH3 (n=3, quartet)

Wait, but that would require the H on C2 to be adjacent to three different sets of H's, each with n=1, 2, and 3. That would lead to a splitting pattern of (1+1)(2+1)(3+1) = 2*3*4 = 24 peaks, which is a lot and may not be observed as such. But the problem states it's a doublet of triplets of quartets, which suggests the splitting occurs step-wise, perhaps in a specific order.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to:

- One H (n=1, doublet)
- Two H's (n=2, triplet)
- Three H's (n=3, quartet)

But how would that happen in the structure?

Wait, maybe the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), the two H's on C1's CH2 (n=2), and the three H's on C3's CH3 (n=3). But I'm not sure if this is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (n=1), the two H's on the ethyl group attached to C3 (n=2), and the three H's on C3's CH3 (n=3). But then, the ethyl group is on C3, so the H on C2 is adjacent to their H's.

Wait, but the ethyl group is on C3, so the H on C2 would be adjacent to the two H's on the CH2 of the ethyl group attached to C3. So n=2, leading to a triplet.

Then, the H on C2 is adjacent to the three H's on C3's CH3 group, leading to a quartet.

So the splitting would be:

1. Doublet (n=1 from C3)
2. Each peak splits into a triplet (n=2 from C3's ethyl CH2)
3. Each of those splits into a quartet (n=3 from C3's CH3)

So the overall pattern is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which matches the problem's description.

If that's the case, then the structure would be option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Wait, but looking back, option D is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So C3 is connected to COOH, which is CH2COOH. No, wait, in option D, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH, so the last group is COOH. So the C3 is attached to COOH.

Wait, so the H on C3 is attached to a C which is connected to C2 (CH(CH3)) and COOH.

So the H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 (n=1), and perhaps the H's on the substituents attached to C3.

But in option D, the substituents on C3 are a CH3 and a COOH group. The COOH is -COOH, which has an OOH group but no H's attached to C3.

So the H on C3 is only adjacent to the H on C2 (n=1), leading to a doublet.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated, and I'm not making progress. Let me try to summarize.

The key points from the NMR data are:

- No vinyl protons → structure has no double bonds.
- Splitting patterns suggest multiple coupling partners.
- One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets → three levels of splitting with n=1, 2, 3.
- Another signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets → three levels with n=1, 2, 2.

Looking at the options, option D seems to have a structure where the central H's are each attached to a CH2CH3 and a CH3 group, leading to multiple coupling possibilities.

I think the correct answer is option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.


The question involves identifying a compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid, and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹, corresponding to a carbonyl group. The 1H NMR spectrum reveals several peaks, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, and two complex splitting patterns: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**  
   - The structure has two central CH groups, each attached to a CH₃ and a C₂H₅ group.  
   - The H on the central CH groups would be adjacent to the H on the other CH group (n=1, doublet) and the two H's on the CH₂ of the C₂H₅ group (n=2, triplet).  
   - This would result in a doublet of triplets, but it does not account for the quartet splitting observed in the NMR data.  

2. **Option B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**  
   - The structure has two central CH groups, each attached to a CH₂CH₃ and a C₂H₅ group.  
   - The H on the central CH groups would be adjacent to the H on the other CH group (n=1, doublet) and the two H's on the C₂H₅ group (n=2, triplet).  
   - This would result in a doublet of triplets of triplets, but it does not match the doublet of triplets of quartets observed in the NMR data.  

3. **Option C: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**  
   - The structure has two central CH groups, each attached to two CH₃ groups.  
   - The H on the central CH groups would be adjacent to the H on the other CH group (n=1, doublet) and the two H's on the CH₂ of the CH₂COOH group (n=2, triplet).  
   - This would result in a doublet of triplets, but it does not account for the quartet splitting observed in the NMR data.  

4. **Option D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**  
   - The structure has two central CH groups, each attached to a CH₂CH₃ and a CH₃ group.  
   - The H on the central CH groups would be adjacent to the H on the other CH group (n=1, doublet), the two H's on the CH₂ of the CH₂CH₃ group (n=2, triplet), and the three H's on the CH₃ group (n=3, quartet).  
   - This results in the observed splitting pattern of a doublet of triplets of quartets.  

### Conclusion:
Option D matches the spectroscopic data, including the splitting patterns observed in the 1H NMR spectrum.  

**Answer: D**
