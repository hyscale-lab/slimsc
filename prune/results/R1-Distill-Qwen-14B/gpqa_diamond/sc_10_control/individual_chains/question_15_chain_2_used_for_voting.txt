Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the planet's orbital distance.

The question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period that's three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because the orbital period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law.

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, because one is slightly evolved but they're the same size. So, same radius, but different masses. That might affect the probability of transit.

I need to find out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a_s / a_p), but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (something else?), or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the chance that the orbit is aligned edge-on.

Wait, I think the transit probability formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - e^2)) * ( (a_s * sin i) / (a_p) ) ), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that term goes away. So the transit probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a) * (something else...).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The probability of a transit is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a) * (some factor?), or is it more about the alignment. Alternatively, maybe the formula is (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / (a) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I remember a simpler version. The probability that a planet transits is approximately the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, but scaled by the planet's size relative to the star. Or another way: the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), because the orbital distance 'a' is in units of R_s? No, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a). Wait, because the area where the planet's orbital plane would cause a transit is a circle with radius equal to the star's radius, and the orbital distance is 'a', so the probability would be something like (R_s / a)^2, but that doesn't make sense because if 'a' is small, the probability would be high, which makes sense. Wait, but actually, the transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbital plane with our line of sight. So, the probability is determined by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, but squared because it's a cross-sectional area.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P = (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a^2), but that's not right. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), but I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), which would be (R_p^2) / (R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) = (R_p^2 * R_s) / (a R_s^2) ) = (R_p^2) / (a R_s). Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, another approach. The transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), because the area of the star is π R_s², and the area of the planet's path is π (R_s + a)^2, but wait, that's not right either.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is the ratio of the area where the planet can be in front of the star (as seen from Earth) to the total area of the orbit. But that's a bit vague.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability for a planet to transit is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)) ), which is (R_p^2) / (a R_s). But wait, that would be dimensionally (length^2) / (length * length) ) → 1/length, which doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a). Let me see: R_p is the planet's radius, R_s is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis (orbital distance) of the planet. So the units would be (radius)^2 * (radius) / (distance) → (radius^3) / (distance). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of angles. The probability that the planet's orbit, when viewed edge-on, would cause it to pass in front. The area of the star's disk is π R_s². The area where the planet's path would intersect the star is like a circle of radius R_s, and the planet's path is at a distance 'a' from the star, so the angular size is R_s / a. So the area where the planet can be in front is π (R_p + R_s)^2? No, perhaps it's the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the planet's orbit (from the star's perspective). But the planet's orbit, as seen from the star, is a circle with radius a. So the area is π a². The area where the planet would transit is when it's within R_s of the line of sight. So the effective area is π (a - R_s)^2 or something else?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look up the formula for transit probability.

Wait, I think the transit probability is given by P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 + (a / R_s)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another source says the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a). Or perhaps (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(sqrt(1 + (a/R_s)^2))). Hmm, I don't remember exactly.

Alternatively, I think the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), which simplifies to (R_p^2) / (a R_s). Wait, that makes sense dimensionally; units would be (length^2)/(length * length) → 1, which is correct for a probability.

Wait, but let me think: a is the semi-major axis, which is in units of length, R_s is the star's radius, also length. So a/R_s is a dimensionless number. Then, (R_p / R_s)^2 is dimensionless. So if the probability is (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a), that's (R_p^2 R_s) / (R_s^2 a) ) = (R_p^2) / (R_s a). Hmm, that's dimensionless. But how does that relate to the actual probability?

Wait, but I recall that the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), so that's (R_p^2) / (R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) = (R_p^2) / (R_s a). So, P = (R_p^2) / (R_s a).

Wait, but wait, maybe it's (R_p + R_s) over a, but for Earth-like planets, R_p is much smaller than R_s, so R_p + R_s ≈ R_s. So perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a) → (R_p^2) / (a R_s).

Alternatively, another approach: The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since e=0 for both, the probability becomes (R_p^2 R_s) / (a R_s^2) ) = R_p^2 / (a R_s).

So, the probability is proportional to (R_p^2) / (a R_s).

So, for each planet, I can compute P1 and P2, then take the ratio.

Given that, let's get the data:

Planet_1:

- Host star mass M1 = 2 M2 (but M2 is the mass of Planet_2's host star)
- Both stars have same radius, R1 = R2 = R.

Planet_1's orbital period P1 = (1/3) P2.

Wait, no, the question says "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2". So if Planet_2's period is P, then Planet_1's is P/3.

Using Kepler's third law, which states that P² is proportional to a³/(M_star). So for each planet:

For Planet_1: P1^2 = (4π²/G M1) * a1^3.

Similarly for Planet_2: P2^2 = (4π²/G M2) * a2^3.

But since M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2/3.

Let me write the equations:

(P1)^2 = (4π²/(G M1)) a1^3 → ( (P2/3) )^2 = (4π²/(G * 2 M2)) a1^3.

Similarly, (P2)^2 = (4π²/(G M2)) a2^3.

Divide the first equation by the second:

( (P2^2 / 9) ) / (P2^2) ) = [ (4π²/(G * 2 M2)) a1^3 ] / [ (4π²/(G M2)) a2^3 ]

Simplify left side: 1/9.

Right side: [ (1/(2 M2)) a1^3 ] / [ (1/M2) a2^3 ) ] = (a1^3 / (2 M2)) * (M2 / a2^3 ) ) = a1^3 / (2 a2^3 )

So 1/9 = a1^3/(2 a2^3) → a1^3 = (2 a2^3)/9 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) → a1 = a2 * (2^(1/3))/(9^(1/3)).

Wait, 9^(1/3) is (3²)^(1/3) )= 3^(2/3) → 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) )= [2/(3²)]^(1/3) )= (2/9)^(1/3).

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of 0.2222. Hmm, 0.2222 is about (0.6)^3 is 0.216, so approx 0.63.

So a1 ≈ a2 * 0.63.

So a1 is roughly 0.63 times a2.

But a is the orbital distance. So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter period, so it's closer to its star.

Now, the transit probability for each planet is P = (R_p^2) / (a R_s).

But wait, the planets have the same mass, but mass is not the same as radius. Wait, the question says both have the same mass, but radius depends on composition. But since we don't have their radii, but wait, the transit probability depends on R_p, the planet's radius.

Wait, but the question doesn't give us R_p for the planets. Hmm, that's a problem. Because without knowing their radii, how can we compute the transit probability?

Wait, wait the question says "Earth-like" planets. So perhaps we can assume that their radii are similar to Earth's. So R_p1 ≈ R_p2 ≈ R_earth. So R_p is the same for both planets. Therefore, R_p1 = R_p2 = R_p.

Wait, that's a key point. Because transit probability depends on (R_p / R_s)^2, and since R_p is the same, and R_s is the same for both stars (since both have same radius), then (R_p / R_s)^2 is the same for both.

Wait, no. Let me think. Both host stars have the same radius. So R_s1 = R_s2 = R. So for both planets, R_p is same (Earth-like), so (R_p/R)^2 is same.

So the only difference in transit probability comes from the other factor, which is 1/(a).

Wait, according to the probability formula P = (R_p^2) / (a R_s). Since R_p and R_s are same for both, the probability is inversely proportional to a. Therefore, the planet with smaller a has higher transit probability.

Because a is smaller, so P = (same) * (1/a), so smaller a → larger P.

So, since a1 is about 0.63 a2, a1 < a2 → P1 > P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

But wait, let's compute the exact ratio. Because the transit probability is proportional to (R_p^2) / (a R_s), and since R_p and R_s are same for both, P is proportional to 1/a.

So P1 / P2 = a2 / a1.

Because P1 = k / a1, P2 = k / a2. So P1/P2 = (k/a1) / (k/a2 ) )= a2/a1.

So a2/a1 = 1/(a1/a2) → from earlier, a1 = a2*(2/9)^(1/3) → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) → so a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of 4.5.

What's the cube of 1.65 is about 4.49, which is close to 4.5. So (9/2)^(1/3) is approximately 1.65.

So P1/P2 = a2/a1 ≈ 1.65 → P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times.

Wait, but wait. Let me recompute the a1 and a2.

We have P1 = P2 / 3.

Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³ / M.

So for Planet_1: (P1)^2 ∝ a1³ / M1 → ( (P2/3) )² ∝ a1³ / (2 M2).

For Planet_2: (P2)^2 ∝ a2³ / M2.

Dividing the two equations:

( (P2/3)^2 ) / (P2^2) ) = (a1^3/(2 M2)) ) / (a2^3 / M2) )

Simplify left side: 1/9.

Right side: (a1^3 / (2 M2)) ) * (M2 / a2^3 ) = a1^3/(2 a2^3 )

So 1/9 = a1^3/(2 a2^3 )

→ a1^3 = (2 a2^3) / 9 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Compute (2/9)^(1/3) = [ (2) / (3^2) ]^(1/3) → 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, 3^2=9, 9^(1/3)= approximately 2.08 (since 2^3=8, 2.08^3≈9). So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.605.

So a1 ≈ 0.605 a2.

Thus, the ratio a2/a1 = 1/0.605 ≈ 1.653 → approximately 1.65.

Therefore, P1/P2 = a2/a1 ≈ 1.65. So Planet_1 has about 1.65 times higher probability.

So the correct option is C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_p^2}{a R_s}
\]

Here:
- \(R_p\) is the planet's radius,
- \(a\) is the orbital distance (semi-major axis),
- \(R_s\) is the star's radius.

### Key Information:
1. **Planet_1 and Planet_2**:
   - Both planets have the same mass and are Earth-like, so \(R_p\) is the same for both.
   - Both host stars have the same radius, \(R_s\).
   - Planet_1 has an orbital period \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\), meaning it is closer to its star.
   - The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2 (\(M_1 = 2M_2\)).

2. **Orbital Distance**:
   Using Kepler's third law, \(P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M}\), we calculate the ratio of the orbital distances:
   \[
   \frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_1}{a_2^3 / M_2}
   \]
   Substituting \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\) and \(M_1 = 2M_2\):
   \[
   \frac{(P_2/3)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / (2M_2)}{a_2^3 / M_2}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}
   \]
   \[
   a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9}a_2^3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a_1 = a_2 \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
   \]
   Approximating \((\frac{2}{9})^{1/3} \approx 0.605\), we find:
   \[
   a_1 \approx 0.605a_2
   \]

3. **Transit Probability Ratio**:
   Since \(P \propto \frac{1}{a}\) (as \(R_p\) and \(R_s\) are the same for both planets), the transit probability ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
   \]
   Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.605a_2\):
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.605a_2} \approx 1.65
   \]

### Conclusion:
Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times higher transit probability than Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the planet's orbital distance.

The question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period that's three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because the orbital period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law.

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, because one is slightly evolved but they're the same size. So, same radius, but different masses. That might affect the probability of transit.

I need to find out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a_s / a_p), but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (something else?), or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the chance that the orbit is aligned edge-on.

Wait, I think the transit probability formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - e^2)) * ( (a_s * sin i) / (a_p) ) ), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that term goes away. So the transit probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a) * (something else...).

Wait, because the area where the planet's orbital plane would cause a transit is a circle with radius equal to the star's radius, and the orbital distance is 'a', so the probability would be something like (R_s / a)^2, but that doesn't make sense because if 'a' is small, the probability would be high, which makes sense. Wait, but actually, the transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbital plane with our line of sight. So, the probability is determined by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, but squared because it's a cross-sectional area.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P = (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a^2), but that's not right. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), but I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), which would be (R_p^2) / (R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) = (R_p^2 * R_s) / (a R_s^2) ) = (R_p^2) / (a R_s). Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, another approach. The transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), because the area of the star is π R_s², and the area of the planet's path is π (R_s + a)^2, but wait, that's not right either.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is the ratio of the area where the planet can be in front of the star (as seen from Earth) to the total area of the orbit. But that's a bit vague.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability for a planet to transit is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)) ), which is (R_p^2) / (a R_s). But wait, that would be dimensionally (length^2) / (length * length) ) → 1/length, which doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a). Let me see: R_p is the planet's radius, R_s is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis (orbital distance) of the planet. So the units would be (radius)^2 * (radius) / (distance) → (radius^3) / (distance). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of angles. The probability that the planet's orbit, when viewed edge-on, would cause it to pass in front. The area of the star's disk is π R_s². The area where the planet's path would intersect the star is like a circle of radius R_s, and the planet's path is at a distance 'a' from the star, so the angular size is R_s / a. So the area where the planet can be in front is π (R_p + R_s)^2? No, perhaps it's the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the planet's orbit (from the star's perspective). But the planet's orbit, as seen from the star, is a circle with radius a. So the area is π a². The area where the planet would transit is when it's within R_s of the line of sight. So the effective area is π (a - R_s)^2 or something else?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look up the formula for transit probability.

Wait, I think the transit probability is given by P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 + (a / R_s)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another source says the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a). Or perhaps (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(sqrt(1 + (a/R_s)^2))). Hmm, I don't remember exactly.

Alternatively, I think the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), which simplifies to (R_p^2) / (a R_s). Wait, that makes sense dimensionally; units would be (length^2)/(length * length) → 1, which is correct for a probability.

Wait, but let me think: a is the semi-major axis, which is in units of length, R_s is the star's radius, also length. So a/R_s is a dimensionless number. Then, (R_p / R_s)^2 is dimensionless. So if the probability is (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a), that's (R_p^2 R_s) / (R_s^2 a) ) = (R_p^2) / (R_s a). Hmm, that's dimensionless. But how does that relate to the actual probability?

Wait, but I recall that the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), so that's (R_p^2) / (R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) = (R_p^2) / (R_s a). So, P = (R_p^2) / (R_s a).

Wait, but wait, maybe it's (R_p + R_s) over a, but for Earth-like planets, R_p is much smaller than R_s, so R_p + R_s ≈ R_s. So perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a) → (R_p^2) / (a R_s).

Alternatively, another approach: The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since e=0 for both, the probability becomes (R_p^2 R_s) / (a R_s^2) ) = R_p^2 / (a R_s).

So, the probability is proportional to (R_p^2) / (a R_s).

So, for each planet, I can compute P1 and P2, then take the ratio.

Given that, let's get the data:

Planet_1:

- Host star mass M1 = 2 M2 (but M2 is the mass of Planet_2's host star)
- Both stars have same radius, R1 = R2 = R.

Planet_1's orbital period P1 = (1/3) P2.

Wait, no, the question says "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2". So if Planet_2's period is P, then Planet_1's is P/3.

Using Kepler's third law, which states that P² is proportional to a³/(M_star). So for each planet:

For Planet_1: P1^2 = (4π²/G M1) * a1^3.

Similarly for Planet_2: P2^2 = (4π²/G M2) * a2^3.

But since M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2/3.

Let me write the equations:

(P1)^2 = (4π²/(G M1)) a1^3 → ( (P2/3) )^2 = (4π²/(G * 2 M2)) a1^3.

Similarly, (P2)^2 = (4π²/(G M2)) a2^3.

Divide the first equation by the second:

( (P2^2 / 9) ) / (P2^2) ) = [ (4π²/(G * 2 M2)) a1^3 ] / [ (4π²/(G M2)) a2^3 ]

Simplify left side: 1/9.

Right side: [ (1/(2 M2)) a1^3 ] / [ (1/M2) a2^3 ) ] = (a1^3 / (2 M2)) * (M2 / a2^3 ) ) = a1^3 / (2 a2^3 )

So 1/9 = a1^3/(2 a2^3) → a1^3 = (2 a2^3)/9 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) → a1 = a2 * (2^(1/3))/(9^(1/3)).

Wait, 9^(1/3) is (3²)^(1/3) )= 3^(2/3) → 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) )= [2/(3²)]^(1/3) )= (2/9)^(1/3).

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of 0.2222. Hmm, 0.2222 is about (0.6)^3 is 0.216, so approx 0.63.

So a1 ≈ a2 * 0.63.

So a1 is roughly 0.63 times a2.

But a is the orbital distance. So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter period, so it's closer to its star.

Now, the transit probability for each planet is P = (R_p^2) / (a R_s).

But wait, the planets have the same mass, but mass is not the same as radius. Wait, the question says both have the same mass, but radius depends on composition. But since we don't have their radii, but wait, the transit probability depends on R_p, the planet's radius.

Wait, but the question doesn't give us R_p for the planets. Hmm, that's a problem. Because without knowing their radii, how can we compute the transit probability?

Wait, wait the question says "Earth-like" planets. So perhaps we can assume that their radii are similar to Earth's. So R_p1 ≈ R_p2 ≈ R_earth. So R_p is the same for both planets. Therefore, R_p1 = R_p2 = R_p.

Wait, that's a key point. Because transit probability depends on (R_p / R_s)^2, and since R_p is the same, and R_s is the same for both stars (since both have same radius), then (R_p / R_s)^2 is the same for both.

Wait, no. Let me think. Both host stars have the same radius. So R_s1 = R_s2 = R. So for both planets, R_p is same (Earth-like), so (R_p/R)^2 is same.

So the only difference in transit probability comes from the other factor, which is 1/(a).

Wait, according to the probability formula P = (R_p^2) / (a R_s). Since R_p and R_s are same for both, the probability is inversely proportional to a. Therefore, the planet with smaller a has higher transit probability.

Because a is smaller, so P = (same) * (1/a), so smaller a → larger P.

So, since a1 is about 0.63 a2, a1 < a2 → P1 > P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

But wait, let's compute the exact ratio. Because the transit probability is proportional to (R_p^2) / (a R_s), and since R_p and R_s are same for both, P is proportional to 1/a.

So P1 / P2 = a2 / a1.

Because P1 = k / a1, P2 = k / a2. So P1/P2 = (k/a1) / (k/a2 ) )= a2/a1.

So a2/a1 = 1/(a1/a2) → from earlier, a1 = a2*(2/9)^(1/3) → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) → so a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of 4.5.

What's the cube of 1.65 is about 4.49, which is close to 4.5. So (9/2)^(1/3) is approximately 1.65.

So P1/P2 = a2/a1 ≈ 1.65 → P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times.

Wait, but wait. Let me recompute the a1 and a2.

We have P1 = P2 / 3.

Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³ / M.

So for Planet_1: (P1)^2 ∝ a1³ / M1 → ( (P2/3) )² ∝ a1³ / (2 M2).

For Planet_2: (P2)^2 ∝ a2³ / M2.

Dividing the two equations:

( (P2/3)^2 ) / (P2^2) ) = (a1^3/(2 M2)) ) / (a2^3 / M2) )

Simplify left side: 1/9.

Right side: (a1^3 / (2 M2)) ) * (M2 / a2^3 ) = a1^3/(2 a2^3 )

So 1/9 = a1^3/(2 a2^3 )

→ a1^3 = (2 a2^3) / 9 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Compute (2/9)^(1/3) = [ (2) / (3^2) ]^(1/3) → 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, 3^2=9, 9^(1/3)= approximately 2.08 (since 2^3=8, 2.08^3≈9). So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.605.

So a1 ≈ 0.605 a2.

Thus, the ratio a2/a1 = 1/0.605 ≈ 1.653 → approximately 1.65.

Therefore, P1/P2 = a2/a1 ≈ 1.65. So Planet_1 has about 1.65 times higher probability.

So the correct option is C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_p^2}{a R_s}
\]

Here:
- \(R_p\) is the planet's radius,
- \(a\) is the orbital distance (semi-major axis),
- \(R_s\) is the star's radius.

### Key Information:
1. **Planet_1 and Planet_2**:
   - Both planets have the same mass and are Earth-like, so \(R_p\) is the same for both.
   - Both host stars have the same radius, \(R_s\).
   - Planet_1 has an orbital period \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\), meaning it is closer to its star.
   - The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2 (\(M_1 = 2M_2\)).

2. **Orbital Distance**:
   Using Kepler's third law, \(P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M}\), we calculate the ratio of the orbital distances:
   \[
   \frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_1}{a_2^3 / M_2}
   \]
   Substituting \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\) and \(M_1 = 2M_2\):
   \[
   \frac{(P_2/3)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / (2M_2)}{a_2^3 / M_2}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}
   \]
   \[
   a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9}a_2^3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a_1 = a_2 \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
   \]
   Approximating \((\frac{2}{9})^{1/3} \approx 0.605\), we find:
   \[
   a_1 \approx 0.605a_2
   \]

3. **Transit Probability Ratio**:
   Since \(P \propto \frac{1}{a}\) (as \(R_p\) and \(R_s\) are the same for both planets), the transit probability ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
   \]
   Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.605a_2\):
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.605a_2} \approx 1.65
   \]

### Conclusion:
Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times higher transit probability than Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
