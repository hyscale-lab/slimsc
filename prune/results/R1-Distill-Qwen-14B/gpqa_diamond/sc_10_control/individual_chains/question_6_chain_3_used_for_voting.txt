Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Let me start by reading the problem again.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that in polar coordinates, potentials often depend on r and θ, and sometimes these can be separable, allowing us to solve the Schrödinger equation in parts. So maybe I can split this potential into radial and angular parts.

Wait, I think the particle is moving in two dimensions, so maybe it's in polar coordinates (r, θ) where r is the radial distance and θ is the angle. So, the potential seems to have two terms: the first is (1/2)k r², which is like a harmonic oscillator potential in r. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, that looks a bit more complicated. I wonder how to handle that.

I remember that in the case of a central potential (which depends only on r), the problem separates into radial and angular parts, leading to quantized energy levels. But here, the potential also depends on θ, which suggests that the problem might not be separable in the usual way. Or maybe it's separable in some other way, perhaps using a different coordinate system or by considering the angular part as part of the potential.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can rewrite the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates to see if it simplifies. Because sometimes potentials that look complicated in polar coordinates become simple in Cartesian. Let me think about that.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So, cosθ = x/r. So cos²θ = x²/(r²). So the potential V(r,θ) can be written as (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²)/(r²). Let's see, that simplifies to (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Because r² times (x²/r²) is x².

So V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Wait, but r² is x² + y², so substituting that in, we get V(x,y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Let me combine like terms.

(1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = ( (1/2 + 3/2)k x² ) + (1/2)k y² ) → (2k x²) + (1/2 k y²).

Wait wait, 1/2 + 3/2 is 2, yes. So V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Hmm, that looks like two independent harmonic oscillators in x and y directions, but with different frequencies.

Wait, no. Because the potential for a harmonic oscillator in 2D is usually (1/2) m ω² (x² + y²), but here, our V is 2k x² + (1/2 k) y². That suggests that the particle is in a harmonic oscillator potential where the x and y directions have different spring constants.

Wait, but the form of the potential is 2k x² + (k/2) y². Now, in the context of energy levels for a 2D harmonic oscillator, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction, but scaled by their respective frequencies. Because each direction's frequency is determined by the spring constant. 

Wait, the general solution for a 2D harmonic oscillator where each direction has a different frequency is that the energy levels are E = ħω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y (n_y + 1/2 ), where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers. So the total energy is the sum of the contributions from each direction.

But wait, first I need to find ω_x and ω_y for this potential. The potential is V(x,y) = (1/2) m ω_x² x² + (1/2) m ω_y² y². So let me compare.

Our potential is 2 k x² + (k/2) y². So, that would correspond to (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k and (1/2) m ω_y² = (k/2).

Wait, no, wait. The standard form for a harmonic oscillator potential in x is (1/2) m ω² x². So, if our potential in x is 2k x², then 2k must equal (1/2) m ω_x². So solving for ω_x:

(1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, for y direction: (1/2) m ω_y² = (k/2) → ω_y² = (k)/(m) → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me check the math again.

Wait, for the x part:

V_x = 2 k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → 2k = (1/2) m ω_x² → ω_x² = (4k)/(m) → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, for the y part:

V_y = (k/2) y² = (1/2) m ω_y² y² → k/2 = (1/2) m ω_y² → ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So yes, that math checks out.

Now, the energy for a 2D harmonic oscillator is E = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2 ) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2 ), where n_x and n_y are integers ≥ 0.

Substituting ω_x and ω_y:

E = ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ (sqrt(k/m)) (n_y + 1/2 )

Let me factor out ħ sqrt(k/m) from both terms:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2 (n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]

Let me expand the terms inside the brackets:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = (2n_x + n_y) + 3/2.

So, E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Wait, let me make sure. 2*(n_x + 1/2) is 2n_x +1. And the other term is n_y + 1/2. So when you add them, 2n_x + n_y + 1 + 0.5 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So E = ħ * sqrt(k/m) * (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). That matches.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let me check:

Option C says (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ... yes.

But wait, the other options. Let me make sure.

Option A: (2n_x +3n_y +1/2)
Option B: (n_x +3n_y +3/2)
Option C: (2n_x +n_y +3/2)
Option D: (3n_x +2n_y +1/2)

So our result is option C.

But wait, let me think again about the energy expression. Since the x and y directions have different frequencies, the energy is a combination of both. So 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 times ħ sqrt(k/m) is correct.

Wait, why 3/2? Because each direction contributes a 1/2 ħω term, so when you combine them, 2*(1/2) from x and 1/2 from y gives 3/2.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the zero-point energy. So in x direction, each quantum level adds (n_x + 1/2) ħω_x, and same for y. But since ω_x is twice ω_y, the x part contributes more per quantum number.

Wait, but in the options, the constants are 1/2, 3/2, etc. So our calculation gives (2n_x +n_y +3/2) times the sqrt factor. So that matches option C.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.

The problem involves finding the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). To solve this, the potential is rewritten in Cartesian coordinates using \( x = r\cos\theta \) and \( y = r\sin\theta \). Substituting \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \), the potential becomes:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
\]

Simplifying, this gives:

\[
V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This represents a 2D harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions. The energy levels for a 2D harmonic oscillator are given by:

\[
E = \hbar \omega_x (n_x + \frac{1}{2}) + \hbar \omega_y (n_y + \frac{1}{2}),
\]

where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers, and \( \omega_x \) and \( \omega_y \) are the angular frequencies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions. From the potential, the frequencies are determined as:

\[
\omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}, \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Substituting these into the energy expression:

\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[ 2(n_x + \frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \frac{1}{2}) \right].
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left( 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right).
\]

This matches the energy spectrum given in option C. The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the coefficients of \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) or the constant term.

So V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Wait, but r² is x² + y², so substituting that in, we get V(x,y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Let me combine like terms.

(1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = ( (1/2 + 3/2)k x² ) + (1/2)k y² ) → (2k x²) + (1/2 k y²).

Wait wait, 1/2 + 3/2 is 2, yes. So V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Hmm, that looks like two independent harmonic oscillators in x and y directions, but with different frequencies.

Wait, no. Because the potential for a harmonic oscillator in 2D is usually (1/2) m ω² (x² + y²), but here, our V is 2k x² + (1/2 k) y². That suggests that the particle is in a harmonic oscillator potential where the x and y directions have different spring constants.

Wait, but the form of the potential is 2k x² + (k/2) y². Now, in the context of energy levels for a 2D harmonic oscillator, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction, but scaled by their respective frequencies. Because each direction's frequency is determined by the spring constant. 

Wait, the general solution for a 2D harmonic oscillator where each direction has a different frequency is that the energy levels are E = ħω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y (n_y + 1/2 ), where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers. So the total energy is the sum of the contributions from each direction.

But wait, first I need to find ω_x and ω_y for this potential. The potential is V(x,y) = (1/2) m ω_x² x² + (1/2) m ω_y² y². So let me compare.

Our potential is 2 k x² + (k/2) y². So, that would correspond to (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k and (1/2) m ω_y² = (k/2).

Wait, no, wait. The standard form for a harmonic oscillator potential in x is (1/2) m ω² x². So, if our potential in x is 2k x², then 2k must equal (1/2) m ω_x². So solving for ω_x:

(1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, for y direction: (1/2) m ω_y² = (k/2) → ω_y² = (k)/(m) → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me check the math again.

Wait, for the x part:

V_x = 2 k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → 2k = (1/2) m ω_x² → ω_x² = (4k)/(m) → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, for the y part:

V_y = (k/2) y² = (1/2) m ω_y² y² → k/2 = (1/2) m ω_y² → ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So yes, that math checks out.

Now, the energy for a 2D harmonic oscillator is E = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2 ) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2 ), where n_x and n_y are integers ≥ 0.

Substituting ω_x and ω_y:

E = ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ (sqrt(k/m)) (n_y + 1/2 )

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = (2n_x + n_y) + 3/2.

So, E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Wait, let me make sure. 2*(n_x + 1/2) is 2n_x +1. And the other term is n_y + 1/2. So when you add them, 2n_x + n_y + 1 + 0.5 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

But wait, the other options. Let me make sure.

Option A: (2n_x +3n_y +1/2)
Option B: (n_x +3n_y +3/2)

So our result is option C.

To solve this, the potential is rewritten in Cartesian coordinates using \( x = r\cos\theta \) and \( y = r\sin\theta \). Substituting \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \), the potential becomes:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
\]

Simplifying, this gives:

\[
V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This represents a 2D harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions. The energy levels for a 2D harmonic oscillator are given by:

\[
E = \hbar \omega_x (n_x + \frac{1}{2}) + \hbar \omega_y (n_y + \frac{1}{2}),

where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers, and \( \omega_x \) and \( \omega_y \) are the angular frequencies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions. From the potential, the frequencies are determined as:

\[
\omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}, \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Substituting these into the energy expression:

\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[ 2(n_x + \frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \frac{1}{2}) \right].
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left( 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right).
\]

This matches the energy spectrum given in option C. The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the coefficients of \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) or the constant term.
