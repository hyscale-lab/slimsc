Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what it's asking. 

The problem says that particles are collided in the center of a spherical detector. These particles are of a new type and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, the problem is about the particles reaching the detector walls. So it's about how far they travel before decaying or something. Oh right, in particle physics, particles that decay quickly can only travel a certain distance before they decay. The distance depends on their speed because faster particles (higher gamma) will travel further before decaying.

So the setup is that the particles are produced at the center of the detector. The detector is a sphere with a radius of 30 meters. So the particles have to travel 30 meters to reach the wall.

At a Lorentz factor of 20, only one third of the particles make it. But we need two-thirds to make it, so we need a higher Lorentz factor because that would mean they are moving faster, hence live longer or travel further.

Wait, no. Wait, particles with higher gamma (higher velocity) have longer proper lifetimes. So they can travel further before decaying. So if at gamma=20, 1/3 reach the wall, increasing gamma should increase the fraction reaching the wall.

Wait, the initial setup says one third reach. So two-thirds decay before reaching the wall. To get two-thirds reaching, perhaps the gamma needs to be such that they can survive longer, so they can go the 30 meters.

Wait, but wait, the fraction reaching the wall depends on the distance they can travel before decaying. The lifetime as measured in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So the mean lifetime tau is gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime.

The particles travel at speed v. The distance they can cover before decaying is v * tau. Since v is approximately c for ultra-relativistic particles, we can approximate v as c.

So the distance L is approximately c * gamma * tau_0. 

Wait, but in the problem, the fraction that reach the detector wall depends on whether their lifetime (as seen in the lab frame) allows them to reach 30 meters. So if L = c * gamma * tau_0, and the detector radius is R=30 m, then the number of particles that reach the wall would depend on how their decay length compares to R.

But wait, what's the distribution here? I think the decay follows an exponential probability. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after traveling a distance L is exp(-L/(c * tau)). So the survival probability P is exp( - L/(c tau) ) = exp( - gamma R/(c tau_0) ), because tau = gamma tau_0, and L = R.

So when gamma is such that gamma R/(c tau_0) = ln(1/P), where P is the probability of survival.

Wait, but in the problem, when gamma is 20, one third reach the wall. So P = 1/3. So for that case, 1/3 = exp( -20 * R/(c tau_0) ). Wait, wait, no, because when gamma is 20, R is 30 m. So the argument is (20 * 30 m) / (c tau_0).

Wait, let me write it down:

At gamma = 20, P = 1/3 = exp( - (gamma * R)/(c tau_0) )

So, 1/3 = exp( -(20 * R)/(c tau_0) )

Taking natural log on both sides:

ln(1/3) = - (20 R)/(c tau_0)

Which is ln(3) = (20 R)/(c tau_0 )

So, 20 R/(c tau_0 ) = ln(3)

So, when we want P = 2/3, that's the new probability. So 2/3 = exp( - (gamma_new * R)/(c tau_0) )

Taking ln:

ln(2/3) = - (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

- ln(2/3) = (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0 )

But from the earlier equation, we have 20 R/(c tau_0) = ln(3)

So, substituting 20 R/(c tau_0) with ln(3), let's see:

We can write (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0) = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2)

Because ln(2/3) is negative, so the negative makes it positive ln(3/2).

So (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0) ) = ln(3/2 )

But from before, 20 R/(c tau_0) = ln(3)

So, (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0) ) = ln(3/2 )

Let me write:

gamma_new = [ ln(3/2) / ln(3) ] * 20

Because 20 R/(c tau_0) = ln(3) → (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0 ) = ln(3/2 )

So gamma_new = (ln(3/2) / ln(3)) ) * 20

Compute ln(3) is approximately 1.0986.

ln(3/2) is ln(1.5) which is about 0.4055.

So, 0.4055 / 1.0986 ≈ 0.369.

So, gamma_new ≈ 20 * 0.369 ≈ 7.38.

Wait, but that's way lower. But wait, that can't be right because we're trying to find a gamma where a larger fraction (2/3) reach the wall. So higher gamma should result in higher survival probability.

Wait, but according to this, gamma_new would be lower, which would mean lower gamma, which leads to lower survival probability. That doesn't make sense. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me re-express the initial equations.

At gamma =20, P = 1/3 = exp( - (gamma R)/(c tau_0) )

Wait, maybe I have the equation wrong. Because if the mean lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0, then the time the particle has is R/(v) ≈ R/(c) (since v≈c). But the decay probability is exp( -t/(tau) ) = exp( -(R/(c tau_0 gamma) ) )

Wait, wait another approach: The proper lifetime is tau_0. The lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma tau_0. The particle has to live long enough to reach the wall at distance R.

The time available is t = R / v ≈ R / c.

The probability that the particle hasn't decayed is P = exp( - t/(tau) ) = exp( - R/(c gamma tau_0) )

So when gamma is 20, P=1/3. So,

1/3 = exp( - (20 R)/(c tau_0) )

Which gives (20 R)/(c tau_0) ) = ln 3.

Now, when P' = 2/3, it's:

2/3 = exp( - (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0) )

Take ln:

ln(2/3) = - (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0)

Multiply both sides by -1:

- ln(2/3) = gamma_new R/(c tau_0 )

But from earlier, 20 R/(c tau_0 ) = ln(3 )

So, substitute:

gamma_new R/(c tau_0 ) = ln(3/2 )

Because - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2 )

So, (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0 ) = ln(3/2 ) → gamma_new = [ ln(3/2 ) / (20 R/(c tau_0 )) ) ] * 20 

Wait, no, because 20 R/(c tau_0 ) is ln(3). So,

gamma_new = [ ln(3/2 ) / ln(3) ] * 20

So, let's compute that.

ln(3) is approx 1.0986, ln(3/2) is approx 0.4055.

So 0.4055 / 1.0986 ≈ 0.369.

0.369 * 20 = approx 7.38.

Wait, so gamma_new would be about 7.38, but that's lower than the original gamma of 20, which can't be right because a lower gamma would mean a lower probability.

Wait, because if gamma_new is lower, then the survival probability would be lower, which is the opposite of what we need. So this suggests that my approach is wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps I have the equation inverted. Let me think again. The survival probability is exp(-L/(c tau)), and L is the distance. Wait, but if the particle is moving at speed v, then L = v t. So the lifetime as observed is tau = gamma tau_0. So the time available is t = L/(v) = L/(beta c), because v = beta c.

Thus, the survival probability P is exp(- t/(tau) ) = exp( - (L/(beta c)) / (gamma tau_0) ) )

But gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta² ), so beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Hmm, maybe I can express beta in terms of gamma. For gamma >>1 (ultra-relativistic), beta is approximately 1, so beta ≈ 1 - 0.5 (1/gamma² )

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, beta can be considered as 1, because the velocities are ultra-relativistic. So v ≈ c.

So then, L = v t ≈ c t.

The time available is t = R/(c) [since R is 30 m, t ≈ 30/(3e8) = 1e-7 s or something, but the exact value might not matter since it's the ratio we're after.]

So the survival probability is exp( - t/(gamma tau_0) ) = exp( - R/(c gamma tau_0) )

Wait, because t = R/(c), so t/(gamma tau_0 ) = R/(c gamma tau_0 )

So, the survival probability is P = exp( - R/(c gamma tau_0 ) )

At gamma=20, P=1/3.

So,

1/3 = exp( - R/(c gamma tau_0 ) )

Take natural logs:

ln(1/3) = - R/(c gamma tau_0 )

Which implies,

R/(c gamma tau_0 ) = ln(3 )

So,

gamma tau_0 = R/(c ln(3) )

Wait, no, because R/(c gamma tau_0 ) = ln(3 ), so gamma tau_0 = R/(c ln(3) )

So, gamma tau_0 = R/(c ln(3) )

Now, when gamma increases, the survival probability increases because the exponent becomes smaller (since gamma is in the denominator). Wait, wait: P = exp( - R/(c gamma tau_0 ) )

So when gamma increases, the exponent's denominator increases, so exponent's value decreases, so P increases.

So, when we want P_new = 2/3, which is higher than 1/3, we need a larger gamma.

So using the same equation:

2/3 = exp( - R/(c gamma_new tau_0 ) )

Take ln:

ln(2/3) = - R/(c gamma_new tau_0 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

- ln(2/3) = R/(c gamma_new tau_0 )

We can write -ln(2/3) as ln(3/2 )

So,

R/(c gamma_new tau_0 ) = ln(3/2 )

But from the first equation, R/(c gamma tau_0 ) = ln(3 )

So,

ln(3/2 ) = (R/(c gamma_new tau_0 )) = (R/(c tau_0 )) * (1/gamma_new )

But from the first equation, R/(c tau_0 ) = gamma * ln(3 )

So,

ln(3/2 ) = gamma * ln(3 ) / gamma_new

Rearranging,

gamma_new = gamma * ln(3 ) / ln(3/2 )

Because,

gamma_new = gamma * ( ln(3 ) / ln(3/2) )

So,

gamma_new = 20 * ( ln(3 ) / ln(3/2) )

Let me compute that.

Compute ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055

So,

gamma_new ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055 )

Compute 1.0986 / 0.4055: approximately 2.708.

So,

gamma_new ≈ 20 * 2.708 ≈ 54.16.

So about 54.

Looking at the options, option A is 54. So the answer should be A.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation:

ln(3) = 1.098612289

ln(3/2)=ln(1.5)=0.4054651081

So 1.098612289 / 0.4054651081 ≈ 2.7080502

Multiply by 20: 20 * 2.7080502 ≈54.161.

So approximately 54.16, which is option A.

So the needed Lorentz factor is approximately 54.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the survival probability of the particles and their Lorentz factor. The survival probability \( P \) is given by:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{\gamma R}{c \tau_0}\right),
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( R \) is the detector radius (30 m), \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \tau_0 \) is the proper lifetime of the particles.

### Step 1: Relating \( \gamma \) and \( P \) for \( \gamma = 20 \)
At \( \gamma = 20 \), the survival probability is \( P = \frac{1}{3} \). Substituting into the survival probability formula:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{20 \cdot 30}{c \tau_0}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{20 \cdot 30}{c \tau_0}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\ln(3) = \frac{20 \cdot 30}{c \tau_0}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{20 \cdot 30}{c \tau_0} = \ln(3).
\]

### Step 2: Relating \( \gamma \) and \( P \) for \( P = \frac{2}{3} \)
For the new survival probability \( P = \frac{2}{3} \), the formula becomes:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{\gamma_{\text{new}} \cdot 30}{c \tau_0}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{\gamma_{\text{new}} \cdot 30}{c \tau_0}.
\]

Multiply through by \(-1\):

\[
-\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{\gamma_{\text{new}} \cdot 30}{c \tau_0}.
\]

Simplify \( -\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \), so:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{\gamma_{\text{new}} \cdot 30}{c \tau_0}.
\]

### Step 3: Solving for \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \)
From the earlier result, \( \frac{20 \cdot 30}{c \tau_0} = \ln(3) \). Substituting this into the new equation:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{\gamma_{\text{new}}}{20} \cdot \ln(3).
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \):

\[
\gamma_{\text{new}} = 20 \cdot \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

### Step 4: Numerical Calculation
Using approximate values:
- \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \),
- \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \),

we compute:

\[
\gamma_{\text{new}} = 20 \cdot \frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 20 \cdot 2.708 \approx 54.16.
\]

### Conclusion
The required Lorentz factor is approximately \( 54 \), which corresponds to option **A**.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what it's asking. 

The problem says that particles are collided in the center of a spherical detector. These particles are of a new type and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, the problem is about the particles reaching the detector walls. So it's about how far they travel before decaying or something. Oh right, in particle physics, particles that decay quickly can only travel a certain distance before they decay. The distance depends on their speed because faster particles (higher gamma) will travel further before decaying.

So the setup is that the particles are produced at the center of the detector. The detector is a sphere with a radius of 30 meters. So the particles have to travel 30 meters to reach the wall.

At a Lorentz factor of 20, only one third of the particles make it. But we need two-thirds to make it, so we need a higher Lorentz factor because that would mean they are moving faster, hence live longer or travel further.

Wait, no. Wait, particles with higher gamma (higher velocity) have longer proper lifetimes. So they can travel further before decaying. So if at gamma=20, 1/3 reach the wall, increasing gamma should increase the fraction reaching the wall.

Wait, the initial setup says one third reach. So two-thirds decay before reaching the wall. To get two-thirds reaching, perhaps the gamma needs to be such that they can survive longer, so they can go the 30 meters.

Wait, but wait, the fraction reaching the wall depends on the distance they can travel before decaying. The lifetime as measured in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So the mean lifetime tau is gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime.

The particles travel at speed v. The distance they can cover before decaying is v * tau. Since v is approximately c for ultra-relativistic particles, we can approximate v as c.

So the distance L is approximately c * gamma * tau_0. 

Wait, but in the problem, the fraction that reach the detector wall depends on whether their lifetime (as seen in the lab frame) allows them to reach 30 meters. So if L = c * gamma * tau_0, and the detector radius is R=30 m, then the number of particles that reach the wall would depend on how their decay length compares to R.

But wait, what's the distribution here? I think the decay follows an exponential probability. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after traveling a distance L is exp(-L/(c * tau)). So the survival probability P is exp( - L/(c tau) ) = exp( - gamma R/(c tau_0) ), because tau = gamma tau_0, and L = R.

So when gamma is such that gamma R/(c tau_0) = ln(1/P), where P is the probability of survival.

Wait, but in the problem, when gamma is 20, one third reach the wall. So P = 1/3. So for that case, 1/3 = exp( -20 * R/(c tau_0) ). Wait, wait, no, because when gamma is 20, R is 30 m. So the argument is (20 * 30 m) / (c tau_0).

Wait, let me write it down:

At gamma = 20, P = 1/3 = exp( - (gamma * R)/(c tau_0) )

So, 1/3 = exp( -(20 * R)/(c tau_0) )

Taking natural log on both sides:

ln(1/3) = - (20 R)/(c tau_0)

Which is ln(3) = (20 R)/(c tau_0 )

So, 20 R/(c tau_0 ) = ln(3)

So, when we want P = 2/3, that's the new probability. So 2/3 = exp( - (gamma_new * R)/(c tau_0) )

Taking ln:

ln(2/3) = - (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

- ln(2/3) = (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0 )

But from the earlier equation, we have 20 R/(c tau_0) = ln(3)

So, substituting 20 R/(c tau_0) with ln(3), let's see:

We can write (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0) = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2)

Because ln(2/3) is negative, so the negative makes it positive ln(3/2).

So (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0) ) = ln(3/2 )

But from before, 20 R/(c tau_0) = ln(3)

So, (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0) ) = ln(3/2 )

Let me write:

gamma_new = [ ln(3/2) / ln(3) ] * 20

Because 20 R/(c tau_0) = ln(3) → (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0 ) = ln(3/2 )

So gamma_new = (ln(3/2) / ln(3)) ) * 20

Compute ln(3) is approximately 1.0986.

ln(3/2) is ln(1.5) which is about 0.4055.

So, 0.4055 / 1.0986 ≈ 0.369.

So, gamma_new ≈ 20 * 0.369 ≈ 7.38.

Wait, but that's way lower. But wait, that can't be right because we're trying to find a gamma where a larger fraction (2/3) reach the wall. So higher gamma should result in higher survival probability.

Wait, but according to this, gamma_new would be lower, which would mean lower gamma, which leads to lower survival probability. That doesn't make sense. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me re-express the initial equations.

At gamma =20, P = 1/3 = exp( - (gamma R)/(c tau_0) )

Wait, maybe I have the equation wrong. Because if the mean lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0, then the time the particle has is R/(v) ≈ R/(c) (since v≈c). But the decay probability is exp( -t/(tau) ) = exp( -(R/(c tau_0 gamma) ) )

Wait, wait another approach: The proper lifetime is tau_0. The lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma tau_0. The particle has to live long enough to reach the wall at distance R.

The time available is t = R / v ≈ R / c.

The probability that the particle hasn't decayed is P = exp( - t/(tau) ) = exp( - R/(c gamma tau_0) )

So when gamma is 20, P=1/3. So,

1/3 = exp( - (20 R)/(c tau_0) )

Which gives (20 R)/(c tau_0) ) = ln 3.

Now, when P' = 2/3, it's:

2/3 = exp( - (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0) )

Take ln:

ln(2/3) = - (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0)

Multiply both sides by -1:

- ln(2/3) = gamma_new R/(c tau_0 )

But from earlier, 20 R/(c tau_0 ) = ln(3 )

So, substitute:

gamma_new R/(c tau_0 ) = ln(3/2 )

Because - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2 )

So, (gamma_new R)/(c tau_0 ) = ln(3/2 ) → gamma_new = [ ln(3/2 ) / (20 R/(c tau_0 )) ) ] * 20 

Wait, no, because 20 R/(c tau_0 ) is ln(3). So,

gamma_new = [ ln(3/2 ) / ln(3) ] * 20

So, let's compute that.

ln(3) is approx 1.0986, ln(3/2) is approx 0.4055.

So 0.4055 / 1.0986 ≈ 0.369.

0.369 * 20 = approx 7.38.

Wait, so gamma_new would be about 7.38, but that's lower than the original gamma of 20, which can't be right because a lower gamma would mean a lower probability.

Wait, because if gamma_new is lower, then the survival probability would be lower, which is the opposite of what we need. So this suggests that my approach is wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps I have the equation inverted. Let me think again. The survival probability is exp(-L/(c tau)), and L is the distance. Wait, but if the particle is moving at speed v, then L = v t. So the lifetime as observed is tau = gamma tau_0. So the time available is t = L/(v) = L/(beta c), because v = beta c.

Thus, the survival probability P is exp(- t/(tau) ) = exp( - (L/(beta c)) / (gamma tau_0) ) )

But gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta² ), so beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Hmm, maybe I can express beta in terms of gamma. For gamma >>1 (ultra-relativistic), beta is approximately 1, so beta ≈ 1 - 0.5 (1/gamma² )

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, beta can be considered as 1, because the velocities are ultra-relativistic. So v ≈ c.

So then, L = v t ≈ c t.

The time available is t = R/(c) [since R is 30 m, t ≈ 30/(3e8) = 1e-7 s or something, but the exact value might not matter since it's the ratio we're after.]

So the survival probability is exp( - t/(gamma tau_0) ) = exp( - R/(c gamma tau_0) )

Wait, because t = R/(c), so t/(gamma tau_0 ) = R/(c gamma tau_0 )

So, the survival probability is P = exp( - R/(c gamma tau_0 ) )

At gamma=20, P=1/3.

So,

1/3 = exp( - R/(c gamma tau_0 ) )

Take natural logs:

ln(1/3) = - R/(c gamma tau_0 )

Which implies,

R/(c gamma tau_0 ) = ln(3 )

So,

gamma tau_0 = R/(c ln(3) )

Wait, no, because R/(c gamma tau_0 ) = ln(3 ), so gamma tau_0 = R/(c ln(3) )

So, gamma tau_0 = R/(c ln(3) )

Now, when gamma increases, the survival probability increases because the exponent becomes smaller (since gamma is in the denominator). Wait, wait: P = exp( - R/(c gamma tau_0 ) )

So when gamma increases, the exponent's denominator increases, so exponent's value decreases, so P increases.

So, when we want P_new = 2/3, which is higher than 1/3, we need a larger gamma.

So using the same equation:

2/3 = exp( - R/(c gamma_new tau_0 ) )

Take ln:

ln(2/3) = - R/(c gamma_new tau_0 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

- ln(2/3) = R/(c gamma_new tau_0 )

We can write -ln(2/3) as ln(3/2 )

So,

R/(c gamma_new tau_0 ) = ln(3/2 )

But from the first equation, R/(c gamma tau_0 ) = ln(3 )

So,

ln(3/2 ) = (R/(c gamma_new tau_0 )) = (R/(c tau_0 )) * (1/gamma_new )

But from the first equation, R/(c tau_0 ) = gamma * ln(3 )

So,

ln(3/2 ) = gamma * ln(3 ) / gamma_new

Rearranging,

gamma_new = gamma * ln(3 ) / ln(3/2 )

Because,

gamma_new = gamma * ( ln(3 ) / ln(3/2) )

So,

gamma_new = 20 * ( ln(3 ) / ln(3/2) )

Let me compute that.

Compute ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055

So,

gamma_new ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055 )

Compute 1.0986 / 0.4055: approximately 2.708.

So,

gamma_new ≈ 20 * 2.708 ≈ 54.16.

So about 54.

Looking at the options, option A is 54. So the answer should be A.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation:

ln(3) = 1.098612289

ln(3/2)=ln(1.5)=0.4054651081

So 1.098612289 / 0.4054651081 ≈ 2.7080502

Multiply by 20: 20 * 2.7080502 ≈54.161.

So approximately 54.16, which is option A.

So the needed Lorentz factor is approximately 54.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the survival probability of the particles and their Lorentz factor. The survival probability \( P \) is given by:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{\gamma R}{c \tau_0}\right),
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( R \) is the detector radius (30 m), \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \tau_0 \) is the proper lifetime of the particles.

### Step 1: Relating \( \gamma \) and \( P \) for \( \gamma = 20 \)
At \( \gamma = 20 \), the survival probability is \( P = \frac{1}{3} \). Substituting into the survival probability formula:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{20 \cdot 30}{c \tau_0}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{20 \cdot 30}{c \tau_0}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\ln(3) = \frac{20 \cdot 30}{c \tau_0}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{20 \cdot 30}{c \tau_0} = \ln(3).
\]

### Step 2: Relating \( \gamma \) and \( P \) for \( P = \frac{2}{3} \)
For the new survival probability \( P = \frac{2}{3} \), the formula becomes:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{\gamma_{\text{new}} \cdot 30}{c \tau_0}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{\gamma_{\text{new}} \cdot 30}{c \tau_0}.
\]

Multiply through by \(-1\):

\[
-\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{\gamma_{\text{new}} \cdot 30}{c \tau_0}.
\]

Simplify \( -\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \), so:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{\gamma_{\text{new}} \cdot 30}{c \tau_0}.
\]

### Step 3: Solving for \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \)
From the earlier result, \( \frac{20 \cdot 30}{c \tau_0} = \ln(3) \). Substituting this into the new equation:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{\gamma_{\text{new}}}{20} \cdot \ln(3).
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \):

\[
\gamma_{\text{new}} = 20 \cdot \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

### Step 4: Numerical Calculation
Using approximate values:
- \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \),
- \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \),

we compute:

\[
\gamma_{\text{new}} = 20 \cdot \frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 20 \cdot 2.708 \approx 54.16.
\]

### Conclusion
The required Lorentz factor is approximately \( 54 \), which corresponds to option **A**.
