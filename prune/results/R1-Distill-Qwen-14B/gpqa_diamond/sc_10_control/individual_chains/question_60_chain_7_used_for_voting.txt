Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. So the question is about an alien spacecraft traveling at a very high speed towards Earth. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective.

Wait, right, the problem mentions the Large Magellanic Cloud as the origin. I remember that the LMC is about 160,000 to 170,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance is roughly around 160,000 light-years. But wait, the exact number might not matter because the problem gives another approach.

The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super close to c. I think I should calculate the time from the astronaut's frame of reference, which would involve special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction.

Wait, in special relativity, the time experienced by the traveler (proper time) is shorter than the time measured by a stationary observer. Or wait, no. Let me get this right. The astronaut's frame is the one moving relative to Earth, so the distance they perceive would be length-contracted.

Length contraction formula is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (distance in Earth's frame) and L is the length in the astronaut's frame.

But wait, I'm not sure if I should use the Earth's frame or the astronaut's frame. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the time from Earth's frame and then apply time dilation to find the astronaut's experienced time.

Let me try both approaches.

First, Earth's frame: The distance is D = 163,000 light-years (approx value, but maybe the problem uses a different figure. Wait, the problem doesn't give the distance. Oh wait, maybe the distance isn't needed because the problem gives another approach. Wait, the problem says the astronaut is 22, and we need the time experienced by the astronaut.

Wait, maybe I can calculate the time from Earth's perspective and then account for time dilation. So, from Earth's frame, the time taken would be D / v. But D is the distance, which the problem doesn't give. Oh wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate based on the speed and the distance as perceived by the astronaut.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the time the astronaut experiences. So, the proper time tau is given by the equation:

tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Where t is the time measured in Earth's frame, and tau is the proper time (the astronaut's time).

But to find tau, I need to know t, the time in Earth's frame. How do I find t? Well, t = D / v. But D is the distance to Earth from the LMC. Oh, wait, maybe I have to know the distance. Wait, the problem says the average lifetime is 150 solar years, but that's probably a red herring.

Wait, the problem states that the astronaut is 22 years old. So from the astronaut's perspective, how long does the trip take?

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the time dilation factor and then figure out if the astronaut lives long enough.

Wait, let me think about the speed. v is 0.99999987 c. So v is very close to c.

The gamma factor (Lorentz factor) is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is so close to c, gamma will be a large number.

Wait, let's compute gamma. Let me compute v²/c²: (0.99999987)^2. Let me approximate this. Let me compute 1 - (v/c)^2.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v squared is (0.99999987)^2 c^2 ≈ (0.99999974) c^2. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) is sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.00051.

So gamma is 1 / 0.00051 ≈ 1960.78. So gamma is about 1960.

Wait, let me compute more accurately. Let me compute v as 0.99999987 c. So v = c - (1.3e-7)c. Because 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013.

Wait, wait, perhaps a more precise way is better. Let me compute (0.99999987)^2.

But maybe there's a better way. Let me compute 1 - (0.99999987)^2.

Compute 0.99999987 = 1 - 1.3e-7.

So (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a², where a=1.3e-7.

So 1 - (1 - a)^2 = 2a - a².

a=1.3e-7, so 2a=2.6e-7, a²=1.69e-14, which is negligible.

So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²)=sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

So gamma = 1/(5.099e-4) ≈ 1961.

So gamma is approximately 1961.

Now, the time experienced by the astronaut is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t / gamma.

Wait, but how to find t?

From Earth's frame, the time it takes is D / v, where D is the distance from LMC to Earth. But the problem doesn't provide D, so perhaps I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the proper time is given by the following formula:

tau = D / (v gamma)

Wait, no, wait: From the Earth's frame, the time is t = D / v. Then the proper time (tau) is t / gamma.

Wait, but I don't have D. Hmm, this is getting tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can see from the astronaut's perspective. They would see the distance as contracted. So in their frame, the distance is L = D / gamma.

So the time they experience is L / v. Because in their frame, Earth is approaching them at speed v, and the distance is L.

So tau = (D / gamma) / v.

But D is the distance in Earth's frame, which is D = v * t_earth.

So substituting, tau = (v t_earth / gamma) / v = t_earth / gamma.

Which brings us back to tau = t_earth / gamma.

So same as before.

But without D, I can't compute t_earth, unless I have some relation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is implying that the astronaut's own frame is the one where the trip takes a certain amount of time. But without the distance, I can't compute the time.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the time experienced by the astronaut, so using the proper time formula.

But without the distance, perhaps I should think in terms of the lifetime of the astronaut.

Wait, the average lifetime of the aliens is 150 solar years. The astronaut is 22 years old, so if the trip takes longer than (150-22)=128 years, the astronaut would die. But wait, that's from Earth's frame, but the astronaut's own time would be shorter.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is implying that from Earth's perspective, the trip would take a certain time, and using time dilation, calculate the astronaut's experienced time.

Wait, but again, without the distance, I don't know. Hmm. Maybe the problem expects me to use the speed and the gamma factor, and find the time experienced.

Wait, perhaps using the gamma factor, the time experienced (tau) is t_earth / gamma.

But without t_earth, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe it's saying that the distance is so great that the trip would take longer than the astronaut's lifetime, but considering time dilation, maybe it's possible.

Wait, but given that the speed is 0.99999987 c, that's about a 1960 gamma factor.

So from Earth's frame, the time to reach Earth would be D / (0.99999987 c). But we don't know D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the speed and the gamma factor to find the proper time.

Wait, perhaps the distance from the LMC to Earth is about 160,000 light-years. Let me assume that.

So D = 160,000 light-years.

So t_earth = D / v = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c) ≈ (160000 / 0.99999987) years.

Wait, since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, so t_earth would be (160,000 / 0.99999987) years ≈ approximately 160,000 * (1/0.99999987) ≈ about 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,002.02 years.

Wait, so t_earth is about 160,002 years.

Then tau = t_earth / gamma ≈ 160,002 / 1961 ≈ approx 81.37 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 81.37 years.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22, so adding that, they would be about 103 when they arrive. But their average lifetime is 150 years, so they would live, right? But wait, the question is how long it takes from their perspective. So the options are 72, 77, 81, or the astronaut dies.

So 81 is one of the options, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check.

Wait, the gamma factor was about 1960, right?

So 160,000 years (t_earth) divided by 1960 gives 81.55 years. So approximately 81.5, which is around 81 years. So option C is 81 years.

But wait, I assumed D is 160,000 ly. Does the problem give any clue about the distance? The problem mentions the LMC, which is about ~160,000 ly away, so that's a valid assumption.

So the astronaut would experience about 81 years, which would make them 22 +81 = 103 years old upon arrival. Since their average lifetime is 150, they would survive, so option A is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years

So the correct answer should be C) 81 years.

To determine how long the astronaut will take to reach Earth from their perspective, we analyze the situation using special relativity. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), which is very close to the speed of light. The distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Earth is approximately \( D \approx 160,000 \) light-years. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Time in Earth's Frame (\( t_{\text{Earth}} \)):**  
   From Earth's perspective, the time taken for the spacecraft to reach Earth is given by:
   \[
   t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c}.
   \]
   Since \( 1 \, \text{ly} / c = 1 \, \text{year} \), this simplifies to:
   \[
   t_{\text{Earth}} \approx \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \approx 160,002 \, \text{years}.
   \]

2. **Relativistic Time Dilation:**  
   The astronaut experiences proper time (\( \tau \)), which is shorter than \( t_{\text{Earth}} \) due to time dilation. The relationship is:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma},
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). For \( v = 0.99999987c \), calculate \( \gamma \):
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - (0.99999987)^2 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-7}, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}}} \approx 1961.
   \]

3. **Astronaut's Experienced Time (\( \tau \)):**  
   Substituting \( t_{\text{Earth}} \approx 160,002 \, \text{years} \) and \( \gamma \approx 1961 \) into the formula for \( \tau \):
   \[
   \tau = \frac{160,002}{1961} \approx 81.37 \, \text{years}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options:**  
   The astronaut's experienced time is approximately \( 81 \, \text{years} \), which matches option **C**. The astronaut will survive the trip, as their average lifetime is \( 150 \, \text{years} \), and \( 81 \, \text{years} \) is shorter than this.

### Conclusion:
The astronaut will experience approximately \( 81 \, \text{years} \) during the journey, and they will survive to reach Earth.

Compute 0.99999987 = 1 - 1.3e-7.

So (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a², where a=1.3e-7.

So 1 - (1 - a)^2 = 2a - a².

a=1.3e-7, so 2a=2.6e-7, a²=1.69e-14, which is negligible.

So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²)=sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

So gamma = 1/(5.099e-4) ≈ 1961.

So gamma is approximately 1961.
