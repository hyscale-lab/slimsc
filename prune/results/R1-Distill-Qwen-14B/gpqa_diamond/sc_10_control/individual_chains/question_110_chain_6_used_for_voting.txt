Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about which stars can be detected by two specific spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by understanding the question.

The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can observe brighter than 16 mag. So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be brighter than 17 (since 17 is the higher limit between 16 and 17). Wait, no, wait. No, wait a second. No, wait. Wait, ESPRESSO can observe up to 17, meaning it can detect stars as bright as 17 or brighter. HIRES can detect up to 16, so it's more sensitive. So a star that is detected by both must have an apparent V magnitude (m) ≤ 17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤ 16 (for HIRES). Wait, no. Because the way it's worded: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO. Brighter than 17 means m < 17. Similarly, for HIRES, m < 16. So a star that is brighter than both 17 and 16, which is m <16. Because 16 is less than 17. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent magnitude must be less than (brighter than) 16. Because if it's brighter than 16, it's automatically brighter than 17, so it can be seen by both.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's say a star has m=15.5. For ESPRESSO, m <17, so yes. For HIRES, m <16, which 15.5 is, so yes. So it can be detected by both.

But another star with m=16.5: ESPRESSO can see it (since 16.5 <17?), wait, no. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So wait, does "brighter than" mean m <17? Because higher magnitude is dimmer. So if a star is brighter than 17, its magnitude is less than 17. So for ESPRESSO, m <17. For HIRES, m <16. So a star that's m=16.5 is brighter than 17? Wait, m=16.5 is dimmer than 17. Because higher magnitude means dimmer. Wait, no. Wait, no, magnitude scale is such that lower numbers mean brighter. So a magnitude of 16 is brighter than 17. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, it's m <17. So a star with m=16.5 is brighter than 17 because 16.5 is less than 17. Wait, no. Wait, what's the confusion here.

Wait, let me get this straight. The scale is inverted. The higher the magnitude, the dimmer the star. So "brighter than V mag 17" means m <17. So a star with m=16 is brighter than 17.

So for a star to be detected by both instruments, it must have m <16 (because HIRES can only go up to m=16). Because if m is less than 16, then it's also less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So for both to detect, m must be less than 16.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase.

ESPRESSO: can detect m <17 (i.e., brighter than 17). So any star with m up to 17 is detectable by ESPRESSO.

HIRES: can detect m <16. So any star with m up to 16 is detectable by HIRES.

So for a star to be detectable by both, it must have m <16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if m is less than 16, it's automatically less than 17, so both can detect it.

Alternatively, if a star has m=16.5, it's brighter than 17 mag? No, wait, 16.5 is less than 17. So m=16.5 is brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can detect it (since m <17), but HIRES can't because it's m=16.5 which is higher than 16. So HIRES can't see it. So that star would only be seen by ESPRESSO.

So the stars that can be seen by both must have m <16.

Wait, but let me see the options.

Looking at the options, the possible stars are Star1, Star2, Star3, Star4, Star5.

Each star has some parameters. Let's look at each:

Star1: abs V mag=15.5, distance=10 pc.

Wait, I need to calculate its apparent magnitude. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10 (d / 10), where M is absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs.

So Star1: M=15.5, d=10pc.

m = 15.5 + 5*(log(10/10)) = 15.5 + 5*(0) = 15.5.

So m=15.5, which is less than 16. So it's detectable by both.

Star2: apparent V mag=16.5, distance=5 pc.

Wait, but wait. Wait, Star2's given as apparent V=16.5, which is m=16.5. So for HIRES, which requires m<16, Star2's m=16.5 is not acceptable. So HIRES can't detect it. But ESPRESSO can, since m=16.5 <17.

So Star2 can be detected by ESPRESSO, not by HIRES.

Star3: apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6 mag, distance=15 pc.

Wait, but wait, the question says that the total absorption in V band is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So extinction (A_V) = 3.1 * E(B-V). So for Star3: A_V=3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

So the observed apparent magnitude (m) is affected by extinction. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the apparent magnitude as given is already the observed, or is it the intrinsic? Hmm, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" for Star3. Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag." So the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but extinction is 1.86 mag.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because the observed apparent magnitude is the sum of intrinsic and extinction. Or is the given apparent magnitude the observed one, and we have to correct for extinction?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the apparent magnitude as observed (m_obs) is the actual brightness, which is affected by extinction. The formula is: m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_V.

So, if a star's true (intrinsic) magnitude is m_true, and we observe m_obs = m_true + A_V.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The star emits light, but if dust is present, it absorbs and scatters some of that light, making the star appear dimmer. So the observed magnitude is brighter than the intrinsic (without extinction) by A_V. Wait, no. Wait, higher magnitudes mean dimmer. So if a star's light is absorbed (extincted), it appears dimmer, so its observed magnitude is higher than its intrinsic.

So, observed m_obs = intrinsic m_true + A_V.

Wait, no, that can't be right because if there's extinction, the star appears dimmer, so m_obs is larger (since higher magnitude is dimmer). So yes, m_obs = m_true + A_V.

But wait, the way it's usually presented is that the apparent magnitude is the observed (so includes extinction), and the absolute magnitude is the intrinsic.

Wait, but in the case of Star3, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" and E(B-V)=0.6. So, how does this fit in?

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the intrinsic brightness. Because if the star's light is being absorbed, the apparent magnitude is affected. So the observed m is 15.5 mag, but the intrinsic m_intrinsic is m_obs - A_V.

Wait, but wait. Let me get this straight. Suppose a star without any extinction would have an apparent magnitude m_true. If it's behind dust, its apparent magnitude becomes m_obs = m_true + A_V.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because extinction makes the star dimmer, so m_obs is larger. So, m_obs = m_true + A_V.

Alternatively, if the star is at a certain distance without extinction, you calculate its apparent magnitude as m_true. But when extinction is present, m_obs = m_true + A_V.

So, in Star3's case, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, which includes the extinction. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude (if there were no extinction) would be m_true = m_obs - A_V = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64.

Wait, wait no. Because the star's light is dimmed by extinction, so the observed m is larger than the intrinsic. So, m_obs = m_true + A_V.

Wait, but that would imply that without extinction, the star would appear brighter (smaller m). So, if m_obs is 15.5, and A_V is 1.86, then the intrinsic m_true is 15.5 -1.86 = 13.64. So the star is actually brighter than it appears because of the extinction. But I'm not sure if I need to correct for this in this problem.

Wait, but the question is about the apparent magnitude, as observed. Because the spectrographs detect the apparent brightness. So when the question says, for example, Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, that's what is observed, so the spectrograph would see that. But the problem is whether it is brighter than the limit. So, the apparent magnitude as observed is 15.5, which is less than 16 (for HIRES), so it can be detected by HIRES. But wait, the star is at 15 pc distance. Wait, no, the distance is given, but for Star3, the apparent magnitude is given, so I don't need to calculate it. So Star3's m is 15.5, which is less than 16, so detectable by both? Because 15.5 <16. So both can detect.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the apparent magnitude given is 15.5. But wait, the star's location is RA=11h and DEC=48 deg. Would that affect whether it's visible from the observatories? Oh, but the question says to disregard the pointing limits, so I don't have to worry about whether the stars are visible in the sky from the observatories.

So Star3's m=15.5 <16, so both can detect it. So Star3 is a candidate.

Star4: absolute V mag=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance=10 pc.

So I need to calculate its apparent magnitude.

Using the formula m = M +5 log(d/10) + A_V.

Wait, M is the absolute magnitude, d is distance. So m (intrinsic) is M +5 log(d/10). Then add A_V for extinction.

So M=15.5, d=10 pc.

m_intrinsic (without extinction) = 15.5 + 5*(log(10/10)) =15.5 +0=15.5.

Then, A_V=3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So m_obs =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So m=16.74.

So for HIRES, which requires m<16, 16.74 is not acceptable. So Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO (since 16.74 <17).

Star5: absolute V mag=16.5, distance=5 pc.

Compute apparent magnitude m.

m = M +5 log (d/10) =16.5 +5 log(5/10)=16.5 +5 log(0.5) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505≈14.995.

So m≈15.0.

So m=15.0, which is less than 16. So both can detect it.

So let's list each star:

Star1: m=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star2: m=16.5 → detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star3: m=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star4: m=16.74 → detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star5: m≈15.0 → detectable by both.

Wait, so Star1, Star3, and Star5 can be detected by both. But the options don't include all three.

Wait, let's double-check each calculation.

Star1: absolute mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So m=15.5. So both can detect.

Star2: apparent mag 16.5 → detected by ESPRESSO (16.5 <17) but not HIRES.

Star3: apparent mag 15.5 → both can detect.

Star4: m_obs=16.74 → detected by ESPRESSO only.

Star5: m≈15.0 → both can detect.

So which stars are detectable by both? Star1, Star3, Star5.

But the options don't have all three. Let's look at the options.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 cannot be detected by both.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Both can be detected by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 only by ESPRESSO.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 only by ESPRESSO.

Wait, but option B says Star3 and Star5. Both can be detected by both.

But wait, looking back at Star3: the problem states that Star3 has an apparent V mag of 15.5 and E(B-V)=0.6, but when we calculated the extinction, we got A_V=1.86. So m_obs =15.5 (given) → which is the observed magnitude. So the observed m is 15.5, so it's less than 16, so detectable by HIRES.

But wait, if the observed m is 15.5, then it's acceptable for both. So yes, Star3 is a candidate.

Star5: m≈15.0 → both detect.

So the possible stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options, the only option that includes any of these is option B (Star3 and Star5) and option D (Star1 and Star4, but Star4 can't).

But looking at the options, option B is "Star3 and Star5" — so both can be detected by both spectrographs.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again.

Star3: apparent V is 15.5, which is less than 16. So yes.

Star5: m≈15.0.

So both can be detected by both.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about Star5 again. The absolute magnitude is 16.5, distance 5 pc.

m = M +5 log(d/10) → 16.5 +5 log(5/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995 → approx 15.0.

So m=15.0, which is less than 16, so both can detect.

So which options include Star3 and Star5? Option B.

But let me look at the options:

Option B) Star3 and Star5.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can detect stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., \( m < 17 \)), while HIRES can detect stars brighter than 16 mag (i.e., \( m < 16 \)). For a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V magnitude must satisfy \( m < 16 \).

### Analysis of Each Star:

   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10 / 10) = 15.5
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.5 \), which is \( < 16 \).  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \).  
   - \( m = 16.5 \), which is \( \geq 16 \).  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
     \]  
   - The observed apparent magnitude is already given as \( m = 15.5 \), which includes extinction.  
   - \( m = 15.5 \), which is \( < 16 \).  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).  
   - Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10 / 10) = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Observed apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{obs}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - \( m_{\text{obs}} = 16.74 \), which is \( \geq 16 \).  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5 / 10) = 16.5 + 5 \cdot (-0.3010) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.0 \), which is \( < 16 \).  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

### Conclusion:
Stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**. Among the options provided, only **Option B (Star3 and Star5)** satisfies the condition.

**Answer: B**

But another star with m=16.5: ESPRESSO can see it (since 16.5 <17?), wait, no. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So wait, does "brighter than" mean m <17? Because higher magnitude is dimmer. So if a star is brighter than 17, its magnitude is less than 17. So for ESPRESSO, m <17. For HIRES, m <16. So a star that's m=16.5 is brighter than 17? Wait, m=16.5 is dimmer than 17. Because higher magnitude means dimmer. Wait, no. Wait, no, magnitude scale is such that lower numbers mean brighter. So a magnitude of 16 is brighter than 17. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, it's m <17. So a star with m=16.5 is brighter than 17 because 16.5 is less than 17. Wait, no. Wait, what's the confusion here.

Wait, let me get this straight. The scale is inverted. The higher the magnitude, the dimmer the star. So "brighter than V mag 17" means m <17. So a star with m=16 is brighter than 17.

So Star1: M=15.5, d=10pc.

m = 15.5 + 5*(log(10/10)) = 15.5 + 5*(0) = 15.5.

So m=15.5, which is less than 16. So it's detectable by both.

Star2: apparent V mag=16.5, distance=5 pc.

Wait, but wait. Wait, Star2's given as apparent V=16.5, which is m=16.5. So for HIRES, which requires m<16, Star2's m=16.5 is not acceptable. So HIRES can't detect it. But ESPRESSO can, since m=16.5 <17.

So Star2 can be detected by ESPRESSO, not by HIRES.

Star3: apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6 mag, distance=15 pc.

Wait, but wait, the question says that the total absorption in V band is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So extinction (A_V) = 3.1 * E(B-V). So for Star3: A_V=3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

So the observed apparent magnitude (m) is affected by extinction. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the apparent magnitude as given is already the observed, or is it the intrinsic? Hmm, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" for Star3. Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag." So the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but extinction is 1.86 mag.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because the observed apparent magnitude is the sum of intrinsic and extinction. Or is the given apparent magnitude the observed one, and we have to correct for extinction?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the apparent magnitude as observed (m_obs) is the actual brightness, which is affected by extinction. The formula is: m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_V.

So, if a star's true (intrinsic) magnitude is m_true, and we observe m_obs = m_true + A_V.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The star emits light, but if dust is present, it absorbs and scatters some of that light, making the star appear dimmer. So the observed magnitude is brighter than the intrinsic (without extinction) by A_V. Wait, no. Wait, higher magnitudes mean dimmer. So if a star's light is absorbed (extincted), it appears dimmer, so its observed magnitude is higher than its intrinsic.

So, observed m_obs = intrinsic m_true + A_V.

Wait, no, that can't be right because if there's extinction, the star appears dimmer, so m_obs is larger (since higher magnitude is dimmer). So yes, m_obs = m_true + A_V.

But wait, the way it's usually presented is that the apparent magnitude is the observed (so includes extinction), and the absolute magnitude is the intrinsic.

Wait, but in the case of Star3, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" and E(B-V)=0.6. So, how does this fit in?

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the intrinsic brightness. Because if the star's light is being absorbed, the apparent magnitude is affected. So the observed m is 15.5 mag, but the intrinsic m_intrinsic is m_obs - A_V.

Wait, but wait. Let me get this straight. Suppose a star without any extinction would have an apparent magnitude m_true. If it's behind dust, its apparent magnitude becomes m_obs = m_true + A_V.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because extinction makes the star dimmer, so m_obs is larger. So, m_obs = m_true + A_V.

Alternatively, if the star is at a certain distance without extinction, you calculate its apparent magnitude as m_true. But when extinction is present, m_obs = m_true + A_V.

So, in Star3's case, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, which includes the extinction. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude (if there were no extinction) would be m_true = m_obs - A_V = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64.

Wait, wait no. Because the star's light is dimmed by extinction, so the observed m is larger than the intrinsic. So, m_obs = m_true + A_V.

Wait, but that would imply that without extinction, the star would appear brighter (smaller m). So, if m_obs is 15.5, and A_V is 1.86, then the intrinsic m_true is 15.5 -1.86 = 13.64. So the star is actually brighter than it appears because of the extinction. But I'm not sure if I need to correct for this in this problem.

Wait, but the question is about the apparent magnitude, as observed. Because the spectrographs detect the apparent brightness. So when the question says, for example, Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, that's what is observed, so the spectrograph would see that. But the problem is whether it is brighter than the limit. So, the apparent magnitude as observed is 15.5, which is less than 16 (for HIRES), so it can be detected by HIRES. But wait, the star is at 15 pc distance. Wait, no, the distance is given, but for Star3, the apparent magnitude is given, so I don't need to calculate it. So Star3's m is 15.5, which is less than 16, so detectable by both? Because 15.5 <16. So both can detect.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the apparent magnitude given is 15.5. But wait, the star's location is RA=11h and DEC=48 deg. Would that affect whether it's visible from the observatories? Oh, but the question says to disregard the pointing limits, so I don't have to worry about whether the stars are visible in the sky from the observatories.

So Star3's m=15.5 <16, so both can detect it. So Star3 is a candidate.

Star4: absolute V mag=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance=10 pc.

So I need to calculate its apparent magnitude.

Using the formula m = M +5 log(d/10) + A_V.

Wait, M is the absolute magnitude, d is distance. So m (intrinsic) is M +5 log(d/10). Then add A_V for extinction.

So M=15.5, d=10 pc.

m_intrinsic (without extinction) = 15.5 + 5*(log(10/10)) =15.5 +0=15.5.

Then, A_V=3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So m_obs =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So m=16.74.

So for HIRES, which requires m<16, 16.74 is not acceptable. So Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO (since 16.74 <17).

Star5: absolute V mag=16.5, distance=5 pc.

Compute apparent magnitude m.

m = M +5 log (d/10) =16.5 +5 log(5/10)=16.5 +5 log(0.5) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505≈14.995.

So m≈15.0.

So m=15.0, which is less than 16. So both can detect it.

So let's list each star:

Star1: m=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star2: m=16.5 → detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star3: m=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star4: m=16.74 → detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star5: m≈15.0 → detectable by both.

Wait, so Star1, Star3, and Star5 can be detected by both. But the options don't include all three.

Wait, let's double-check each calculation.

Star1: absolute mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So m=15.5. So both can detect.

Star2: apparent mag 16.5 → detected by ESPRESSO (16.5 <17) but not HIRES.

Star3: apparent mag 15.5 → both can detect.

Star4: m_obs=16.74 → detected by ESPRESSO only.

Star5: m≈15.0 → both can detect.

So which stars are detectable by both? Star1, Star3, Star5.

But the options don't have all three. Let's look at the options.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 cannot be detected by both.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Both can be detected by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 only by ESPRESSO.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 only by ESPRESSO.

Wait, but option B says Star3 and Star5. Both can be detected by both.

But wait, looking back at Star3: the problem states that Star3 has an apparent V mag of 15.5 and E(B-V)=0.6, but when we calculated the extinction, we got A_V=1.86. So m_obs =15.5 (given) → which is the observed magnitude. So the observed m is 15.5, so it's less than 16, so detectable by HIRES.

But wait, if the observed m is 15.5, then it's acceptable for both. So yes, Star3 is a candidate.

Star5: m≈15.0 → both detect.

So the possible stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options, the only option that includes any of these is option B (Star3 and Star5) and option D (Star1 and Star4, but Star4 can't).

But looking at the options, option B is "Star3 and Star5" — so both can be detected by both spectrographs.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again.

Star3: apparent V is 15.5, which is less than 16. So yes.

Star5: m≈15.0.

So both can be detected by both.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about Star5 again. The absolute magnitude is 16.5, distance 5 pc.

m = M +5 log(d/10) → 16.5 +5 log(5/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995 → approx 15.0.

So m=15.0, which is less than 16, so both can detect.

So which options include Star3 and Star5? Option B.

But let me look at the options:

Option B) Star3 and Star5.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can detect stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., \( m < 17 \)), while HIRES can detect stars brighter than 16 mag (i.e., \( m < 16 \)). For a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V magnitude must satisfy \( m < 16 \).

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10 / 10) = 15.5
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.5 \), which is \( < 16 \).  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \).  
   - \( m = 16.5 \), which is \( \geq 16 \).  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
     \]  
   - The observed apparent magnitude is already given as \( m = 15.5 \), which includes extinction.  
   - \( m = 15.5 \), which is \( < 16 \).  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).  
   - Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10 / 10) = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Observed apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{obs}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - \( m_{\text{obs}} = 16.74 \), which is \( \geq 16 \).  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5 / 10) = 16.5 + 5 \cdot (-0.3010) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.0 \), which is \( < 16 \).  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

### Conclusion:
Stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**. Among the options provided, only **Option B (Star3 and Star5)** satisfies the condition.

**Answer: B**
