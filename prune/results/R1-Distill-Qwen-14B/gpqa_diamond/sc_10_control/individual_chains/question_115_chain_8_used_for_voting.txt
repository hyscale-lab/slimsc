Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So, there's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one's going upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the two photons' directions.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. And since energy and momentum must be conserved, the photons' momenta must add up to the total momentum of the system before the collision.

Wait, but the electron and positron have equal and opposite charges, right? But their Lorentz factors are different. So first, I think I need to calculate their relativistic momenta because the Lorentz factor is involved.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given by 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since we're given the gamma values, maybe I don't need to calculate v directly. Oh right, because momentum p is gamma * m * v. Alternatively, since gamma is given, and for electrons, m is the rest mass (about 9.1e-31 kg), but maybe we can use the relation that p = gamma * m * v, but perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, I remember that for high speeds, the momentum can be expressed in terms of the gamma and the rest mass. Wait, no, but wait, for each particle, the momentum would be gamma multiplied by m multiplied by their velocity.

But since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their velocities are in opposite directions. So maybe their momenta are in opposite directions as well.

Wait, let me think about the setup. The electron is moving to the right (since it's coming from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (since it's coming from the right). So their momenta are in opposite directions. So when they collide, the total momentum before collision is the sum of their individual momenta.

But wait, electrons and positrons have the same mass. So the electron has gamma_e =4, and the positron gamma_p=2.

So the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. The positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p. But since m_e = m_p = m, and their velocities are in opposite directions. So let's take the direction of the electron as positive. Then the positron's direction is negative.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the velocities. Because Lorentz factors are given, so perhaps I can compute their momenta without knowing v.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of four-momentum. The total four-momentum before annihilation is the sum of the electron and positron's four-momenta.

But perhaps the easiest way is to compute total energy and total momentum before annihilation, then use that to find the photons' momenta and energies.

So, let's compute the total energy and total momentum.

The electron's total energy is gamma_e * m c², and its momentum is gamma_e * m v. Similarly for the positron.

Wait, but the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so its momentum is in the opposite direction. So when we sum the momenta, we subtract.

Wait, no. Let's define the direction: the electron is moving along +x, so its momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e (positive). The positron is moving along -x, so its momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p. But since it's moving to the left, v_p is negative. So p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p, which is negative because v_p is negative.

Wait, but let me think again. If the positron is moving to the right, which way? No, the positron is moving from the right towards the left. So its velocity is negative, so its momentum is negative.

So the total momentum before collision is p_e (positive) plus p_p (which is negative). So overall, the sum is p_total = p_e + p_p.

Similarly, the total energy is E_e + E_p, where E_e = gamma_e * m c², E_p = gamma_p * m c².

But wait, the positron is a particle of antimatter, so when it annihilates with an electron, their rest masses are combined. So the total rest mass energy is 2 m c². But in this case, since they're moving, their energies are higher than that.

So, let's compute E_total and p_total.

E_e = gamma_e * m c² =4 * m c².

E_p = gamma_p * m c² =2 * m c².

So E_total = (4 + 2) m c² =6 m c².

Now, for the momentum. Let me denote v_e as the speed of the electron, v_p as the speed of the positron.

But, since gamma_e =4 and gamma_p=2, I can compute the velocities.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to relate p and gamma without computing v. Because p = gamma m v, and gamma =1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me express v in terms of gamma. Let me think:

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So, for the electron:

v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(4)^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) )= c * (sqrt(15)/4) ≈ 0.968 c.

Similarly, for the positron:

v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2)^2) = c * sqrt(3/4) = c*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 0.866 c.

Wait, but since the positron is moving to the left, v_p is negative. So when we compute p_p, it's gamma_p * m * v_p, which would be 2 * m * ( -0.866 c ) = -1.732 m c.

Wait, but p_e is gamma_e * m * v_e =4 * m *0.968 c ≈3.872 m c.

So p_total =3.872 m c (from electron) + (-1.732 m c) from positron.

Wait, wait—no. Because the positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative. So its momentum is gamma_p * m * (v_p) where v_p is negative.

So, p_p =2 * m * (-0.866 c) = -1.732 m c.

So adding them together:

p_total =3.872 m c -1.732 m c ≈2.14 m c.

Wait, because 3.872 -1.732 =2.14.

So the total momentum before collision is approximately 2.14 m c in the direction of the electron's motion.

Now, after the collision, two photons are produced. Each photon has the same energy, so their energies are equal. Let's denote the energy of each photon as E_photon.

Since energy is conserved, 2 E_photon = E_total =6 m c². So E_photon =3 m c² each.

Wait, that would be the case only if the total energy before is 6 m c², which is correct.

But wait, photons also carry momentum. The momentum of a photon is p_photon = E_photon /c, and the direction is the direction the photon is moving.

So, the two photons have energies E1 and E2, each equal to 3 m c². So their momenta are p1 = E1/c =3 m c, and p2 =3 m c.

But wait, the problem states that the photons are moving in directions upper-right and lower-right. So their momenta are vectors. Let me denote the x and y components.

Let me denote photon 1 as moving in the upper-right direction, making an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 as moving in the lower-right, making an angle theta below the x-axis.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's said that one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So I'm assuming they are symmetric in some way.

Since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are equal, so p1 = p2 =3 m c.

So, the total momentum after annihilation is the vector sum of the two photons' momenta.

But since the total momentum before was along the x-axis, the total after must also be along the x-axis.

So let's model the momenta of the photons.

For photon 1, moving upper-right: its momentum vector has components (p1x, p1y) = (p1 cos theta, p1 sin theta).

For photon 2, moving lower-right: (p2x, p2y) = (p2 cos(-theta), p2 sin(-theta)) )= (p2 cos theta, -p2 sin theta).

Because they're symmetric, perhaps the angles are the same in magnitude but opposite in direction.

So the sum of the x-components must equal the initial total momentum, which is p_total =2.14 m c.

The sum of y-components must be zero because the initial system has no net y-momentum.

So, let's write the equations.

Sum of x-components:

p1 cos theta + p2 cos theta = (p1 + p2) cos theta.

But p1 = p2 =3 m c.

So, (3 m c +3 m c ) * cos theta =2 *3 m c * cos theta =6 m c cos theta.

This should equal p_total =2.14 m c.

So,

6 m c cos theta =2.14 m c.

Divide both sides by m c:

6 cos theta =2.14.

So cos theta =2.14 /6 ≈0.3567.

So theta ≈ arccos(0.3567) ≈69 degrees.

Wait, but wait a second. The angle between the two photons would be 2 theta, because one is theta above and the other is theta below the x-axis. So the angle between them is 2 theta.

So 2 *69 =138 degrees. That's option C.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me recalculate the total momentum.

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

Wait, gamma_e is 4. So p_e =4 * m_e * v_e.

v_e = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e^2 )) *c = sqrt(1 - 1/16) c = sqrt(15/16) c = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈0.9682 c.

So p_e =4 * m_e *0.9682 c =3.8728 m_e c.

Similarly, for the positron:

gamma_p=2. So p_p =2 * m_p * v_p.

v_p = sqrt(1 -1/(4)) c = sqrt(3/4) c = (√3)/2 c ≈0.8660 c.

But since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its velocity is negative. So p_p =2 * m_p * (-0.8660 c ) = -1.732 m_p c.

Wait, but m_p is the same as m_e, since it's a positron (same mass as an electron). So p_p =-1.732 m_e c.

So total momentum before collision:

p_total =3.8728 m_e c -1.732 m_e c = (3.8728 -1.732 ) m_e c ≈2.1408 m_e c.

Now, the photons: each has energy E_photon=3 m_e c^2.

So, the momentum of each photon is E_photon/c=3 m_e c.

So, each photon's momentum is 3 m_e c.

Let me model their directions. Let's say photon 1 has an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 has an angle theta below the x-axis.

So, their momenta vectors are:

Photon 1: (3 m_e c cos theta, 3 m_e c sin theta )

Photon 2: (3 m_e c cos theta, -3 m_e c sin theta )

So, the sum of their y-components must be zero.

3 m_e c sin theta -3 m_e c sin theta =0. Which makes sense.

The sum of their x-components is:

3 m_e c cos theta +3 m_e c cos theta =6 m_e c cos theta.

But this must equal the total momentum before collision, which is 2.1408 m_e c.

So,

6 m_e c cos theta =2.1408 m_e c.

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos theta =2.1408.

So cos theta =2.1408 /6 ≈0.3568.

Taking arccos: theta ≈69 degrees.

So the angle between the two photons is 2 theta =138 degrees.

That's option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of the electron and positron, ensuring energy and momentum conservation. The electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors of 4 and 2, respectively. Their relativistic momenta and energies are calculated, and the total momentum and energy before annihilation are determined. After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies and symmetric directions (upper-right and lower-right). Using the conservation laws, the angle between the photons' directions is calculated.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Energy and Momentum Before Annihilation
The total energy of the system before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m c^2 + \gamma_p m c^2 = (4 + 2)m c^2 = 6m c^2
\]
The total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the relativistic momenta of the electron and positron. Using the relation \(p = \gamma m v\) and \(v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}\), their momenta are:
\[
p_e = \gamma_e m v_e = 4m c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4^2}} = 4m c \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} = 3.872m c
\]
\[
p_p = \gamma_p m v_p = 2m c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2^2}} = 2m c \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 1.732m c
\]
Since the positron moves in the opposite direction, its momentum is negative:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_e - p_p = 3.872m c - 1.732m c = 2.1408m c
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Photons After Annihilation
After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies \(E_{\text{photon}}\). By energy conservation:
\[
2E_{\text{photon}} = E_{\text{total}} \implies E_{\text{photon}} = 3m c^2
\]
The momentum of each photon is:
\[
p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{3m c^2}{c} = 3m c
\]
The photons move symmetrically in the upper-right and lower-right directions. Let the angles of the photons above and below the x-axis be \(\theta\). The momentum components of the photons are:
\[
\text{Photon 1 (upper-right)}: (p_1 \cos\theta, p_1 \sin\theta)
\]
\[
\text{Photon 2 (lower-right)}: (p_2 \cos\theta, -p_2 \sin\theta)
\]
Since \(p_1 = p_2 = 3m c\), the total momentum after annihilation is:
\[
p_{\text{total, x}} = p_1 \cos\theta + p_2 \cos\theta = 2p_1 \cos\theta
\]
\[
p_{\text{total, y}} = p_1 \sin\theta - p_2 \sin\theta = 0
\]
The total momentum before annihilation is along the x-axis, so the total momentum after annihilation must also be along the x-axis:
\[
2p_1 \cos\theta = p_{\text{total}}
\]
Substituting \(p_1 = 3m c\) and \(p_{\text{total}} = 2.1408m c\):
\[
2(3m c) \cos\theta = 2.1408m c \implies 6 \cos\theta = 2.1408 \implies \cos\theta = \frac{2.1408}{6} \approx 0.3568
\]
\[
\theta = \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ
\]
The angle between the two photons is:
\[
\text{Angle between photons} = 2\theta = 2(69^\circ) = 138^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Wait, but the electron and positron have equal and opposite charges, right? But their Lorentz factors are different. So first, I think I need to calculate their relativistic momenta because the Lorentz factor is involved.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given by 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since we're given the gamma values, maybe I don't need to calculate v directly. Oh right, because momentum p is gamma * m * v. Alternatively, since gamma is given, and for electrons, m is the rest mass (about 9.1e-31 kg), but maybe we can use the relation that p = gamma * m * v, but perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, I remember that for high speeds, the momentum can be expressed in terms of the gamma and the rest mass. Wait, no, but wait, for each particle, the momentum would be gamma multiplied by m multiplied by their velocity.

But since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their velocities are in opposite directions. So maybe their momenta are in opposite directions as well.

Wait, let me think about the setup. The electron is moving to the right (since it's coming from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (since it's coming from the right). So their momenta are in opposite directions. So when they collide, the total momentum before collision is the sum of their individual momenta.

But wait, electrons and positrons have the same mass. So the electron has gamma_e =4, and the positron gamma_p=2.

So the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. The positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p. But since m_e = m_p = m, and their velocities are in opposite directions. So let's take the direction of the electron as positive. Then the positron's direction is negative.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the velocities. Because Lorentz factors are given, so perhaps I can compute their momenta without knowing v.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of four-momentum. The total four-momentum before annihilation is the sum of the electron and positron's four-momenta.

But perhaps the easiest way is to compute total energy and total momentum before annihilation, then use that to find the photons' momenta and energies.

So, let's compute the total energy and total momentum.

The electron's total energy is gamma_e * m c², and its momentum is gamma_e * m v. Similarly for the positron.

Wait, but the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so its momentum is in the opposite direction. So when we sum the momenta, we subtract.

Wait, no. Let's define the direction: the electron is moving along +x, so its momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e (positive). The positron is moving along -x, so its momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p. But since it's moving to the left, v_p is negative. So p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p, which is negative because v_p is negative.

Wait, but let me think again. If the positron is moving to the right, which way? No, the positron is moving from the right towards the left. So its velocity is negative, so its momentum is negative.

So the total momentum before collision is p_e (positive) plus p_p (which is negative). So overall, the sum is p_total = p_e + p_p.

Similarly, the total energy is E_e + E_p, where E_e = gamma_e * m c², E_p = gamma_p * m c².

But wait, the positron is a particle of antimatter, so when it annihilates with an electron, their rest masses are combined. So the total rest mass energy is 2 m c². But in this case, since they're moving, their energies are higher than that.

So, let's compute E_total and p_total.

E_e = gamma_e * m c² =4 * m c².

E_p = gamma_p * m c² =2 * m c².

So E_total = (4 + 2) m c² =6 m c².

Now, for the momentum. Let me denote v_e as the speed of the electron, v_p as the speed of the positron.

But, since gamma_e =4 and gamma_p=2, I can compute the velocities.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to relate p and gamma without computing v. Because p = gamma m v, and gamma =1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me express v in terms of gamma. Let me think:

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So, for the electron:

v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(4)^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) )= c * (sqrt(15)/4) ≈ 0.968 c.

Similarly, for the positron:

v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2)^2) = c * sqrt(3/4) = c*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 0.866 c.

Wait, but since the positron is moving to the left, v_p is negative. So when we compute p_p, it's gamma_p * m * v_p, which would be 2 * m * ( -0.866 c ) = -1.732 m c.

Wait, but p_e is gamma_e * m * v_e =4 * m *0.968 c ≈3.872 m c.

So p_total =3.872 m c (from electron) + (-1.732 m c) from positron.

Wait, wait—no. Because the positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative. So its momentum is gamma_p * m * (v_p) where v_p is negative.

So, p_p =2 * m * (-0.866 c) = -1.732 m c.

So adding them together:

p_total =3.872 m c -1.732 m c ≈2.14 m c.

Wait, because 3.872 -1.732 =2.14.

So the total momentum before collision is approximately 2.14 m c in the direction of the electron's motion.

Now, after the collision, two photons are produced. Each photon has the same energy, so their energies are equal. Let's denote the energy of each photon as E_photon.

Since energy is conserved, 2 E_photon = E_total =6 m c². So E_photon =3 m c² each.

Wait, that would be the case only if the total energy before is 6 m c², which is correct.

But wait, photons also carry momentum. The momentum of a photon is p_photon = E_photon /c, and the direction is the direction the photon is moving.

So, the two photons have energies E1 and E2, each equal to 3 m c². So their momenta are p1 = E1/c =3 m c, and p2 =3 m c.

But wait, the problem states that the photons are moving in directions upper-right and lower-right. So their momenta are vectors. Let me denote the x and y components.

Let me denote photon 1 as moving in the upper-right direction, making an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 as moving in the lower-right, making an angle theta below the x-axis.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's said that one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So I'm assuming they are symmetric in some way.

Since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are equal, so p1 = p2 =3 m c.

So, the total momentum after annihilation is the vector sum of the two photons' momenta.

But since the total momentum before was along the x-axis, the total after must also be along the x-axis.

So let's model the momenta of the photons.

For photon 1, moving upper-right: its momentum vector has components (p1x, p1y) = (p1 cos theta, p1 sin theta).

For photon 2, moving lower-right: (p2x, p2y) = (p2 cos(-theta), p2 sin(-theta)) )= (p2 cos theta, -p2 sin theta).

Because they're symmetric, perhaps the angles are the same in magnitude but opposite in direction.

So the sum of the x-components must equal the initial total momentum, which is p_total =2.14 m c.

The sum of y-components must be zero because the initial system has no net y-momentum.

So, let's write the equations.

Sum of x-components:

p1 cos theta + p2 cos theta = (p1 + p2) cos theta.

But p1 = p2 =3 m c.

So, (3 m c +3 m c ) * cos theta =2 *3 m c * cos theta =6 m c cos theta.

This should equal p_total =2.14 m c.

So,

6 m c cos theta =2.14 m c.

Divide both sides by m c:

6 cos theta =2.14.

So cos theta =2.14 /6 ≈0.3567.

So theta ≈ arccos(0.3567) ≈69 degrees.

Wait, but wait a second. The angle between the two photons would be 2 theta, because one is theta above and the other is theta below the x-axis. So the angle between them is 2 theta.

So 2 *69 =138 degrees. That's option C.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me recalculate the total momentum.

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

Wait, gamma_e is 4. So p_e =4 * m_e * v_e.

v_e = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e^2 )) *c = sqrt(1 - 1/16) c = sqrt(15/16) c = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈0.9682 c.

So p_e =4 * m_e *0.9682 c =3.8728 m_e c.

Similarly, for the positron:

gamma_p=2. So p_p =2 * m_p * v_p.

v_p = sqrt(1 -1/(4)) c = sqrt(3/4) c = (√3)/2 c ≈0.8660 c.

But since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its velocity is negative. So p_p =2 * m_p * (-0.8660 c ) = -1.732 m_p c.

Wait, but m_p is the same as m_e, since it's a positron (same mass as an electron). So p_p =-1.732 m_e c.

So total momentum before collision:

p_total =3.8728 m_e c -1.732 m_e c = (3.8728 -1.732 ) m_e c ≈2.1408 m_e c.

Now, the photons: each has energy E_photon=3 m_e c^2.

So, the momentum of each photon is E_photon/c=3 m_e c.

So, each photon's momentum is 3 m_e c.

Let me model their directions. Let's say photon 1 has an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 has an angle theta below the x-axis.

So, their momenta vectors are:

Photon 1: (3 m_e c cos theta, 3 m_e c sin theta )

Photon 2: (3 m_e c cos theta, -3 m_e c sin theta )

So, the sum of their y-components must be zero.

3 m_e c sin theta -3 m_e c sin theta =0. Which makes sense.

The sum of their x-components is:

3 m_e c cos theta +3 m_e c cos theta =6 m_e c cos theta.

But this must equal the total momentum before collision, which is 2.1408 m_e c.

So,

6 m_e c cos theta =2.1408 m_e c.

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos theta =2.1408.

So cos theta =2.1408 /6 ≈0.3568.

Taking arccos: theta ≈69 degrees.

So the angle between the two photons is 2 theta =138 degrees.

That's option C.

\]
The total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the relativistic momenta of the electron and positron. Using the relation \(p = \gamma m v\) and \(v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}\), their momenta are:
\[
p_e = \gamma_e m v_e = 4m c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4^2}} = 4m c \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} = 3.872m c
\]
\[
p_p = \gamma_p m v_p = 2m c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2^2}} = 2m c \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 1.732m c
\]
Since the positron moves in the opposite direction, its momentum is negative:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_e - p_p = 3.872m c - 1.732m c = 2.1408m c
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Photons After Annihilation
After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies \(E_{\text{photon}}\). By energy conservation:
\[
2E_{\text{photon}} = E_{\text{total}} \implies E_{\text{photon}} = 3m c^2
\]
The momentum of each photon is:
\[
p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{3m c^2}{c} = 3m c
\]
The photons move symmetrically in the upper-right and lower-right directions. Let the angles of the photons above and below the x-axis be \(\theta\). The momentum components of the photons are:
\[
\text{Photon 1 (upper-right)}: (p_1 \cos\theta, p_1 \sin\theta)
\]
\[
\text{Photon 2 (lower-right)}: (p_2 \cos\theta, -p_2 \sin\theta)
\]
Since \(p_1 = p_2 = 3m c\), the total momentum after annihilation is:
\[
p_{\text{total, x}} = p_1 \cos\theta + p_2 \cos\theta = 2p_1 \cos\theta
\]
\[
p_{\text{total, y}} = p_1 \sin\theta - p_2 \sin\theta = 0
\]
The total momentum before annihilation is along the x-axis, so the total momentum after annihilation must also be along the x-axis:
\[
2p_1 \cos\theta = p_{\text{total}}
\]
Substituting \(p_1 = 3m c\) and \(p_{\text{total}} = 2.1408m c\):
\[
2(3m c) \cos\theta = 2.1408m c \implies 6 \cos\theta = 2.1408 \implies \cos\theta = \frac{2.1408}{6} \approx 0.3568
\]
\[
\theta = \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ
\]
The angle between the two photons is:
\[
\text{Angle between photons} = 2\theta = 2(69^\circ) = 138^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
