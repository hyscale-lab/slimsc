Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. But I'll take it step by step.

Let me read the question again. So, there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. Okay, so each charge is 3.2e-19 C. But wait, the problem says 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So, point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from P.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, right, in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is what we're usually dealing with here. But wait, I remember that potential energy is related to the work done to assemble the charges, bringing them from infinity to their positions.

But wait, the system is isolated. So, I think that means we don't consider any external fields or anything; it's just about the energy between the charges themselves.

So, how do I approach this? The system consists of the 13th charge fixed at P and the other 12 each at 2 meters from P. So, the 13th charge is fixed, meaning we don't move it. But what about the other 12? They're each at 2 m from P, but are they each 2 meters apart from each other? Or is the distance between any two of them maybe something else? The problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from point P, which suggests that they are all on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P. So their positions relative to each other can vary on the surface, but each is 2 meters away from P.

Wait a second, but the setup doesn't specify anything about their mutual distances. So for potential energy, we need to consider all the pairwise interactions. But if they're all on a sphere, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances would vary. However, wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. Oh, right! Because the potential energy can vary depending on how the charges are arranged, but the system will have a minimum potential energy when the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy.

Wait, but wait a second. For point charges, the potential energy is a sum over all pairs. So, the potential energy U is (1/(4πε₀)) times the sum over all pairs of (q_i q_j)/r_ij.

But in this scenario, we have 12 charges each at a fixed distance from the 13th, and each of the 12 can move on the sphere, but their mutual distances can change. To find the minimum energy, we need to arrange those 12 charges in such a way that the total potential energy is minimized.

Wait, but how? For point charges, the potential energy depends on their positions. If all the 12 are the same charge, which is 2e, and since they are identical, arranging them in a symmetric fashion would minimize the potential energy. I remember that for identical charges on a sphere, the configuration with the lowest potential energy is when they are equally spaced, like the vertices of a regular icosahedron or something similar. But wait, actually, for the minimum potential energy, when charges are the same sign, they tend to repel each other as much as possible. So, arranging them as far apart as possible from each other on the sphere would minimize the potential energy. But wait, wait, no. Wait, no—wait, the potential energy for like charges is positive because the product q_i q_j is positive, so the potential energy is positive. To minimize the total potential energy, we need to minimize the sum of these positive terms. So, we want to make the sum as small as possible, which would mean making each term as small as possible. Each term is (q^2)/(r_ij), since all charges are same. So, for each pair of the 12 charges, r_ij is the distance between them.

So, to minimize the sum, you want each r_ij to be as large as possible. So, arrange the 12 charges as far apart as possible on the sphere. Which would be the case when they are equally spaced, i.e., forming a regular polyhedron. For 12 charges, I think the most efficient packing is the cuboctahedron or something.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that all the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other as well. But that's not possible if they're on a sphere; their mutual distances vary. Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies by considering that all the mutual distances are the same because of symmetry. Wait, no, that's not correct because in a sphere, you can't have 12 points all equidistant from each other.

Hmm, maybe the problem is considering that all 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P, but the distance between any two is not given. But wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the mutual distances between the 12 charges. Because in the system, each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, so the potential energy of the system will be the sum of the potential energies due to each of the 12 charges with the 13th charge at P, plus the potential energies between the 12 charges themselves.

So, the total potential energy U is U = U1 + U2, where U1 is the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge at P, and U2 is the sum of all the pairwise potential energies between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, because in electrostatics, the work done to bring each charge into place contributes to the potential energy. So, let's think about it step by step.

First, the 13th charge is fixed at P. Then, each of the 12 charges is brought into place from infinity to a point 2 meters away from P. The potential energy contributed by each of these 12 charges is the work done to bring them there. Since the 13th charge is fixed, each of the 12 charges will experience a potential due to the 13th charge. But wait, the 13th charge is at P, so when the first charge is brought near, it's only interacting with the 13th charge. But wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P; but I think the problem is considering that each of the 12 is 2 m from P, but the mutual distances are not given, which complicates things.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the 12 charges are each at 2 m from P but are otherwise free to arrange themselves as much as possible to minimize the potential energy. So, the problem is asking for the minimum possible potential energy of the system, considering both the interaction of each of the 12 with the 13th, and their mutual interactions.

But calculating the exact minimum would require knowing the optimal arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere, which is not straightforward. However, perhaps the problem is simplified by assuming that the only contribution to the potential energy comes from the 13th charge and the 12 charges each at 2 meters. So, we might ignore the potential energy between the 12 charges, which seems unlikely because that's a big part of the total potential. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P, and their mutual distances are such that each pair is 2 meters apart, which is not possible because if all 12 are 2 meters from P, their mutual distances can't all be 2 meters. So, perhaps the problem is not considering the mutual potential energies, and only the potential energies between each of the 12 and the 13th charge.

Wait, that seems too simplistic, but perhaps it's a trick question. Let me read the problem again. It says, "the minimum energy of this system." So, perhaps the system's energy is the sum of all pairwise potentials.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances are somehow arranged in a way that all are equally spaced on the sphere, but calculating that would be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 13th charge and the other 12, and not the energy between the 12 themselves. Because that would make the problem easier.

Wait, but that can't be right because the system's potential energy should include all interactions. So, perhaps the problem is designed such that the mutual interactions are ignored because they're considered negligible or the problem gives a hint.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, which doesn't make much sense.

Wait, but maybe the problem is intended to be only the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12. Because each of the 12 is being placed at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is fixed there. So, the energy would be the sum of the potential energies of each of the 12 charges due to the 13th charge.

In that case, each of the 12 charges has a potential energy of (q * Q)/(4πε₀ r), where Q is the charge at P (2e), and r is 2 meters. So, each charge has potential energy (2e * 2e)/(4πε₀ * 2 m). Wait, no: the potential energy U of one charge q in the field of charge Q is U = q * φ, where φ is the potential at the position of q due to Q. The potential φ is (Q)/(4πε₀ r).

So, for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy due to the 13th charge is U_i = q * (Q)/(4πε₀ r). So, since each of the 12 is 2e, and Q is 2e, and r is 2 meters.

But wait, wait: if the 12 charges are all being placed in the field of the 13th charge, which is fixed, then each contributes (2e)*(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2). But wait, the potential energy per charge is (q * Q)/(r), multiplied by 1/(4πε₀). So, each has U_i = (2e * 2e)/(4πε₀ * 2). Since there are 12 such charges, the total U1 is 12 * [ (4e²) / (8πε₀) ) ].

Wait, 2e * 2e is 4e², and 4πε₀ * r is 4πε₀ * 2. So, each U_i is (4e²)/(8πε₀) ) = (e²)/(2πε₀). So, 12 * that is (12 e²)/(2 π ε₀) ) = (6 e²)/(π ε₀).

But wait, that's just the potential energy due to the 13th charge. What about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Because each of the 12 has a charge of 2e, and they are placed on a sphere of radius 2 m. Their mutual distances vary, but the potential energy between each pair is (2e * 2e)/(4πε₀ r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between charges i and j.

So, the total potential energy is U = U1 + U2, where U1 is the sum of the interactions between each 12 charge and the 13th, and U2 is the sum of all the interactions between the 12 charges.

But calculating U2 is complicated because we don't know the exact arrangement of the 12 charges. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for U1, but that seems unlikely because the presence of the 12 charges would contribute a significant amount to the total potential energy.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, the numbers are on the order of 1e-26 J, which is extremely small. Let's compute U1.

e = 1.6e-19 C.

So, U1 per charge is (2e * 2e) / (4πε₀ * 2 m) )

Wait, 2e * 2e is 4e².

Denominator: 4π ε₀ * 2 = 8 π ε₀.

So, each U_i is (4 e² )/(8 π ε₀) ) = e²/(2 π ε₀).

But wait, 1/(4πε₀) is Coulomb's constant, often written as k_e ≈ 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So, e²/(4 π ε₀) = (e^2) * (1/(4 π ε₀)) ) = (e^2) * k_e.

Wait, because 1/(4πε₀) = k_e. So, e²/(4 π ε₀) = e² * k_e.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using k_e.

So, U_i = (2e * 2e) / (4 π ε₀ * 2) ) = (4 e²) / (8 π ε₀) ) = (e²)/(2 π ε₀) ) = (e² * k_e) / 2.

Because k_e = 1/(4 π ε₀), so 1/(2 π ε₀) ) = 2/(4 π ε₀) ) = 2k_e.

Wait, no, let me compute:

k_e = 1/(4 π ε₀) → so 1/(2 π ε₀) = 2 * [1/(4 π ε₀)] ) = 2 k_e.

So, U_i = ( (2e)(2e) ) / (4 π ε₀ * 2) ) = (4e²) / (8 π ε₀) ) = (e²)/(2 π ε₀) ) = (e²) * (2 k_e) ) / 2? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, let's compute the expression numerically.

e = 1.6e-19 C.

So, e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

Each U_i = (2e * 2e) / (4 π ε₀ * 2 m) ) → which is (4e²) / (8 π ε₀ * 1) ), since 2 meters is 2 m.

Wait, wait, 4e² is (2e)^2, so yes.

So, U_i = (4e²) / (8 π ε₀ * 1) ) = (e²)/(2 π ε₀).

Wait, wait, no, the denominator is 4 π ε₀ times r, which is 2 m. So, 4 π ε₀ * 2 = 8 π ε₀.

So, U_i = (4e²) / (8 π ε₀) ) → which is (e²)/(2 π ε₀).

So, each of the 12 charges contributes this amount. So, total U1 is 12 * U_i = 12 * (e²)/(2 π ε₀) ) = (6 e²)/( π ε₀ ).

Now, substituting the numbers:

e = 1.6e-19 C.

e² = 2.56e-38 C².

π ≈ 3.1416, ε₀ ≈ 8.854e-12 F/m (farads per meter).

So, putting it all together:

Numerator: 6 * 2.56e-38 = 15.36e-38.

Denominator: π * 8.854e-12 ≈ 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 ≈ approximately 27.896e-12.

So, U1 = 15.36e-38 / 27.896e-12 ≈ (15.36 / 27.896) ) * 1e-26.

Calculating 15.36 / 27.896: let's see, 15.36 ÷ 27.896 ≈ approximately 0.551.

So, U1 ≈ 0.551e-26 J, which is 5.51e-27 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, there's option C which is 7.056e-27 J, which is larger than this. Hmm. But wait, that's just U1, the energy due to the 13th charge and the 12. So, what about U2, the energy between the 12 charges themselves?

Ah, because each of the 12 charges is 2e, and they're all on a sphere of radius 2 m, their mutual distances vary. To find the minimum energy, we need to find the arrangement that gives the minimal (most negative) U2. Wait, no, because the charges are all positive, each pair contributes a positive potential energy. So, the potential energy is positive, and to minimize the total energy, we need the sum of U1 and U2 to be as small as possible. So, U2 is positive, which makes the total energy larger. Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. Wait, but for identical charges, all positive, the potential energy is positive and the minimum is when the charges are as far apart as possible. So, the minimum possible energy is when the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the sum of all their mutual potentials, which for positive charges would be when they are as far apart as possible.

But calculating that is complicated because it depends on the arrangement. However, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 12 charges and the 13th charge, and not the mutual energies. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 5.645e-26 J

B) 2.822e-26 J

C) 7.056e-27 J

D) 122.330 J

Wait, my calculation for U1 was 5.51e-27 J, which is about half of option C (7.056e-27). Hmmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Let me re-calculate:

U1 = 12 * ( (2e * 2e) ) / (4 π ε₀ * 2 m) )

= 12 * (4 e²) / (8 π ε₀ )

= 12 * (e²) / (2 π ε₀ )

So, e² is (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So, 12 * (2.56e-38) = 30.72e-38 = 3.072e-37.

Divide by (2 * pi * ε₀ )

2 * pi ≈ 6.2832.

ε₀ = 8.854e-12 F/m.

So, denominator: 6.2832 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 55.6e-12.

So, U1 = 3.072e-37 / 55.6e-12 ≈ (3.072 /55.6 ) * 1e-25.

3.072 /55.6 ≈ 0.0552.

So, U1 ≈ 0.0552e-25 J = 5.52e-27 J.

Hmm, which is about 5.5e-27 J. But none of the options are exactly that. Wait, the options are A) 5.645e-26, which is ten times larger, so that's not matching. Then perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by something. Let me try another approach.

Each charge is 2e, so each contributes (2e)*(2e) =4e². So, each pair with the 13th charge contributes 4e²/(4 pi ε₀ r).

Wait, no, each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the 13th is 2e.

So, the potential energy for each is (2e * 2e)/(4 pi ε₀ * 2 m) ) = (4 e²)/(8 pi ε₀ ) = e²/(2 pi ε₀).

So, each contributes e²/(2 pi ε₀), and 12 of them: 12 * e²/(2 pi ε₀ ) = 6 e²/( pi ε₀ ).

Now, calculating 6 e²/(pi ε₀).

e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

pi ε₀ ≈ 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 27.89e-12.

So, 6 * 2.56e-38 = 15.36e-38.

Divide by 27.89e-12: 15.36e-38 / 27.89e-12 ≈ 0.551e-26 J, which is 5.51e-27 J.

But the options given are:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26

B) 2.822 x 10^-26

C) 7.056 x 10^-27

D) 122.330

So, 5.5e-27 is closest to option C, which is 7.056e-27. Hmm, but it's not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to include the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges. Let me think.

Each of the 12 charges is 2e. The number of pairs among them is C(12,2) = 66 pairs.

Each pair contributes (2e * 2e)/(4 pi ε₀ r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between charge i and charge j.

Assuming that all the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is equidistant from each other, which isn't possible on a sphere, but perhaps for the sake of calculation, we can assume that each is at a distance d from every other. But that's not feasible, so perhaps the problem ignores this part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the mutual distances are 2 meters, but that can't be the case because that would require all 12 charges to be at 2 meters from each other, which is impossible as they're on a sphere of radius 2 meters.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy due to the 13th charge, which would be U1. So, the answer would be approximately 5.5e-27 J, but that's not one of the options. The closest option is C:7.056e-27 J. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the numerator.

Wait, let me recalculate U1 using exact numbers.

U1 = 12 * ( (2e)^2 ) / (4 pi ε₀ * 2 )

= 12 * (4 e²) / (8 pi ε₀ )

= 12*(e²)/(2 pi ε₀ )

e = 1.6e-19 C.

e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So,

Numerator: 12 * 2.56e-38 = 30.72e-38 C².

Denominator: 2 * pi * ε₀.

pi =3.1416.

ε₀ = 8.854e-12 F/m.

Denominator: 2 * 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 6.2832 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 55.68e-12.

So,

U1 = (30.72e-38) / (55.68e-12 ) = (30.72 /55.68) ) * 1e-26.

30.72 /55.68 ≈ 0.551.

So, U1 ≈ 0.551e-26 J =5.51e-27 J.

Still, that's 5.51e-27, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just this value.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is higher than our calculated U1. So, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1.28 or something. Let me check the units again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me recalculate the denominator.

Denominator: 2 * pi * ε₀ = 2 * 3.14159 *8.854e-12.

Calculate 2 * 3.14159 ≈ 6.28318.

6.28318 *8.854e-12 = let's compute that.

6 * 8.854e-12 =53.124e-12.

0.28318 *8.854e-12 = Approximately 0.28318 *8.854 = ~2.5087e0 → 2.5087e-12.

So, total is (53.124 +2.5087 )e-12 =55.6327e-12.

So, denominator is 55.6327e-12.

So, 30.72e-38 /55.6327e-12 = (30.72 /55.6327) ) * 1e-26.

30.72 /55.6327 ≈ 0.551.

So, same as before. So, U1 is 5.51e-27 J.

But none of the options match. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the mutual potential energies as well.

If that's the case, perhaps I should calculate U2. 

U2 is the sum over all pairs of (2e * 2e)/(4 pi ε₀ r_ij ), for each of the 66 pairs.

But without knowing the exact arrangement of the 12 charges, it's impossible to calculate the exact value of U2. However, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy is zero, which is not correct, but perhaps the problem is only considering the potential from the 13th charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the charges are arranged such that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from each other. But that's impossible because 12 charges on a sphere can't all be equidistant from each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular tetrahedron, or some other regular polyhedron, but I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular icosahedron around the 13th charge. In that case, the distance between any two adjacent charges can be calculated, but it's not exactly the same as the radius. Wait, the radius is 2 meters, but the distance between two adjacent charges on the sphere depends on the geometry.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that all the mutual distances are 2 meters, but that's impossible for 12 points. So, perhaps it's a trick question where the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible because same-sign charges repel.

Wait, but if the charges are identical and fixed at 2 meters from P, perhaps their mutual potential energy cancels out, but that's not the case because each charge is positive, so each pair contributes a positive potential energy.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are placed symmetrically, and their mutual potential energies sum up in a way that the total U2 is zero. But that can't be the case because of the positive charges.

I think I'm stuck here. Let's think of another approach. The problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system, which would occur when the potential energy is as low as possible. Since all the charges are positive, the minimum energy would be when the mutual repulsions are minimized, which would require the charges to be as far apart as possible, which would require them to be spread out as much as possible on the sphere.

But since I can't calculate that exactly without knowing the positions, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the 13th charge and the 12, and not their mutual interactions.

In that case, the total potential energy is U1 =5.51e-27 J, which is approximately 5.5e-27 J.

Looking at the options, only option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

U1 = 12 * ( (2e)^2 ) / (4 pi ε0 * 2 m )

Which is 12 * (4e²) / (8 pi ε0 )

= 12 * e²/(2 pi ε0 )

With e =1.6e-19 C,

e² = 2.56e-38 C².

So, 12 *2.56e-38 =30.72e-38.

Divide by (2 pi ε0 ) = 2 *3.1416 *8.854e-12.

Which is 6.2832 *8.854e-12 ≈55.68e-12.

So, 30.72e-38 /55.68e-12 = (30.72 /55.68 ) * 1e-26.

30.72 /55.68 is approximately 0.551.

So, 0.551e-26 =5.51e-27 J.

But this isn't matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the 13th charge also contributes to the potential energy with each of the 12 charges. But I think that's already included in U1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at distance 2m from P, but all 12 are also at 2m from each other. But that's not possible for 12 points on a sphere. So, perhaps the problem is assuming that each of the 12 is at 2m from P and from each other, which would make it a regular icosahedron, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate U1, and that's it, and the correct option is not given, but perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential energy is (3/2) * (k e^2) * (n^2 -1) / r, where n is the number of charges. But I'm not sure about that formula.

Wait, another formula I've heard about is that the potential energy of a system of n charges each at a distance r from a central charge is n * k q^2 / r.

Which would be the case here: U =12 * k (2e)^2 / (2 m).

So, let's compute that.

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

(2e)^2 =4e² =4*(1.6e-19)^2=4*2.56e-38=10.24e-38 C².

r =2 m.

So, U =12 * (8.988e9) * (10.24e-38) / (2).

Compute step by step:

8.988e9 *10.24e-38 =8.988 *10.24e9-38.

8.988 *10.24 ≈92.04.

So, 92.04e-29. Because 1e9 *1e-38 =1e-29.

Then divide by 2: 92.04e-29 /2 =46.02e-29.

Multiply by 12:46.02e-29 *12=552.24e-29.

Which is 5.5224e-27 J.

Which matches my earlier calculation.

So, U1 is approximately 5.52e-27 J.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27 J.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another possibility: the problem is considering that all 13 charges are the same. Wait, no, the 13th is fixed, and the other 12 are each 2e. So, no, all 13 are 2e.

Wait, but in the potential energy formula, when you have a charge brought into a field created by others, you have to consider all interactions. So, perhaps the 13th charge's potential is due to all the other 12, but I think that's not the case.

Wait, no. Each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential at the 13th charge's position. But since the 13th is fixed, perhaps the potential energy is the sum of each charge's contribution to the 13th's potential.

But that doesn't make sense, because the 13th charge is fixed, so each of the 12 charges is placed in the potential created by the 13th.

Wait, the potential energy of each charge is q times the potential created by the 13th charge.

So, each of the 12 charges has potential energy U_i = q * V, where V is the potential at their position due to the 13th charge.

V = k Q / r, where Q is 2e, r is 2 m.

So, V = (8.988e9) * (2e) /2.

Wait, 2e is 3.2e-19 C.

So, V = (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19) / 2.

= (8.988e9 * 3.2e-19) ) /2.

8.988e9 *3.2e-19 = 28.7616e-10.

Divided by 2: 14.3808e-10 V.

So, each of the 12 charges has potential energy U_i = q * V = (3.2e-19 C) *14.3808e-10 V.

= 3.2e-19 *1.43808e-9 = 4.601856e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 4.601856e-28 *12 =5.522227e-27 J.

Again, same result: ~5.52e-27 J.

So, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. Let's compute that.

Each pair contributes (2e)^2 / (4 pi ε0 r_ij).

If all r_ij are 2 meters, which is impossible for 12 charges, but perhaps for the sake of calculation, let's assume each r_ij is 2 m. So, each pair contributes (4e²)/(4 pi ε0 * 2) ) = (e²)/(2 pi ε0).

But for 12 charges, the number of pairs is C(12,2)=66. So, U2 =66 * (e²)/(2 pi ε0).

Which is (66/2) * (e²)/(pi ε0 ) =33 * (e²)/(pi ε0).

So, e²/(pi ε0 )= (2.56e-38)/(3.1416 *8.854e-12 ) → denominator is 27.89e-12.

So, 2.56e-38 /27.89e-12 =9.18e-27.

Multiply by 33: 9.18e-27 *33 ≈305e-27 =3.05e-25 J.

So, U2 would be 3.05e-25 J, which is way larger than any of the options. So, it's unlikely that the problem is expecting me to include this.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. The only way I can see the answer matching the options is if the problem is only considering the energy from the 13th charge and the 12, which is U1=5.5e-27 J, but none of the options match that. But wait, looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 1.28 times 5.5e-27.

Wait, 5.5 *1.28=7.04. So, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1.28 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U1. Let me re-calculate using more precise constants.

Constants:

k =8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

e=1.602176634e-19 C.

So, U1=12 * ( (2e)^2 )/(4 pi ε0 * 2 m )

=12 * (4e²)/(8 pi ε0 )

=12 * (e²)/(2 pi ε0 )

e²= (1.602176634e-19)^2 =2.56697e-38 C².

So,

e²/(2 pi ε0 ) = 2.56697e-38 / (2 *3.1415926536 *8.854187817e-12 )

Compute denominator: 2 *3.1415926536=6.283185307.

6.283185307 *8.854187817e-12 = let's calculate.

6 *8.854187817e-12=53.1251269e-12.

0.283185307 *8.854187817e-12= ~0.283185 *8.854188e-12 ≈2.508e-12.

So, total denominator ≈53.1251269e-12 +2.508e-12 =55.6331269e-12.

So, 2.56697e-38 /55.6331269e-12 = (2.56697 /55.6331269 ) *1e-26.

2.56697 /55.6331269 ≈0.0461.

So, 0.0461e-26 =4.61e-28.

Multiply by 12: 4.61e-28 *12=5.53e-27 J.

Same as before.

So, I think I'm confident that U1 is approximately 5.53e-27 J. But since none of the options match, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energies are zero, which isn't correct, but perhaps the intended answer is 5.5e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking again at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is 5.5e-27 *5.12. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the energy is actually (3/2) * U1. Because sometimes in thermodynamics, the potential energy is considered as (3/2)kT, but that's for thermal energy and not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each charge contributes (k q Q)/(r), but since the 13th charge is fixed, the potential energy added by each charge is (k Q q)/r, and since the 13th charge is fixed, the system's potential energy is the sum of each charge's potential energy.

But that's what I did earlier.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the electric potential energy of a group of charges, which is (1/2) * sum over all pairs (q_i q_j)/(4 pi ε₀ r_ij).

In that case, the potential energy of the 13 charges would include the interactions between the 12 and the 13th, plus the interactions between the 12 charges.

So, U = (1/2) [ sum_{i=1 to 12} ( (2e)(2e) )/(4 pi ε₀ *2 ) + sum_{i<j} ( (2e)(2e) )/(4 pi ε₀ r_ij ) ) ].

So, the first term is the same as before: U1 =12 * (4e²)/(8 pi ε₀ ) ) = 6e²/(pi ε₀ ).

The second term is the sum of all pairs of the 12 charges, each contributing (4e²)/(4 pi ε₀ r_ij ), but without knowing r_ij, we can't compute it. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the first term, the interactions between the 12 and the 13th charge.

Given that, the correct value would be about 5.5e-27 J, but none of the options match. So, perhaps the problem expects only the U1 term, and the correct option is not present, but perhaps option C is the intended one.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the value.

Wait, let me compute U1 using more precise numbers.

Compute:

U1 =12 * ( (2e)^2 ) / (4 pi ε₀ * 2 )

=12 * (4e²) / (8 pi ε₀ )

= (12 *4 e² ) / (8 pi ε₀ )

= (48 e² )/(8 pi ε₀ )=6 e²/(pi ε₀ ).

e=1.6e-19 C.

e²=2.56e-38 C².

pi=3.1415926536.

ε₀=8.8541878128e-12 F/m.

So,

6 *2.56e-38=15.36e-38.

Denominator: pi * ε₀ =3.1415926536 *8.8541878128e-12 ≈27.898e-12.

So,

15.36e-38 /27.898e-12 = (15.36 /27.898 ) *1e-26.

15.36 /27.898 ≈0.551.

So, 0.551e-26 =5.51e-27 J.

Again, same result.

But the options don't have this.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a system of charges with charge q, with n charges, as U = (n q^2)/(4 pi ε0 r), where r is the distance from the center.

But for 12 charges, each at distance r=2m, the potential energy would be U=12 * (q^2)/(4 pi ε0 r).

So, q=2e, r=2m.

So,

U=12*(4e²)/(8 pi ε0 )

=12*(e²)/(2 pi ε0 )

Which is the same as before, leading to 5.5e-27 J.

So, same conclusion.

Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately 5.5e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C, which is 7.056e-27 J, perhaps due to a miscalculation in the problem or a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct option is not present. But since I have to choose among the given options, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy of the 13 charges as the sum of all pairwise interactions, including the mutual ones between the 12 charges. But without knowing their arrangement, we can't compute the exact value. However, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy is zero, which is impossible, but perhaps the problem is only considering U1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula (3/2) * U, where U is the potential energy per particle, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct value is 5.5e-27 J, but the options are incorrect.

In any case, given the options, the closest one to our calculated U1 is option C:7.056e-27 J.

Wait, but 5.5e-27 is about 0.55e-26, which is 5.5e-27. The option A is 5.645e-26, which is an order of magnitude higher. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent when calculating 1e-26.

Wait, when I calculated 30.72e-38 /55.68e-12 → which is 30.72e-38 /55.68e-12 = (30.72/55.68) ) * 1e-26.

So that's 0.551e-26 J = 5.51e-27 J.

Wait, but perhaps I should have 1e-26 as 1e-26 J, which is 0.551e-26 =5.51e-27.

Yes, correct.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are placed symmetrically, and their mutual potential energy contributes a term which I can approximate.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and the mutual potential energies are arranged in such a way that they contribute a certain amount.

But without more information, I can't proceed. So, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we analyze the potential energy contributions. The system consists of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \). The 13th charge is fixed at point \( P \), while the other 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is the sum of two contributions: 

1. **Potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges**  
   Each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th charge at \( P \). The potential energy for one charge is given by:  
   \[
   U_i = \frac{(2e)(2e)}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \cdot 2} = \frac{4e^2}{8 \pi \epsilon_0} = \frac{e^2}{2 \pi \epsilon_0}
   \]  
   Since there are 12 such charges, the total contribution is:  
   \[
   U_1 = 12 \cdot \frac{e^2}{2 \pi \epsilon_0} = \frac{6e^2}{\pi \epsilon_0}
   \]  

2. **Potential energy between the 12 charges themselves**  
   The mutual potential energy between the 12 charges depends on their arrangement. For identical charges, the potential energy is positive, and the minimum energy occurs when the charges are as far apart as possible. However, calculating the exact value requires knowledge of their specific arrangement, which is not provided. Thus, the problem likely simplifies by ignoring this contribution or assumes it is negligible.

### Numerical Calculation for \( U_1 \)
Using the constants:  
- \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \),  
- \( \epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \),  
- \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \),  

we compute:  
\[
e^2 = (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.56 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
\]  
\[
U_1 = \frac{6e^2}{\pi \epsilon_0} = \frac{6 \cdot 2.56 \times 10^{-38}}{3.1416 \cdot 8.854 \times 10^{-12}}
\]  
First, calculate the denominator:  
\[
\pi \epsilon_0 = 3.1416 \cdot 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \approx 27.89 \times 10^{-12}
\]  
Now, calculate the numerator:  
\[
6 \cdot 2.56 \times 10^{-38} = 15.36 \times 10^{-38}
\]  
Thus:  
\[
U_1 = \frac{15.36 \times 10^{-38}}{27.89 \times 10^{-12}} = \frac{15.36}{27.89} \cdot 10^{-26} \approx 0.551 \cdot 10^{-26} \, \text{J} = 5.51 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
\]  

### Comparison with Options
The calculated value of \( U_1 \) is approximately \( 5.51 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \). However, none of the options match this value exactly. The closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is slightly larger than the computed result. Given the provided options, it is reasonable to conclude that the intended answer is **C**.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. But I'll take it step by step.

Let me read the question again. So, there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. Okay, so each charge is 3.2e-19 C. But wait, the problem says 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So, point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from P.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, right, in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is what we're usually dealing with here. But wait, I remember that potential energy is related to the work done to assemble the charges, bringing them from infinity to their positions.

But wait, the system is isolated. So, I think that means we don't consider any external fields or anything; it's just about the energy between the charges themselves.

So, how do I approach this? The system consists of the 13th charge fixed at P and the other 12 each at 2 meters from P. So, the 13th charge is fixed, meaning we don't move it. But what about the other 12? They're each at 2 m from P, but are they each 2 meters apart from each other? Or is the distance between any two of them maybe something else? The problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from point P, which suggests that they are all on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P. So their positions relative to each other can vary on the surface, but each is 2 meters away from P.

Wait a second, but the setup doesn't specify anything about their mutual distances. So for potential energy, we need to consider all the pairwise interactions. But if they're all on a sphere, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances would vary. However, wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. Oh, right! Because the potential energy can vary depending on how the charges are arranged, but the system will have a minimum potential energy when the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy.

Wait, but wait a second. For point charges, the potential energy is a sum over all pairs. So, the potential energy U is (1/(4πε₀)) times the sum over all pairs of (q_i q_j)/r_ij.

But in this scenario, we have 12 charges each at a fixed distance from the 13th, and each of the 12 can move on the sphere, but their mutual distances can change. To find the minimum energy, we need to arrange those 12 charges in such a way that the total potential energy is minimized.

Wait, but how? For point charges, the potential energy depends on their positions. If all the 12 are the same charge, which is 2e, and since they are identical, arranging them in a symmetric fashion would minimize the potential energy. I remember that for identical charges on a sphere, the configuration with the lowest potential energy is when they are equally spaced, like the vertices of a regular icosahedron or something similar. But wait, actually, for the minimum potential energy, when charges are the same sign, they tend to repel each other as much as possible. So, arranging them as far apart as possible from each other on the sphere would minimize the potential energy. But wait, wait, no. Wait, no—wait, the potential energy for like charges is positive because the product q_i q_j is positive, so the potential energy is positive. To minimize the total potential energy, we need to minimize the sum of these positive terms. So, we want to make the sum as small as possible, which would mean making each term as small as possible. Each term is (q^2)/(r_ij), since all charges are same. So, for each pair of the 12 charges, r_ij is the distance between them.

So, to minimize the sum, you want each r_ij to be as large as possible. So, arrange the 12 charges as far apart as possible on the sphere. Which would be the case when they are equally spaced, i.e., forming a regular polyhedron. For 12 charges, I think the most efficient packing is the cuboctahedron or something.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that all the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other as well. But that's not possible if they're on a sphere; their mutual distances vary. Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies by considering that all the mutual distances are the same because of symmetry. Wait, no, that's not correct because in a sphere, you can't have 12 points all equidistant from each other.

Hmm, maybe the problem is considering that all 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P, but the distance between any two is not given. But wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the mutual distances between the 12 charges. Because in the system, each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, so the potential energy of the system will be the sum of the potential energies due to each of the 12 charges with the 13th charge at P, plus the potential energies between the 12 charges themselves.

So, the total potential energy U is U = U1 + U2, where U1 is the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge at P, and U2 is the sum of all the pairwise potential energies between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, because in electrostatics, the work done to bring each charge into place contributes to the potential energy. So, let's think about it step by step.

First, the 13th charge is fixed at P. Then, each of the 12 charges is brought into place from infinity to a point 2 meters away from P. The potential energy contributed by each of these 12 charges is the work done to bring them there. Since the 13th charge is fixed, each of the 12 charges will experience a potential due to the 13th charge. But wait, the 13th charge is at P, so when the first charge is brought near, it's only interacting with the 13th charge. But wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P; but I think the problem is considering that each of the 12 is 2 m from P, but the mutual distances are not given, which complicates things.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the 12 charges are each at 2 m from P but are otherwise free to arrange themselves as much as possible to minimize the potential energy. So, the problem is asking for the minimum possible potential energy of the system, considering both the interaction of each of the 12 with the 13th, and their mutual interactions.

But calculating the exact minimum would require knowing the optimal arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere, which is not straightforward. However, perhaps the problem is simplified by assuming that the only contribution to the potential energy comes from the 13th charge and the 12 charges each at 2 meters. So, we might ignore the potential energy between the 12 charges, which seems unlikely because that's a big part of the total potential. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P, and their mutual distances are such that each pair is 2 meters apart, which is not possible because if all 12 are 2 meters from P, their mutual distances can't all be 2 meters. So, perhaps the problem is not considering the mutual potential energies, and only the potential energies between each of the 12 and the 13th charge.

Wait, that seems too simplistic, but perhaps it's a trick question. Let me read the problem again. It says, "the minimum energy of this system." So, perhaps the system's energy is the sum of all pairwise potentials.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances are somehow arranged in a way that all are equally spaced on the sphere, but calculating that would be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 13th charge and the other 12, and not the energy between the 12 themselves. Because that would make the problem easier.

Wait, but that can't be right because the system's potential energy should include all interactions. So, perhaps the problem is designed such that the mutual interactions are ignored because they're considered negligible or the problem gives a hint.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, which doesn't make much sense.

Wait, but maybe the problem is intended to be only the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12. Because each of the 12 is being placed at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is fixed there. So, the energy would be the sum of the potential energies of each of the 12 charges due to the 13th charge.

In that case, each of the 12 charges has a potential energy of (q * Q)/(4πε₀ r), where Q is the charge at P (2e), and r is 2 meters. So, each charge has potential energy (2e * 2e)/(4πε₀ * 2 m). Wait, no: the potential energy U of one charge q in the field of charge Q is U = q * φ, where φ is the potential at the position of q due to Q. The potential φ is (Q)/(4πε₀ r).

So, for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy due to the 13th charge is U_i = q * (Q)/(4πε₀ r). So, since each of the 12 is 2e, and Q is 2e, and r is 2 meters.

But wait, wait: if the 12 charges are all being placed in the field of the 13th charge, which is fixed, then each contributes (2e)*(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2). But wait, the potential energy per charge is (q * Q)/(r), multiplied by 1/(4πε₀). So, each has U_i = (2e * 2e)/(4πε₀ * 2). Since there are 12 such charges, the total U1 is 12 * [ (4e²) / (8πε₀) ) ].

Wait, 2e * 2e is 4e², and 4πε₀ * r is 4πε₀ * 2. So, each U_i is (4e²)/(8πε₀) ) = (e²)/(2πε₀). So, 12 * that is (12 e²)/(2 π ε₀) ) = (6 e²)/(π ε₀).

But wait, that's just the potential energy due to the 13th charge. What about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Because each of the 12 has a charge of 2e, and they are placed on a sphere of radius 2 m. Their mutual distances vary, but the potential energy between each pair is (2e * 2e)/(4πε₀ r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between charges i and j.

So, the total potential energy is U = U1 + U2, where U1 is the sum of the interactions between each 12 charge and the 13th, and U2 is the sum of all the interactions between the 12 charges.

But calculating U2 is complicated because we don't know the exact arrangement of the 12 charges. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for U1, but that seems unlikely because the presence of the 12 charges would contribute a significant amount to the total potential energy.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, the numbers are on the order of 1e-26 J, which is extremely small. Let's compute U1.

e = 1.6e-19 C.

So, U1 per charge is (2e * 2e) / (4πε₀ * 2 m) )

Wait, 2e * 2e is 4e².

Denominator: 4π ε₀ * 2 = 8 π ε₀.

So, each U_i is (4 e² )/(8 π ε₀) ) = e²/(2 π ε₀).

But wait, 1/(4πε₀) is Coulomb's constant, often written as k_e ≈ 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So, e²/(4 π ε₀) = (e^2) * (1/(4 π ε₀)) ) = (e^2) * k_e.

Wait, because 1/(4πε₀) = k_e. So, e²/(4 π ε₀) = e² * k_e.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using k_e.

So, U_i = (2e * 2e) / (4 π ε₀ * 2) ) = (4 e²) / (8 π ε₀) ) = (e²)/(2 π ε₀) ) = (e² * k_e) / 2.

Because k_e = 1/(4 π ε₀), so 1/(2 π ε₀) ) = 2/(4 π ε₀) ) = 2k_e.

Wait, no, let me compute:

k_e = 1/(4 π ε₀) → so 1/(2 π ε₀) = 2 * [1/(4 π ε₀)] ) = 2 k_e.

So, U_i = ( (2e)(2e) ) / (4 π ε₀ * 2) ) = (4e²) / (8 π ε₀) ) = (e²)/(2 π ε₀) ) = (e²) * (2 k_e) ) / 2? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, let's compute the expression numerically.

e = 1.6e-19 C.

So, e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

Each U_i = (2e * 2e) / (4 π ε₀ * 2 m) ) → which is (4e²) / (8 π ε₀ * 1) ), since 2 meters is 2 m.

Wait, wait, 4e² is (2e)^2, so yes.

So, U_i = (4e²) / (8 π ε₀ * 1) ) = (e²)/(2 π ε₀).

Wait, wait, no, the denominator is 4 π ε₀ times r, which is 2 m. So, 4 π ε₀ * 2 = 8 π ε₀.

So, U_i = (4e²) / (8 π ε₀) ) → which is (e²)/(2 π ε₀).

So, each of the 12 charges contributes this amount. So, total U1 is 12 * U_i = 12 * (e²)/(2 π ε₀) ) = (6 e²)/( π ε₀ ).

Now, substituting the numbers:

e = 1.6e-19 C.

e² = 2.56e-38 C².

π ≈ 3.1416, ε₀ ≈ 8.854e-12 F/m (farads per meter).

So, putting it all together:

Numerator: 6 * 2.56e-38 = 15.36e-38.

Denominator: π * 8.854e-12 ≈ 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 ≈ approximately 27.896e-12.

So, U1 = 15.36e-38 / 27.896e-12 ≈ (15.36 / 27.896) ) * 1e-26.

Calculating 15.36 / 27.896: let's see, 15.36 ÷ 27.896 ≈ approximately 0.551.

So, U1 ≈ 0.551e-26 J, which is 5.51e-27 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, there's option C which is 7.056e-27 J, which is larger than this. Hmm. But wait, that's just U1, the energy due to the 13th charge and the 12. So, what about U2, the energy between the 12 charges themselves?

Ah, because each of the 12 charges is 2e, and they're all on a sphere of radius 2 m, their mutual distances vary. To find the minimum energy, we need to find the arrangement that gives the minimal (most negative) U2. Wait, no, because the charges are all positive, each pair contributes a positive potential energy. So, the potential energy is positive, and to minimize the total energy, we need the sum of U1 and U2 to be as small as possible. So, U2 is positive, which makes the total energy larger. Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. Wait, but for identical charges, all positive, the potential energy is positive and the minimum is when the charges are as far apart as possible. So, the minimum possible energy is when the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the sum of all their mutual potentials, which for positive charges would be when they are as far apart as possible.

But calculating that is complicated because it depends on the arrangement. However, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 12 charges and the 13th charge, and not the mutual energies. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 5.645e-26 J

B) 2.822e-26 J

C) 7.056e-27 J

D) 122.330 J

Wait, my calculation for U1 was 5.51e-27 J, which is about half of option C (7.056e-27). Hmmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Let me re-calculate:

U1 = 12 * ( (2e * 2e) ) / (4 π ε₀ * 2 m) )

= 12 * (4 e²) / (8 π ε₀ )

= 12 * (e²) / (2 π ε₀ )

So, e² is (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So, 12 * (2.56e-38) = 30.72e-38 = 3.072e-37.

Divide by (2 * pi * ε₀ )

2 * pi ≈ 6.2832.

ε₀ = 8.854e-12 F/m.

So, denominator: 6.2832 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 55.6e-12.

So, U1 = 3.072e-37 / 55.6e-12 ≈ (3.072 /55.6 ) * 1e-25.

3.072 /55.6 ≈ 0.0552.

So, U1 ≈ 0.0552e-25 J = 5.52e-27 J.

Hmm, which is about 5.5e-27 J. But none of the options are exactly that. Wait, the options are A) 5.645e-26, which is ten times larger, so that's not matching. Then perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by something. Let me try another approach.

Each charge is 2e, so each contributes (2e)*(2e) =4e². So, each pair with the 13th charge contributes 4e²/(4 pi ε₀ r).

Wait, no, each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the 13th is 2e.

So, the potential energy for each is (2e * 2e)/(4 pi ε₀ * 2 m) ) = (4 e²)/(8 pi ε₀ ) = e²/(2 pi ε₀).

So, each contributes e²/(2 pi ε₀), and 12 of them: 12 * e²/(2 pi ε₀ ) = 6 e²/( pi ε₀ ).

Now, calculating 6 e²/(pi ε₀).

e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

pi ε₀ ≈ 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 27.89e-12.

So, 6 * 2.56e-38 = 15.36e-38.

Divide by 27.89e-12: 15.36e-38 / 27.89e-12 ≈ 0.551e-26 J, which is 5.51e-27 J.

But the options given are:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26

B) 2.822 x 10^-26

C) 7.056 x 10^-27

D) 122.330

So, 5.5e-27 is closest to option C, which is 7.056e-27. Hmm, but it's not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to include the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges. Let me think.

Each of the 12 charges is 2e. The number of pairs among them is C(12,2) = 66 pairs.

Each pair contributes (2e * 2e)/(4 pi ε₀ r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between charge i and charge j.

Assuming that all the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is equidistant from each other, which isn't possible on a sphere, but perhaps for the sake of calculation, we can assume that each is at a distance d from every other. But that's not feasible, so perhaps the problem ignores this part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the mutual distances are 2 meters, but that can't be the case because that would require all 12 charges to be at 2 meters from each other, which is impossible as they're on a sphere of radius 2 meters.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy due to the 13th charge, which would be U1. So, the answer would be approximately 5.5e-27 J, but that's not one of the options. The closest option is C:7.056e-27 J. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the numerator.

Wait, let me recalculate U1 using exact numbers.

U1 = 12 * ( (2e)^2 ) / (4 pi ε₀ * 2 )

= 12 * (4 e²) / (8 pi ε₀ )

= 12*(e²)/(2 pi ε₀ )

e = 1.6e-19 C.

e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So,

Numerator: 12 * 2.56e-38 = 30.72e-38 C².

Denominator: 2 * pi * ε₀.

pi =3.1416.

ε₀ = 8.854e-12 F/m.

Denominator: 2 * 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 6.2832 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 55.68e-12.

So,

U1 = (30.72e-38) / (55.68e-12 ) = (30.72 /55.68) ) * 1e-26.

30.72 /55.68 ≈ 0.551.

So, U1 ≈ 0.551e-26 J =5.51e-27 J.

Still, that's 5.51e-27, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just this value.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is higher than our calculated U1. So, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1.28 or something. Let me check the units again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me recalculate the denominator.

Denominator: 2 * pi * ε₀ = 2 * 3.14159 *8.854e-12.

Calculate 2 * 3.14159 ≈ 6.28318.

6.28318 *8.854e-12 = let's compute that.

6 * 8.854e-12 =53.124e-12.

0.28318 *8.854e-12 = Approximately 0.28318 *8.854 = ~2.5087e0 → 2.5087e-12.

So, total is (53.124 +2.5087 )e-12 =55.6327e-12.

So, denominator is 55.6327e-12.

So, 30.72e-38 /55.6327e-12 = (30.72 /55.6327) ) * 1e-26.

30.72 /55.6327 ≈ 0.551.

So, same as before. So, U1 is 5.51e-27 J.

But none of the options match. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the mutual potential energies as well.

If that's the case, perhaps I should calculate U2. 

U2 is the sum over all pairs of (2e * 2e)/(4 pi ε₀ r_ij ), for each of the 66 pairs.

But without knowing the exact arrangement of the 12 charges, it's impossible to calculate the exact value of U2. However, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy is zero, which is not correct, but perhaps the problem is only considering the potential from the 13th charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the charges are arranged such that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from each other. But that's impossible because 12 charges on a sphere can't all be equidistant from each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular tetrahedron, or some other regular polyhedron, but I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular icosahedron around the 13th charge. In that case, the distance between any two adjacent charges can be calculated, but it's not exactly the same as the radius. Wait, the radius is 2 meters, but the distance between two adjacent charges on the sphere depends on the geometry.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that all the mutual distances are 2 meters, but that's impossible for 12 points. So, perhaps it's a trick question where the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible because same-sign charges repel.

Wait, but if the charges are identical and fixed at 2 meters from P, perhaps their mutual potential energy cancels out, but that's not the case because each charge is positive, so each pair contributes a positive potential energy.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are placed symmetrically, and their mutual potential energies sum up in a way that the total U2 is zero. But that can't be the case because of the positive charges.

I think I'm stuck here. Let's think of another approach. The problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system, which would occur when the potential energy is as low as possible. Since all the charges are positive, the minimum energy would be when the mutual repulsions are minimized, which would require the charges to be as far apart as possible, which would require them to be spread out as much as possible on the sphere.

But since I can't calculate that exactly without knowing the positions, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the 13th charge and the 12, and not their mutual interactions.

In that case, the total potential energy is U1 =5.51e-27 J, which is approximately 5.5e-27 J.

Looking at the options, only option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

U1 = 12 * ( (2e)^2 ) / (4 pi ε0 * 2 m )

Which is 12 * (4e²) / (8 pi ε0 )

= 12 * e²/(2 pi ε0 )

With e =1.6e-19 C,

e² = 2.56e-38 C².

So, 12 *2.56e-38 =30.72e-38.

Divide by (2 pi ε0 ) = 2 *3.1416 *8.854e-12.

Which is 6.2832 *8.854e-12 ≈55.68e-12.

So, 30.72e-38 /55.68e-12 = (30.72 /55.68 ) * 1e-26.

30.72 /55.68 is approximately 0.551.

So, 0.551e-26 =5.51e-27 J.

But this isn't matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the 13th charge also contributes to the potential energy with each of the 12 charges. But I think that's already included in U1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at distance 2m from P, but all 12 are also at 2m from each other. But that's not possible for 12 points on a sphere. So, perhaps the problem is assuming that each of the 12 is at 2m from P and from each other, which would make it a regular icosahedron, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate U1, and that's it, and the correct option is not given, but perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential energy is (3/2) * (k e^2) * (n^2 -1) / r, where n is the number of charges. But I'm not sure about that formula.

Wait, another formula I've heard about is that the potential energy of a system of n charges each at a distance r from a central charge is n * k q^2 / r.

Which would be the case here: U =12 * k (2e)^2 / (2 m).

So, let's compute that.

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

(2e)^2 =4e² =4*(1.6e-19)^2=4*2.56e-38=10.24e-38 C².

r =2 m.

So, U =12 * (8.988e9) * (10.24e-38) / (2).

Compute step by step:

8.988e9 *10.24e-38 =8.988 *10.24e9-38.

8.988 *10.24 ≈92.04.

So, 92.04e-29. Because 1e9 *1e-38 =1e-29.

Then divide by 2: 92.04e-29 /2 =46.02e-29.

Multiply by 12:46.02e-29 *12=552.24e-29.

Which is 5.5224e-27 J.

Which matches my earlier calculation.

So, U1 is approximately 5.52e-27 J.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27 J.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another possibility: the problem is considering that all 13 charges are the same. Wait, no, the 13th is fixed, and the other 12 are each 2e. So, no, all 13 are 2e.

Wait, but in the potential energy formula, when you have a charge brought into a field created by others, you have to consider all interactions. So, perhaps the 13th charge's potential is due to all the other 12, but I think that's not the case.

Wait, no. Each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential at the 13th charge's position. But since the 13th is fixed, perhaps the potential energy is the sum of each charge's contribution to the 13th's potential.

But that doesn't make sense, because the 13th charge is fixed, so each of the 12 charges is placed in the potential created by the 13th.

Wait, the potential energy of each charge is q times the potential created by the 13th charge.

So, each of the 12 charges has potential energy U_i = q * V, where V is the potential at their position due to the 13th charge.

V = k Q / r, where Q is 2e, r is 2 m.

So, V = (8.988e9) * (2e) /2.

Wait, 2e is 3.2e-19 C.

So, V = (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19) / 2.

= (8.988e9 * 3.2e-19) ) /2.

8.988e9 *3.2e-19 = 28.7616e-10.

Divided by 2: 14.3808e-10 V.

So, each of the 12 charges has potential energy U_i = q * V = (3.2e-19 C) *14.3808e-10 V.

= 3.2e-19 *1.43808e-9 = 4.601856e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 4.601856e-28 *12 =5.522227e-27 J.

Again, same result: ~5.52e-27 J.

So, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. Let's compute that.

Each pair contributes (2e)^2 / (4 pi ε0 r_ij).

If all r_ij are 2 meters, which is impossible for 12 charges, but perhaps for the sake of calculation, let's assume each r_ij is 2 m. So, each pair contributes (4e²)/(4 pi ε0 * 2) ) = (e²)/(2 pi ε0).

But for 12 charges, the number of pairs is C(12,2)=66. So, U2 =66 * (e²)/(2 pi ε0).

Which is (66/2) * (e²)/(pi ε0 ) =33 * (e²)/(pi ε0).

So, e²/(pi ε0 )= (2.56e-38)/(3.1416 *8.854e-12 ) → denominator is 27.89e-12.

So, 2.56e-38 /27.89e-12 =9.18e-27.

Multiply by 33: 9.18e-27 *33 ≈305e-27 =3.05e-25 J.

So, U2 would be 3.05e-25 J, which is way larger than any of the options. So, it's unlikely that the problem is expecting me to include this.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. The only way I can see the answer matching the options is if the problem is only considering the energy from the 13th charge and the 12, which is U1=5.5e-27 J, but none of the options match that. But wait, looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 1.28 times 5.5e-27.

Wait, 5.5 *1.28=7.04. So, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1.28 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U1. Let me re-calculate using more precise constants.

Constants:

k =8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

e=1.602176634e-19 C.

So, U1=12 * ( (2e)^2 )/(4 pi ε0 * 2 m )

=12 * (4e²)/(8 pi ε0 )

=12 * (e²)/(2 pi ε0 )

e²= (1.602176634e-19)^2 =2.56697e-38 C².

So,

e²/(2 pi ε0 ) = 2.56697e-38 / (2 *3.1415926536 *8.854187817e-12 )

Compute denominator: 2 *3.1415926536=6.283185307.

6.283185307 *8.854187817e-12 = let's calculate.

6 *8.854187817e-12=53.1251269e-12.

0.283185307 *8.854187817e-12= ~0.283185 *8.854188e-12 ≈2.508e-12.

So, total denominator ≈53.1251269e-12 +2.508e-12 =55.6331269e-12.

So, 2.56697e-38 /55.6331269e-12 = (2.56697 /55.6331269 ) *1e-26.

2.56697 /55.6331269 ≈0.0461.

So, 0.0461e-26 =4.61e-28.

Multiply by 12: 4.61e-28 *12=5.53e-27 J.

Same as before.

So, I think I'm confident that U1 is approximately 5.53e-27 J. But since none of the options match, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energies are zero, which isn't correct, but perhaps the intended answer is 5.5e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking again at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is 5.5e-27 *5.12. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the energy is actually (3/2) * U1. Because sometimes in thermodynamics, the potential energy is considered as (3/2)kT, but that's for thermal energy and not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each charge contributes (k q Q)/(r), but since the 13th charge is fixed, the potential energy added by each charge is (k Q q)/r, and since the 13th charge is fixed, the system's potential energy is the sum of each charge's potential energy.

But that's what I did earlier.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the electric potential energy of a group of charges, which is (1/2) * sum over all pairs (q_i q_j)/(4 pi ε₀ r_ij).

In that case, the potential energy of the 13 charges would include the interactions between the 12 and the 13th, plus the interactions between the 12 charges.

So, U = (1/2) [ sum_{i=1 to 12} ( (2e)(2e) )/(4 pi ε₀ *2 ) + sum_{i<j} ( (2e)(2e) )/(4 pi ε₀ r_ij ) ) ].

So, the first term is the same as before: U1 =12 * (4e²)/(8 pi ε₀ ) ) = 6e²/(pi ε₀ ).

The second term is the sum of all pairs of the 12 charges, each contributing (4e²)/(4 pi ε₀ r_ij ), but without knowing r_ij, we can't compute it. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the first term, the interactions between the 12 and the 13th charge.

Given that, the correct value would be about 5.5e-27 J, but none of the options match. So, perhaps the problem expects only the U1 term, and the correct option is not present, but perhaps option C is the intended one.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the value.

Wait, let me compute U1 using more precise numbers.

Compute:

U1 =12 * ( (2e)^2 ) / (4 pi ε₀ * 2 )

=12 * (4e²) / (8 pi ε₀ )

= (12 *4 e² ) / (8 pi ε₀ )

= (48 e² )/(8 pi ε₀ )=6 e²/(pi ε₀ ).

e=1.6e-19 C.

e²=2.56e-38 C².

pi=3.1415926536.

ε₀=8.8541878128e-12 F/m.

So,

6 *2.56e-38=15.36e-38.

Denominator: pi * ε₀ =3.1415926536 *8.8541878128e-12 ≈27.898e-12.

So,

15.36e-38 /27.898e-12 = (15.36 /27.898 ) *1e-26.

15.36 /27.898 ≈0.551.

So, 0.551e-26 =5.51e-27 J.

Again, same result.

But the options don't have this.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a system of charges with charge q, with n charges, as U = (n q^2)/(4 pi ε0 r), where r is the distance from the center.

But for 12 charges, each at distance r=2m, the potential energy would be U=12 * (q^2)/(4 pi ε0 r).

So, q=2e, r=2m.

So,

U=12*(4e²)/(8 pi ε0 )

=12*(e²)/(2 pi ε0 )

Which is the same as before, leading to 5.5e-27 J.

So, same conclusion.

Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately 5.5e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C, which is 7.056e-27 J, perhaps due to a miscalculation in the problem or a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct option is not present. But since I have to choose among the given options, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy of the 13 charges as the sum of all pairwise interactions, including the mutual ones between the 12 charges. But without knowing their arrangement, we can't compute the exact value. However, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy is zero, which is impossible, but perhaps the problem is only considering U1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula (3/2) * U, where U is the potential energy per particle, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct value is 5.5e-27 J, but the options are incorrect.

In any case, given the options, the closest one to our calculated U1 is option C:7.056e-27 J.

Wait, but 5.5e-27 is about 0.55e-26, which is 5.5e-27. The option A is 5.645e-26, which is an order of magnitude higher. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent when calculating 1e-26.

Wait, when I calculated 30.72e-38 /55.68e-12 → which is 30.72e-38 /55.68e-12 = (30.72/55.68) ) * 1e-26.

So that's 0.551e-26 J = 5.51e-27 J.

Wait, but perhaps I should have 1e-26 as 1e-26 J, which is 0.551e-26 =5.51e-27.

Yes, correct.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are placed symmetrically, and their mutual potential energy contributes a term which I can approximate.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and the mutual potential energies are arranged in such a way that they contribute a certain amount.

But without more information, I can't proceed. So, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we analyze the potential energy contributions. The system consists of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \). The 13th charge is fixed at point \( P \), while the other 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is the sum of two contributions: 

1. **Potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges**  
   Each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th charge at \( P \). The potential energy for one charge is given by:  
   \[
   U_i = \frac{(2e)(2e)}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \cdot 2} = \frac{4e^2}{8 \pi \epsilon_0} = \frac{e^2}{2 \pi \epsilon_0}
   \]  
   Since there are 12 such charges, the total contribution is:  
   \[
   U_1 = 12 \cdot \frac{e^2}{2 \pi \epsilon_0} = \frac{6e^2}{\pi \epsilon_0}
   \]  

2. **Potential energy between the 12 charges themselves**  
   The mutual potential energy between the 12 charges depends on their arrangement. For identical charges, the potential energy is positive, and the minimum energy occurs when the charges are as far apart as possible. However, calculating the exact value requires knowledge of their specific arrangement, which is not provided. Thus, the problem likely simplifies by ignoring this contribution or assumes it is negligible.

### Numerical Calculation for \( U_1 \)
Using the constants:  
- \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \),  
- \( \epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \),  
- \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \),  

we compute:  
\[
e^2 = (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.56 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
\]  
\[
U_1 = \frac{6e^2}{\pi \epsilon_0} = \frac{6 \cdot 2.56 \times 10^{-38}}{3.1416 \cdot 8.854 \times 10^{-12}}
\]  
First, calculate the denominator:  
\[
\pi \epsilon_0 = 3.1416 \cdot 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \approx 27.89 \times 10^{-12}
\]  
Now, calculate the numerator:  
\[
6 \cdot 2.56 \times 10^{-38} = 15.36 \times 10^{-38}
\]  
Thus:  
\[
U_1 = \frac{15.36 \times 10^{-38}}{27.89 \times 10^{-12}} = \frac{15.36}{27.89} \cdot 10^{-26} \approx 0.551 \cdot 10^{-26} \, \text{J} = 5.51 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
\]  

### Comparison with Options
The calculated value of \( U_1 \) is approximately \( 5.51 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \). However, none of the options match this value exactly. The closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is slightly larger than the computed result. Given the provided options, it is reasonable to conclude that the intended answer is **C**.
