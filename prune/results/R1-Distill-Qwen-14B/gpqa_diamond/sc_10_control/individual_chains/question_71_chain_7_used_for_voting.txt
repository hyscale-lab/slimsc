Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

Alright, the question says there are five exoplanets, Planet_1 to Planet_5, all in orbital resonance with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, but I don't think that's super relevant here. The key part is their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, each planet's orbital period is a multiple of Planet_1's period.

Wait, the question is about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both have the same albedo, which probably means their reflectivity is the same, so that might simplify things a bit.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula I recall is something like T = T_star * (L / (16πσd²))^(1/4), but maybe it's easier to think in terms of the inverse square law for flux. Oh right, the formula is often approximated as T_p = T_s * (R_s / (2a)) )^(1/2), but wait, T_s is the star's effective temperature, R_s is its radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. But another approach is using the proportionality since all the planets orbit the same star. So the equilibrium temperature should depend on the square root of (1/(semi-major axis squared)), but considering the period ratio.

Wait, but Kepler's third law relates the period P to the semi-major axis a. The formula is P² ∝ a³, right? Because for a star, Kepler's law is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So if we know the period ratios, we can find the a ratios.

So let's get the periods straight. The periods are in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let me assign Planet_1 a period P1. Then Planet_2 is P2 = 2*P1, Planet_3 is P3=2.5*P1, Planet_4 is P4=3.5*P1, and Planet_5 is P5=5*P1.

But since we need the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, maybe I just need to find the ratio of their distances first. Because T is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), but since L (star's luminosity) and other constants are the same for both planets, the ratio of their temperatures will depend on the square root of the ratio of their distances.

Wait, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). Oh, but since albedo is the same for both, that term is the same and cancels out in the ratio. So the main factor is the distance a.

So, the steps are:

1. Find the ratio of periods P4/P2.
2. Use Kepler's law to find the ratio of their semi-major axes a4/a2.
3. Plug into the temperature ratio formula.

Let's compute each step.

1. The period ratio: P4 is 3.5 * P1, P2 is 2 * P1. So P4/P2 = (3.5)/(2) = 1.75. 

Wait, but Kepler's law says P² ∝ a³. So, (P4/P2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3.

Let me write this as (a4/a2)^3 = (P4/P2)^2.

So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Wait, let's compute that. P4/P2 is 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

So (1.75)^(2/3) = ?

Hmm, let me compute that. Alternatively, 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3).

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 1.75 squared is 3.0625, then take cube root of 3.0625. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: (P4/P2)^2 = (3.5/2)^2 = (7/4)^2 = 49/16 = 3.0625.

So a4/a2 is the cube root of (3.0625). So cube root of 3.0625 is approximately... Well, cube of 1.45 is about 3.05, because 1.45^3 = (1.4^3 = 2.744, 1.45^3=1.45 *1.45 *1.45. 1.45*1.45=2.1025. 2.1025 *1.45: 2 *1.45=2.9, 0.1025 *1.45~0.1486, total ~3.0486. So about 1.45.

So, a4/a2 ≈ 1.45.

Wait, but wait—does this mean that a4 is larger than a2? Yes, because 3.5 is larger than 2, so a4 is further out.

But equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of a. Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So if a4 is 1.45 times a2, then the temperature ratio T4/T2 is proportional to (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(1/1.45) ≈ sqrt(0.69) ≈ 0.83.

Wait, let me compute that more precisely. 1.45 is approximately 1.444, which is 12/8.5? Hmm, maybe better to just use exact numbers.

Wait, the exact ratio is a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3).

Let me compute 1.75^(2/3). 1.75 is 7/4.

So 7/4 = 1.75.

(7/4)^(1/3) is the cube root of 1.75.

Wait, cube of 1.2 is 1.728, which is close to 1.75. So cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.2 times something. Let me compute 1.2^3 is 1.728, which is just under 1.75. So cube root of 1.75 is about 1.2 * (1.75/1.728)^(1/3). Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the exact value.

Alternatively, using logarithms.

But perhaps it's better to use exact exponents. Let me think: (7/4)^(2/3) = e^[(2/3) * ln(7/4)].

Hmm, I don't remember the exact value, but I can approximate ln(7/4) as ln(1.75) ≈ 0.5596.

So 2/3 * 0.5596 ≈ 0.373.

e^0.373 ≈ 1.453. So (7/4)^(2/3) ≈ 1.453.

So a4 is approximately 1.453 times a2.

So the distance ratio a4/a2 is about 1.453.

Now, the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(1/1.453) ≈ 1 / sqrt(1.453).

Compute sqrt(1.453): sqrt(1.44) is 1.2, sqrt(1.453) is a bit more. Let's see: 1.2^2=1.44, 1.21^2=1.4641. So 1.453 is between 1.2^2 and 1.21^2. So sqrt(1.453)=approx 1.205.

So T4/T2 ≈ 1 / 1.205 ≈ 0.8298, which is around 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, which is the closest.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes it's easy to confuse the ratios.

So, to recap:

1. Ratio of periods (P4/P2) = 3.5/2 = 1.75.

2. (a4/a2)^3 = (P4/P2)^2 → (a4/a2)^3 = (1.75)^2 = 3.0625 → a4/a2 = (3.0625)^(1/3) ≈ 1.453.

3. T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(1/1.453) ≈ sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829.

So the ratio is approximately 0.83, which is option C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by analyzing the given orbital period ratios. The periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, so Planet_2 has a period \( P_2 = 2P_1 \) and Planet_4 has \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \). Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), we relate the periods to the semi-major axes:

\[
\left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{a_4}{a_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( \frac{P_4}{P_2} = \frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75 \), we find:

\[
\left(\frac{a_4}{a_2}\right)^3 = (1.75)^2 = 3.0625
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = (3.0625)^{1/3} \approx 1.453
\]

The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance, \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \). Therefore, the temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.453}} \approx \sqrt{0.688} \approx 0.829
\]

This value rounds to approximately 0.83. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**C) ~0.83**

Wait, but Kepler's law says P² ∝ a³. So, (P4/P2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3.

Let me write this as (a4/a2)^3 = (P4/P2)^2.

So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Wait, let's compute that. P4/P2 is 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

So (1.75)^(2/3) = ?

Hmm, let me compute that. Alternatively, 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3).

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 1.75 squared is 3.0625, then take cube root of 3.0625. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: (P4/P2)^2 = (3.5/2)^2 = (7/4)^2 = 49/16 = 3.0625.

So, a4/a2 ≈ 1.45.

Wait, but wait—does this mean that a4 is larger than a2? Yes, because 3.5 is larger than 2, so a4 is further out.

But equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of a. Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So if a4 is 1.45 times a2, then the temperature ratio T4/T2 is proportional to (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(1/1.45) ≈ sqrt(0.69) ≈ 0.83.

Wait, let me compute that more precisely. 1.45 is approximately 1.444, which is 12/8.5? Hmm, maybe better to just use exact numbers.

Wait, the exact ratio is a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3).

Let me compute 1.75^(2/3). 1.75 is 7/4.

So 7/4 = 1.75.

(7/4)^(1/3) is the cube root of 1.75.

Wait, cube of 1.2 is 1.728, which is close to 1.75. So cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.2 times something. Let me compute 1.2^3 is 1.728, which is just under 1.75. So cube root of 1.75 is about 1.2 * (1.75/1.728)^(1/3). Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the exact value.

Alternatively, using logarithms.

But perhaps it's better to use exact exponents. Let me think: (7/4)^(2/3) = e^[(2/3) * ln(7/4)].

Hmm, I don't remember the exact value, but I can approximate ln(7/4) as ln(1.75) ≈ 0.5596.

So 2/3 * 0.5596 ≈ 0.373.

e^0.373 ≈ 1.453. So (7/4)^(2/3) ≈ 1.453.

So a4 is approximately 1.453 times a2.

So the distance ratio a4/a2 is about 1.453.

Now, the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(1/1.453) ≈ 1 / sqrt(1.453).

Compute sqrt(1.453): sqrt(1.44) is 1.2, sqrt(1.453) is a bit more. Let's see: 1.2^2=1.44, 1.21^2=1.4641. So 1.453 is between 1.2^2 and 1.21^2. So sqrt(1.453)=approx 1.205.

So the ratio is approximately 0.83, which is option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by analyzing the given orbital period ratios. The periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, so Planet_2 has a period \( P_2 = 2P_1 \) and Planet_4 has \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \). Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), we relate the periods to the semi-major axes:

\[
\left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{a_4}{a_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( \frac{P_4}{P_2} = \frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75 \), we find:

\[
\left(\frac{a_4}{a_2}\right)^3 = (1.75)^2 = 3.0625
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = (3.0625)^{1/3} \approx 1.453
\]

The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance, \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \). Therefore, the temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.453}} \approx \sqrt{0.688} \approx 0.829
\]

This value rounds to approximately 0.83. Among the given options, the closest match is:
