Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says that there are three exoplanets—Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not sure if that's super relevant here; maybe it's just context about how they were found.

The main data points given are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The equilibrium temperature ratios are Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3. Wait, but equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity, right?

Also, the mass ratios are given. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35. So Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2, and Planet2 is more massive than Planet3. But I'm not sure yet how that ties into the orbital period.

The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. So we need to find Period3 / Period1.

Hmm, I'm trying to remember Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) ) * a³. Since the planets' masses are much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M + m ≈ M, the star's mass. So for each planet, P² is proportional to a³ divided by M.

Wait, but in this problem, all the planets are around the same star, right? So M is the same for all three planets. So the period squared is proportional to a³. So P is proportional to a^(3/2). So if I can find the ratio of a3 to a1, I can find the ratio of their periods.

But wait, how do I get the semi-major axis (a) for each planet? The equilibrium temperature is given, which is based on the formula:

Teq = (L / (16πσ))^(1/4) * ( (1 - albedo) / ( (1 + e cos θ) ) )^(1/4) )

Assuming circular orbits (e=0) and same star, L is the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature is proportional to ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) multiplied by (1 / sqrt(a)).

Wait, no, let me think again. The formula for equilibrium temperature when the planet has an albedo A is:

Teq = T_star * ( (1 - A) / ( (1 + (m_p / m_s)) ) )^(1/4) * ( (1) / (sqrt(a)) )

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The star's effective temperature is T_star, but the planet's equilibrium temperature would be lower because it's farther away. The formula I think is:

Teq = T_star * ( R_star / (2 a) )^(1/2) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Wait, no, that's for the star's flux. Alternatively, the flux received by the planet is F = L / (4π a²), and the planet emits as a blackbody, so:

F * (1 - A) / 4 = σ Teq^4

So, L/(4π a²) * (1-A)/4 = σ Teq^4

Then, Teq = [ L (1 - A) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4)

We can rearrange this to find a in terms of Teq. Let's solve for a²:

a² = L (1 - A) / (16 π σ Teq^4 )

So a is proportional to [ L (1 - A) / Teq^4 ]^(1/2) )^(1/2) ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to take the ratio between two planets.

Let's consider Planet1 and Planet2. The ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is Teq1/Teq2 = 1.4. We can write the equilibrium temperature ratio as:

Teq1 / Teq2 = [ (a2 / a1) ]^(1/2) * [ (1 - A2) / (1 - A1) ]^(1/4 )

But since all planets have the same albedo (0.3), the (1 - A) term is the same for all. So that ratio simplifies to:

Teq1/Teq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, (Teq1/Teq2)^2 = a2 / a1

Given that Teq1/Teq2 is 1.4, then (1.4)^2 = a2/a1 => 1.96 = a2/a1. So a2 = 1.96 a1.

Similarly, for Planet2 and Planet3, Teq2/Teq3 = 2.3. Using the same approach:

(Teq2/Teq3)^2 = a3/a2

So (2.3)^2 = a3/a2 → 5.29 = a3/a2 → a3 =5.29 a2.

But a2 is 1.96 a1, so a3 =5.29 * 1.96 a1.

Let me calculate that: 5.29 * 1.96. Let's see, 5*1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 is around 0.5684. So total approximately 10.3684. So a3 ≈10.3684 a1.

Now, with Kepler's third law, P² ∝ a³. So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) * (M_planet3 + M_star)/(M_planet1 + M_star) )^(1/2) )

But since the planet masses are much smaller than the star's, we can ignore the planetary masses in the denominator. So (M + m_p) ≈ M for all planets.

So the ratio simplifies to (a3/a1)^(3/2).

We have a3/a1 ≈10.3684, so (10.3684)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5).

Let me compute that. Let's first compute the square root of 10.3684. The square root of 10 is about 3.162, and sqrt(10.24)=3.2. Let me calculate sqrt(10.3684):

Well, 3.2^2=10.24, 3.21^2=10.3041, 3.22^2=10.3684. Oh wait, exactly? 3.22 *3.22 = (3 + 0.22)^2 = 9 + 2*3*0.22 + 0.22^2 =9 + 1.32 + 0.0484=10.3684. So sqrt(10.3684)=3.22.

So (10.3684)^(1.5) = (10.3684)^(1) * (10.3684)^(0.5) =10.3684 *3.22.

Calculating that: 10 *3.22=32.2, 0.3684 *3.22≈1.186. So total approx 32.2 +1.186=33.386.

So P3/P1 ≈33.386. Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have missed a step because I didn't account for the mass ratios. The problem provided mass ratios between Planet1 and Planet2 (1.15) and Planet2 and Planet3 (1.35). So perhaps the planet's mass affects the orbital period? Because Kepler's third law does involve the sum of the masses.

Wait, the formula is P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) *a³. So when M is the star's mass, and m is the planet's mass, but the planet's mass is much smaller than M, so M + m ≈ M. So the planet's mass doesn't significantly affect the period. So in our previous calculation, we can ignore the planetary masses.

So the initial calculation should hold. Thus, the period ratio is about 33.4.

Looking back at the options:

A) ~10.4

B) ~3.2

C) ~4.4

D) ~33.4

So the correct answer is D.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the given data and apply Kepler's third law along with the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance.

### Key Information:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:
   - \( \frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = 1.4 \)
   - \( \frac{T_{\text{eq2}}}{T_{\text{eq3}}} = 2.3 \)

   The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (\( T_{\text{eq}} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \)). Using the given ratios:
   \[
   \left(\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}}\right)^2 = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \implies 1.4^2 = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \implies a_2 = 1.96 \, a_1
   \]
   \[
   \left(\frac{T_{\text{eq2}}}{T_{\text{eq3}}}\right)^2 = \frac{a_3}{a_2} \implies 2.3^2 = \frac{a_3}{a_2} \implies a_3 = 5.29 \, a_2
   \]

   Substituting \( a_2 = 1.96 \, a_1 \) into \( a_3 = 5.29 \, a_2 \):
   \[
   a_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 \, a_1 \approx 10.3684 \, a_1
   \]

2. **Kepler's Third Law**:
   Kepler's third law states that \( P^2 \propto a^3 \). Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
   \]

   Substituting \( \frac{a_3}{a_1} \approx 10.3684 \):
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
   \]

3. **Calculation**:
   First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.3684} \):
   \[
   \sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22
   \]
   Then:
   \[
   (10.3684)^{3/2} = 10.3684 \times 3.22 \approx 33.386
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. Comparing this result with the options:
   - A) ~10.4
   - B) ~3.2
   - C) ~4.4
   - D) ~33.4

   The correct answer is **D**.

Wait, no, let me think again. The formula for equilibrium temperature when the planet has an albedo A is:

Teq = T_star * ( (1 - A) / ( (1 + (m_p / m_s)) ) )^(1/4) * ( (1) / (sqrt(a)) )

Then, Teq = [ L (1 - A) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4)

We can rearrange this to find a in terms of Teq. Let's solve for a²:

a² = L (1 - A) / (16 π σ Teq^4 )

So a is proportional to [ L (1 - A) / Teq^4 ]^(1/2) )^(1/2) ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to take the ratio between two planets.

Let's consider Planet1 and Planet2. The ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is Teq1/Teq2 = 1.4. We can write the equilibrium temperature ratio as:

Teq1 / Teq2 = [ (a2 / a1) ]^(1/2) * [ (1 - A2) / (1 - A1) ]^(1/4 )

But since all planets have the same albedo (0.3), the (1 - A) term is the same for all. So that ratio simplifies to:

Teq1/Teq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, (Teq1/Teq2)^2 = a2 / a1

Given that Teq1/Teq2 is 1.4, then (1.4)^2 = a2/a1 => 1.96 = a2/a1. So a2 = 1.96 a1.

Similarly, for Planet2 and Planet3, Teq2/Teq3 = 2.3. Using the same approach:

(Teq2/Teq3)^2 = a3/a2

So (2.3)^2 = a3/a2 → 5.29 = a3/a2 → a3 =5.29 a2.

But a2 is 1.96 a1, so a3 =5.29 * 1.96 a1.

Let me calculate that: 5.29 * 1.96. Let's see, 5*1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 is around 0.5684. So total approximately 10.3684. So a3 ≈10.3684 a1.

So the ratio simplifies to (a3/a1)^(3/2).

So (10.3684)^(1.5) = (10.3684)^(1) * (10.3684)^(0.5) =10.3684 *3.22.

Calculating that: 10 *3.22=32.2, 0.3684 *3.22≈1.186. So total approx 32.2 +1.186=33.386.

So P3/P1 ≈33.386. Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.
