Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again. The question is about an annihilation process: a proton and an antiproton annihilate to produce two A+ and two A- particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, with different velocities.

Hmm, annihilation... right, when particles and their antiparticles meet, they convert their mass into energy, usually producing other particles. But wait, in this case, they produce two of each A+ and A-. So the initial particles are a proton and antiproton. Proton is a baryon, and so is the antiproton. Oh wait, protons have a certain mass, and so do antiprotons. So their rest mass energy should be considered.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh, so maybe we can approximate that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass. So the initial momentum might be mostly from the proton? Or maybe since the antiproton is moving slowly, we can assume it's at rest? Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

So, the initial system is a proton and an antiproton. Let's denote their masses. The mass of a proton (and antiproton) is about 938 MeV/c². So each has a rest mass energy of approximately 938 MeV. But the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass. So perhaps we can approximate the initial energy as the sum of their rest energies, but that depends on their velocities.

Wait, but since the proton is moving toward the antiproton (assuming they are colliding), but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm, maybe the setup is that the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, no, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is at rest? Or perhaps both are moving, but the antiproton's velocity is much less than the proton's. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the initial setup.

Wait, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2 A+ + 2 A-. So the initial system is a proton and an antiproton. The problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, which suggests that its velocity is much less than c, so its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass. So maybe we can approximate that the initial energy is just the sum of their rest energies plus any kinetic energy. But since the antiproton is moving, perhaps the initial total momentum isn't zero.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving and the proton is at rest, then the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, its momentum is small compared to its rest mass times c.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the antiproton is at rest, given that it's moving slowly. But I'm not sure. Let me try to think about conservation of energy and momentum.

In any case, the initial total energy is the sum of the energies of the proton and the antiproton. The initial momentum is the sum of their momenta. After the annihilation, we have four particles: two A+ and two A-.

Wait, but in the problem, the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. So each A is lighter than the proton, which is about 938 MeV. So the initial rest mass energy is 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. The final rest mass energy is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. So, the initial rest mass is higher than the final rest mass, which makes sense because some energy is converted into kinetic energy of the products.

But wait, this is in the center-of-momentum frame? Or in the lab frame? Hmm, probably we're considering the lab frame where one particle is at rest, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, but that might not hold.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps we can model the initial system as a proton at rest and the antiproton has some small velocity. But since it's moving slowly, perhaps we can approximate its velocity as zero, but that's possibly an oversimplification.

Alternatively, maybe the initial system's total rest mass is given by the sum of the proton and antiproton rest masses. But wait, wait, no. The rest mass of the system would be different because the particles are moving. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the approximation that the initial particles are at rest, so the total energy is the sum of their rest energies. But wait, that would only be the case if they are both at rest, but the antiproton is moving, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the conservation of energy and momentum. Let me denote:

Initial particles: proton (p) and antiproton (p̄). Let’s say the proton is moving with velocity v_p and the antiproton is moving with velocity v_p̄. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps v_p̄ ≈ 0, or that its velocity is much less than c.

Wait, but the problem statement isn't clear on whether the proton is moving or the antiproton. Hmm. Maybe the setup is that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it. If that's the case, the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton. But the antiproton's velocity is slow, so its momentum is small.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the center of mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero. Because the proton and antiproton have equal and opposite momenta. But that's only the case if they have the same speed in opposite directions. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps the proton is moving in the opposite direction with the same speed, making the total momentum zero. That would make sense because in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that. Hmm, perhaps I should make some assumptions. Let me proceed under the assumption that the initial system's total momentum is zero, which would make the center of mass frame the same as the lab frame. So the total initial momentum is zero.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, and the proton is at rest, then the total initial momentum is not zero. So that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the system's initial momentum is zero, so the proton and antiproton are moving with equal and opposite velocities. So their momenta cancel each other out.

But if that's the case, then the initial system's total momentum is zero, and the products must also have zero total momentum.

So, in the initial frame, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the proton and antiproton. If they're moving with equal and opposite velocities, then yes, their momenta cancel. But let me think: for a proton and antiproton, their rest masses are the same, so if they have velocities v and -v, their energies would be E_p = gamma * m_p c² and similarly for E_p̄. The total energy would be 2 gamma m_p c².

But wait, in the problem statement, the antiproton is moving slowly. So if the initial system's momentum is zero, then the velocities of the proton and antiproton must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the proton is moving quickly? That seems contradictory. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the initial system is at rest. But that would mean the proton and antiproton are moving with equal and opposite momenta. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the proton is moving quickly, but that would require their momenta to balance.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the non-relativistic approximation, given that the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps we can approximate the initial energy as the sum of their rest energies and their kinetic energies treated non-relativistically.

Wait, but the problem is about finding the velocity of the A particles. So perhaps the products are moving with some velocity that can be found via conservation laws.

Wait, let's think about this. After annihilation, we have four particles: two A+ and two A-. Let me assume they all move in the same direction, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, they could be moving in pairs, but perhaps in opposite directions.

Wait, but without knowing the directions, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps all four particles move together with the same velocity, but that might not be the case either.

Hmm, perhaps the products are moving in such a way that their total momentum equals the initial momentum. So if the initial momentum is zero (assuming the proton and antiproton are moving with equal and opposite momenta), then the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That would imply that the products are moving symmetrically in some way.

Wait, but the products are two A+ and two A-. For the total momentum to be zero, maybe the two A+ are moving in one direction and the two A- in the opposite, with appropriate velocities and masses. Or perhaps they all move in pairs, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair of A+ and A- combines into something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider that all four particles move together with the same velocity, so their total momentum can be calculated as (4 m_A v) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ), but that's a bit messy.

Wait, but if the initial system's total momentum is zero, then the products must have total momentum zero as well. So the vector sum of their momenta must be zero.

Hmm, perhaps the simplest scenario is that the four particles move in such a way that their momenta cancel. For example, two might move in one direction and two in the opposite, each with the same speed but opposite directions. But since each A has the same mass, their momenta would be same in magnitude but opposite in direction, leading to a total momentum of zero.

Wait, but that would require the two pairs to have symmetric momenta. So, for example, two A+ moving in the same direction and two A- moving in the opposite. But A+ and A- have the same mass, so their momenta would cancel each other.

Wait, but that would require that the A+ and A- are moving in opposite directions, each with the same speed. So their momentum vectors would cancel out. So the total momentum of all four would be zero.

But how does that help me find the velocity of each A particle?

Alternatively, perhaps each pair (A+ and A-) are moving together, but that's getting too vague.

Hmm, maybe I should think about energy and momentum conservation.

Let me denote variables:

Initial energy: E_initial = E_p + E_p̄

Initial momentum: p_initial = p_p + p_p̄

But if the initial system is at rest, then p_initial = 0, so E_initial = E_p + E_p̄ = (gamma_p + gamma_p̄) m_p c².

But if the system is at rest, then gamma_p = gamma_p̄, and their velocities are opposite. So, for example, if the proton is moving with velocity v, the antiproton would be moving with velocity -v, so that their momenta cancel each other.

In that case, E_initial = 2 gamma_p m_p c².

After the annihilation, the system's energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles. Each A has energy E_A = gamma_A m_A c².

The total energy after is 4 gamma_A m_A c².

But wait, the rest mass energy of the initial system isn't just 2 m_p c², because they're moving. Hmm, no, because if they're moving, their rest masses are still m_p each, but their energies are higher.

Wait, but if the initial system is at rest, then the initial energy is the sum of their rest energies, which would be 2 m_p c². But wait, no. Because if they are moving with some velocity, their energies are higher than their rest masses. Wait, but if the initial system is at rest, the total momentum is zero, so the individual momenta must cancel each other.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

Assuming the initial system is at rest: so the total momentum is zero. So the proton and antiproton are moving in opposite directions with velocities v and -v, respectively, such that their momenta cancel.

In that case, the total energy would be E_initial = gamma(v) m_p c² + gamma(v) m_p c² = 2 gamma(v) m_p c².

After annihilation, the four A particles must have the same total energy E_final = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

But wait, also, the total momentum after must be zero, so the vector sum of their momenta must be zero. So perhaps each A is moving with velocity u such that their momenta cancel each other.

Wait, but how? If all four are moving in the same direction, their momenta would add up, which can't be zero. So perhaps the A particles are moving in pairs. For example, two A+ move in one direction, and two A- move in the opposite direction, each with the same speed. Because each A+ and A- has the same mass, their momenta would be equal and opposite.

Wait, but the problem states that the products are 2 A+ and 2 A-. So if each A+ is moving with velocity v in, say, the positive direction, and each A- is moving with velocity v in the negative direction, then their momenta would cancel each other. So the total momentum would be zero.

Wait, but that would require each A+ and A- to have the same speed but opposite directions. So the momentum of each A+ is gamma v m_A c, and each A- would have momentum gamma v m_A c in the opposite direction.

But since there are two of each, their total momentum would be 2*(gamma v m_A c) in positive and 2*(gamma v m_A c) in negative direction, which cancels to zero.

So that's a possible scenario.

Now, the total energy after annihilation is the sum of the energies of each A:

E_final = 4 * gamma_A m_A c².

But wait, each A has energy gamma_A m_A c², so four of them would have 4 gamma_A m_A c².

But the initial energy is E_initial = 2 gamma(v) m_p c².

So energy conservation gives:

2 gamma(v) m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

We can simplify this by dividing both sides by c² and canceling terms.

2 gamma(v) m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

Simplify further:

gamma(v) m_p = 2 gamma_A m_A.

Hmm, but we also have to consider momentum conservation. The initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum after must be zero. So in the case where each A+ and A- are moving in opposite directions, their velocities are such that their momenta cancel. So if all A particles are moving with the same speed u, but in opposite directions, their momenta will cancel.

Wait, because for each A+, their momentum is gamma(u) m_A u, and each A- has momentum gamma(u) m_A (-u), so each pair cancels. So the total momentum is zero, satisfying conservation.

So, given that, the energy equation would be:

2 gamma(v) m_p c² = 4 gamma(u) m_A c².

Wait, but I think the gamma(u) is for each A's velocity. So the equation becomes:

2 gamma(v) m_p = 4 gamma(u) m_A.

Wait, but the variables are getting a bit mixed. Maybe I can find a relation between u and v.

But wait, what else do I know? Hmm, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So v is small, maybe non-relativistic. So gamma(v) ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, then v is close to zero. So, gamma(v) ≈ 1. But if the initial system is at rest, then the initial energy would be approximately 2 m_p c². Then, the final energy would be 4 gamma(u) m_A c². So:

2 m_p c² = 4 gamma(u) m_A c².

Divide both sides by c²:

2 m_p = 4 gamma(u) m_A.

Simplify:

gamma(u) m_A = (m_p)/2.

So, gamma(u) = m_p/(2 m_A).

Given that m_p is about 938 MeV/c² and m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So, m_p/(2 m_A) = 938 / (2*300) = 938 / 600 ≈ 1.5633.

So, gamma(u) ≈ 1.5633.

But wait, gamma(u) must be greater than 1, which it is.

Now, gamma(u) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (u²/c²)).

So, 1.5633 = 1 / sqrt(1 - u²/c²).

Squaring both sides:

(1.5633)^2 = 1 / (1 - u²/c²).

1.5633^2 ≈ 2.443.

So, 2.443 = 1/(1 - u²/c²).

Take reciprocal: 1/2.443 ≈ 0.4095 = 1 - u²/c².

So, u²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905.

Take square root: u/c ≈ sqrt(0.5905) ≈ 0.7683.

So, u ≈ 0.7683 c.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c. That's the closest.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I make any incorrect assumptions? Let me check.

I assumed that the initial system is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. Then, the products must also have zero momentum, which I modeled by having each A+ and A- moving with velocity u and -u, respectively. But that's just one scenario. Are there other possibilities?

Alternatively, perhaps all four A particles move together with the same velocity. Let me consider that. Then, the total momentum would be 4 gamma(u) m_A u, which must equal zero. But that's only possible if u is zero, which can't be the case because then the energy wouldn't match. So that's not a feasible scenario.

Thus, the initial assumption that each pair of A particles are moving in opposite directions with the same speed seems correct.

So, in that case, the calculation gives u ≈ 0.7683 c, which rounds to 0.77c, option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

gamma(u) = m_p/(2 m_A).

m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So, 938/(2 * 300) = 938/600 ≈ 1.5633.

Yes, that's correct.

So, gamma(u) = 1.5633.

1.5633 = 1/sqrt(1 - u²/c²).

Squaring, 2.443 = 1/(1 - u²/c²).

So 1 - u²/c² = 1/2.443 ≈ 0.4095.

u²/c² = 1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905.

u/c = sqrt(0.5905) ≈ 0.7683.

Which is 0.7683c, so approximately 0.77c.

So option A is 0.77c.

Wait, but the options are given in the problem as:

Options:
A) 0.77c
B) 0.96c
C) 0.91c
D) 0.86c

So the answer would be option A.

But wait, I assumed that the initial system is at rest, which may not be the case. Because the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, but it doesn't specify whether the proton is moving or not. So perhaps the initial assumption about the system being at rest isn't correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it. So the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton.

In that case, the initial energy would be the proton's rest energy plus the antiproton's total energy.

So E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p̄ m_p c².

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄.

After annihilation, the four A particles must have a total energy E_final and total momentum p_final.

But this complicates things because we have to deal with both energy and momentum conservation.

But since the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can approximate gamma_p̄ ≈ 1, because v_p̄ is much less than c, so v_p̄ ≈ 0, making the antiproton's energy approximately m_p c², and its momentum approximately m_p v_p̄.

But then the initial momentum is just m_p v_p̄.

Now, the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v_p̄², but wait, no, if the antiproton is moving slowly, we can treat its kinetic energy as (1/2) m_p v_p̄², and its rest energy is m_p c².

So E_initial = m_p c² + m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v_p̄² = 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v_p̄².

But this is the non-relativistic case, but perhaps it's a valid approximation since the antiproton is moving slowly.

Now, the final energy is E_final = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

And the final momentum is p_final = 4 gamma_A m_A u, where u is the velocity of each A particle. Assuming all four A particles move in the same direction with velocity u.

Wait, but that's a big assumption. If all four are moving in the same direction, their momentum would add up, which would have to match the initial momentum.

But according to momentum conservation, p_initial = p_final.

So:

m_p v_p̄ ≈ 4 gamma_A m_A u.

But since v_p̄ is small, perhaps I can express u in terms of this equation.

But wait, we also have energy conservation:

E_initial = E_final.

So,

2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v_p̄² ≈ 4 gamma_A m_A c².

But since v_p̄ is small, the term (1/2) m_p v_p̄² is much smaller than 2 m_p c². So perhaps we can neglect it as a first approximation.

Then, 2 m_p c² ≈ 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Dividing both sides by c², we get:

2 m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

gamma_A = m_p/(2 m_A) = 938/(2*300) = 938/600 ≈ 1.5633.

Which brings us back to the same gamma as before. Then, as before, u ≈ 0.7683 c.

But this time, the initial momentum is m_p v_p̄ ≈ 4 gamma_A m_A u.

So substituting gamma_A from above, and u from before:

m_p v_p̄ ≈ 4 * (m_p/(2 m_A)) * m_A u.

Simplify:

m_p v_p̄ ≈ 4*(m_p/(2 m_A)) * m_A * u.

The m_A's cancel:

m_p v_p̄ ≈ 4*(m_p/2) * u.

Simplify:

m_p v_p̄ ≈ 2 m_p u.

Divide both sides by m_p:

v_p̄ ≈ 2 u.

But wait, earlier we found u ≈ 0.7683 c. So v_p̄ ≈ 2 * 0.7683 c ≈ 1.5366 c.

Wait, that's impossible because nothing can exceed the speed of light. So this suggests that my assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is invalid.

Hmm, so perhaps the previous approach where the A particles are moving in opposite directions is the correct one, because otherwise, the momentum equation leads to an impossible velocity.

So, let's go back to the case where the initial system is at rest. So, the proton and antiproton are moving with equal and opposite velocities, such that their momenta cancel. So the initial total momentum is zero.

In that case, the four A particles must also have a total momentum of zero.

So, for the four A particles, their momenta must cancel each other.

The simplest way this can happen is if the two A+ and two A- are moving in such a way that their momenta cancel. For example, each A+ could be moving in one direction, and each A- in the opposite, with the same speed.

So, each A+ has momentum gamma(u) m_A u, and each A- has momentum gamma(u) m_A (-u).

So for each pair, the momenta are equal and opposite, so the total momentum is zero.

Thus, the calculation proceeds as earlier.

So, the velocity u is approximately 0.77c, which matches option A.

But wait, let me think again. Are there any other factors I might have missed?

Wait, another approach is using the conservation of four-momentum. The total four-momentum before annihilation must equal the total four-momentum after.

The initial four-momentum is the sum of the proton and antiproton's four-momenta.

Assuming the initial system is at rest, the total momentum is zero, and the total energy is 2 gamma(v) m_p c², as before.

But perhaps it's easier to compute in the center-of-momentum frame.

Wait, but if the system is at rest, then that's already the center-of-momentum frame.

Alternatively, if the system isn't at rest, then the frame would have to be adjusted.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

In any case, given the initial approach leads me to option A, but the other approach, where the initial system is not at rest, leads to an impossible velocity, I think the correct scenario is the initial system being at rest, leading to the velocity of A being approximately 0.77c.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process:

**Initial System**: A proton (\(p\)) and an antiproton (\(\bar{p}\)) annihilate to produce two \(A^+\) and two \(A^-\). The antiproton is stated to be moving slowly, implying its velocity is much smaller than the speed of light (\(c\)).

### Key Assumptions and Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before annihilation equals the total energy after annihilation.
2. **Momentum Conservation**: The total momentum before annihilation equals the total momentum after annihilation.

#### Initial Energy and Momentum
- The rest energy of a proton (or antiproton) is \(m_p c^2 \approx 938 \, \text{MeV}\).
- Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. Thus, the total initial energy is approximately:
  \[
  E_{\text{initial}} \approx 2 m_p c^2
  \]
- The initial momentum is zero if the proton and antiproton are moving with equal and opposite velocities, making the system effectively at rest.

#### Final Energy and Momentum
- After annihilation, four particles (\(2A^+\) and \(2A^-\)) are produced. Each \(A\) particle has rest energy \(m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV}\).
- The total energy after annihilation is:
  \[
  E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma m_A c^2
  \]
  where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}\) is the Lorentz factor for the velocity \(u\) of the \(A\) particles.
- The total momentum after annihilation must also be zero, implying the \(A\) particles are symmetrically distributed in opposite directions with the same speed \(u\).

### Energy Conservation Equation
Using energy conservation:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}
\]
\[
2 m_p c^2 = 4 \gamma m_A c^2
\]
Dividing through by \(c^2\) and simplifying:
\[
\gamma = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}
\]
Substituting \(m_p \approx 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) and \(m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\):
\[
\gamma = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} \approx 1.5633
\]

### Solving for \(u\)
The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}
\]
Rearranging:
\[
1 - u^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\gamma^2}
\]
\[
u^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}
\]
Substituting \(\gamma \approx 1.5633\):
\[
u^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1.5633)^2} \approx 1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
u/c = \sqrt{0.5905} \approx 0.7683
\]
Thus:
\[
u \approx 0.7683c
\]

### Final Answer
The velocity of particle \(A\) is approximately \(0.77c\), which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again. The question is about an annihilation process: a proton and an antiproton annihilate to produce two A+ and two A- particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, with different velocities.

Hmm, annihilation... right, when particles and their antiparticles meet, they convert their mass into energy, usually producing other particles. But wait, in this case, they produce two of each A+ and A-. So the initial particles are a proton and antiproton. Proton is a baryon, and so is the antiproton. Oh wait, protons have a certain mass, and so do antiprotons. So their rest mass energy should be considered.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh, so maybe we can approximate that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass. So the initial momentum might be mostly from the proton? Or maybe since the antiproton is moving slowly, we can assume it's at rest? Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

So, the initial system is a proton and an antiproton. Let's denote their masses. The mass of a proton (and antiproton) is about 938 MeV/c². So each has a rest mass energy of approximately 938 MeV. But the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass. So perhaps we can approximate the initial energy as the sum of their rest energies, but that depends on their velocities.

Wait, but since the proton is moving toward the antiproton (assuming they are colliding), but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm, maybe the setup is that the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, no, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is at rest? Or perhaps both are moving, but the antiproton's velocity is much less than the proton's. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the initial setup.

Wait, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2 A+ + 2 A-. So the initial system is a proton and an antiproton. The problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, which suggests that its velocity is much less than c, so its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass. So maybe we can approximate that the initial energy is just the sum of their rest energies plus any kinetic energy. But since the antiproton is moving, perhaps the initial total momentum isn't zero.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving and the proton is at rest, then the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, its momentum is small compared to its rest mass times c.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the antiproton is at rest, given that it's moving slowly. But I'm not sure. Let me try to think about conservation of energy and momentum.

In any case, the initial total energy is the sum of the energies of the proton and the antiproton. The initial momentum is the sum of their momenta. After the annihilation, we have four particles: two A+ and two A-.

Wait, but in the problem, the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. So each A is lighter than the proton, which is about 938 MeV. So the initial rest mass energy is 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. The final rest mass energy is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. So, the initial rest mass is higher than the final rest mass, which makes sense because some energy is converted into kinetic energy of the products.

But wait, this is in the center-of-momentum frame? Or in the lab frame? Hmm, probably we're considering the lab frame where one particle is at rest, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, but that might not hold.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps we can model the initial system as a proton at rest and the antiproton has some small velocity. But since it's moving slowly, perhaps we can approximate its velocity as zero, but that's possibly an oversimplification.

Alternatively, maybe the initial system's total rest mass is given by the sum of the proton and antiproton rest masses. But wait, wait, no. The rest mass of the system would be different because the particles are moving. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the approximation that the initial particles are at rest, so the total energy is the sum of their rest energies. But wait, that would only be the case if they are both at rest, but the antiproton is moving, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the conservation of energy and momentum. Let me denote:

Initial particles: proton (p) and antiproton (p̄). Let’s say the proton is moving with velocity v_p and the antiproton is moving with velocity v_p̄. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps v_p̄ ≈ 0, or that its velocity is much less than c.

Wait, but the problem statement isn't clear on whether the proton is moving or the antiproton. Hmm. Maybe the setup is that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it. If that's the case, the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton. But the antiproton's velocity is slow, so its momentum is small.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the center of mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero. Because the proton and antiproton have equal and opposite momenta. But that's only the case if they have the same speed in opposite directions. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps the proton is moving in the opposite direction with the same speed, making the total momentum zero. That would make sense because in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that. Hmm, perhaps I should make some assumptions. Let me proceed under the assumption that the initial system's total momentum is zero, which would make the center of mass frame the same as the lab frame. So the total initial momentum is zero.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, and the proton is at rest, then the total initial momentum is not zero. So that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the system's initial momentum is zero, so the proton and antiproton are moving with equal and opposite velocities. So their momenta cancel each other out.

But if that's the case, then the initial system's total momentum is zero, and the products must also have zero total momentum.

So, in the initial frame, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the proton and antiproton. If they're moving with equal and opposite velocities, then yes, their momenta cancel. But let me think: for a proton and antiproton, their rest masses are the same, so if they have velocities v and -v, their energies would be E_p = gamma * m_p c² and similarly for E_p̄. The total energy would be 2 gamma m_p c².

But wait, in the problem statement, the antiproton is moving slowly. So if the initial system's momentum is zero, then the velocities of the proton and antiproton must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the proton is moving quickly? That seems contradictory. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the initial system is at rest. But that would mean the proton and antiproton are moving with equal and opposite momenta. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the proton is moving quickly, but that would require their momenta to balance.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the non-relativistic approximation, given that the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps we can approximate the initial energy as the sum of their rest energies and their kinetic energies treated non-relativistically.

Wait, but the problem is about finding the velocity of the A particles. So perhaps the products are moving with some velocity that can be found via conservation laws.

Wait, let's think about this. After annihilation, we have four particles: two A+ and two A-. Let me assume they all move in the same direction, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, they could be moving in pairs, but perhaps in opposite directions.

Wait, but without knowing the directions, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps all four particles move together with the same velocity, but that might not be the case either.

Hmm, perhaps the products are moving in such a way that their total momentum equals the initial momentum. So if the initial momentum is zero (assuming the proton and antiproton are moving with equal and opposite momenta), then the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That would imply that the products are moving symmetrically in some way.

Wait, but the products are two A+ and two A-. For the total momentum to be zero, maybe the two A+ are moving in one direction and the two A- in the opposite, with appropriate velocities and masses. Or perhaps they all move in pairs, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair of A+ and A- combines into something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider that all four particles move together with the same velocity, so their total momentum can be calculated as (4 m_A v) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ), but that's a bit messy.

Wait, but if the initial system's total momentum is zero, then the products must have total momentum zero as well. So the vector sum of their momenta must be zero.

Hmm, perhaps the simplest scenario is that the four particles move in such a way that their momenta cancel. For example, two might move in one direction and two in the opposite, each with the same speed but opposite directions. But since each A has the same mass, their momenta would be same in magnitude but opposite in direction, leading to a total momentum of zero.

Wait, but that would require the two pairs to have symmetric momenta. So, for example, two A+ moving in the same direction and two A- moving in the opposite. But A+ and A- have the same mass, so their momenta would cancel each other.

Wait, but that would require that the A+ and A- are moving in opposite directions, each with the same speed. So their momentum vectors would cancel out. So the total momentum of all four would be zero.

But how does that help me find the velocity of each A particle?

Alternatively, perhaps each pair (A+ and A-) are moving together, but that's getting too vague.

Hmm, maybe I should think about energy and momentum conservation.

Let me denote variables:

Initial energy: E_initial = E_p + E_p̄

Initial momentum: p_initial = p_p + p_p̄

But if the initial system is at rest, then p_initial = 0, so E_initial = E_p + E_p̄ = (gamma_p + gamma_p̄) m_p c².

But if the system is at rest, then gamma_p = gamma_p̄, and their velocities are opposite. So, for example, if the proton is moving with velocity v, the antiproton would be moving with velocity -v, so that their momenta cancel each other.

In that case, E_initial = 2 gamma_p m_p c².

After the annihilation, the system's energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles. Each A has energy E_A = gamma_A m_A c².

The total energy after is 4 gamma_A m_A c².

But wait, the rest mass energy of the initial system isn't just 2 m_p c², because they're moving. Hmm, no, because if they're moving, their rest masses are still m_p each, but their energies are higher.

Wait, but if the initial system is at rest, then the initial energy is the sum of their rest energies, which would be 2 m_p c². But wait, no. Because if they are moving with some velocity, their energies are higher than their rest masses. Wait, but if the initial system is at rest, the total momentum is zero, so the individual momenta must cancel each other.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

Assuming the initial system is at rest: so the total momentum is zero. So the proton and antiproton are moving in opposite directions with velocities v and -v, respectively, such that their momenta cancel.

In that case, the total energy would be E_initial = gamma(v) m_p c² + gamma(v) m_p c² = 2 gamma(v) m_p c².

After annihilation, the four A particles must have the same total energy E_final = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

But wait, also, the total momentum after must be zero, so the vector sum of their momenta must be zero. So perhaps each A is moving with velocity u such that their momenta cancel each other.

Wait, but how? If all four are moving in the same direction, their momenta would add up, which can't be zero. So perhaps the A particles are moving in pairs. For example, two A+ move in one direction, and two A- move in the opposite direction, each with the same speed. Because each A+ and A- has the same mass, their momenta would be equal and opposite.

Wait, but the problem states that the products are 2 A+ and 2 A-. So if each A+ is moving with velocity v in, say, the positive direction, and each A- is moving with velocity v in the negative direction, then their momenta would cancel each other. So the total momentum would be zero.

Wait, but that would require each A+ and A- to have the same speed but opposite directions. So the momentum of each A+ is gamma v m_A c, and each A- would have momentum gamma v m_A c in the opposite direction.

But since there are two of each, their total momentum would be 2*(gamma v m_A c) in positive and 2*(gamma v m_A c) in negative direction, which cancels to zero.

So that's a possible scenario.

Now, the total energy after annihilation is the sum of the energies of each A:

E_final = 4 * gamma_A m_A c².

But wait, each A has energy gamma_A m_A c², so four of them would have 4 gamma_A m_A c².

But the initial energy is E_initial = 2 gamma(v) m_p c².

So energy conservation gives:

2 gamma(v) m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

We can simplify this by dividing both sides by c² and canceling terms.

2 gamma(v) m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

Simplify further:

gamma(v) m_p = 2 gamma_A m_A.

Hmm, but we also have to consider momentum conservation. The initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum after must be zero. So in the case where each A+ and A- are moving in opposite directions, their velocities are such that their momenta cancel. So if all A particles are moving with the same speed u, but in opposite directions, their momenta will cancel.

Wait, because for each A+, their momentum is gamma(u) m_A u, and each A- has momentum gamma(u) m_A (-u), so each pair cancels. So the total momentum is zero, satisfying conservation.

So, given that, the energy equation would be:

2 gamma(v) m_p c² = 4 gamma(u) m_A c².

Wait, but I think the gamma(u) is for each A's velocity. So the equation becomes:

2 gamma(v) m_p = 4 gamma(u) m_A.

Wait, but the variables are getting a bit mixed. Maybe I can find a relation between u and v.

But wait, what else do I know? Hmm, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So v is small, maybe non-relativistic. So gamma(v) ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, then v is close to zero. So, gamma(v) ≈ 1. But if the initial system is at rest, then the initial energy would be approximately 2 m_p c². Then, the final energy would be 4 gamma(u) m_A c². So:

2 m_p c² = 4 gamma(u) m_A c².

Divide both sides by c²:

2 m_p = 4 gamma(u) m_A.

Simplify:

gamma(u) m_A = (m_p)/2.

So, gamma(u) = m_p/(2 m_A).

Given that m_p is about 938 MeV/c² and m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So, m_p/(2 m_A) = 938 / (2*300) = 938 / 600 ≈ 1.5633.

So, gamma(u) ≈ 1.5633.

But wait, gamma(u) must be greater than 1, which it is.

Now, gamma(u) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (u²/c²)).

So, 1.5633 = 1 / sqrt(1 - u²/c²).

Squaring both sides:

(1.5633)^2 = 1 / (1 - u²/c²).

1.5633^2 ≈ 2.443.

So, 2.443 = 1/(1 - u²/c²).

Take reciprocal: 1/2.443 ≈ 0.4095 = 1 - u²/c².

So, u²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905.

Take square root: u/c ≈ sqrt(0.5905) ≈ 0.7683.

So, u ≈ 0.7683 c.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c. That's the closest.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I make any incorrect assumptions? Let me check.

I assumed that the initial system is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. Then, the products must also have zero momentum, which I modeled by having each A+ and A- moving with velocity u and -u, respectively. But that's just one scenario. Are there other possibilities?

Alternatively, perhaps all four A particles move together with the same velocity. Let me consider that. Then, the total momentum would be 4 gamma(u) m_A u, which must equal zero. But that's only possible if u is zero, which can't be the case because then the energy wouldn't match. So that's not a feasible scenario.

Thus, the initial assumption that each pair of A particles are moving in opposite directions with the same speed seems correct.

So, in that case, the calculation gives u ≈ 0.7683 c, which rounds to 0.77c, option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

gamma(u) = m_p/(2 m_A).

m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So, 938/(2 * 300) = 938/600 ≈ 1.5633.

Yes, that's correct.

So, gamma(u) = 1.5633.

1.5633 = 1/sqrt(1 - u²/c²).

Squaring, 2.443 = 1/(1 - u²/c²).

So 1 - u²/c² = 1/2.443 ≈ 0.4095.

u²/c² = 1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905.

u/c = sqrt(0.5905) ≈ 0.7683.

Which is 0.7683c, so approximately 0.77c.

So option A is 0.77c.

Wait, but the options are given in the problem as:

Options:
A) 0.77c
B) 0.96c
C) 0.91c
D) 0.86c

So the answer would be option A.

But wait, I assumed that the initial system is at rest, which may not be the case. Because the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, but it doesn't specify whether the proton is moving or not. So perhaps the initial assumption about the system being at rest isn't correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it. So the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton.

In that case, the initial energy would be the proton's rest energy plus the antiproton's total energy.

So E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p̄ m_p c².

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄.

After annihilation, the four A particles must have a total energy E_final and total momentum p_final.

But this complicates things because we have to deal with both energy and momentum conservation.

But since the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can approximate gamma_p̄ ≈ 1, because v_p̄ is much less than c, so v_p̄ ≈ 0, making the antiproton's energy approximately m_p c², and its momentum approximately m_p v_p̄.

But then the initial momentum is just m_p v_p̄.

Now, the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v_p̄², but wait, no, if the antiproton is moving slowly, we can treat its kinetic energy as (1/2) m_p v_p̄², and its rest energy is m_p c².

So E_initial = m_p c² + m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v_p̄² = 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v_p̄².

But this is the non-relativistic case, but perhaps it's a valid approximation since the antiproton is moving slowly.

Now, the final energy is E_final = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

And the final momentum is p_final = 4 gamma_A m_A u, where u is the velocity of each A particle. Assuming all four A particles move in the same direction with velocity u.

Wait, but that's a big assumption. If all four are moving in the same direction, their momentum would add up, which would have to match the initial momentum.

But according to momentum conservation, p_initial = p_final.

So:

m_p v_p̄ ≈ 4 gamma_A m_A u.

But since v_p̄ is small, perhaps I can express u in terms of this equation.

But wait, we also have energy conservation:

E_initial = E_final.

So,

2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v_p̄² ≈ 4 gamma_A m_A c².

But since v_p̄ is small, the term (1/2) m_p v_p̄² is much smaller than 2 m_p c². So perhaps we can neglect it as a first approximation.

Then, 2 m_p c² ≈ 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Dividing both sides by c², we get:

2 m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

gamma_A = m_p/(2 m_A) = 938/(2*300) = 938/600 ≈ 1.5633.

Which brings us back to the same gamma as before. Then, as before, u ≈ 0.7683 c.

But this time, the initial momentum is m_p v_p̄ ≈ 4 gamma_A m_A u.

So substituting gamma_A from above, and u from before:

m_p v_p̄ ≈ 4 * (m_p/(2 m_A)) * m_A u.

Simplify:

m_p v_p̄ ≈ 4*(m_p/(2 m_A)) * m_A * u.

The m_A's cancel:

m_p v_p̄ ≈ 4*(m_p/2) * u.

Simplify:

m_p v_p̄ ≈ 2 m_p u.

Divide both sides by m_p:

v_p̄ ≈ 2 u.

But wait, earlier we found u ≈ 0.7683 c. So v_p̄ ≈ 2 * 0.7683 c ≈ 1.5366 c.

Wait, that's impossible because nothing can exceed the speed of light. So this suggests that my assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is invalid.

Hmm, so perhaps the previous approach where the A particles are moving in opposite directions is the correct one, because otherwise, the momentum equation leads to an impossible velocity.

So, let's go back to the case where the initial system is at rest. So, the proton and antiproton are moving with equal and opposite velocities, such that their momenta cancel. So the initial total momentum is zero.

In that case, the four A particles must also have a total momentum of zero.

So, for the four A particles, their momenta must cancel each other.

The simplest way this can happen is if the two A+ and two A- are moving in such a way that their momenta cancel. For example, each A+ could be moving in one direction, and each A- in the opposite, with the same speed.

So, each A+ has momentum gamma(u) m_A u, and each A- has momentum gamma(u) m_A (-u).

So for each pair, the momenta are equal and opposite, so the total momentum is zero.

Thus, the calculation proceeds as earlier.

So, the velocity u is approximately 0.77c, which matches option A.

But wait, let me think again. Are there any other factors I might have missed?

Wait, another approach is using the conservation of four-momentum. The total four-momentum before annihilation must equal the total four-momentum after.

The initial four-momentum is the sum of the proton and antiproton's four-momenta.

Assuming the initial system is at rest, the total momentum is zero, and the total energy is 2 gamma(v) m_p c², as before.

But perhaps it's easier to compute in the center-of-momentum frame.

Wait, but if the system is at rest, then that's already the center-of-momentum frame.

Alternatively, if the system isn't at rest, then the frame would have to be adjusted.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

In any case, given the initial approach leads me to option A, but the other approach, where the initial system is not at rest, leads to an impossible velocity, I think the correct scenario is the initial system being at rest, leading to the velocity of A being approximately 0.77c.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process:

**Initial System**: A proton (\(p\)) and an antiproton (\(\bar{p}\)) annihilate to produce two \(A^+\) and two \(A^-\). The antiproton is stated to be moving slowly, implying its velocity is much smaller than the speed of light (\(c\)).

### Key Assumptions and Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before annihilation equals the total energy after annihilation.
2. **Momentum Conservation**: The total momentum before annihilation equals the total momentum after annihilation.

#### Initial Energy and Momentum
- The rest energy of a proton (or antiproton) is \(m_p c^2 \approx 938 \, \text{MeV}\).
- Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. Thus, the total initial energy is approximately:
  \[
  E_{\text{initial}} \approx 2 m_p c^2
  \]
- The initial momentum is zero if the proton and antiproton are moving with equal and opposite velocities, making the system effectively at rest.

#### Final Energy and Momentum
- After annihilation, four particles (\(2A^+\) and \(2A^-\)) are produced. Each \(A\) particle has rest energy \(m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV}\).
- The total energy after annihilation is:
  \[
  E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma m_A c^2
  \]
  where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}\) is the Lorentz factor for the velocity \(u\) of the \(A\) particles.
- The total momentum after annihilation must also be zero, implying the \(A\) particles are symmetrically distributed in opposite directions with the same speed \(u\).

### Energy Conservation Equation
Using energy conservation:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}
\]
\[
2 m_p c^2 = 4 \gamma m_A c^2
\]
Dividing through by \(c^2\) and simplifying:
\[
\gamma = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}
\]
Substituting \(m_p \approx 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) and \(m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\):
\[
\gamma = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} \approx 1.5633
\]

### Solving for \(u\)
The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}
\]
Rearranging:
\[
1 - u^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\gamma^2}
\]
\[
u^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}
\]
Substituting \(\gamma \approx 1.5633\):
\[
u^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1.5633)^2} \approx 1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
u/c = \sqrt{0.5905} \approx 0.7683
\]
Thus:
\[
u \approx 0.7683c
\]

### Final Answer
The velocity of particle \(A\) is approximately \(0.77c\), which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
