Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Let's read the question again.

So, there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. I need to find the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ each.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l. Since they're in p orbitals, l should be 1 for each. Oh, because p is l=1. So that makes sense. The state is |1,1,2,-1>. So l1=1, l2=1, total l=2, and m=-1.

The question is about measuring L1z and L2z, each giving -ħ. Since Lz is l multiplied by ħ, right? So if l is 1 for each, then L1z eigenvalues would be -1*ħ each. So each L1z and L2z measurement would be -ħ. So what's the probability of getting both as -ħ?

But wait, the state is a coupled state. So the total angular momentum is |2, -1>. So the state is an eigenstate of L² and Lz. But what about the individual L1z and L2z?

I remember that when you have two particles, their individual angular momenta can be coupled in different ways. The coupled state is a combination of the product states of the individual states. So, to find the probability, I think I need to express the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the product states |l1,m1> |l2,m2>.

Wait, the coupled state is |l1, l2, L, M> = |1,1,2,-1>. The individual states are |m1> and |m2>, so m1 + m2 = M = -1.

So, the product states would have m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1. So possible m1 and m2 pairs would be (0, -1), (1, -2), (-1, 0), (-2,1), etc., but since each l is 1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So possible m1 and m2 pairs that sum to -1 are:

m1, m2:
-1, 0 → sum is -1.
0, -1 → sum is -1.
1, -2 → but m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can only be up to -1. So only the first two possibilities are valid.

Wait, so possible product states are |m1= -1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2= -1>. So the coupled state is a linear combination of these two product states.

The state |L=2, M=-1> is a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

So, the expansion of |1,1,2,-1> in terms of |m1, m2> would involve coefficients for the allowed m1, m2 pairs.

I think the formula for the coefficients involves the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are used to combine angular momenta.

The general expression is |l1, l2, L, M> = sum_{m1, m2} [ <m1, m2 | L, M> ] |m1, m2>, where <m1, m2 | L, M> are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

So for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1, we can find the coefficients.

I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L and M. For specific cases, especially when L is l1 + l2, since 1 + 1 = 2, this is the maximum L.

The state |2, -1> can be written as a sum of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1, and the coefficients are non-zero only for certain m1 and m2.

I recall that for L = l1 + l2, the highest weight state is |l, l> = |l1, l2> with m1=l1, m2=l2.

So for L=2, the highest M is +2. So the state |2,2> would be |1,1> with coefficient 1.

Similarly, the state |2, -2> would be a combination where m1 = -1, m2 = -1, but wait, no. Because m1 + m2 = -2. Since l1=1 and l2=1, each m can be -1, 0, +1. So m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 would sum to -2. So |2, -2> is |m1=-1, m2=-1>, with coefficient 1.

Wait, but in our case, we're looking at M=-1. So for |2, -1>, what are the components?

I think the expansion would have the terms where m1 + m2 = -1.

As I thought before, possible pairs are (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1).

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for these would be sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), but I'm a bit unsure.

Wait, let me think. For two spin-1 particles (since l=1), the combinations for L=2 and M=-1.

The standard Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2 and M=-1 would come from the addition of two l=1 states. The coefficients can be found using the formula or from known tables.

From what I recall, the coefficients for |2, -1> would be:

The state |2, -1> = sqrt(1/3) |m1= -1, m2=0> + sqrt(2/3) |m1=0, m2= -1>.

Wait, no, wait: let's think of how Clebsch-Gordan coefficients work. For L=2, M=-1, the states would be a combination of m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1.

The coefficients for the state |2, -1> can be found using the recursion relations or from standard tables.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of symmetry. The state |2, -1> is a symmetric combination, but wait, no, because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are symmetric under exchange of m1 and m2 only when the state is symmetric, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think of the state |2, M> where M is negative. For M = -1, the state will be a combination of terms where m1 and m2 add to -1. Also, each term will have a certain coefficient.

From the Clebsch-Gordan series, the expansion coefficients for L=2, M=-1 are given by:

|2, -1> = sqrt(1/3) |m1=1, m2=-2> → but wait, m2 can't be -2 as l2=1, so m2 can't be less than -1.

Wait, no. For m2, the possible values are -1,0,1. So M=-1 can come from m1= -1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2= -1.

So the state |2, -1> is a linear combination of these two product states.

So, the coefficients would be:

√(2/3) times |m1=0, m2=-1> plus √(1/3) times |m1=-1, m2=0>.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think about the ladder operators.

The ladder operators for angular momentum can be used to build the states.

The state |2, -1> can be obtained by applying L_- (the lowering operator) to |2,0>, but perhaps that's a longer route.

Alternatively, perhaps looking up a table for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients would help. Let me try to remember.

I think that for L=2, M=-1:

The state is a combination of |m1=1, m2=-2> (but m2 can't be -2) → so that's invalid. So only the terms where m1 and m2 are within the allowed range.

So, the allowed terms are (m1= -1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1). So the coefficients for these two terms would determine the expansion.

I remember that for |2, 2>, the coefficient is 1 for |1,1>, and for |2,1>, it's a combination of |1,0> and |0,1>, but wait no, wait. Wait, no, in our case, the l's are both 1, so m1 and m2 can be -1,0,1.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

After some thought, I think the CG coefficient for |2,-1> in terms of |1, m1> and |1, m2> is:

|2, -1> = sqrt(1/3) |1, -1> |1, 0> + sqrt(2/3) |1, 0> |1, -1>.

Wait, but that's the same as the state |1, 0> |1, -1>, which would sum to M=-1. So the state is a symmetric combination of these two product states.

Wait, wait, but why the coefficients? Let me think about the normalization. The sum of the squares should be 1.

(1/3) + (2/3) = 1, which works. So the coefficients are sqrt(1/3) and sqrt(2/3).

Wait, but why are the coefficients like that? I might need to recall the standard addition. Alternatively, perhaps the state is written as:

|2, -1> = sqrt(2/3) |1,0> |1,-1> + sqrt(1/3) |1,-1> |1,0>.

But wait, these are the same terms, just swapped. Since |1,0> |1,-1> is the same as |1,-1> |1,0> when considering the combined state, because tensor products are ordered as particle 1 and particle 2. So to account for the different orderings, perhaps the coefficients are arranged in a symmetric way.

Wait, actually, the state |1, m1> |1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1 includes the possibilities m1=0, m2=-1 and m1=-1, m2=0.

Hence, the state |2, -1> is a combination of these two product states.

But the coefficients depend on the Clebsch-Gordan expansion. For the state |2, -1>, the expansion is:

|2,-1> = sqrt( (2) / (2*(2)+1) ) |1,0> |1,-1> + sqrt( (1) / (2*(2)+1) ) |1,-1> |1,0>.

Wait, 2*(2)+1 is 5, so the coefficients would be sqrt(2/5) and sqrt(1/5), but that doesn't add up to one when squared.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Another approach: for the state |L, M>, the expansion coefficients can be found using the relation:

< l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M > = [ (2L +1) / ( (l1 + l2 - L + 1)(l1 + l2 - L) ... ) )^(1/2) ] ... but I'm not exactly sure of the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the specific case where l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

I know that the highest weight state is |2,2> = |1,1> |1,1>, with coefficient 1.

The next state is |2,1> which is a combination of |1,1> |1,0> and |1,0> |1,1>.

Wait, but the coefficients for |2,1> would be something like sqrt( ( (2)(2+1) ) / ( (2 +1)(2+2) )) ) or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look up the CG coefficients for specific cases. From what I remember, the CG coefficients can be found in standard references.

Another approach: think about symmetry. The state |2, -1> must be symmetric under exchange of the two particles because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for identical particles (like electrons) should consider symmetry. Wait, but wait, electrons are fermions, so their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But wait, in this question, are we considering spin? The question says to ignore spin, so perhaps we're only considering the orbital angular momentum part.

But wait, the question says to ignore spin, so the state given is purely the orbital angular momentum coupled state. So for orbital angular momentum, the state |l1, l2, L, M> is symmetric under exchange if L = l1 + l2, because L is even or odd accordingly.

Wait, but electrons are fermions, so their combined state (including spin) must be antisymmetric. But since we're ignoring spin, perhaps we can treat them as distinguishable particles for the purposes of this calculation? Hmm, but I'm not sure if that affects the problem here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to not get bogged down and focus on the expansion coefficients.

From the CG tables, for L=2 and M=-1, the expansion is:

|2, -1> = sqrt(1/3) |1, -1> |1, 0> + sqrt(2/3) |1, 0> |1, -1>.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because |1,0> |1,-1> and |1,-1> |1,0> are the same state if the particles are indistinct. Wait, no, because in the tensor product, the order matters. So the first term is particle 1 in m=-1 and particle 2 in m=0, and the second term is particle 1 in m=0 and particle 2 in m=-1.

So the state would be a sum of these two terms.

So the expansion is:

|2,-1> = a |m1=-1, m2=0> + b |m1=0, m2=-1>,

where a² + b² = 1.

What are the coefficients?

I think the standard CG coefficients for L=2, M=-1 are:

a = sqrt( (2) ) / sqrt( 3 ) → sqrt(2/3),

and b = sqrt(1/3).

Wait, because the sum of the squares would be 2/3 + 1/3 = 1.

So,

a = sqrt(2/3),

b = sqrt(1/3).

Wait, but wait, it's possible I have the coefficients the other way. Let me think again.

Looking for the coefficients for |2, -1>, I recall that:

|2, -1> = sqrt(2/3) |1, 0> |1, -1> + sqrt(1/3) |1, -1> |1, 0>.

Wait, but that would imply that the first term has m1=0 and m2=-1, and the second term has m1=-1 and m2=0.

So the coefficients are sqrt(2/3) for m1=0, m2=-1, and sqrt(1/3) for m1=-1, m2=0.

Wait, but why would the coefficients be different for the two terms?

Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are symmetric. I'm getting a bit confused here. Another approach: think about the state |2, -1> as being built from the possible m1 and m2 values that sum to -1.

So the state is |2, -1> = c1 |m1=-1, m2=0> + c2 |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The normalization condition is |c1|^2 + |c2|^2 = 1.

Now, using the ladder operators to find the coefficients.

The state |2, -1> can be obtained by applying L_- (the lowering operator) to |2,0>.

So, L_- |2,0> = ħ sqrt( (2)(2+1) - 0(0-1) ) |2, -1> → Wait, wait, L_- |L, M> = ħ sqrt(L(L+1) - M(M-1)) |L, M-1>.

So for M=0, L=2,

L_- |2,0> = ħ sqrt( 2*3 - 0*(-1) ) |2, -1> = ħ sqrt(6) |2, -1>.

But also, L_- is L1_- + L2_-.

So, L_- |2, 0> = (L1_- + L2_-) |l1=1, m1> |l2=1, m2>.

But for |2,0>, the state is |l1=1, m1=1> |l2=1, m2=-1> + |l1=1, m1=0> |l2=1, m2=0> + |l1=1, m1=-1> |l2=1, m2=1>, but wait, no, no. Wait, |2,0> is a different state. Wait, no, wait. Wait, |2,0> would be a combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 =0.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting off track here. Another approach: perhaps the expansion for |2,-1> is as follows.

The state |2,-1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The coefficients can be found using the CG coefficients, which for L=2, M=-1, are:

The CG coefficient for m1=1 and m2= -2 is zero because m2 can't be -2. So only m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1 are allowed.

The coefficients are sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), but I'm not exactly sure which term has which.

Wait, another approach: the state |2, -1> must be orthogonal to the state |2, -2>, which is |m1=-1, m2=-1>.

So, when we write |2, -1> as a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, the coefficients are orthogonal to |m1=-1, m2=-1>.

But that might not directly help. Alternatively, perhaps the state for |2, -1> is:

sqrt(2/3) |m1=0, m2=-1> + sqrt(1/3) |m1=-1, m2=0>.

So the expansion is:

|2, -1> = sqrt(2/3) |0, -1> + sqrt(1/3) |-1, 0>.

Wait, but in terms of the product states of particle 1 and particle 2, this would mean that for the first term, particle 1 has m1=0 and particle 2 has m2=-1, and the second term has particle 1 m1=-1 and particle 2 m2=0.

So, each term corresponds to a possible outcome when measuring L1z and L2z.

The question is asking for the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ each. So, for each electron, we have L1z |m1> = ħ m1 |m1>, and same for L2z.

So, each m is multiplied by ħ. So if m1 = -1, then L1z is -ħ, and same for m2.

So, to get both L1z and L2z as -ħ, each m must be -1.

So, in the expansion of |2, -1>, the product states where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 would contribute to this measurement outcome.

Wait a second, but in the expansion of |2, -1>, the product states are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. Neither of these have m1 and m2 both equal to -1.

So, in the state |2, -1>, there's no component where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because in the expansion, each term has one m=-1 and the other m=0.

So, when we measure L1z and L2z, the possible outcomes for each measurement are based on the product states present in the expansion. Since none of the product states have m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, the probability of both measurements being -ħ is zero.

Wait, that makes sense now. So the probability would be zero because the state doesn't include any product state where both m1 and m2 are -1.

So, the correct answer should be D) 0.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given coupled angular momentum state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ for two electrons in p orbitals. The state represents the total angular momentum quantum numbers $l_1=1$, $l_2=1$, $L=2$, and $M=-1$. The goal is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Orbital Angular Momentum States**: Each electron has $l=1$, so the possible $m$ values for each are $m_1, m_2 \in \{-1, 0, +1\}$. The total angular momentum $M$ is given as $-1$, which implies $m_1 + m_2 = -1$.

2. **Expansion of $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$**: The coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the product states $|m_1\rangle |m_2\rangle$ where $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The valid pairs $(m_1, m_2)$ are:
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$

   The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ are:
   \[
   |1,1,2,-1\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} |m_1=0, m_2=-1\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} |m_1=-1, m_2=0\rangle
   \]
   These coefficients ensure proper normalization, as $\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\right)^2 = 1$.

3. **Measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$**: The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are proportional to $m_1$ and $m_2$, respectively. Specifically:
   \[
   L_{1z} = m_1 \hbar, \quad L_{2z} = m_2 \hbar
   \]
   To measure both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, we require $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. However, in the expansion of $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$, there is no component where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The state only includes the terms $|m_1=-1, m_2=0\rangle$ and $|m_1=0, m_2=-1\rangle$.

4. **Probability Calculation**: Since the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ does not contain any component where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is zero.

### Conclusion:
The joint probability of measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ each is **0**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Let's read the question again.

So, there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. I need to find the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ each.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l. Since they're in p orbitals, l should be 1 for each. Oh, because p is l=1. So that makes sense. The state is |1,1,2,-1>. So l1=1, l2=1, total l=2, and m=-1.

The question is about measuring L1z and L2z, each giving -ħ. Since Lz is l multiplied by ħ, right? So if l is 1 for each, then L1z eigenvalues would be -1*ħ each. So each L1z and L2z measurement would be -ħ. So what's the probability of getting both as -ħ?

But wait, the state is a coupled state. So the total angular momentum is |2, -1>. So the state is an eigenstate of L² and Lz. But what about the individual L1z and L2z?

I remember that when you have two particles, their individual angular momenta can be coupled in different ways. The coupled state is a combination of the product states of the individual states. So, to find the probability, I think I need to express the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the product states |l1,m1> |l2,m2>.

Wait, the coupled state is |l1, l2, L, M> = |1,1,2,-1>. The individual states are |m1> and |m2>, so m1 + m2 = M = -1.

So, the product states would have m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1. So possible m1 and m2 pairs would be (0, -1), (1, -2), (-1, 0), (-2,1), etc., but since each l is 1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So possible m1 and m2 pairs that sum to -1 are:

m1, m2:
-1, 0 → sum is -1.
0, -1 → sum is -1.
1, -2 → but m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can only be up to -1. So only the first two possibilities are valid.

Wait, so possible product states are |m1= -1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2= -1>. So the coupled state is a linear combination of these two product states.

The state |L=2, M=-1> is a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

So, the expansion of |1,1,2,-1> in terms of |m1, m2> would involve coefficients for the allowed m1, m2 pairs.

I think the formula for the coefficients involves the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are used to combine angular momenta.

The general expression is |l1, l2, L, M> = sum_{m1, m2} [ <m1, m2 | L, M> ] |m1, m2>, where <m1, m2 | L, M> are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

So for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1, we can find the coefficients.

I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L and M. For specific cases, especially when L is l1 + l2, since 1 + 1 = 2, this is the maximum L.

The state |2, -1> can be written as a sum of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1, and the coefficients are non-zero only for certain m1 and m2.

I recall that for L = l1 + l2, the highest weight state is |l, l> = |l1, l2> with m1=l1, m2=l2.

So for L=2, the highest M is +2. So the state |2,2> would be |1,1> with coefficient 1.

Similarly, the state |2, -2> would be a combination where m1 = -1, m2 = -1, but wait, no. Because m1 + m2 = -2. Since l1=1 and l2=1, each m can be -1, 0, +1. So m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 would sum to -2. So |2, -2> is |m1=-1, m2=-1>, with coefficient 1.

Wait, but in our case, we're looking at M=-1. So for |2, -1>, what are the components?

I think the expansion would have the terms where m1 + m2 = -1.

As I thought before, possible pairs are (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1).

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for these would be sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), but I'm a bit unsure.

Wait, let me think. For two spin-1 particles (since l=1), the combinations for L=2 and M=-1.

The standard Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2 and M=-1 would come from the addition of two l=1 states. The coefficients can be found using the formula or from known tables.

From what I recall, the coefficients for |2, -1> would be:

The state |2, -1> = sqrt(1/3) |m1= -1, m2=0> + sqrt(2/3) |m1=0, m2= -1>.

Wait, no, wait: let's think of how Clebsch-Gordan coefficients work. For L=2, M=-1, the states would be a combination of m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1.

The coefficients for the state |2, -1> can be found using the recursion relations or from standard tables.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of symmetry. The state |2, -1> is a symmetric combination, but wait, no, because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are symmetric under exchange of m1 and m2 only when the state is symmetric, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think of the state |2, M> where M is negative. For M = -1, the state will be a combination of terms where m1 and m2 add to -1. Also, each term will have a certain coefficient.

From the Clebsch-Gordan series, the expansion coefficients for L=2, M=-1 are given by:

|2, -1> = sqrt(1/3) |m1=1, m2=-2> → but wait, m2 can't be -2 as l2=1, so m2 can't be less than -1.

Wait, no. For m2, the possible values are -1,0,1. So M=-1 can come from m1= -1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2= -1.

So the state |2, -1> is a linear combination of these two product states.

So, the coefficients would be:

√(2/3) times |m1=0, m2=-1> plus √(1/3) times |m1=-1, m2=0>.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think about the ladder operators.

The ladder operators for angular momentum can be used to build the states.

The state |2, -1> can be obtained by applying L_- (the lowering operator) to |2,0>, but perhaps that's a longer route.

Alternatively, perhaps looking up a table for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients would help. Let me try to remember.

I think that for L=2, M=-1:

The state is a combination of |m1=1, m2=-2> (but m2 can't be -2) → so that's invalid. So only the terms where m1 and m2 are within the allowed range.

So, the allowed terms are (m1= -1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1). So the coefficients for these two terms would determine the expansion.

I remember that for |2, 2>, the coefficient is 1 for |1,1>, and for |2,1>, it's a combination of |1,0> and |0,1>, but wait no, wait. Wait, no, in our case, the l's are both 1, so m1 and m2 can be -1,0,1.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

After some thought, I think the CG coefficient for |2,-1> in terms of |1, m1> and |1, m2> is:

|2, -1> = sqrt(1/3) |1, -1> |1, 0> + sqrt(2/3) |1, 0> |1, -1>.

Wait, but that's the same as the state |1, 0> |1, -1>, which would sum to M=-1. So the state is a symmetric combination of these two product states.

Wait, wait, but why the coefficients? Let me think about the normalization. The sum of the squares should be 1.

(1/3) + (2/3) = 1, which works. So the coefficients are sqrt(1/3) and sqrt(2/3).

Wait, but why are the coefficients like that? I might need to recall the standard addition. Alternatively, perhaps the state is written as:

|2, -1> = sqrt(2/3) |1,0> |1,-1> + sqrt(1/3) |1,-1> |1,0>.

But wait, these are the same terms, just swapped. Since |1,0> |1,-1> is the same as |1,-1> |1,0> when considering the combined state, because tensor products are ordered as particle 1 and particle 2. So to account for the different orderings, perhaps the coefficients are arranged in a symmetric way.

Wait, actually, the state |1, m1> |1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1 includes the possibilities m1=0, m2=-1 and m1=-1, m2=0.

Hence, the state |2, -1> is a combination of these two product states.

But the coefficients depend on the Clebsch-Gordan expansion. For the state |2, -1>, the expansion is:

|2,-1> = sqrt( (2) / (2*(2)+1) ) |1,0> |1,-1> + sqrt( (1) / (2*(2)+1) ) |1,-1> |1,0>.

Wait, 2*(2)+1 is 5, so the coefficients would be sqrt(2/5) and sqrt(1/5), but that doesn't add up to one when squared.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Another approach: for the state |L, M>, the expansion coefficients can be found using the relation:

< l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M > = [ (2L +1) / ( (l1 + l2 - L + 1)(l1 + l2 - L) ... ) )^(1/2) ] ... but I'm not exactly sure of the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the specific case where l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

I know that the highest weight state is |2,2> = |1,1> |1,1>, with coefficient 1.

The next state is |2,1> which is a combination of |1,1> |1,0> and |1,0> |1,1>.

Wait, but the coefficients for |2,1> would be something like sqrt( ( (2)(2+1) ) / ( (2 +1)(2+2) )) ) or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look up the CG coefficients for specific cases. From what I remember, the CG coefficients can be found in standard references.

Another approach: think about symmetry. The state |2, -1> must be symmetric under exchange of the two particles because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for identical particles (like electrons) should consider symmetry. Wait, but wait, electrons are fermions, so their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But wait, in this question, are we considering spin? The question says to ignore spin, so perhaps we're only considering the orbital angular momentum part.

But wait, the question says to ignore spin, so the state given is purely the orbital angular momentum coupled state. So for orbital angular momentum, the state |l1, l2, L, M> is symmetric under exchange if L = l1 + l2, because L is even or odd accordingly.

Wait, but electrons are fermions, so their combined state (including spin) must be antisymmetric. But since we're ignoring spin, perhaps we can treat them as distinguishable particles for the purposes of this calculation? Hmm, but I'm not sure if that affects the problem here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to not get bogged down and focus on the expansion coefficients.

From the CG tables, for L=2 and M=-1, the expansion is:

|2, -1> = sqrt(1/3) |1, -1> |1, 0> + sqrt(2/3) |1, 0> |1, -1>.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because |1,0> |1,-1> and |1,-1> |1,0> are the same state if the particles are indistinct. Wait, no, because in the tensor product, the order matters. So the first term is particle 1 in m=-1 and particle 2 in m=0, and the second term is particle 1 in m=0 and particle 2 in m=-1.

So the state would be a sum of these two terms.

So the expansion is:

|2,-1> = a |m1=-1, m2=0> + b |m1=0, m2=-1>,

where a² + b² = 1.

What are the coefficients?

I think the standard CG coefficients for L=2, M=-1 are:

a = sqrt( (2) ) / sqrt( 3 ) → sqrt(2/3),

and b = sqrt(1/3).

Wait, because the sum of the squares would be 2/3 + 1/3 = 1.

So,

a = sqrt(2/3),

b = sqrt(1/3).

Wait, but wait, it's possible I have the coefficients the other way. Let me think again.

Looking for the coefficients for |2, -1>, I recall that:

|2, -1> = sqrt(2/3) |1, 0> |1, -1> + sqrt(1/3) |1, -1> |1, 0>.

Wait, but that would imply that the first term has m1=0 and m2=-1, and the second term has m1=-1 and m2=0.

So the coefficients are sqrt(2/3) for m1=0, m2=-1, and sqrt(1/3) for m1=-1, m2=0.

Wait, but why would the coefficients be different for the two terms?

Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are symmetric. I'm getting a bit confused here. Another approach: think about the state |2, -1> as being built from the possible m1 and m2 values that sum to -1.

So the state is |2, -1> = c1 |m1=-1, m2=0> + c2 |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The normalization condition is |c1|^2 + |c2|^2 = 1.

Now, using the ladder operators to find the coefficients.

The state |2, -1> can be obtained by applying L_- (the lowering operator) to |2,0>.

So, L_- |2,0> = ħ sqrt( (2)(2+1) - 0(0-1) ) |2, -1> → Wait, wait, L_- |L, M> = ħ sqrt(L(L+1) - M(M-1)) |L, M-1>.

So for M=0, L=2,

L_- |2,0> = ħ sqrt( 2*3 - 0*(-1) ) |2, -1> = ħ sqrt(6) |2, -1>.

But also, L_- is L1_- + L2_-.

So, L_- |2, 0> = (L1_- + L2_-) |l1=1, m1> |l2=1, m2>.

But for |2,0>, the state is |l1=1, m1=1> |l2=1, m2=-1> + |l1=1, m1=0> |l2=1, m2=0> + |l1=1, m1=-1> |l2=1, m2=1>, but wait, no, no. Wait, |2,0> is a different state. Wait, no, wait. Wait, |2,0> would be a combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 =0.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting off track here. Another approach: perhaps the expansion for |2,-1> is as follows.

The state |2,-1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The coefficients can be found using the CG coefficients, which for L=2, M=-1, are:

The CG coefficient for m1=1 and m2= -2 is zero because m2 can't be -2. So only m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1 are allowed.

The coefficients are sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), but I'm not exactly sure which term has which.

Wait, another approach: the state |2, -1> must be orthogonal to the state |2, -2>, which is |m1=-1, m2=-1>.

So, when we write |2, -1> as a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, the coefficients are orthogonal to |m1=-1, m2=-1>.

But that might not directly help. Alternatively, perhaps the state for |2, -1> is:

sqrt(2/3) |m1=0, m2=-1> + sqrt(1/3) |m1=-1, m2=0>.

So the expansion is:

|2, -1> = sqrt(2/3) |0, -1> + sqrt(1/3) |-1, 0>.

Wait, but in terms of the product states of particle 1 and particle 2, this would mean that for the first term, particle 1 has m1=0 and particle 2 has m2=-1, and the second term has particle 1 m1=-1 and particle 2 m2=0.

So, each term corresponds to a possible outcome when measuring L1z and L2z.

The question is asking for the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ each. So, for each electron, we have L1z |m1> = ħ m1 |m1>, and same for L2z.

So, each m is multiplied by ħ. So if m1 = -1, then L1z is -ħ, and same for m2.

So, to get both L1z and L2z as -ħ, each m must be -1.

So, in the expansion of |2, -1>, the product states where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 would contribute to this measurement outcome.

Wait a second, but in the expansion of |2, -1>, the product states are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. Neither of these have m1 and m2 both equal to -1.

So, in the state |2, -1>, there's no component where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because in the expansion, each term has one m=-1 and the other m=0.

So, when we measure L1z and L2z, the possible outcomes for each measurement are based on the product states present in the expansion. Since none of the product states have m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, the probability of both measurements being -ħ is zero.

Wait, that makes sense now. So the probability would be zero because the state doesn't include any product state where both m1 and m2 are -1.

So, the correct answer should be D) 0.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given coupled angular momentum state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ for two electrons in p orbitals. The state represents the total angular momentum quantum numbers $l_1=1$, $l_2=1$, $L=2$, and $M=-1$. The goal is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Orbital Angular Momentum States**: Each electron has $l=1$, so the possible $m$ values for each are $m_1, m_2 \in \{-1, 0, +1\}$. The total angular momentum $M$ is given as $-1$, which implies $m_1 + m_2 = -1$.

2. **Expansion of $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$**: The coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the product states $|m_1\rangle |m_2\rangle$ where $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The valid pairs $(m_1, m_2)$ are:
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$

   The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ are:
   \[
   |1,1,2,-1\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} |m_1=0, m_2=-1\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} |m_1=-1, m_2=0\rangle
   \]
   These coefficients ensure proper normalization, as $\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\right)^2 = 1$.

3. **Measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$**: The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are proportional to $m_1$ and $m_2$, respectively. Specifically:
   \[
   L_{1z} = m_1 \hbar, \quad L_{2z} = m_2 \hbar
   \]
   To measure both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, we require $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. However, in the expansion of $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$, there is no component where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The state only includes the terms $|m_1=-1, m_2=0\rangle$ and $|m_1=0, m_2=-1\rangle$.

4. **Probability Calculation**: Since the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ does not contain any component where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is zero.

### Conclusion:
The joint probability of measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ each is **0**.
