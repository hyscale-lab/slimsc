Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Let me see, the problem states that I have 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, that's a mix of a weak acid, a strong acid, and a strong base. Interesting.

Wait, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider neutralization reactions. So, the first thing I should probably do is figure out how much of each species is present in terms of moles and then see what reacts.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each component. Oh right, moles = concentration (M) multiplied by volume (L). I'll need to convert the volumes from milliliters to liters.

Starting with CH3COOH: 500 mL is 0.5 L, and it's 0.1 M. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely.

Next, HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L, 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates into H+ and Cl- ions.

Then Ba(OH)2: 300 mL is 0.3 L, 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions. So moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each mole gives two OH-, the total moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when you mix all these together, the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react. Also, the H+ from CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, will react with OH- as well.

Wait, but I think the order matters. The strong acid and strong base will neutralize each other first, and then see how much of the weak acid is left to react with any remaining OH- or H+.

Wait, let's see: the H+ comes from HCl (strong acid) and CH3COOH (weak acid). The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2 (strong base).

So, the total H+ would be from HCl and CH3COOH, and the total OH- is from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, actually, no. Because in solution, HCl will donate H+ completely, CH3COOH will donate some H+ (but not completely because it's weak), and Ba(OH)2 will donate OH-.

But wait, the problem is that H+ from HCl will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2. Let's calculate the moles of H+ and OH-.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles. Plus the H+ from CH3COOH: which is a weak acid, so I can't ignore it. Wait, but maybe the strong acid and strong base will neutralize each other, and then the weak acid will react with any excess OH- or H+.

So, let's first calculate the moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, sorry, HCl gives H+ (strong). Ba(OH)2 gives OH- (strong). So, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

So, when they react, moles of H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. Which one is in excess?

H+ = 0.08, OH- = 0.18. So OH- is in excess by 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

So after neutralization, we have 0.10 moles of OH- left. But wait, what about the CH3COOH?

Because CH3COOH is an acid. So, any OH- remaining would react with the CH3COOH.

So, the OH- will react with CH3COOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.

So, let's see how much OH- is left after reacting with CH3COOH.

We have 0.10 moles of OH- from earlier. The CH3COOH has 0.05 moles available.

So, OH- will react with CH3COOH. How much OH- is consumed?

Each mole of CH3COOH can neutralize one mole of OH-.

So, OH- available initially after HCl and Ba(OH)2 reaction: 0.10 moles.

CH3COOH has 0.05 moles. So, after reaction, OH- will have 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles left.

Wait, but wait: no, because when OH- reacts with CH3COOH, it's neutralizing the H+ in CH3COOH. So, the OH- is 0.10, and the CH3COOH has 0.05 H+ available (since it's a weak acid, but in this case, it's the amount before considering the reaction). So, the OH- will take all 0.05 H+ from CH3COOH, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- left.

Wait, but let me think again. The CH3COOH can donate a maximum of 0.05 moles of H+ (if it were a strong acid), but it's weak, so in reality, it donates much less. But in this case, since the solution is being neutralized by OH-, which is a strong base, it would deprotonate the weak acid completely because the OH- is in excess. Hmm, maybe that's the case.

Wait, because OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the weak acid. So the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 =0.05 moles of OH-.

But wait, what about the solution after all these reactions. So, the total solution volume is 500 +400+300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles, which would make the solution basic. So, the pH is determined by the excess OH-.

But wait, let me double-check. Let's go step by step.

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

2. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O.

Moles after reaction: H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18.

H+ will be consumed by OH-: so after reaction, H+ =0 (since OH- is in excess), and OH- = 0.18 -0.08 =0.10 mol.

So now, we have 0.10 mol of OH-.

Then, this OH- reacts with CH3COOH. Each mole of OH- will react with one mole of CH3COOH to produce CH3COO- and water.

CH3COOH has 0.05 mol. OH- has 0.10 mol.

So, CH3COOH will be completely consumed, and OH- will have 0.10 -0.05=0.05 mol left.

So, the solution now has 0.05 mol of OH- in 1.2 L.

Wait, but wait a second. When OH- reacts with CH3COOH, it's a base reacting with a weak acid, so the CH3COOH is a proton donor, and OH- is the acceptor. So yes, the OH- will deprotonate CH3COOH, making acetate ions.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.05 mol.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Now, to find pH, we need to find pOH first. pOH = -log[OH-].

So, [OH-] = 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 -1.38 =12.62.

Wait, so the pH is around 12.62. Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So that's the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any steps. Let me recount:

- HCl (0.08 mol H+) and Ba(OH)2 (0.18 mol OH-) react. H+ is completely neutralized, leaving 0.10 mol OH-.

- The remaining OH- (0.10 mol) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 mol). All CH3COOH is consumed, leaving OH- =0.05 mol.

- [OH-] =0.05 /1.2 L≈0.04167 M.

pOH = log(1/0.04167) → wait, no, pOH is -log(0.04167). Let me calculate:

0.04167 is approximately 4.167e-2.

Log(4.167e-2) is around log(4.167) + log(1e-2). Log(4.167) is about 0.62, so 0.62 -2= -1.38. So pOH is 1.38. Thus, pH =14-1.38=12.62.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be option A.

To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the reaction between the given acids and base. The solution contains:

1. **CH3COOH (weak acid)**:  
   - Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L, Concentration = 0.1 M  
   - Moles of CH3COOH = \( 0.1 \times 0.5 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **HCl (strong acid)**:  
   - Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L, Concentration = 0.2 M  
   - Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \times 0.4 = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - HCl fully dissociates into \( \text{H}^+ \) and \( \text{Cl}^- \), so moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) = 0.08 mol.

3. **Ba(OH)2 (strong base)**:  
   - Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L, Concentration = 0.3 M  
   - Moles of Ba(OH)2 = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of \( \text{OH}^- \), so moles of \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 1: Neutralization of HCl and Ba(OH)2
The \( \text{H}^+ \) from HCl reacts with \( \text{OH}^- \) from Ba(OH)2:  
\[
\text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]
- Moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) = 0.08 mol, Moles of \( \text{OH}^- \) = 0.18 mol.  
- After neutralization, \( \text{H}^+ \) is completely consumed, and \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{OH}^- \) remains.

### Step 2: Reaction of Remaining OH⁻ with CH3COOH
The remaining \( \text{OH}^- \) reacts with CH3COOH:  
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \to \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]
- Moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol, Moles of \( \text{OH}^- \) = 0.10 mol.  
- CH3COOH is completely consumed, leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{OH}^- \).

### Step 3: Calculate [OH⁻] and pH
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]
The concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) is:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of OH}^-}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
\]
The pOH is:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
\]
The pH is:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, which corresponds to option **A**.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions.

H+ = 0.08, OH- = 0.18. So OH- is in excess by 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

So after neutralization, we have 0.10 moles of OH- left. But wait, what about the CH3COOH?

Because CH3COOH is an acid. So, any OH- remaining would react with the CH3COOH.

So, the OH- will react with CH3COOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.

So, let's see how much OH- is left after reacting with CH3COOH.

But wait, what about the solution after all these reactions. So, the total solution volume is 500 +400+300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles, which would make the solution basic. So, the pH is determined by the excess OH-.

But wait, let me double-check. Let's go step by step.

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

2. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O.

Moles after reaction: H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18.

H+ will be consumed by OH-: so after reaction, H+ =0 (since OH- is in excess), and OH- = 0.18 -0.08 =0.10 mol.

So now, we have 0.10 mol of OH-.

Then, this OH- reacts with CH3COOH. Each mole of OH- will react with one mole of CH3COOH to produce CH3COO- and water.

CH3COOH has 0.05 mol. OH- has 0.10 mol.

So, CH3COOH will be completely consumed, and OH- will have 0.10 -0.05=0.05 mol left.

So, the solution now has 0.05 mol of OH- in 1.2 L.

Wait, but wait a second. When OH- reacts with CH3COOH, it's a base reacting with a weak acid, so the CH3COOH is a proton donor, and OH- is the acceptor. So yes, the OH- will deprotonate CH3COOH, making acetate ions.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.05 mol.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Now, to find pH, we need to find pOH first. pOH = -log[OH-].

So, [OH-] = 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 -1.38 =12.62.

Wait, so the pH is around 12.62. Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So that's the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any steps. Let me recount:

- HCl (0.08 mol H+) and Ba(OH)2 (0.18 mol OH-) react. H+ is completely neutralized, leaving 0.10 mol OH-.

- The remaining OH- (0.10 mol) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 mol). All CH3COOH is consumed, leaving OH- =0.05 mol.

- [OH-] =0.05 /1.2 L≈0.04167 M.

pOH = log(1/0.04167) → wait, no, pOH is -log(0.04167). Let me calculate:

0.04167 is approximately 4.167e-2.

Log(4.167e-2) is around log(4.167) + log(1e-2). Log(4.167) is about 0.62, so 0.62 -2= -1.38. So pOH is 1.38. Thus, pH =14-1.38=12.62.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the reaction between the given acids and base. The solution contains:

1. **CH3COOH (weak acid)**:  
   - Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L, Concentration = 0.1 M  
   - Moles of CH3COOH = \( 0.1 \times 0.5 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **HCl (strong acid)**:  
   - Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L, Concentration = 0.2 M  
   - Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \times 0.4 = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - HCl fully dissociates into \( \text{H}^+ \) and \( \text{Cl}^- \), so moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) = 0.08 mol.

3. **Ba(OH)2 (strong base)**:  
   - Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L, Concentration = 0.3 M  
   - Moles of Ba(OH)2 = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of \( \text{OH}^- \), so moles of \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 1: Neutralization of HCl and Ba(OH)2
The \( \text{H}^+ \) from HCl reacts with \( \text{OH}^- \) from Ba(OH)2:  
\[
\text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]
- Moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) = 0.08 mol, Moles of \( \text{OH}^- \) = 0.18 mol.  
- After neutralization, \( \text{H}^+ \) is completely consumed, and \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{OH}^- \) remains.

### Step 2: Reaction of Remaining OH⁻ with CH3COOH
The remaining \( \text{OH}^- \) reacts with CH3COOH:  
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \to \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]
- Moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol, Moles of \( \text{OH}^- \) = 0.10 mol.  
- CH3COOH is completely consumed, leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{OH}^- \).

### Step 3: Calculate [OH⁻] and pH
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]
The concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) is:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of OH}^-}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
\]
The pOH is:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
\]
The pH is:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, which corresponds to option **A**.

Answer: A
