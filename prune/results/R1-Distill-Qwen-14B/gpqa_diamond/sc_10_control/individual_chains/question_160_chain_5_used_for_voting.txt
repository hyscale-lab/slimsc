Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says there's an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining vertically along the z-axis onto this aperture. We're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. They also mention that the angles are small, so tan(theta) ≈ theta.

Hmm, okay. So when the aperture becomes infinitely large in the number of sides, what shape does it approach? Well, a polygon with infinite sides is basically a circle. So this setup is similar to a circular aperture. Wait, but wait, the question says it's an N-sided polygon with all apothems equal. So that makes sense because a circle's radius is the same as the apothem in a way.

Wait, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides. For a regular polygon with N sides, each of length s, the apothem a is given by a = (s)/(2 tan(π/N)). But in this case, all apothems are the same, but I'm not sure if that's crucial right now.

So, the problem is about the diffraction pattern when light passes through or around an aperture. Since the light is coming along the z-axis, it's a 2D diffraction problem, right? So the far field pattern—like what you'd see on a screen some distance away from the aperture—is given by the Fraunhofer diffraction.

For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot (the Airy disk) with the first dark rings (minima) around it. The angular position of the minima can be found using the formula involving the Bessel functions. But wait, the question is about the first two minima. For a circular aperture, the first minima occur at θ where the argument of the Bessel function J1 is at its first zero. I'm trying to remember, the zeros of Bessel functions determine the minima.

Wait, but the question is about when N is very large, so the shape is a circle. So the diffraction pattern is similar to a circular aperture. So in that case, the minima occur at angles where the Bessel function J1 reaches its zeros.

Wait, the formula for the angular position of the minima for a circular aperture is given by sin(θ) = λ / (π a) * (n), where n is the order of the zero. For the first minimum (n=1), sin(θ) ≈ λ/(π a). So θ ≈ λ/(π a). But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, wait, no. Wait, actually, the first minimum is the first dark ring after the central maximum. So the first minimum is at n=1, and the second minimum is at n=2. So the angular positions are θ1 = (λ/(π a)) * 1, θ2 = (λ/(π a)) * 2. So the angular distance between them would be θ2 - θ1 = (λ/(π a)) (2 -1) )= λ/(π a). But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. The positions of the minima for a circular aperture are given by θ = (m * π a) / λ, where m is the index of the zero of the Bessel function J1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is that the minima occur at θ where J1(k a sin θ) = 0, where k is 2π/λ. So the zeros of J1 are at θ where k a sin θ = x_m, where x_m is the m-th zero. The first zero of J1 is at x_1 ≈ 3.8317, the second at x_2 ≈ 7.0156, the third at x_3 ≈ 10.1735, etc.

But wait, when N is infinite, the shape is a circle, so the diffraction pattern is similar to a circular aperture. So the condition for minima is that J1(k a sin θ) = 0. So the angles are given by sin θ = x_m/(k a), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1.

Wait, wait, let me get this straight. The formula I remember is θ = (x_m * λ) / (π a), because k = 2π/λ, so sinθ = x_m/(k a) = x_m λ/(2π a). So θ ≈ x_m λ/(2 π a), for small angles, since sinθ ≈ theta.

So for the first minimum, m=1, x_1 ≈ 3.8317, so θ1 = (3.8317 λ) / (2 π a) ≈ (3.8317)/(6.2832) * λ/a ≈ 0.610 λ/a. For m=2, x_2 ≈7.0156, θ2=7.0156 * λ/(2π a) ≈ (7.0156)/(6.2832) * λ/a ≈ 1.116 λ/a.

So the angular distance between the first two minima is θ2 - θ1 = (1.116 - 0.610) λ/a = 0.506 λ/a. Looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a, which would be the answer.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: when the aperture is a polygon, but N approaches infinity, so it's a circle. So the diffraction pattern is the same as a circular aperture. So the first minima would be at θ1 and θ2 as I calculated, and the difference is 0.506 λ/a, which matches option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the formula for the first minima in a single slit. Wait, but that's a different scenario. In a single slit of width 'd', the minima occur at a sinθ = m λ, m=1,2,... So the angular distance between minima would be λ/(d), but that's for a single slit, which is different from an aperture.

Wait, but in this problem, the shape is a polygon with all apothems equal, so when N is large, it becomes a circle. So the diffraction pattern is that of a circular aperture. So the first two minima would be at θ1 and θ2 as I calculated earlier, with their difference being 0.506 λ/a.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a, so that should be the correct answer.

The problem involves an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon with all apothems of equal length \(a\). When monochromatic light of wavelength \(\lambda\) shines vertically through this aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern in the far field. As \(N\) approaches infinity, the aperture becomes circular, and the diffraction pattern corresponds to that of a circular aperture.

For a circular aperture, the angular positions of the minima in the diffraction pattern are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function \(J_1\). The \(m\)-th minimum occurs at:

\[
\sin\theta = \frac{x_m \lambda}{\pi a},
\]

where \(x_m\) is the \(m\)-th zero of \(J_1\). For small angles, \(\sin\theta \approx \theta\), so the angular positions of the minima are approximately:

\[
\theta_m \approx \frac{x_m \lambda}{\pi a}.
\]

The first two zeros of \(J_1\) are \(x_1 \approx 3.8317\) and \(x_2 \approx 7.0156\). Thus, the angular positions of the first two minima are:

\[
\theta_1 \approx \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{\pi a}, \quad \theta_2 \approx \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{\pi a}.
\]

The angular distance between the first two minima is:

\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{(7.0156 - 3.8317) \lambda}{\pi a} \approx \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{\pi a}.
\]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.1416\), this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta\theta \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**D) \(0.506 \lambda / a\).**
