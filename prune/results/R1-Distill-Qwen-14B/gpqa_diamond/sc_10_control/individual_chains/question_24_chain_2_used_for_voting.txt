Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again and see what I can figure out.

The problem is about a mixture X that undergoes some reactions, and I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Let me start by jotting down the key points.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, and these liquids can decolorize bromine water. So, what does that mean? Well, decolorizing bromine water usually happens when there's a reaction that breaks the bromine, like addition or maybe substitution. The common reactions that decolorize bromine are alkenes (which undergo addition reactions) or something with a lot of hydrogen, maybe alkanes? Wait, no, alkanes don't react with bromine water under normal conditions. So more likely, the liquids in X are alkenes or maybe something else with double bonds.

Next, when mixture X is treated with platinum (Pt) and heated, it forms mixture Y, which is a result of a disproportionation reaction. The mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So, after the reaction, the products can't react with bromine anymore. That suggests that the double bonds in X were hydrogenated, but because it's a disproportionation, maybe one of the products is more reduced and the other is less? Wait, no, wait. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, perhaps the starting material is something like an alkene with a certain structure that can lead to two different products.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. So each of them must be reacting. But when treated with Pt and heated, perhaps each undergoes a different reaction? Or maybe each one in X undergoes a disproportionation. Hmm, not sure yet.

Then, the hydrogenation of both X and Y with Pt under severe conditions gives only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon, and it's part of Y. Also, Z is a solvent, which is a clue—maybe it's something like toluene or benzene? Wait, but Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it must be a saturated compound, something that's fully hydrogenated so no more H2 can add.

The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let me calculate that. So, if Z is CnHm, then (mass of H)/(molar mass of Z) = 0.1428. Let's see. Let me think: 14.28% is approximately 1/7, because 100/7 is about 14.28. So, 14.28% would be 1/7 of the mass. So, if Z has a molecular formula where the H contributes 1/7 of the molar mass, what could that be?

Hydrogen's atomic weight is about 1, carbon is 12. Let's say the formula is CnH2m. Wait, let me think. Let me set up an equation. Let the molecular weight of Z be (12n + m), since it's CnHm. The mass of hydrogen is m*(1) = m. So, m/(12n + m) = 1/7. Multiply both sides by denominator: m = (12n + m)/7 → 7m = 12n + m → 6m =12n → m = 2n.

So the formula is CnH2n. Hmm. Possible alkanes or cycloalkanes. For example, ethylene is C2H4, but that's not an alkane. Wait, but for an alkane, the formula is CnH2n+2. Wait, but in this case, we have CnH2n. So that suggests maybe a cycloalkane, like cyclopropane (C3H6), cyclobutane (C4H8), etc. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic compound because benzene is C6H6, which fits CnH2n (n=3, no, wait benzene is C6H6, so m=6 here, n=6: 6=2*3, but wait 6 doesn't equal 2*3. Wait, wait, benzene is C6H6, which is C6H12/2. So for benzene, m=6, n=6, 6=2*3? No... Wait, no, because 2n would be 12 if n=6. Hmm, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, let me try again. The molecular formula is CnHm. We have m/(12n + m) = 1/7 → 7m =12n + m → 6m=12n → m=2n. So m=2n. So the formula is CnH2n.

So it's a molecule where the number of hydrogens is twice the number of carbons. Alkanes have 2n+2 H's, alkenes have 2n H's. So, wait, if X is a mixture of alkenes, which when hydrogenated give alkanes, but in this case, hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z, which is CnH2n, which would be an alkene. Wait, no, that can't be, because if Z is CnH2n, that's like an alkene structure, but Z is formed by hydrogenation. Wait, but hydrogenation of alkenes would give alkanes, which have more H. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, let me read that again. The hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only Z, which is a certain hydrocarbon. So both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. But X was a mixture of two liquids which decolorize bromine. So X had alkenes or something else. Let me think.

Wait, if X is a mixture of two alkenes, and when hydrogenated, they become alkanes. But in this case, hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z (a single compound), which is part of Y. So Y must be a mixture that upon hydrogenation gives the same Z as X does. So perhaps Y is a mixture that contains some dihydro derivatives, so when hydrogenated, it gives Z.

Wait, but the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, Y is formed through a disproportionation. So Y has two substances, but when either X or Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z.

Wait, but the hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z. So, X has two components which, when hydrogenated, form Z. Similarly, Y's two components, when hydrogenated, also form Z. So, perhaps each component in X, when hydrogenated, becomes a part of Z. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me think about the possible structures. Let's consider that Z is a hydrocarbon with a formula where H is 14.28% of the mass. Let me compute that. Let's say the molecular weight of Z is M. So, H is (14.28/100)*M. Let me compute M.

The fraction is 0.1428. Let me find M such that (molar mass H) / M = 0.1428. H's molar mass is 1, so 1/M=0.1428 → M≈7. So, M=7 g/mol? That can't be right because even CH4 is 16 g/mol. Hmm, maybe I've made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it again. Let me denote:

(Mass of H) / (Molar mass of Z) = 0.1428.

Assume Z is CnH2n, as before.

Molar mass of Z is 12n + 2n = 14n.

Mass of H is 2n * 1 = 2n.

So, (2n) / (14n) )= 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428. Oh, so yes! So Z is CnH2n. So the molecular formula is CnH2n, which could be cyclopropane (n=3: C3H6), cyclobutane (n=4: C4H8), etc. But wait, cyclopropane has a very high strain, so maybe it's something else.

Wait, but another possibility is that Z is benzene, which is C6H6. Let's check: the molar mass is 78 g/mol. Hydrogen contributes 6 g/mol. 6/78 ≈ 0.0769, which is about 7.69%, not 14.28%. So benzene doesn't fit. So, perhaps Z is something else.

Wait, let me calculate for n=3: Z is C3H6. Molar mass is 3*12 +6=42. Hydrogen mass is 6g. 6/42 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428. So 14.28% hydrogen. That matches! So Z is C3H6, which is propene? No, wait, propene is C3H6 but it's an alkene. But wait, the question says that Z is a hydrocarbon and doesn't react further with hydrogen. So if Z is an alkene, it would react with hydrogen to become an alkane. But the question says Z doesn't react further, implying it's already saturated. So maybe Z isn't propene but propane? Wait, propane is C3H8. Let me check: (8)/(42) ≈ 0.190, which is 19%, which doesn't match. So that can't be.

Hmm, maybe Z is cyclopropane, which is C3H6. But cyclopropane is a cycloalkane, so it's fully saturated, so no further hydrogenation. That fits. So Z is cyclopropane. But wait, when you hydrogenate an alkene, you get an alkane. But cyclopropane is a cycloalkane, so maybe the hydrogenation of a different starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps Z is a dihydro compound. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, X is a mixture of two liquids that can decolorize bromine. So they must have double bonds. So X is two alkenes. When treated with Pt and heat, they undergo a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Disproportionation of alkenes? That's a bit tricky. Wait, maybe it's not the alkenes that are disproportionating, but perhaps the same molecule has multiple sites where hydrogenation can occur in different ways.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material in X is an alkyne. Because alkyne can add bromine, but alkyne hydrogenation would give an alkene. But wait, the problem says that hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z. Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, which upon hydrogenation (with severe conditions, maybe with a catalyst) gives alkanes. But the problem says that X and Y when hydrogenated give Z, a single substance. So, perhaps X's two components hydrogenate to the same Z, and Y's two components also hydrogenate to Z.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that when hydrogenated become the same alkane Z.

But X is two different alkenes, which when hydrogenated produce the same alkane. So perhaps X is 1-butene and 2-butene, which upon hydrogenation both become butane. But that would make Z butane, which is C4H10. Let's check the hydrogen percentage: (10)/(58) ≈ 0.1724 → 17.24%, which doesn't match 14.28%. So that's not it.

But wait, earlier I thought Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane. Let me check its hydrogen percentage: 6/(3*12 +6) =6/42=1/7=14.28%. So it matches. So Z is cyclopropane.

Wait, but cyclopropane is a three-membered ring, fully saturated. So how does that form from hydrogenation? Because hydrogenation usually adds H2 across double bonds, turning alkenes into alkanes. So perhaps the starting materials X and Y have rings that are unsaturated in a way that upon hydrogenation, the ring becomes cyclopropane. That doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps X is a cyclopropane derivative with a double bond.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about what Y is. Y is formed via a disproportionation of X. So X is a substance that, when treated with Pt and heated, undergoes a disproportionation to form Y.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. So each component in X undergoes a disproportionation upon reaction with Pt and heat. Wait, but each would have to have a structure that allows for a disproportionation. Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is a di-substituted alkene that can break in different ways upon hydrogenation.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of X as a mixture of two alkenes. When each is hydrogenated, they form Z. But since X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z, perhaps Y is a mixture of the same alkanes as X, but perhaps more substituted.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y must not have any double bonds. So Y is a mixture of alkanes, perhaps, while X was a mixture of alkenes.

Wait, but the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, Y is formed via a disproportionation. So perhaps each component in X is undergoing a hydrogenation reaction, but perhaps in a way that leads to a change in structure beyond just adding hydrogen. Or maybe it's a dihydrogenation, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that when hydrogenated give the same alkane, Z. So for example, if X is 1,3-butadiene and another diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again about Z. If Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane, then when X is hydrogenated, it forms Z. So X must have had a double bond that, upon hydrogenation, forms cyclopropane. That seems unlikely because hydrogenation usually adds H2 across a double bond, converting it into a single bond. So perhaps X has a cyclopropane ring with a substituent that has a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of 1,2-dichloroethene or something, but this is getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: the problem says that mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y has no double bonds. So Y is a mixture of alkanes. So when X is treated with Pt and heated, it's a hydrogenation reaction, turning the alkenes into alkanes. But wait, why would that be a disproportionation?

Disproportionation implies that the same element is both oxidized and reduced. So perhaps the starting material is a molecule that contains a functional group which can be both oxidized and reduced. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted alkene that breaks in a way to form different products.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives the same alkane, Z. So, for example, if X is a mixture of cis and trans isomers of an alkene, but they would hydrogenate to the same alkane. But the question says X is a mixture of two liquids, which are alkenes, so perhaps they're isomers. But then Y would be the same as the hydrogenated product, which would be alkanes.

Wait, but the problem says that Y is formed via a disproportionation, which suggests that each component of X undergoes a reaction where the same atom is both oxidized and reduced. So perhaps each component in X is something like an alkyne, which upon hydrogenation can add two H2 molecules to form an alkane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two dienes, and upon hydrogenation with Pt, they form an alkane. But I'm not seeing the connection to Z.

Wait, another angle: The problem says that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give only Z. So hydrogenation of X and Y gives the same product, Z. That suggests that X and Y have similar structures, differing by perhaps substitution or functional groups that hydrogenate to the same product.

Since Z is a cyclopropane, perhaps X's alkenes upon hydrogenation form cyclopropane. But how? Maybe X's components are cyclopropane derivatives with double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps X consists of a molecule with a ring and double bonds. Wait, but I'm not making progress on this front.

Let me think about the starting point. Let's say X is a mixture of two alkenes. When hydrogenated, they form Z, which is C3H6. So, Z is cyclopropane, which has a ring structure. So the alkenes in X must have structures that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclopropane.

Wait, but hydrogenation of an alkene (C3H6) would add two H's to make C3H8, which is propane, not cyclopropane. So that doesn't fit. Unless the alkene is part of a ring. Let me think: for example, cyclopropane with a double bond? No, cyclopropane is already a ring with single bonds. Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of substituted cyclopropanes with double bonds elsewhere. For instance, something like 1,2-diphenylethylene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of 1,3-butadiene and another diene, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes that upon hydrogenation form the same cyclopropane. How? Well, perhaps they have rings with double bonds. Like, if X has a cyclopropane ring with a double bond attached, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at this the wrong way. Let's imagine that Z is cyclopropane, C3H6. So when X is hydrogenated, it forms cyclopropane. That would mean that X's structures, upon addition of H2, form a three-membered ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are not alkenes but alkynes. Let me think: if X is an alkyne, hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules to form an alkane. So, if X is acetylene (C2H2), hydrogenation would give C2H6 (ethane), which isn't Z. Because Z is C3H6. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the problem is about benzene. Let me think again. If X is benzene, but no, because benzene doesn't decolorize bromine. Wait, no, benzene does decolorize bromine because it undergoes addition reactions. But then, when X is treated with Pt and heat, perhaps it undergoes hydrogenation. Wait, but benzene requires high pressure and temperature for hydrogenation. So, when benzene is hydrogenated, it becomes cyclohexane. Let's check the hydrogen percentage in cyclohexane. Molar mass is 84 g/mol (C6H12). H is 12 g/mol → 12/84 ≈ 14.28%. Oh! So that matches exactly.

So Z is cyclohexane, which has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. So Z is C6H12, cyclohexane.

Wait, that makes sense. So Z is cyclohexane. So when X is hydrogenated, it forms cyclohexane, and the same when Y is hydrogenated.

So, X must be a mixture of two alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclohexane. So each component in X must be an alkene that, when hydrogenated, gives cyclohexane. So the alkenes would be cyclohexene and another di-substituted cyclohexene? Or perhaps the alkenes are such that they hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

Wait, cyclohexene is C6H10. Upon hydrogenation, it becomes C6H12 (cyclohexane). So X could be a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene that also hydrogenates to cyclohexane. But that would mean that X is a mixture of two alkenes that hydrogenate to the same product, which is cyclohexane. So perhaps X is a mixture of 1,2-dimethylcyclopentene and something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's think about Y. Y is formed via a disproportionation of X upon treatment with Pt and heat. So each component of X is undergoing a disproportionation reaction.

Wait, wait. Disproportionation usually involves the same element in the same molecule undergoing both oxidation and reduction. For example, in the reaction of ozone to form O2 and O3, but wait, that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are terminal alkynes. When hydrogenated, they form alkanes. But earlier I thought Z is cyclohexane, which is C6H12.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused. Let's try to structure this:

1. X is a mixture of two alkenes (since they decolorize bromine water).
2. X, when treated with Pt and heated, undergoes a disproportionation to form Y, which is a mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine (so Y has no double bonds, meaning they are alkanes or aromatics without double bonds, but aromatics like benzene don't decolorize bromine because they've already reacted? No, wait, benzene would decolorize bromine, so Y must be alkanes. So Y is a mixture of alkanes.
3. Hydrogenation of X and Y both give Z, which is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% H. As calculated earlier, Z is C6H12 (cyclohexane) because 12/(6*12 +12)=12/84=1/7≈14.28%.
4. So, X is a mixture of two alkenes that hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So each component in X must be an alkene that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. So each component is a dihydrogenation product of cyclohexane. Wait, no—hydrogenation adds H2, so the alkene would be the unsaturated form of cyclohexane. So, the alkenes in X must be cyclohexene and another structure that also hydrogenates to cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a single structure. If X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane, perhaps it's a different position, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but when X is treated with Pt and heated, it forms Y via a disproportionation. So each component in X must be capable of a disproportionation reaction. So perhaps each component in X is a di-substituted alkene that can undergo a redistribution of substituents upon reaction.

Wait, perhaps each component in X is a benzene ring with substituents, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes that have the same number of carbons. For example, if X contains 1,3-pentadiene and another diene. But I'm not sure how that leads to a disproportionation.

Wait, another thought: the problem says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X. So X's alkenes must have isolated double bonds. So perhaps each component of X is a diene with non-conjugated double bonds, like 1,3-pentadiene. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z, which is cyclohexane. So X must be a mixture of alkenes that when hydrogenated give cyclohexane. So each component in X is an alkene that becomes cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. So each alkene has the same number of carbons as cyclohexane, which is six. So, perhaps X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and another diene? Wait, but hydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene would give cyclohexane. But I'm not seeing how that would be a mixture of two different alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes in X are each different but when hydrogenated form cyclohexane. So, maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each with a structure that upon hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.

Wait, but how? Another possibility: each component in X is a substituted cyclohexene that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. For example, if X contains cyclohexene and another substituted cyclohexene, but that doesn't make sense because both would hydrogenate to cyclohexane, leading to a single product, not a mixture.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the number of hydrogens in X.

The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Each liquid in X is an alkene (since they decolorize bromine), and since X is equimolar, let's say each has a certain formula.

So, if each component in X is an alkene with the formula CnH2n, then when hydrogenated, it becomes CnH2n+2, which would be an alkane. But Z is C6H12, which is a cycloalkane (cyclohexane). So, perhaps each component in X is a cycloalkene that, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexene is C6H10. When hydrogenated, it becomes C6H12 (cyclohexane). So, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another di-substituted cyclohexene, both hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

But in that case, X would have two alkenes, each with the same number of carbons as cyclohexane. So, their formulas would be C6H10 each. But wait, that would make each component in X a C6H10 molecule. So, each has 10 H atoms.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two such alkenes. So, each has 10 H atoms. The total number of H atoms in X's two components is 10 (from first) + 10 (from second) = 20. But wait, let me check the options. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12. 20 isn't among them. So perhaps this is not the right path.

Wait, maybe each component in X has more hydrogens. For example, if X's components are alkenes with more substituents. Wait, but they have to hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So, maybe each component is a substituted cyclohexene.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes in X are not cyclohexene but something else, like 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene or something, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe each component in X is a different di-substituted alkene, but with the same number of carbons. For example, 1-pentene and 2-pentene. When each is hydrogenated, they become pentane. But Z is cyclohexane, which is C6H12. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two different dienes, each with the same number of carbons. For example, 1,3-pentadiene and 1,4-pentadiene. Upon hydrogenation, they become pentane. But again, that gives Z as pentane, which isn't cyclohexane.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the number of hydrogens in X.

If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then each component in X must be an alkene that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. So, each component in X is an alkene with the formula C6H10. Because adding two H's would make it C6H12. So each component in X is C6H10. So each has 10 H atoms.

Since X is a mixture of two such alkenes, each has 10 H. So total H in X is 10 +10 =20. But the options don't have 20. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe each component in X is a different structure, but with the same formula. For example, two different isomers of C6H10. So each has 10 H, so total is 20. But the options don't have 20. So perhaps my assumption about Z is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps Z is a different compound. Let me think again about Z.

If Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane, and when X is hydrogenated, it gives cyclopropane. So X must be a mixture of two alkenes that upon hydrogenation form cyclopropane. But cyclopropane is C3H6, which has three carbons. So perhaps X's components are alkenes with three carbons.

Wait, so if X is a mixture of propene (C3H6) and another alkene, but that doesn't make sense because propene is an alkene and would form propane upon hydrogenation. But Z is cyclopropane, which is C3H6, not propane. Wait, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Z is not cyclopropane. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating Z's formula.

Wait, Z's mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's re-calculate it accurately.

The formula is (mass of H)/(molar mass of Z) = 14.28% → 0.1428.

Let me suppose Z is CnHm. So, (m * 1) / (12n + m) = 0.1428.

We can write this as m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)

Multiply both sides: m = 0.1428*12n + 0.1428 m → m - 0.1428 m = 1.7136 n → m (1-0.1428) =1.7136 n → m*0.8572≈1.7136 n.

So, m ≈ (1.7136 / 0.8572 ) n → approximately 2n.

So, m≈2n.

Which gives the formula CnH2n.

So Z is CnH2n. Let's think of possible hydrocarbons with this formula.

n=3 → C3H6 → cyclopropane.

n=6 → C6H12 → cyclohexane.

Which is more likely to be a solvent? Cyclohexane is a solvent, yes. So perhaps Z is cyclohexane.

So, if Z is C6H12, then each component in X must be an alkene (C6H10). So each has 10 H, two of them in X → 20 H. But the options don't have 20. So maybe I'm wrong about X's structure.

Wait, another possibility: X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with a formula of CnH2n-2. Since they're alkenes, that's correct for a mono-ene.

When hydrogenated, each becomes CnH2n, which would be an alkane. So, for Z to be C6H12, each component in X must be C6H10. So, two such components → total H is 2*10=20 → not an option. So perhaps X has a different structure.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two terminal alkynes. Then, upon hydrogenation, they would add two H2 molecules each. For example, if X is a mixture of two C3H4 alkyne isomers, each upon hydrogenation would become C3H10, but that's not possible because hydrogenation of an alkyne (C3H4) would add two H2's to become C3H10, which is 2,2-dimethylpropane. But that doesn't fit with Z being C6H12.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the problem again.

The key points:

- X: equimolar mix of two alkenes (decolor bromine). Disproportionate to Y (two alkanes, no double bonds).

- Y: mixture that when hydrogenated gives Z.

- X and Y hydrogenated give same Z (C6H12).

So, both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give C6H12.

So, what could Y be? Y is formed by a disproportionation of X. So, perhaps X's components are alkenes that upon hydrogenation give Z, but during reaction with Pt and heat, they undergo a different reaction that leads to Y, which is a mixture of alkanes that also hydrogenate to Z.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with the same number of carbons as Z. For example, if Z is C6H12 (cyclohexane), then X is a mixture of two C6H10 alkenes.

Now, when X is treated with Pt and heat, each alkene undergoes a reaction. But for each to undergo a disproportionation, they must have a structure that allows for both oxidation and reduction. That's tricky because alkenes are reduced, not oxidized, under hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't hydrogenation but something else. Wait, the problem says that when treated with Pt and heated, X undergoes a disproportionation to form Y. So maybe it's a different reaction, not hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a different reaction, like isomerization or dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that would form alkenes, which is not helpful.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes where each can undergo a different hydrogenation pathway, leading to different products.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to find the number of H in X's components.

If Z is C6H12, then each component in X must be an alkene that becomes C6H12 upon hydrogenation. So each component is C6H10, with 10 H atoms per molecule.

If X is a mixture of two such alkenes, each with 10 H, then total H in X is 20. But the options don't have 20, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps each component in X has more H. Let me think: perhaps each component is a di-substituted alkene with more H. For example, if X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and another diene.

Wait, 1,3-cyclohexadiene is C6H8. Upon hydrogenation, it becomes C6H10 (cyclohexane?), no, wait, no. Wait, cyclohexadiene (C6H8) upon hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules to become C6H12 (cyclohexane). So each component in X is C6H8. So two of them would contribute 8*2=16 H atoms. That's option A.

So, if X is a mixture of two C6H8 alkenes, each has 8 H atoms, so total H is 16.

That would match option A) 16.

But how does this fit with the other parts of the question?

So, if X is a mixture of two C6H8 alkenes, each would hydrogenate to C6H12 (Z), which is correct.

When X is treated with Pt and heated, the alkenes undergo a disproportionation to form Y. So, each alkene in X is undergoing a reaction where part of it is oxidized and part reduced.

Wait, but how would that work with alkenes? Maybe each alkene in X is something like 1,3-pentadiene, which upon disproportionation might form different products. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps each alkene in X is a conjugated diene, which upon hydrogenation with Pt under certain conditions could form different products. But I'm not sure.

But the main point is that if each component in X is C6H8 (1,3-cyclohexadiene, for example), then each has 8 H atoms. Two such components would have 16 H in total, which is option A.

So, the answer would be A) 16.

The problem involves analyzing a mixture X of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, undergo a disproportionation reaction upon treatment with platinum and heat to form mixture Y, and ultimately yield a single hydrocarbon Z (C₆H₁₂, cyclohexane) upon hydrogenation. The goal is to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Decolorization of Bromine Water**:  
   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturated bonds (likely alkenes or alkynes). Since the problem specifies no conjugated multiple bonds, the liquids in X are likely simple alkenes.

2. **Formation of Mixture Y**:  
   When X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Disproportionation implies that the same element is both oxidized and reduced. This suggests that the alkenes in X rearrange or isomerize to form a mixture of alkanes in Y, which no longer decolorizes bromine water (no double bonds).

3. **Hydrogenation to Z**:  
   Both X and Y, when hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, yield a single hydrocarbon Z. Z is identified as C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane), as its hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28% (calculated using the formula for hydrogen mass fraction). Cyclohexane is a saturated compound and does not react further with hydrogen.

4. **Structure of X**:  
   Since X is a mixture of two alkenes that hydrogenate to form cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the alkenes in X must have the formula C₆H₁₀. This is because hydrogenation adds two hydrogen atoms across the double bond, converting C₆H₁₀ to C₆H₁₂.

5. **Total Hydrogen Atoms in X**:  
   Each alkene in X has the formula C₆H₁₀, which contains 10 hydrogen atoms. Since X is a mixture of two such alkenes, the total number of hydrogen atoms in X is:  
   \[
   10 \, (\text{from first alkene}) + 10 \, (\text{from second alkene}) = 20 \, \text{hydrogen atoms}.
   \]  
   However, the options provided do not include 20. Revisiting the problem, it is possible that the alkenes in X are not simple C₆H₁₀ alkenes but instead are dienes (C₆H₈). Each diene contains 8 hydrogen atoms, and with two such dienes in X, the total number of hydrogen atoms is:  
   \[
   8 \, (\text{from first diene}) + 8 \, (\text{from second diene}) = 16 \, \text{hydrogen atoms}.
   \]  
   This matches option A.

### Conclusion:
The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **16**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again and see what I can figure out.

The problem is about a mixture X that undergoes some reactions, and I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Let me start by jotting down the key points.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, and these liquids can decolorize bromine water. So, what does that mean? Well, decolorizing bromine water usually happens when there's a reaction that breaks the bromine, like addition or maybe substitution. The common reactions that decolorize bromine are alkenes (which undergo addition reactions) or something with a lot of hydrogen, maybe alkanes? Wait, no, alkanes don't react with bromine water under normal conditions. So more likely, the liquids in X are alkenes or maybe something else with double bonds.

Next, when mixture X is treated with platinum (Pt) and heated, it forms mixture Y, which is a result of a disproportionation reaction. The mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So, after the reaction, the products can't react with bromine anymore. That suggests that the double bonds in X were hydrogenated, but because it's a disproportionation, maybe one of the products is more reduced and the other is less? Wait, no, wait. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, perhaps the starting material is something like an alkene with a certain structure that can lead to two different products.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. So each of them must be reacting. But when treated with Pt and heated, perhaps each undergoes a different reaction? Or maybe each one in X undergoes a disproportionation. Hmm, not sure yet.

Then, the hydrogenation of both X and Y with Pt under severe conditions gives only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon, and it's part of Y. Also, Z is a solvent, which is a clue—maybe it's something like toluene or benzene? Wait, but Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it must be a saturated compound, something that's fully hydrogenated so no more H2 can add.

The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let me calculate that. So, if Z is CnHm, then (mass of H)/(molar mass of Z) = 0.1428. Let's see. Let me think: 14.28% is approximately 1/7, because 100/7 is about 14.28. So, 14.28% would be 1/7 of the mass. So, if Z has a molecular formula where the H contributes 1/7 of the molar mass, what could that be?

Hydrogen's atomic weight is about 1, carbon is 12. Let's say the formula is CnH2m. Wait, let me think. Let me set up an equation. Let the molecular weight of Z be (12n + m), since it's CnHm. The mass of hydrogen is m*(1) = m. So, m/(12n + m) = 1/7. Multiply both sides by denominator: m = (12n + m)/7 → 7m = 12n + m → 6m =12n → m = 2n.

So the formula is CnH2n. Hmm. Possible alkanes or cycloalkanes. For example, ethylene is C2H4, but that's not an alkane. Wait, but for an alkane, the formula is CnH2n+2. Wait, but in this case, we have CnH2n. So that suggests maybe a cycloalkane, like cyclopropane (C3H6), cyclobutane (C4H8), etc. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic compound because benzene is C6H6, which fits CnH2n (n=3, no, wait benzene is C6H6, so m=6 here, n=6: 6=2*3, but wait 6 doesn't equal 2*3. Wait, wait, benzene is C6H6, which is C6H12/2. So for benzene, m=6, n=6, 6=2*3? No... Wait, no, because 2n would be 12 if n=6. Hmm, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, let me try again. The molecular formula is CnHm. We have m/(12n + m) = 1/7 → 7m =12n + m → 6m=12n → m=2n. So m=2n. So the formula is CnH2n.

So it's a molecule where the number of hydrogens is twice the number of carbons. Alkanes have 2n+2 H's, alkenes have 2n H's. So, wait, if X is a mixture of alkenes, which when hydrogenated give alkanes, but in this case, hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z, which is CnH2n, which would be an alkene. Wait, no, that can't be, because if Z is CnH2n, that's like an alkene structure, but Z is formed by hydrogenation. Wait, but hydrogenation of alkenes would give alkanes, which have more H. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, let me read that again. The hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only Z, which is a certain hydrocarbon. So both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. But X was a mixture of two liquids which decolorize bromine. So X had alkenes or something else. Let me think.

Wait, if X is a mixture of two alkenes, and when hydrogenated, they become alkanes. But in this case, hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z (a single compound), which is part of Y. So Y must be a mixture that upon hydrogenation gives the same Z as X does. So perhaps Y is a mixture that contains some dihydro derivatives, so when hydrogenated, it gives Z.

Wait, but the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, Y is formed through a disproportionation. So Y has two substances, but when either X or Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z.

Wait, but the hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z. So, X has two components which, when hydrogenated, form Z. Similarly, Y's two components, when hydrogenated, also form Z. So, perhaps each component in X, when hydrogenated, becomes a part of Z. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me think about the possible structures. Let's consider that Z is a hydrocarbon with a formula where H is 14.28% of the mass. Let me compute that. Let's say the molecular weight of Z is M. So, H is (14.28/100)*M. Let me compute M.

The fraction is 0.1428. Let me find M such that (molar mass H) / M = 0.1428. H's molar mass is 1, so 1/M=0.1428 → M≈7. So, M=7 g/mol? That can't be right because even CH4 is 16 g/mol. Hmm, maybe I've made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it again. Let me denote:

(Mass of H) / (Molar mass of Z) = 0.1428.

Assume Z is CnH2n, as before.

Molar mass of Z is 12n + 2n = 14n.

Mass of H is 2n * 1 = 2n.

So, (2n) / (14n) )= 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428. Oh, so yes! So Z is CnH2n. So the molecular formula is CnH2n, which could be cyclopropane (n=3: C3H6), cyclobutane (n=4: C4H8), etc. But wait, cyclopropane has a very high strain, so maybe it's something else.

Wait, but another possibility is that Z is benzene, which is C6H6. Let's check: the molar mass is 78 g/mol. Hydrogen contributes 6 g/mol. 6/78 ≈ 0.0769, which is about 7.69%, not 14.28%. So benzene doesn't fit. So, perhaps Z is something else.

Wait, let me calculate for n=3: Z is C3H6. Molar mass is 3*12 +6=42. Hydrogen mass is 6g. 6/42 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428. So 14.28% hydrogen. That matches! So Z is C3H6, which is propene? No, wait, propene is C3H6 but it's an alkene. But wait, the question says that Z is a hydrocarbon and doesn't react further with hydrogen. So if Z is an alkene, it would react with hydrogen to become an alkane. But the question says Z doesn't react further, implying it's already saturated. So maybe Z isn't propene but propane? Wait, propane is C3H8. Let me check: (8)/(42) ≈ 0.190, which is 19%, which doesn't match. So that can't be.

Hmm, maybe Z is cyclopropane, which is C3H6. But cyclopropane is a cycloalkane, so it's fully saturated, so no further hydrogenation. That fits. So Z is cyclopropane. But wait, when you hydrogenate an alkene, you get an alkane. But cyclopropane is a cycloalkane, so maybe the hydrogenation of a different starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps Z is a dihydro compound. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, X is a mixture of two liquids that can decolorize bromine. So they must have double bonds. So X is two alkenes. When treated with Pt and heat, they undergo a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Disproportionation of alkenes? That's a bit tricky. Wait, maybe it's not the alkenes that are disproportionating, but perhaps the same molecule has multiple sites where hydrogenation can occur in different ways.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material in X is an alkyne. Because alkyne can add bromine, but alkyne hydrogenation would give an alkene. But wait, the problem says that hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z. Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, which upon hydrogenation (with severe conditions, maybe with a catalyst) gives alkanes. But the problem says that X and Y when hydrogenated give Z, a single substance. So, perhaps X's two components hydrogenate to the same Z, and Y's two components also hydrogenate to Z.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that when hydrogenated become the same alkane Z.

But X is two different alkenes, which when hydrogenated produce the same alkane. So perhaps X is 1-butene and 2-butene, which upon hydrogenation both become butane. But that would make Z butane, which is C4H10. Let's check the hydrogen percentage: (10)/(58) ≈ 0.1724 → 17.24%, which doesn't match 14.28%. So that's not it.

But wait, earlier I thought Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane. Let me check its hydrogen percentage: 6/(3*12 +6) =6/42=1/7=14.28%. So it matches. So Z is cyclopropane.

Wait, but cyclopropane is a three-membered ring, fully saturated. So how does that form from hydrogenation? Because hydrogenation usually adds H2 across double bonds, turning alkenes into alkanes. So perhaps the starting materials X and Y have rings that are unsaturated in a way that upon hydrogenation, the ring becomes cyclopropane. That doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps X is a cyclopropane derivative with a double bond.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about what Y is. Y is formed via a disproportionation of X. So X is a substance that, when treated with Pt and heated, undergoes a disproportionation to form Y.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. So each component in X undergoes a disproportionation upon reaction with Pt and heat. Wait, but each would have to have a structure that allows for a disproportionation. Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is a di-substituted alkene that can break in different ways upon hydrogenation.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of X as a mixture of two alkenes. When each is hydrogenated, they form Z. But since X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z, perhaps Y is a mixture of the same alkanes as X, but perhaps more substituted.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y must not have any double bonds. So Y is a mixture of alkanes, perhaps, while X was a mixture of alkenes.

Wait, but the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, Y is formed via a disproportionation. So perhaps each component in X is undergoing a hydrogenation reaction, but perhaps in a way that leads to a change in structure beyond just adding hydrogen. Or maybe it's a dihydrogenation, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that when hydrogenated give the same alkane, Z. So for example, if X is 1,3-butadiene and another diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again about Z. If Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane, then when X is hydrogenated, it forms Z. So X must have had a double bond that, upon hydrogenation, forms cyclopropane. That seems unlikely because hydrogenation usually adds H2 across a double bond, converting it into a single bond. So perhaps X has a cyclopropane ring with a substituent that has a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of 1,2-dichloroethene or something, but this is getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: the problem says that mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y has no double bonds. So Y is a mixture of alkanes. So when X is treated with Pt and heated, it's a hydrogenation reaction, turning the alkenes into alkanes. But wait, why would that be a disproportionation?

Disproportionation implies that the same element is both oxidized and reduced. So perhaps the starting material is a molecule that contains a functional group which can be both oxidized and reduced. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted alkene that breaks in a way to form different products.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives the same alkane, Z. So, for example, if X is a mixture of cis and trans isomers of an alkene, but they would hydrogenate to the same alkane. But the question says X is a mixture of two liquids, which are alkenes, so perhaps they're isomers. But then Y would be the same as the hydrogenated product, which would be alkanes.

Wait, but the problem says that Y is formed via a disproportionation, which suggests that each component of X undergoes a reaction where the same atom is both oxidized and reduced. So perhaps each component in X is something like an alkyne, which upon hydrogenation can add two H2 molecules to form an alkane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two dienes, and upon hydrogenation with Pt, they form an alkane. But I'm not seeing the connection to Z.

Wait, another angle: The problem says that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give only Z. So hydrogenation of X and Y gives the same product, Z. That suggests that X and Y have similar structures, differing by perhaps substitution or functional groups that hydrogenate to the same product.

Since Z is a cyclopropane, perhaps X's alkenes upon hydrogenation form cyclopropane. But how? Maybe X's components are cyclopropane derivatives with double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps X consists of a molecule with a ring and double bonds. Wait, but I'm not making progress on this front.

Let me think about the starting point. Let's say X is a mixture of two alkenes. When hydrogenated, they form Z, which is C3H6. So, Z is cyclopropane, which has a ring structure. So the alkenes in X must have structures that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclopropane.

Wait, but hydrogenation of an alkene (C3H6) would add two H's to make C3H8, which is propane, not cyclopropane. So that doesn't fit. Unless the alkene is part of a ring. Let me think: for example, cyclopropane with a double bond? No, cyclopropane is already a ring with single bonds. Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of substituted cyclopropanes with double bonds elsewhere. For instance, something like 1,2-diphenylethylene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of 1,3-butadiene and another diene, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes that upon hydrogenation form the same cyclopropane. How? Well, perhaps they have rings with double bonds. Like, if X has a cyclopropane ring with a double bond attached, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at this the wrong way. Let's imagine that Z is cyclopropane, C3H6. So when X is hydrogenated, it forms cyclopropane. That would mean that X's structures, upon addition of H2, form a three-membered ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are not alkenes but alkynes. Let me think: if X is an alkyne, hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules to form an alkane. So, if X is acetylene (C2H2), hydrogenation would give C2H6 (ethane), which isn't Z. Because Z is C3H6. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the problem is about benzene. Let me think again. If X is benzene, but no, because benzene doesn't decolorize bromine. Wait, no, benzene does decolorize bromine because it undergoes addition reactions. But then, when X is treated with Pt and heat, perhaps it undergoes hydrogenation. Wait, but benzene requires high pressure and temperature for hydrogenation. So, when benzene is hydrogenated, it becomes cyclohexane. Let's check the hydrogen percentage in cyclohexane. Molar mass is 84 g/mol (C6H12). H is 12 g/mol → 12/84 ≈ 14.28%. Oh! So that matches exactly.

So Z is cyclohexane, which has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. So Z is C6H12, cyclohexane.

Wait, that makes sense. So Z is cyclohexane. So when X is hydrogenated, it forms cyclohexane, and the same when Y is hydrogenated.

So, X must be a mixture of two alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclohexane. So each component in X must be an alkene that, when hydrogenated, gives cyclohexane. So the alkenes would be cyclohexene and another di-substituted cyclohexene? Or perhaps the alkenes are such that they hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

Wait, cyclohexene is C6H10. Upon hydrogenation, it becomes C6H12 (cyclohexane). So X could be a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene that also hydrogenates to cyclohexane. But that would mean that X is a mixture of two alkenes that hydrogenate to the same product, which is cyclohexane. So perhaps X is a mixture of 1,2-dimethylcyclopentene and something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's think about Y. Y is formed via a disproportionation of X upon treatment with Pt and heat. So each component of X is undergoing a disproportionation reaction.

Wait, wait. Disproportionation usually involves the same element in the same molecule undergoing both oxidation and reduction. For example, in the reaction of ozone to form O2 and O3, but wait, that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are terminal alkynes. When hydrogenated, they form alkanes. But earlier I thought Z is cyclohexane, which is C6H12.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused. Let's try to structure this:

1. X is a mixture of two alkenes (since they decolorize bromine water).
2. X, when treated with Pt and heated, undergoes a disproportionation to form Y, which is a mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine (so Y has no double bonds, meaning they are alkanes or aromatics without double bonds, but aromatics like benzene don't decolorize bromine because they've already reacted? No, wait, benzene would decolorize bromine, so Y must be alkanes. So Y is a mixture of alkanes.
3. Hydrogenation of X and Y both give Z, which is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% H. As calculated earlier, Z is C6H12 (cyclohexane) because 12/(6*12 +12)=12/84=1/7≈14.28%.
4. So, X is a mixture of two alkenes that hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So each component in X must be an alkene that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. So each component is a dihydrogenation product of cyclohexane. Wait, no—hydrogenation adds H2, so the alkene would be the unsaturated form of cyclohexane. So, the alkenes in X must be cyclohexene and another structure that also hydrogenates to cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a single structure. If X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane, perhaps it's a different position, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but when X is treated with Pt and heated, it forms Y via a disproportionation. So each component in X must be capable of a disproportionation reaction. So perhaps each component in X is a di-substituted alkene that can undergo a redistribution of substituents upon reaction.

Wait, perhaps each component in X is a benzene ring with substituents, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes that have the same number of carbons. For example, if X contains 1,3-pentadiene and another diene. But I'm not sure how that leads to a disproportionation.

Wait, another thought: the problem says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X. So X's alkenes must have isolated double bonds. So perhaps each component of X is a diene with non-conjugated double bonds, like 1,3-pentadiene. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z, which is cyclohexane. So X must be a mixture of alkenes that when hydrogenated give cyclohexane. So each component in X is an alkene that becomes cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. So each alkene has the same number of carbons as cyclohexane, which is six. So, perhaps X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and another diene? Wait, but hydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene would give cyclohexane. But I'm not seeing how that would be a mixture of two different alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes in X are each different but when hydrogenated form cyclohexane. So, maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each with a structure that upon hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.

Wait, but how? Another possibility: each component in X is a substituted cyclohexene that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. For example, if X contains cyclohexene and another substituted cyclohexene, but that doesn't make sense because both would hydrogenate to cyclohexane, leading to a single product, not a mixture.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the number of hydrogens in X.

The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Each liquid in X is an alkene (since they decolorize bromine), and since X is equimolar, let's say each has a certain formula.

So, if each component in X is an alkene with the formula CnH2n, then when hydrogenated, it becomes CnH2n+2, which would be an alkane. But Z is C6H12, which is a cycloalkane (cyclohexane). So, perhaps each component in X is a cycloalkene that, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexene is C6H10. When hydrogenated, it becomes C6H12 (cyclohexane). So, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another di-substituted cyclohexene, both hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

But in that case, X would have two alkenes, each with the same number of carbons as cyclohexane. So, their formulas would be C6H10 each. But wait, that would make each component in X a C6H10 molecule. So, each has 10 H atoms.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two such alkenes. So, each has 10 H atoms. The total number of H atoms in X's two components is 10 (from first) + 10 (from second) = 20. But wait, let me check the options. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12. 20 isn't among them. So perhaps this is not the right path.

Wait, maybe each component in X has more hydrogens. For example, if X's components are alkenes with more substituents. Wait, but they have to hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So, maybe each component is a substituted cyclohexene.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes in X are not cyclohexene but something else, like 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene or something, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe each component in X is a different di-substituted alkene, but with the same number of carbons. For example, 1-pentene and 2-pentene. When each is hydrogenated, they become pentane. But Z is cyclohexane, which is C6H12. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two different dienes, each with the same number of carbons. For example, 1,3-pentadiene and 1,4-pentadiene. Upon hydrogenation, they become pentane. But again, that gives Z as pentane, which isn't cyclohexane.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the number of hydrogens in X.

If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then each component in X must be an alkene that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. So, each component in X is an alkene with the formula C6H10. Because adding two H's would make it C6H12. So each component in X is C6H10. So each has 10 H atoms.

Since X is a mixture of two such alkenes, each has 10 H. So total H in X is 10 +10 =20. But the options don't have 20. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe each component in X is a different structure, but with the same formula. For example, two different isomers of C6H10. So each has 10 H, so total is 20. But the options don't have 20. So perhaps my assumption about Z is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps Z is a different compound. Let me think again about Z.

If Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane, and when X is hydrogenated, it gives cyclopropane. So X must be a mixture of two alkenes that upon hydrogenation form cyclopropane. But cyclopropane is C3H6, which has three carbons. So perhaps X's components are alkenes with three carbons.

Wait, so if X is a mixture of propene (C3H6) and another alkene, but that doesn't make sense because propene is an alkene and would form propane upon hydrogenation. But Z is cyclopropane, which is C3H6, not propane. Wait, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Z is not cyclopropane. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating Z's formula.

Wait, Z's mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's re-calculate it accurately.

The formula is (mass of H)/(molar mass of Z) = 14.28% → 0.1428.

Let me suppose Z is CnHm. So, (m * 1) / (12n + m) = 0.1428.

We can write this as m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)

Multiply both sides: m = 0.1428*12n + 0.1428 m → m - 0.1428 m = 1.7136 n → m (1-0.1428) =1.7136 n → m*0.8572≈1.7136 n.

So, m ≈ (1.7136 / 0.8572 ) n → approximately 2n.

So, m≈2n.

Which gives the formula CnH2n.

So Z is CnH2n. Let's think of possible hydrocarbons with this formula.

n=3 → C3H6 → cyclopropane.

n=6 → C6H12 → cyclohexane.

Which is more likely to be a solvent? Cyclohexane is a solvent, yes. So perhaps Z is cyclohexane.

So, if Z is C6H12, then each component in X must be an alkene (C6H10). So each has 10 H, two of them in X → 20 H. But the options don't have 20. So maybe I'm wrong about X's structure.

Wait, another possibility: X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with a formula of CnH2n-2. Since they're alkenes, that's correct for a mono-ene.

When hydrogenated, each becomes CnH2n, which would be an alkane. So, for Z to be C6H12, each component in X must be C6H10. So, two such components → total H is 2*10=20 → not an option. So perhaps X has a different structure.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two terminal alkynes. Then, upon hydrogenation, they would add two H2 molecules each. For example, if X is a mixture of two C3H4 alkyne isomers, each upon hydrogenation would become C3H10, but that's not possible because hydrogenation of an alkyne (C3H4) would add two H2's to become C3H10, which is 2,2-dimethylpropane. But that doesn't fit with Z being C6H12.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the problem again.

The key points:

- X: equimolar mix of two alkenes (decolor bromine). Disproportionate to Y (two alkanes, no double bonds).

- Y: mixture that when hydrogenated gives Z.

- X and Y hydrogenated give same Z (C6H12).

So, both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give C6H12.

So, what could Y be? Y is formed by a disproportionation of X. So, perhaps X's components are alkenes that upon hydrogenation give Z, but during reaction with Pt and heat, they undergo a different reaction that leads to Y, which is a mixture of alkanes that also hydrogenate to Z.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with the same number of carbons as Z. For example, if Z is C6H12 (cyclohexane), then X is a mixture of two C6H10 alkenes.

Now, when X is treated with Pt and heat, each alkene undergoes a reaction. But for each to undergo a disproportionation, they must have a structure that allows for both oxidation and reduction. That's tricky because alkenes are reduced, not oxidized, under hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't hydrogenation but something else. Wait, the problem says that when treated with Pt and heated, X undergoes a disproportionation to form Y. So maybe it's a different reaction, not hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a different reaction, like isomerization or dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that would form alkenes, which is not helpful.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes where each can undergo a different hydrogenation pathway, leading to different products.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to find the number of H in X's components.

If Z is C6H12, then each component in X must be an alkene that becomes C6H12 upon hydrogenation. So each component is C6H10, with 10 H atoms per molecule.

If X is a mixture of two such alkenes, each with 10 H, then total H in X is 20. But the options don't have 20, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps each component in X has more H. Let me think: perhaps each component is a di-substituted alkene with more H. For example, if X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and another diene.

Wait, 1,3-cyclohexadiene is C6H8. Upon hydrogenation, it becomes C6H10 (cyclohexane?), no, wait, no. Wait, cyclohexadiene (C6H8) upon hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules to become C6H12 (cyclohexane). So each component in X is C6H8. So two of them would contribute 8*2=16 H atoms. That's option A.

So, if X is a mixture of two C6H8 alkenes, each has 8 H atoms, so total H is 16.

That would match option A) 16.

But how does this fit with the other parts of the question?

So, if X is a mixture of two C6H8 alkenes, each would hydrogenate to C6H12 (Z), which is correct.

When X is treated with Pt and heated, the alkenes undergo a disproportionation to form Y. So, each alkene in X is undergoing a reaction where part of it is oxidized and part reduced.

Wait, but how would that work with alkenes? Maybe each alkene in X is something like 1,3-pentadiene, which upon disproportionation might form different products. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps each alkene in X is a conjugated diene, which upon hydrogenation with Pt under certain conditions could form different products. But I'm not sure.

But the main point is that if each component in X is C6H8 (1,3-cyclohexadiene, for example), then each has 8 H atoms. Two such components would have 16 H in total, which is option A.

So, the answer would be A) 16.


The problem involves analyzing a mixture X of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, undergo a disproportionation reaction upon treatment with platinum and heat to form mixture Y, and ultimately yield a single hydrocarbon Z (C₆H₁₂, cyclohexane) upon hydrogenation. The goal is to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Decolorization of Bromine Water**:  
   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturated bonds (likely alkenes or alkynes). Since the problem specifies no conjugated multiple bonds, the liquids in X are likely simple alkenes.

2. **Formation of Mixture Y**:  
   When X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Disproportionation implies that the same element is both oxidized and reduced. This suggests that the alkenes in X rearrange or isomerize to form a mixture of alkanes in Y, which no longer decolorizes bromine water (no double bonds).

3. **Hydrogenation to Z**:  
   Both X and Y, when hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, yield a single hydrocarbon Z. Z is identified as C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane), as its hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28% (calculated using the formula for hydrogen mass fraction). Cyclohexane is a saturated compound and does not react further with hydrogen.

4. **Structure of X**:  
   Since X is a mixture of two alkenes that hydrogenate to form cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the alkenes in X must have the formula C₆H₁₀. This is because hydrogenation adds two hydrogen atoms across the double bond, converting C₆H₁₀ to C₆H₁₂.

5. **Total Hydrogen Atoms in X**:  
   Each alkene in X has the formula C₆H₁₀, which contains 10 hydrogen atoms. Since X is a mixture of two such alkenes, the total number of hydrogen atoms in X is:  
   \[
   10 \, (\text{from first alkene}) + 10 \, (\text{from second alkene}) = 20 \, \text{hydrogen atoms}.
   \]  
   However, the options provided do not include 20. Revisiting the problem, it is possible that the alkenes in X are not simple C₆H₁₀ alkenes but instead are dienes (C₆H₈). Each diene contains 8 hydrogen atoms, and with two such dienes in X, the total number of hydrogen atoms is:  
   \[
   8 \, (\text{from first diene}) + 8 \, (\text{from second diene}) = 16 \, \text{hydrogen atoms}.
   \]  
   This matches option A.

### Conclusion:
The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **16**.
