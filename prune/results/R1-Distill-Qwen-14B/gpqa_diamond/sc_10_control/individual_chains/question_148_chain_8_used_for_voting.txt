Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five of them. The compounds are labeled A1 to A5, and each behaves differently in various reactions.

Let me break down each part.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine. When A1 decomposes, the fluorine comes off. So, A1 could be a compound that, when broken down, releases F2 gas. The oF (I think this stands for oxidation state or maybe something else?) is 31.96% for A2. Wait, maybe that's the percentage composition of fluorine in A2.

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So, A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, maybe in a high oxidation state. Xenon is a noble gas, so it's usually unreactive, but under certain conditions, it can form compounds like XeF2, XeF4, or XeF6. Since A1 oxidizes Xe, perhaps A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, like a fluoride with a high oxidation state of Y.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 is likely YF (if Y is in +1 oxidation state) or YF3, YF4, etc., depending on Y's valency.

Then, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. Hmm, when a solution is hot and concentrated, and when a metal is added, perhaps it's a reaction like a double displacement, or some redox reaction.

Let me think about possible elements Y. Since we have five binary fluorides, Y is probably a nonmetals or metals that form multiple fluorides. Possible candidates could be elements like O, S, perhaps Cl, but wait, Cl is a halogen. Alternatively, maybe Y is something like Na, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe Y is oxygen? Because oxygen has multiple fluorides. But wait, oxygen doesn't form that many fluorides. Alternatively, Y could be something like sodium, but sodium typically forms only NaF. Hmm, maybe Y is a halogen, but that might not make much sense.

Wait, let me think again. The problem states it's a binary compound of fluorine with element Y. So Y plus F make the compounds. Five binary compounds, so Y must form five different fluorides. Let's see which elements form multiple fluorides. Maybe chlorine? No, because Cl has only one common fluoride, ClF3? Or wait, maybe Cl can form ClF3 and ClF? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is sulfur. Sulfur forms SF4 and SF6. Wait, but that's only two. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Y is nitrogen. Nitrogen forms NF3 and maybe others, but again, not five.

Wait, another angle: the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. So A1 could be YF3, which decomposes into YF2 and F2? Or maybe something else.

Wait, the data given: when A1 decomposes, the oF is 31.96% for A2. Maybe that's the fluorine content. So let's find a compound where F is 31.96% by mass.

What's the molecular weight of F? Approximately 19 g/mol. So if a compound has F as 31.96%, then for a formula unit, let's say the formula is YF_n.

So (19n)/(M_Y + 19n) = 0.3196.

But without knowing M_Y, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the percentage is 31.96%, which is approximately 32%, close to 32/19 = 1.68 fluorines. Hmm, but that's not very helpful.

Wait, maybe A2 is YF3. Let me check: fluorine is 19*3=57. What's the percentage in YF3? If Y has a molar mass M, then (57)/(M+57) = 0.3196. Let's solve for M.

0.3196*(M+57) = 57
0.3196 M + 0.3196*57 =57
0.3196 M =57 - 0.3196*57
Calculate 0.3196*57: 57 * 0.32 is about 18.24, so 57 - 18.24 =38.76.

0.3196 M =38.76 → M≈38.76 /0.3196 ≈121.2 g/mol.

So Y would have a molar mass around 121.2. Which element is near that? Iodine is about 127. Wait, that's close. So Y could be iodine (I). Hmm, but let's see.

Wait, if Y is iodine, then the fluorides would be IF, IF3, IF5, IF7? Do these exist? I think IF7 is a known compound. So that's five compounds: IF, IF3, IF5, IF7, and maybe another? Or perhaps some other oxidation states.

Wait, but how many binary fluorides does iodine have? I think iodine forms IF5 and IF7, but I'm not certain about the others. Wait, maybe Y is chlorine. No, because chlorine's fluorides are ClF3 and ClF, but again, not five.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is phosphorus. Phosphorus can form PF3, PF5, etc. So let's think: Y is P.

Wait, but let me get back. If Y is iodine, then I could have YF2, YF3, YF4, YF5, YF6. Wait, but that's more than five. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is sulfur. SF4 and SF6. But that's only two. So maybe Y is another element with multiple valencies.

Alternatively, let me think about the first part: A1 is a bright red substance that decomposes into A2 and F2, and A1 is an oxidizing agent for xenon. Xenon's fluorides are formed under specific conditions. For example, XeF2 is formed under certain conditions, and it's a stable compound. But A1 oxidizing Xe suggests that A1 is an oxidizing agent, perhaps in a high oxidation state.

Wait, another thought: maybe A1 is ClF3. Because ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent and can react with noble gases. Hmm, but ClF3 decomposes into ClF and F2 upon heating. Let's see: ClF3 → ClF + F2. So if A1 is ClF3, then A2 would be ClF.

Wait, let's calculate the fluorine percentage in A2 (ClF). Fluorine's molar mass is ~19, Cl is ~35.5. So (19)/(35.5 +19) = 19/54.5 ≈ 0.348, which is about 34.8%. But in the problem, it's 31.96%. Hmm, not matching exactly. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is O F2, but that's a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach is better. Let's proceed with Y being iodine.

If Y is iodine, then A1 could be IF5, which might decompose into IF3 and F2. Let's check the fluorine percentage in A2 (IF3). I is 127, F is 19*3=57. So (57)/(127+57)=57/184≈0.310, which is about 31%, close to 31.96%. Hmm, that's pretty close. So perhaps A2 is IF3.

So Y would be I. Then, the five binary fluorides would be IF, IF3, IF5, IF7, and perhaps another. Wait, but I'm not sure if there are five known. Let me think: I know that I can form IF5, IF7, and possibly lower ones like IF3 and IF. So maybe that's five if considering different stoichiometries.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about that. Alternatively, another approach: the problem states that A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So perhaps Y is in its elemental form, and when fluorinated, it forms A3. If Y is a metal, then fluorination would produce a fluoride. But if Y is a non-metal, perhaps it forms a different fluoride.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the formation of A5. When Y is added to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, it forms A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. That makes me think of something like the hydrolysis of a salt. For example, when NaF is added to something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of a higher fluoride, and adding Y (as a metal) could cause a reaction. Wait, if Y is iodine, perhaps A4 is a solution of something like KIO3 or another iodine compound.

Wait, let's think about A5. It decomposes in water into two substances. That could imply it's an acid or a salt that breaks down into an acid and a base, like a carbonate decomposing into CO2 and water, but perhaps more likely, it's a salt that hydrolyzes. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal iodide reacting with water to form iodine and another compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A5 is a hydrogen iodide, but no, H-I is a gas. Alternatively, maybe A5 is something like I2O5, which upon decomposition in water gives HI and O2. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a higher fluoride, like YF6^3- or something else. Or maybe A4 is a solution of YF4.

Wait, another thought. When Y is added to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, what reaction occurs? Maybe it's a precipitation reaction. For example, if A4 is a solution of a metal fluoride, adding Y (another metal) could displace it. But since Y is a non-metal in this context (assuming it's iodine), maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal, making A4 a metal fluoride solution. But then A5 would be another compound when Y is added. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think about the initial part again. A1 is a bright red substance that decomposes into A2 and fluorine. A1 is an oxidizing agent for Xe. So perhaps A1 is a high oxidation state fluoride.

Wait, another thought. Could A1 be ClF3? Because ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent. When it decomposes, perhaps it forms ClF and F2. Let's see: ClF3 → ClF + F2. So in that case, A2 would be ClF. Let's compute the fluorine percentage in ClF.

Cl has a molar mass of about 35.5, F is 19. So in ClF, F is 19/(35.5+19) = 19/54.5 ≈ 0.348, which is 34.8%. But the problem states 31.96%, which is lower. Close, but not the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is BrF3, which decomposes into BrF and F2. Let's check BrF's fluorine content. Br is about 80, F is 19. So 19/(80+19)=19/99≈0.1919 or 19.19%. Not 31.96% so probably not.

Alternatively, maybe A1 is O F2. Wait, that's a gas, but I'm not sure about its decomposition. Also, O F2 is a strong oxidizer. But O's fluorides are not that common.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride like IF7. Wait, but I'm not sure how it would decompose. Let me think: IF7 might decompose into IF5 and F2. Let's see: in IF5, fluorine is 5*19=95, iodine is 127. So 95/(127+95)=95/222≈0.428, which is 42.8%. Not 31.96%.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the fluorine percentage. 31.96% F in A2.

So, fluorine is 31.96% by mass, which is 0.3196. Let's calculate the possible formula.

Assume the formula is YF_n.

So (n * 19) / (M_Y + n * 19) = 0.3196.

Let me rearrange this equation:

n *19 = 0.3196 * (M_Y + n *19)

n *19 = 0.3196 M_Y + 0.3196 *n *19

Bring terms together:

n *19 - 0.3196 n *19 = 0.3196 M_Y

n *19 (1 - 0.3196) = 0.3196 M_Y

n *19 * 0.6804 = 0.3196 M_Y

So M_Y = [n *19 *0.6804 ] / 0.3196

Let me compute that.

0.6804 /0.3196 ≈2.128.

So M_Y ≈ n*19 *2.128.

So M_Y ≈ n * 39.43.

So for different n values, M_Y would be:

n=1 → ~39.43 g/mol → which is around the atomic mass of K (about 39). But K is a metal and would form KF, but K's fluorides would be KF, KF2? Wait, K typically has a +1 charge, so KF is the main fluoride. But KF is a binary compound.

n=2 → M_Y ≈78.86 → which is around the atomic mass of something like Ge (72.6) or As (74.9). Hmm, As has a molar mass of about 75.

n=3 → M_Y≈118.29 → around the molar mass of Cd (112) or In (115).

n=4 → M_Y≈157.72 → around the molar mass of tellurium (128) or perhaps something else.

Wait, let me think. If M_Y is about 127, which is iodine, let's see what n would be.

127 = n *39.43 → n≈127 /39.43 ≈3.22. Hmm, not an integer. So that doesn't fit. So if M_Y is 127, then n would be about 3.22, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps Y isn't iodine.

Alternatively, perhaps n is 3 and M_Y is about 118. Let's think of elements around that. Cd is 112, In is 115, maybe Sn is 118.5. Oh, wait, Sn is tin, with a molar mass of about 118.71.

If Y is tin (Sn), then let's see.

n=3 → M_Y≈39.43 *3=118.29, which is close to Sn's molar mass (~118.71). So that would make sense. So A2 is SnF3.

Wait, but does Sn form SnF3? I'm not sure. Tin typically forms SnF2, SnF4. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Y is another element.

Wait, let me think again. If M_Y is about 118 and n=3, that's Sn. If Y is Sn, then A2 would be SnF3. But I'm not certain if that's a known compound. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, perhaps n=4, which would give M_Y≈157.72. But I can't think of a common element around that. Maybe it's a less common metal?

Alternatively, let's think about another approach. If A1 is YF_x, which upon decomposition gives YF_y and F2.

So, for example, if A1 is YF3, and it decomposes into YF and F2. Let me write the equation:

YF3 → YF + F2.

Wait, but that's not balanced. Let's balance it.

YF3 → YF + F2.

So, on the left: 3 F in YF3. On the right: 1 F in YF and 2 F in F2 → total 3 F. So the equation is balanced.

So, the products are YF and F2. So in this case, A2 is YF.

What's the fluorine percentage in YF? Let's compute.

If Y is Sn (molar mass ~118.71, F is 19), then in YF, F is 19/(118.71 +19) =19/137.71 ≈0.138, or 13.8%. But the problem says 31.96%, which is higher.

Hmm, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, maybe Y is a metal with lower molar mass. Let's think about n=4, M_Y=157.72. Hmm, maybe that's Polonium (Po) with a molar mass of about 209, so that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another approach. Let's think about the possible compounds and their reactions.

A1 oxidizes xenon, so perhaps it's a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine itself is a strong oxidizing agent, but it's a diatomic molecule. So perhaps A1 is a compound where Y is in a high oxidation state, making the compound a strong oxidizing agent.

Wait, perhaps Y is oxygen. Oxygen forms O F2, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe Y is chlorine, but ClF3 is a known strong oxidizing agent.

Wait, ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent, and it can react with Xe. Let me think: ClF3 decomposes when heated, but under certain conditions, perhaps it could release F2 and form ClF.

Wait, but earlier I calculated that ClF would have a fluorine percentage of about 34.8%, which is close to 31.96% but not exact. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal in a high oxidation state. For example, Fe in FeF3. Wait, but Fe typically forms FeF2 and FeF3. Let me compute fluorine percentage in FeF3.

Fe has a molar mass of ~55.85. F is 19*3=57. So (57)/(55.85+57)=57/112.85≈0.505, so 50.5%. Not close to 31.96%.

Hmm, perhaps Y is a non-metal in a lower oxidation state. Let me think about sulfur. Sulfur forms SF4 and SF6.

In SF4, fluorine is 4*19=76. Sulfur is ~32.07. So 76/(32.07+76)=76/108.07≈0.703, 70.3%. No, that's higher than 31.96%.

Wait, maybe A2 isn't a simple fluoride but a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps A2 is a salt containing F.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the options given for the molecular weight of A4.

The options are:

A) 140-160

B) 220-240

C) 160-180

D) 110-130

So the question is to find the range where the molecular weight of A4 falls.

Now, let's try to figure out what A4 is.

A4 is a binary compound of F and Y. So it's YF_x.

When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed. Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

Hmm, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when a metal is added to a solution of its own higher fluoride, perhaps it forms a lower fluoride. For example, adding Y (as a metal) to YF4 solution would produce YF2 and perhaps other products.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a metal fluoride, and adding Y (as a metal) causes a redox reaction.

Wait, another angle: A5 decomposes in water. Let's imagine A5 is something like YF3. When YF3 is added to water, it might hydrolyze. For example, YF3 + H2O → Y(OH)3 + HF. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a salt that releases HF and another substance. For example, if A5 is CaF2, then upon hydrolysis, it might not decompose, but perhaps another compound.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A4 is a solution of a higher-valent fluoride, like YF6^3- (if Y is in +3 oxidation state), and adding Y metal would reduce it.

Wait, if Y is a metal, say, Al, then AlF3 is a possible compound. But AlF3 is a white solid that doesn't react with Al metal under normal conditions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a transition metal. For example, suppose Y is Mn. Mn forms MnF2, MnF3, MnF4, etc. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the last part again. When Y is added to A4's solution, A5 is formed. Then A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So perhaps A5 is a salt that can be decomposed into an acid and a base, or into a metal and a fluoride.

Wait, another thought: when a metal is added to a solution of a higher fluoride, perhaps a displacement reaction occurs. For example, adding Y metal to a solution of YF4 might not make sense because Y is already in the same element. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a different fluoride, like MgF2, and adding Y (Mg metal) would produce MgF.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a fluoride where Y is in a higher oxidation state, and adding Y metal (in a lower oxidation state) would reduce it.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF6, and adding Y would form YF4 or another compound.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to piece together what I know:

- Y forms five binary fluorides.

- A1 is a bright red substance that decomposes into A2 and F2, with A2 having 31.96% F.

- A1 oxidizes Xe, so it's a strong oxidizing agent.

- A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, so it's likely a direct fluoride, like YF.

- A4 is a compound whose molecular weight we need to find, in a range.

Maybe A4 is a higher fluoride, like YF5 or YF7, but that depends on Y's valency.

Wait, another thought: if Y is iodine, then the five fluorides could be IF, IF3, IF5, IF7, and perhaps another. For example, maybe IFn for n=1,3,5,7, and another, like IF2? Not sure.

But earlier, when considering A2 as IF3, the fluorine percentage was about 31.96%, which fits. So Y would be iodine.

So Y is I.

So the five binary fluorides are IF, I2F, IF3, IF5, IF7. Wait, but I2F isn't a common compound. Alternatively, perhaps the five are IF, IF3, IF5, IF7, and another, maybe IF4? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is sulfur. Let's see, if Y is S, then possible fluorides are SF2, SF4, SF6. Only three, which doesn't reach five. So that can't be.

Another possibility: Y is chlorine. But Cl forms ClF3 and ClF, which is two, maybe ClF5 and others? Not sure.

Wait, so perhaps Y is iodine. Let's proceed with that.

So A1 is a bright red substance. Iodine trifluoride (IF3) is a colorless gas, not bright red. Iodine pentafluoride (IF5) is also a gas, but I'm not sure about its color. Alternatively, maybe A1 is ClF3, which is a bright yellow-green liquid. Wait, ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent and has a bright yellow-green color, not bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is O F2, which is a bright red gas. Oh, wait, O F2 is a bright red gas at room temperature. That could fit.

So if A1 is O F2, then when it decomposes, maybe it forms O2 and F2. But wait, the decomposition of O F2 is 2 OF2 → O2 + 2 F2. So A2 would be O2, but that can't be right because A2 is a binary fluoride.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the compounds.

Wait, another possibility: could A1 be a compound like XeF2? No, because XeF2 is a noble gas fluoride, and it's not a bright red substance.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a binary compound of fluorine with another element that is bright red and decomposes into another fluoride and F2.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is BrF3. Bromine trifluoride is a colorless liquid, but perhaps under certain conditions it's red. Alternatively, maybe it's a different compound.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach.

If Y is iodine, and A4 is a solution of a higher fluoride, perhaps I'm to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Assuming A4 is YF5 (IF5), which has a molar mass of 127 (I) +5*19=127+95=222 g/mol. So the molecular weight is 222. Looking at the options, option B is 220-240, which would include 222. So the answer could be B.

But wait, the question is about the range of A4's molecular weight. So if A4 is IF5, its molecular weight is 222, which falls into option B.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps A4 is YF4. For Y=I, that would be 127 + 4*19=127+76=203 g/mol. 203 is in the range 220-240? No, 203 is below 220. So option B starts at 220. So 203 is in option D (110-130? No, wait, option D is 110-130, which is much lower.

Alternatively, if A4 is YF3 (IF3), molar mass is 127 + 57= 184 g/mol. That falls into option C (160-180) no, 184 is higher than 180. So option C is 160-180, which would include up to 180. 184 is just above that, so it doesn't fit.

Hmm, so none of the options fit exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps Y isn't iodine. Let me think again.

If the fluorine percentage in A2 is 31.96%, and the formula is YF_n, then:

Earlier, I found M_Y ≈n *39.43. So for n=3, M_Y≈118.29. Let's think of Y as tin (Sn), which has a molar mass of about 118.71. So that fits.

So Y would be tin (Sn), and A2 is SnF3.

Then, A1 would be a higher fluoride, perhaps SnF5. Let's see: when SnF5 decomposes, perhaps it forms SnF and F2.

Wait, the decomposition reaction: SnF5 → SnF + F2.

But let's balance the equation.

SnF5 → SnF + F2.

On the left: 5 F. On the right: 1 F + 2 F (from F2) → 3 F. Not balanced. So need to find the correct stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition is SnF5 → SnF3 + F2.

Let me balance that:

SnF5 → SnF3 + F2.

Left: 5 F. Right: 3 F + 2 F →5 F. So balanced for F. Also, Sn is balanced.

So the equation is SnF5 → SnF3 + F2.

In this case, A2 is SnF3.

Now, what's the fluorine percentage in SnF3?

Sn is about 118.71, F is 3*19=57. So 57/(118.71+57) =57/175.71 ≈0.324, which is 32.4%. Close to 31.96%. So that fits.

So Y is tin (Sn), and A2 is SnF3.

Now, A1 is SnF5, which is a binary fluoride. When it decomposes, it gives SnF3 and F2.

Now, the other parts of the problem.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y with fluorine. So Y is tin, so fluorinating tin would form SnF2, SnF4, etc. A3 is a binary fluoride, perhaps SnF2.

A3 can also interact with xenon. So SnF2 reacts with Xe under certain conditions. Maybe it's a reaction where Xe is oxidized.

Then, when Y (Sn) is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed.

Wait, Y is Sn. So adding Sn to a solution of A4 (a binary fluoride, perhaps SnF4) would produce what? Maybe a displacement reaction.

Wait, SnF4 is a possible compound. Adding Sn metal to SnF4 solution would perhaps not react, as Sn is already in the solution. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a higher-valent tin fluoride, and adding Sn would reduce it.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of SnF6^2- (but that's hypothetical). Alternatively, maybe A4 is SnF4, and adding Sn would produce SnF2.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me proceed.

Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So perhaps A5 is SnF4, which upon hydrolysis would form SnO2 and HF. Wait, SnF4 is a possible compound. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze:

SnF4 + 2 H2O → Sn(OH)2 + 4 HF.

But Sn(OH)2 is not very stable and might further decompose. Alternatively, perhaps it forms SnO2 and H2F2, but I'm not certain.

But regardless, the key point is to determine the molecular weight of A4.

If A4 is SnF4, its molar mass is 118.71 + 4*19 =118.71 +76= 194.71 g/mol. Looking at the options:

A) 140-160 → 194 is above.

B) 220-240 → no.

C) 160-180 → 194 is above.

D) 110-130 → no.

Hmm, none of the options fit 194. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is SnF2.

SnF2's molar mass: 118.71 + 2*19=118.71+38=156.71 g/mol. That falls into option C (160-180) if close, but 156 is just below 160. So option C starts at 160, so 156 would be in option D (110-130? No, 156 is higher than 130). Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps A4 is SnF6, which has a molar mass of 118.71 +6*19=118.71 +114=232.71 g/mol. That falls into option B (220-240), which is correct.

But earlier, I thought that A4 is SnF4, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again.

When Y (Sn) is added to a solution of A4, which is perhaps SnF6, the reaction would be:

SnF6 + Sn → products.

But I'm not sure about the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is SnF4 and the reaction produces SnF2.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is SnF4 + Sn → 2 SnF2.

That would make sense, as Sn is being added to SnF4, reducing the higher fluoride to a lower one.

So A5 would be SnF2, which has a molar mass of 156.71. So A4 is SnF4 (194.71 g/mol) and A5 is SnF2 (156.71). But the question is about A4's molecular weight, which is ~195, which doesn't fit any of the options provided.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me recap:

Y is Sn.

A1 is SnF5.

A2 is SnF3.

A3 is SnF2.

A4 is perhaps SnF4.

When Sn metal is added to a hot, concentrated solution of SnF4, it produces SnF2.

Then, A5 is SnF2, which upon decomposition in water forms Sn(OH)2 and HF.

Wait, but SnF2 would have a molar mass of 156.71, which doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a different compound. Let's think of other possibilities.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the options given. The options are ranges for the molecular weight of A4.

If Y is iodine (I), and A4 is IF5, then its molar mass is 127 +5*19=127+95=222, which falls into option B (220-240).

If Y is tin (Sn), A4 could be SnF4 (194.71), which doesn't fit, or SnF6 (232.71), which fits option B.

So perhaps Y is tin and A4 is SnF6.

But earlier, I thought that when Y is added to A4, which is SnF6, perhaps a displacement reaction occurs. Let me think: SnF6 + Sn → 2 SnF3. So A5 would be SnF3, which has a molar mass of 118.71 +3*19= 118.71 +57=175.71.

So A4's MW is 232.71, which is in option B.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is another compound, but this seems plausible.

So the range for A4's molecular weight would be 220-240, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of substance A4, a binary compound of fluorine with element Y. Five binary fluorides of Y are known, and the behavior of these compounds is described in the question. Here's the analysis:

1. **Identifying Element Y**:  
   - A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 (with 31.96% fluorine by mass) and fluorine gas (F2).  
   - A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing xenon.  
   - The fluorine percentage in A2 (31.96%) suggests a compound of the form YFₙ, where the molar mass of Y can be calculated using the formula:  
     \[
     \frac{n \cdot 19}{M_Y + n \cdot 19} = 0.3196
     \]  
     Solving this gives \( M_Y \approx n \cdot 39.43 \). For \( n = 3 \), \( M_Y \approx 118.29 \), which corresponds to tin (Sn). Thus, Y is identified as tin.

2. **Behavior of the Compounds**:  
   - A1 is likely SnF₅, which decomposes into SnF₃ (A2) and F₂.  
   - A2 (SnF₃) has a fluorine percentage of 31.96%, consistent with the calculation:  
     \[
     \frac{57}{118.71 + 57} \approx 0.324 \, (\text{32.4\%}).
     \]  
   - A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, likely SnF₂.  
   - A4 is a binary fluoride of tin, and its molecular weight must be determined.

3. **Determining A4**:  
   - A4 is a binary compound of fluorine with tin. Possible candidates include SnF₂, SnF₄, and SnF₆.  
   - When Y (Sn) is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes in water into two substances, suggesting A5 is a hydrolyzable fluoride.  
   - If A4 is SnF₆, its molecular weight is:  
     \[
     M = 118.71 + 6 \cdot 19 = 232.71 \, \text{g/mol}.
     \]  
     This falls within the range 220–240.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Based on the analysis, A4 is likely SnF₆, and its molecular weight falls within the range 220–240.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five of them. The compounds are labeled A1 to A5, and each behaves differently in various reactions.

Let me break down each part.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine. When A1 decomposes, the fluorine comes off. So, A1 could be a compound that, when broken down, releases F2 gas. The oF (I think this stands for oxidation state or maybe something else?) is 31.96% for A2. Wait, maybe that's the percentage composition of fluorine in A2.

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So, A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, maybe in a high oxidation state. Xenon is a noble gas, so it's usually unreactive, but under certain conditions, it can form compounds like XeF2, XeF4, or XeF6. Since A1 oxidizes Xe, perhaps A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, like a fluoride with a high oxidation state of Y.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 is likely YF (if Y is in +1 oxidation state) or YF3, YF4, etc., depending on Y's valency.

Then, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. Hmm, when a solution is hot and concentrated, and when a metal is added, perhaps it's a reaction like a double displacement, or some redox reaction.

Let me think about possible elements Y. Since we have five binary fluorides, Y is probably a nonmetals or metals that form multiple fluorides. Possible candidates could be elements like O, S, perhaps Cl, but wait, Cl is a halogen. Alternatively, maybe Y is something like Na, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe Y is oxygen? Because oxygen has multiple fluorides. But wait, oxygen doesn't form that many fluorides. Alternatively, Y could be something like sodium, but sodium typically forms only NaF. Hmm, maybe Y is a halogen, but that might not make much sense.

Wait, let me think again. The problem states it's a binary compound of fluorine with element Y. So Y plus F make the compounds. Five binary compounds, so Y must form five different fluorides. Let's see which elements form multiple fluorides. Maybe chlorine? No, because Cl has only one common fluoride, ClF3? Or wait, maybe Cl can form ClF3 and ClF? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is sulfur. Sulfur forms SF4 and SF6. Wait, but that's only two. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Y is nitrogen. Nitrogen forms NF3 and maybe others, but again, not five.

Wait, another angle: the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. So A1 could be YF3, which decomposes into YF2 and F2? Or maybe something else.

Wait, the data given: when A1 decomposes, the oF is 31.96% for A2. Maybe that's the fluorine content. So let's find a compound where F is 31.96% by mass.

What's the molecular weight of F? Approximately 19 g/mol. So if a compound has F as 31.96%, then for a formula unit, let's say the formula is YF_n.

So (19n)/(M_Y + 19n) = 0.3196.

But without knowing M_Y, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the percentage is 31.96%, which is approximately 32%, close to 32/19 = 1.68 fluorines. Hmm, but that's not very helpful.

Wait, maybe A2 is YF3. Let me check: fluorine is 19*3=57. What's the percentage in YF3? If Y has a molar mass M, then (57)/(M+57) = 0.3196. Let's solve for M.

0.3196*(M+57) = 57
0.3196 M + 0.3196*57 =57
0.3196 M =57 - 0.3196*57
Calculate 0.3196*57: 57 * 0.32 is about 18.24, so 57 - 18.24 =38.76.

0.3196 M =38.76 → M≈38.76 /0.3196 ≈121.2 g/mol.

So Y would have a molar mass around 121.2. Which element is near that? Iodine is about 127. Wait, that's close. So Y could be iodine (I). Hmm, but let's see.

Wait, if Y is iodine, then the fluorides would be IF, IF3, IF5, IF7? Do these exist? I think IF7 is a known compound. So that's five compounds: IF, IF3, IF5, IF7, and maybe another? Or perhaps some other oxidation states.

Wait, but how many binary fluorides does iodine have? I think iodine forms IF5 and IF7, but I'm not certain about the others. Wait, maybe Y is chlorine. No, because chlorine's fluorides are ClF3 and ClF, but again, not five.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is phosphorus. Phosphorus can form PF3, PF5, etc. So let's think: Y is P.

Wait, but let me get back. If Y is iodine, then I could have YF2, YF3, YF4, YF5, YF6. Wait, but that's more than five. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is sulfur. SF4 and SF6. But that's only two. So maybe Y is another element with multiple valencies.

Alternatively, let me think about the first part: A1 is a bright red substance that decomposes into A2 and F2, and A1 is an oxidizing agent for xenon. Xenon's fluorides are formed under specific conditions. For example, XeF2 is formed under certain conditions, and it's a stable compound. But A1 oxidizing Xe suggests that A1 is an oxidizing agent, perhaps in a high oxidation state.

Wait, another thought: maybe A1 is ClF3. Because ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent and can react with noble gases. Hmm, but ClF3 decomposes into ClF and F2 upon heating. Let's see: ClF3 → ClF + F2. So if A1 is ClF3, then A2 would be ClF.

Wait, let's calculate the fluorine percentage in A2 (ClF). Fluorine's molar mass is ~19, Cl is ~35.5. So (19)/(35.5 +19) = 19/54.5 ≈ 0.348, which is about 34.8%. But in the problem, it's 31.96%. Hmm, not matching exactly. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is O F2, but that's a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach is better. Let's proceed with Y being iodine.

If Y is iodine, then A1 could be IF5, which might decompose into IF3 and F2. Let's check the fluorine percentage in A2 (IF3). I is 127, F is 19*3=57. So (57)/(127+57)=57/184≈0.310, which is about 31%, close to 31.96%. Hmm, that's pretty close. So perhaps A2 is IF3.

So Y would be I. Then, the five binary fluorides would be IF, IF3, IF5, IF7, and perhaps another. Wait, but I'm not sure if there are five known. Let me think: I know that I can form IF5, IF7, and possibly lower ones like IF3 and IF. So maybe that's five if considering different stoichiometries.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about that. Alternatively, another approach: the problem states that A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So perhaps Y is in its elemental form, and when fluorinated, it forms A3. If Y is a metal, then fluorination would produce a fluoride. But if Y is a non-metal, perhaps it forms a different fluoride.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the formation of A5. When Y is added to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, it forms A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. That makes me think of something like the hydrolysis of a salt. For example, when NaF is added to something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of a higher fluoride, and adding Y (as a metal) could cause a reaction. Wait, if Y is iodine, perhaps A4 is a solution of something like KIO3 or another iodine compound.

Wait, let's think about A5. It decomposes in water into two substances. That could imply it's an acid or a salt that breaks down into an acid and a base, like a carbonate decomposing into CO2 and water, but perhaps more likely, it's a salt that hydrolyzes. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal iodide reacting with water to form iodine and another compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A5 is a hydrogen iodide, but no, H-I is a gas. Alternatively, maybe A5 is something like I2O5, which upon decomposition in water gives HI and O2. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a higher fluoride, like YF6^3- or something else. Or maybe A4 is a solution of YF4.

Wait, another thought. When Y is added to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, what reaction occurs? Maybe it's a precipitation reaction. For example, if A4 is a solution of a metal fluoride, adding Y (another metal) could displace it. But since Y is a non-metal in this context (assuming it's iodine), maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal, making A4 a metal fluoride solution. But then A5 would be another compound when Y is added. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think about the initial part again. A1 is a bright red substance that decomposes into A2 and fluorine. A1 is an oxidizing agent for Xe. So perhaps A1 is a high oxidation state fluoride.

Wait, another thought. Could A1 be ClF3? Because ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent. When it decomposes, perhaps it forms ClF and F2. Let's see: ClF3 → ClF + F2. So in that case, A2 would be ClF. Let's compute the fluorine percentage in ClF.

Cl has a molar mass of about 35.5, F is 19. So in ClF, F is 19/(35.5+19) = 19/54.5 ≈ 0.348, which is 34.8%. But the problem states 31.96%, which is lower. Close, but not the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is BrF3, which decomposes into BrF and F2. Let's check BrF's fluorine content. Br is about 80, F is 19. So 19/(80+19)=19/99≈0.1919 or 19.19%. Not 31.96% so probably not.

Alternatively, maybe A1 is O F2. Wait, that's a gas, but I'm not sure about its decomposition. Also, O F2 is a strong oxidizer. But O's fluorides are not that common.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride like IF7. Wait, but I'm not sure how it would decompose. Let me think: IF7 might decompose into IF5 and F2. Let's see: in IF5, fluorine is 5*19=95, iodine is 127. So 95/(127+95)=95/222≈0.428, which is 42.8%. Not 31.96%.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the fluorine percentage. 31.96% F in A2.

So, fluorine is 31.96% by mass, which is 0.3196. Let's calculate the possible formula.

Assume the formula is YF_n.

So (n * 19) / (M_Y + n * 19) = 0.3196.

Let me rearrange this equation:

n *19 = 0.3196 * (M_Y + n *19)

n *19 = 0.3196 M_Y + 0.3196 *n *19

Bring terms together:

n *19 - 0.3196 n *19 = 0.3196 M_Y

n *19 (1 - 0.3196) = 0.3196 M_Y

n *19 * 0.6804 = 0.3196 M_Y

So M_Y = [n *19 *0.6804 ] / 0.3196

Let me compute that.

0.6804 /0.3196 ≈2.128.

So M_Y ≈ n*19 *2.128.

So M_Y ≈ n * 39.43.

So for different n values, M_Y would be:

n=1 → ~39.43 g/mol → which is around the atomic mass of K (about 39). But K is a metal and would form KF, but K's fluorides would be KF, KF2? Wait, K typically has a +1 charge, so KF is the main fluoride. But KF is a binary compound.

n=2 → M_Y ≈78.86 → which is around the atomic mass of something like Ge (72.6) or As (74.9). Hmm, As has a molar mass of about 75.

n=3 → M_Y≈118.29 → around the molar mass of Cd (112) or In (115).

n=4 → M_Y≈157.72 → around the molar mass of tellurium (128) or perhaps something else.

Wait, let me think. If M_Y is about 127, which is iodine, let's see what n would be.

127 = n *39.43 → n≈127 /39.43 ≈3.22. Hmm, not an integer. So that doesn't fit. So if M_Y is 127, then n would be about 3.22, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps Y isn't iodine.

Alternatively, perhaps n is 3 and M_Y is about 118. Let's think of elements around that. Cd is 112, In is 115, maybe Sn is 118.5. Oh, wait, Sn is tin, with a molar mass of about 118.71.

If Y is tin (Sn), then let's see.

n=3 → M_Y≈39.43 *3=118.29, which is close to Sn's molar mass (~118.71). So that would make sense. So A2 is SnF3.

Wait, but does Sn form SnF3? I'm not sure. Tin typically forms SnF2, SnF4. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Y is another element.

Wait, let me think again. If M_Y is about 118 and n=3, that's Sn. If Y is Sn, then A2 would be SnF3. But I'm not certain if that's a known compound. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, perhaps n=4, which would give M_Y≈157.72. But I can't think of a common element around that. Maybe it's a less common metal?

Alternatively, let's think about another approach. If A1 is YF_x, which upon decomposition gives YF_y and F2.

So, for example, if A1 is YF3, and it decomposes into YF and F2. Let me write the equation:

YF3 → YF + F2.

Wait, but that's not balanced. Let's balance it.

YF3 → YF + F2.

So, on the left: 3 F in YF3. On the right: 1 F in YF and 2 F in F2 → total 3 F. So the equation is balanced.

So, the products are YF and F2. So in this case, A2 is YF.

What's the fluorine percentage in YF? Let's compute.

If Y is Sn (molar mass ~118.71, F is 19), then in YF, F is 19/(118.71 +19) =19/137.71 ≈0.138, or 13.8%. But the problem says 31.96%, which is higher.

Hmm, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, maybe Y is a metal with lower molar mass. Let's think about n=4, M_Y=157.72. Hmm, maybe that's Polonium (Po) with a molar mass of about 209, so that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another approach. Let's think about the possible compounds and their reactions.

A1 oxidizes xenon, so perhaps it's a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine itself is a strong oxidizing agent, but it's a diatomic molecule. So perhaps A1 is a compound where Y is in a high oxidation state, making the compound a strong oxidizing agent.

Wait, perhaps Y is oxygen. Oxygen forms O F2, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe Y is chlorine, but ClF3 is a known strong oxidizing agent.

Wait, ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent, and it can react with Xe. Let me think: ClF3 decomposes when heated, but under certain conditions, perhaps it could release F2 and form ClF.

Wait, but earlier I calculated that ClF would have a fluorine percentage of about 34.8%, which is close to 31.96% but not exact. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal in a high oxidation state. For example, Fe in FeF3. Wait, but Fe typically forms FeF2 and FeF3. Let me compute fluorine percentage in FeF3.

Fe has a molar mass of ~55.85. F is 19*3=57. So (57)/(55.85+57)=57/112.85≈0.505, so 50.5%. Not close to 31.96%.

Hmm, perhaps Y is a non-metal in a lower oxidation state. Let me think about sulfur. Sulfur forms SF4 and SF6.

In SF4, fluorine is 4*19=76. Sulfur is ~32.07. So 76/(32.07+76)=76/108.07≈0.703, 70.3%. No, that's higher than 31.96%.

Wait, maybe A2 isn't a simple fluoride but a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps A2 is a salt containing F.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the options given for the molecular weight of A4.

The options are:

A) 140-160

B) 220-240

C) 160-180

D) 110-130

So the question is to find the range where the molecular weight of A4 falls.

Now, let's try to figure out what A4 is.

A4 is a binary compound of F and Y. So it's YF_x.

When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed. Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

Hmm, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when a metal is added to a solution of its own higher fluoride, perhaps it forms a lower fluoride. For example, adding Y (as a metal) to YF4 solution would produce YF2 and perhaps other products.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a metal fluoride, and adding Y (as a metal) causes a redox reaction.

Wait, another angle: A5 decomposes in water. Let's imagine A5 is something like YF3. When YF3 is added to water, it might hydrolyze. For example, YF3 + H2O → Y(OH)3 + HF. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a salt that releases HF and another substance. For example, if A5 is CaF2, then upon hydrolysis, it might not decompose, but perhaps another compound.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A4 is a solution of a higher-valent fluoride, like YF6^3- (if Y is in +3 oxidation state), and adding Y metal would reduce it.

Wait, if Y is a metal, say, Al, then AlF3 is a possible compound. But AlF3 is a white solid that doesn't react with Al metal under normal conditions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a transition metal. For example, suppose Y is Mn. Mn forms MnF2, MnF3, MnF4, etc. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the last part again. When Y is added to A4's solution, A5 is formed. Then A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So perhaps A5 is a salt that can be decomposed into an acid and a base, or into a metal and a fluoride.

Wait, another thought: when a metal is added to a solution of a higher fluoride, perhaps a displacement reaction occurs. For example, adding Y metal to a solution of YF4 might not make sense because Y is already in the same element. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a different fluoride, like MgF2, and adding Y (Mg metal) would produce MgF.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a fluoride where Y is in a higher oxidation state, and adding Y metal (in a lower oxidation state) would reduce it.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF6, and adding Y would form YF4 or another compound.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to piece together what I know:

- Y forms five binary fluorides.

- A1 is a bright red substance that decomposes into A2 and F2, with A2 having 31.96% F.

- A1 oxidizes Xe, so it's a strong oxidizing agent.

- A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, so it's likely a direct fluoride, like YF.

- A4 is a compound whose molecular weight we need to find, in a range.

Maybe A4 is a higher fluoride, like YF5 or YF7, but that depends on Y's valency.

Wait, another thought: if Y is iodine, then the five fluorides could be IF, IF3, IF5, IF7, and perhaps another. For example, maybe IFn for n=1,3,5,7, and another, like IF2? Not sure.

But earlier, when considering A2 as IF3, the fluorine percentage was about 31.96%, which fits. So Y would be iodine.

So Y is I.

So the five binary fluorides are IF, I2F, IF3, IF5, IF7. Wait, but I2F isn't a common compound. Alternatively, perhaps the five are IF, IF3, IF5, IF7, and another, maybe IF4? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is sulfur. Let's see, if Y is S, then possible fluorides are SF2, SF4, SF6. Only three, which doesn't reach five. So that can't be.

Another possibility: Y is chlorine. But Cl forms ClF3 and ClF, which is two, maybe ClF5 and others? Not sure.

Wait, so perhaps Y is iodine. Let's proceed with that.

So A1 is a bright red substance. Iodine trifluoride (IF3) is a colorless gas, not bright red. Iodine pentafluoride (IF5) is also a gas, but I'm not sure about its color. Alternatively, maybe A1 is ClF3, which is a bright yellow-green liquid. Wait, ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent and has a bright yellow-green color, not bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is O F2, which is a bright red gas. Oh, wait, O F2 is a bright red gas at room temperature. That could fit.

So if A1 is O F2, then when it decomposes, maybe it forms O2 and F2. But wait, the decomposition of O F2 is 2 OF2 → O2 + 2 F2. So A2 would be O2, but that can't be right because A2 is a binary fluoride.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the compounds.

Wait, another possibility: could A1 be a compound like XeF2? No, because XeF2 is a noble gas fluoride, and it's not a bright red substance.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a binary compound of fluorine with another element that is bright red and decomposes into another fluoride and F2.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is BrF3. Bromine trifluoride is a colorless liquid, but perhaps under certain conditions it's red. Alternatively, maybe it's a different compound.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach.

If Y is iodine, and A4 is a solution of a higher fluoride, perhaps I'm to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Assuming A4 is YF5 (IF5), which has a molar mass of 127 (I) +5*19=127+95=222 g/mol. So the molecular weight is 222. Looking at the options, option B is 220-240, which would include 222. So the answer could be B.

But wait, the question is about the range of A4's molecular weight. So if A4 is IF5, its molecular weight is 222, which falls into option B.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps A4 is YF4. For Y=I, that would be 127 + 4*19=127+76=203 g/mol. 203 is in the range 220-240? No, 203 is below 220. So option B starts at 220. So 203 is in option D (110-130? No, wait, option D is 110-130, which is much lower.

Alternatively, if A4 is YF3 (IF3), molar mass is 127 + 57= 184 g/mol. That falls into option C (160-180) no, 184 is higher than 180. So option C is 160-180, which would include up to 180. 184 is just above that, so it doesn't fit.

Hmm, so none of the options fit exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps Y isn't iodine. Let me think again.

If the fluorine percentage in A2 is 31.96%, and the formula is YF_n, then:

Earlier, I found M_Y ≈n *39.43. So for n=3, M_Y≈118.29. Let's think of Y as tin (Sn), which has a molar mass of about 118.71. So that fits.

So Y would be tin (Sn), and A2 is SnF3.

Then, A1 would be a higher fluoride, perhaps SnF5. Let's see: when SnF5 decomposes, perhaps it forms SnF and F2.

Wait, the decomposition reaction: SnF5 → SnF + F2.

But let's balance the equation.

SnF5 → SnF + F2.

On the left: 5 F. On the right: 1 F + 2 F (from F2) → 3 F. Not balanced. So need to find the correct stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition is SnF5 → SnF3 + F2.

Let me balance that:

SnF5 → SnF3 + F2.

Left: 5 F. Right: 3 F + 2 F →5 F. So balanced for F. Also, Sn is balanced.

So the equation is SnF5 → SnF3 + F2.

In this case, A2 is SnF3.

Now, what's the fluorine percentage in SnF3?

Sn is about 118.71, F is 3*19=57. So 57/(118.71+57) =57/175.71 ≈0.324, which is 32.4%. Close to 31.96%. So that fits.

So Y is tin (Sn), and A2 is SnF3.

Now, A1 is SnF5, which is a binary fluoride. When it decomposes, it gives SnF3 and F2.

Now, the other parts of the problem.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y with fluorine. So Y is tin, so fluorinating tin would form SnF2, SnF4, etc. A3 is a binary fluoride, perhaps SnF2.

A3 can also interact with xenon. So SnF2 reacts with Xe under certain conditions. Maybe it's a reaction where Xe is oxidized.

Then, when Y (Sn) is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed.

Wait, Y is Sn. So adding Sn to a solution of A4 (a binary fluoride, perhaps SnF4) would produce what? Maybe a displacement reaction.

Wait, SnF4 is a possible compound. Adding Sn metal to SnF4 solution would perhaps not react, as Sn is already in the solution. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a higher-valent tin fluoride, and adding Sn would reduce it.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of SnF6^2- (but that's hypothetical). Alternatively, maybe A4 is SnF4, and adding Sn would produce SnF2.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me proceed.

Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So perhaps A5 is SnF4, which upon hydrolysis would form SnO2 and HF. Wait, SnF4 is a possible compound. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze:

SnF4 + 2 H2O → Sn(OH)2 + 4 HF.

But Sn(OH)2 is not very stable and might further decompose. Alternatively, perhaps it forms SnO2 and H2F2, but I'm not certain.

But regardless, the key point is to determine the molecular weight of A4.

If A4 is SnF4, its molar mass is 118.71 + 4*19 =118.71 +76= 194.71 g/mol. Looking at the options:

A) 140-160 → 194 is above.

B) 220-240 → no.

C) 160-180 → 194 is above.

D) 110-130 → no.

Hmm, none of the options fit 194. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is SnF2.

SnF2's molar mass: 118.71 + 2*19=118.71+38=156.71 g/mol. That falls into option C (160-180) if close, but 156 is just below 160. So option C starts at 160, so 156 would be in option D (110-130? No, 156 is higher than 130). Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps A4 is SnF6, which has a molar mass of 118.71 +6*19=118.71 +114=232.71 g/mol. That falls into option B (220-240), which is correct.

But earlier, I thought that A4 is SnF4, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again.

When Y (Sn) is added to a solution of A4, which is perhaps SnF6, the reaction would be:

SnF6 + Sn → products.

But I'm not sure about the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is SnF4 and the reaction produces SnF2.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is SnF4 + Sn → 2 SnF2.

That would make sense, as Sn is being added to SnF4, reducing the higher fluoride to a lower one.

So A5 would be SnF2, which has a molar mass of 156.71. So A4 is SnF4 (194.71 g/mol) and A5 is SnF2 (156.71). But the question is about A4's molecular weight, which is ~195, which doesn't fit any of the options provided.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me recap:

Y is Sn.

A1 is SnF5.

A2 is SnF3.

A3 is SnF2.

A4 is perhaps SnF4.

When Sn metal is added to a hot, concentrated solution of SnF4, it produces SnF2.

Then, A5 is SnF2, which upon decomposition in water forms Sn(OH)2 and HF.

Wait, but SnF2 would have a molar mass of 156.71, which doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a different compound. Let's think of other possibilities.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the options given. The options are ranges for the molecular weight of A4.

If Y is iodine (I), and A4 is IF5, then its molar mass is 127 +5*19=127+95=222, which falls into option B (220-240).

If Y is tin (Sn), A4 could be SnF4 (194.71), which doesn't fit, or SnF6 (232.71), which fits option B.

So perhaps Y is tin and A4 is SnF6.

But earlier, I thought that when Y is added to A4, which is SnF6, perhaps a displacement reaction occurs. Let me think: SnF6 + Sn → 2 SnF3. So A5 would be SnF3, which has a molar mass of 118.71 +3*19= 118.71 +57=175.71.

So A4's MW is 232.71, which is in option B.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is another compound, but this seems plausible.

So the range for A4's molecular weight would be 220-240, which is option B.


The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of substance A4, a binary compound of fluorine with element Y. Five binary fluorides of Y are known, and the behavior of these compounds is described in the question. Here's the analysis:

1. **Identifying Element Y**:  
   - A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 (with 31.96% fluorine by mass) and fluorine gas (F2).  
   - A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing xenon.  
   - The fluorine percentage in A2 (31.96%) suggests a compound of the form YFₙ, where the molar mass of Y can be calculated using the formula:  
     \[
     \frac{n \cdot 19}{M_Y + n \cdot 19} = 0.3196
     \]  
     Solving this gives \( M_Y \approx n \cdot 39.43 \). For \( n = 3 \), \( M_Y \approx 118.29 \), which corresponds to tin (Sn). Thus, Y is identified as tin.

2. **Behavior of the Compounds**:  
   - A1 is likely SnF₅, which decomposes into SnF₃ (A2) and F₂.  
   - A2 (SnF₃) has a fluorine percentage of 31.96%, consistent with the calculation:  
     \[
     \frac{57}{118.71 + 57} \approx 0.324 \, (\text{32.4\%}).
     \]  
   - A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, likely SnF₂.  
   - A4 is a binary fluoride of tin, and its molecular weight must be determined.

3. **Determining A4**:  
   - A4 is a binary compound of fluorine with tin. Possible candidates include SnF₂, SnF₄, and SnF₆.  
   - When Y (Sn) is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes in water into two substances, suggesting A5 is a hydrolyzable fluoride.  
   - If A4 is SnF₆, its molecular weight is:  
     \[
     M = 118.71 + 6 \cdot 19 = 232.71 \, \text{g/mol}.
     \]  
     This falls within the range 220–240.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Based on the analysis, A4 is likely SnF₆, and its molecular weight falls within the range 220–240.
