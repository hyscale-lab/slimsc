Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about the Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives two reactions and asks about the starting materials and products. The first reaction is A + H2SO4 producing 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. The second reaction is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate plus H2SO4 giving product B. I need to choose the correct options from A to D.

I remember that the Pinacol rearrangement involves a 1,2-diol (two adjacent hydroxyl groups) under acidic conditions. The mechanism typically involves protonation of one alcohol, which makes it a better leaving group, followed by a hydride or alkyl shift. This leads to the formation of a ketone.

So, for the first reaction, the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me try to draw its structure mentally. It's a cyclohexanone ring with two p-tolyl groups attached to the second carbon. So, the ketone is at position 1, and the two substituents are at position 2.

The starting material A must be a diol that upon rearrangement gives this product. In the Pinacol rearrangement, the diol would have two adjacent hydroxyl groups. When the rearrangement occurs, the two adjacent carbons become a carbonyl group. So, I think the diol should have two OH groups on adjacent carbons, each connected to a p-tolyl group.

Wait, but the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexanone. So, the diol must have been a cyclohexanol derivative with two adjacent diols, right? Let's think: The diol would have two OH groups on adjacent carbons of a cyclohexane ring, each attached to a p-tolyl group.

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the diol is a secondary alcohol with two adjacent hydroxyls. Oh wait, no, diols have two OH groups. So, for the product to have two p-tolyl groups on C2, the starting diol must have each OH attached to a carbon that will end up as adjacent carbons in the product. Hmm.

Wait, the Pinacol rearrangement transforms a 1,2-diol into a ketone. The general structure is that the diol is RCH(OH)CH(OH)R', and upon rearrangement, it becomes R'C(O)R, with a shift of a group.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The typical Pinacol structure is a vicinal diol, like HO-R1-R2-OH, where R1 and R2 are adjacent. Under acid, one OH gets protonated, becomes a good leaving group. Then a hydride or alkyl shift occurs, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

So, the product would have a carbonyl group where one of the R groups has moved.

In the first reaction, the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the cyclohexanone has two p-tolyl groups on C2. So, the starting diol must have had two OH groups on adjacent carbons, each attached to a p-tolyl group. Wait, but in the rearrangement, the OH groups are on adjacent carbons, so if we have two p-tolyl groups on adjacent carbons, but in the product, they end up on the same carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the starting diol is a cyclohexane with two adjacent OH groups, each attached to a p-tolyl group on adjacent carbons. When the rearrangement happens, the two OHs are on adjacent carbons, but when the shift happens, one of the groups moves to form a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diol where the two OH groups are on the same carbon. Wait, no, that's not possible because vicinal diols have adjacent OHs.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclohexanol with two adjacent p-tolyl groups and two OHs on those adjacent carbons. So, like, the structure would be cyclohexane with two adjacent CH(OH) groups, each attached to a p-tolyl. When the acid is added, one OH is protonated, then a hydride shift occurs, leading the formation of a carbonyl group on one of the adjacent carbons, with the other becoming a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the diol is a bicyclic structure or something else. Alternatively, maybe the diol is on a six-membered ring, like cyclohexane. For example, the diol could be 1,2-cyclohexanediol with each OH attached to a p-tolyl group on adjacent carbons.

Wait, no, that's not possible because each carbon can only have so many substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the diol is a cyclohexane ring where two adjacent carbons each have an OH and a p-tolyl group.

Wait, but that would make it di-p-tolylcyclohexanediol-1,2. Then, upon rearrangement, the two adjacent OH's would lose a water molecule, and the group would shift to form a ketone.

Wait, let's think about how the product is 2,2-di-p-tolyl. So, the product has two p-tolyl groups on the same carbon (C2), and the ketone is at C1.

So, the starting diol must have the two p-tolyl groups on adjacent carbons, with each attached to an OH. When one OH is protonated, a hydride shift occurs from the adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. So, the diol would have a structure like (p-tolyl)CH(OH)CH(OH)(p-tolyl), but that would be a four-carbon chain, not a ring. But wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring where two adjacent carbons have OH and p-tolyl groups each.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a diol where each of the two adjacent OHs is attached to a p-tolyl group. So, when the rearrangement happens, one of the p-tolyl groups moves, but that doesn't make sense because the product has two p-tolyl groups on the same carbon.

Alternatively, the starting diol has each of two adjacent carbons bearing an OH and a p-tolyl group. So, when the rearrangement occurs, the OHs are on adjacent carbons, and after a hydride shift, the p-tolyl groups end up on the same carbon as the ketone.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of the mechanism. In the Pinacol rearrangement, the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons. Under acid, one OH is protonated, making it a better leaving group. The adjacent OH donates a hydride, leading to the formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the diol is something like (R)CH(OH)CH(OH)(R'), and upon rearrangement, it becomes R'C(O)R with the loss of a water molecule. So, in our case, R and R' would be p-tolyl groups.

Wait, but in the product, both p-tolyl groups are on the same carbon. So, R and R' must have been on the same carbon in the starting material. Or perhaps the starting material is a 1,2-diol where each OH is attached to a carbon that's connected to a p-tolyl group. So, when the rearrangement occurs, one p-tolyl stays, and the other moves.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclohexanol where on two adjacent carbons, each has an OH and a p-tolyl group. So, the structure would be something like cyclohexane with two adjacent CH(OH)(p-tolyl) groups. Then, when the acid is added, the protonation and rearrangement would cause the formation of a ketone, with both p-tolyl groups on the same carbon.

So, the starting material A is a cyclohexane ring with two adjacent diols, each attached to a p-tolyl group. So, the structure would be 1,2-bis(p-tolylcyclohexanediol), right? But looking at the options, option A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol.

Wait, wait, what's that structure? 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So, the cyclohexanol has a substituent at position 1 which is a hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl group. Wait, that would be a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane at position 1, and that methyl has two hydroxyl groups, each attached to a p-tolyl group. Hmm, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexanol where the adjacent carbon (position 2) has a hydroxyl and a p-tolyl group. Wait, but the name is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diol where each of two adjacent carbons has an OH group and a p-tolyl group. So, the structure would be something like:

p-tolyl-O-C-OH-C-p-tolyl, but thatâ€™s not a ring.

Wait, maybe the diol is a bicyclic compound, but that might complicate things.

Looking at the options, option A says A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So, the cyclohexanol has a substituent at position 1, which is a hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl group. So, that substituent is a methyl group attached to two hydroxy groups, each attached to a p-tolyl.

Wait, that would imply that the substituent is like (HO-p-tolyl)2CH-. So, the group is a methyl with two hydroxyls, each attached to a p-tolyl. But wait, that would make a vicinal diol on a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but then when the acid is added, the diol would rearrange. So, each hydroxyl is on a different carbon of the methyl group. The protonation occurs on one OH, then a hydride shift from the adjacent carbon, leading to a ketone.

Wait, but the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the ketone is on C1, and C2 has two p-tolyl groups.

Hmm, maybe that's correct. So, the starting material A is a cyclohexanol (position 1) with a substituent at position 1, which is a methyl group with two adjacent hydroxyls, each attached to a p-tolyl group.

When the rearrangement occurs, the diol part (the methyl group) undergoes the Pinacol rearrangement. So, the diol (vicinal) would rearrange into a ketone. So, the methyl group would become a ketone with the p-tolyl groups attached.

Wait, but the product is a cyclohexanone with two p-tolyl groups on C2. So, perhaps the substituent on the cyclohexane, after rearrangement, brings the p-tolyl groups to C2.

Wait, maybe the rearrangement leads to the loss of the methyl group, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the group shifts.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look at the second part of the question to get some clues.

The second reaction is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate with H2SO4 giving product B. So, the starting material is a methyl ester of a dihydroxybutanoate with a p-tolyl group on C2.

The structure is CH2(COOCH3)(OH)CH2(OH)CH2-p-tolyl? Wait, no. Let me think. The starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. So, butanoate is four carbons. The 2-position has both a hydroxyl and a p-tolyl group. The 3-position has a hydroxyl.

So, the structure is:

p-tolyl-C(OH)(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, butanoate is CH2CH2CH2COOCH3, but with substituents. The 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate would have the structure:

CH2(COOCH3)-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-OH-CH2?

Wait, no, butanoate is CH3CH2CH2COO-, but the substituents are at 2 and 3. So, the structure is:

p-tolyl is on C2, hydroxyl on C2 and C3. So, it's:

CH2(COOCH3) is at C4, then C3 is CH(OH), C2 is CH(OH)(p-tolyl), and C1 is CH2?

Wait, I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me draw it:

Butanoate is four carbons. So, positions are 1,2,3,4 from the COOCH3.

So, position 1: CH2-

position 2: C(OH)(p-tolyl)

position 3: CH(OH)

position 4: COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, butanoate is CH2CH2CH2COOCH3, so the four carbons are:

1 (COOCH3), 2, 3, 4 (the methyl end). Hmm, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, no. The correct structure for 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate methyl ester would be:

The butanoate is CH2CH2CH2COOCH3, with the p-tolyl and two OHs on the second carbon. So, the ester is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-CH2

Wait, no. Because butanoate is four carbons in a row. The substituents are on the second carbon. So, the structure is:

COOCH3 is at C1, then C2 is CH(OH)(p-tolyl), C3 is CH(OH), and C4 is CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, butanoate has four carbons:

Positions 1 (COOCH3), 2, 3, 4 (CH3).

So, the starting ester is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-CH3

So, the ester is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

When this undergoes Pinacol rearrangement, what happens? The vicinal diols (on C2 and C3) would undergo rearrangement. So, the two OHs are on adjacent carbons (C2 and C3), each attached to a group.

Protonation occurs on one OH, let's say on C2. Then, a hydride shift occurs from C3 to C2, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group on C2.

Wait, but wait, when a rearrangement occurs, the adjacent diol becomes a ketone. Let me think about the mechanism. The diol is RCH(OH)CH(OH)R'. Upon acid, the first OH is protonated. The adjacent OH donates a hydride, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. The leaving group (water) departs, and the structure rearranges.

So, in this case, the diol is on C2 and C3. Let's say the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, no, the structure is:

COOCH3 is attached to the first carbon, then the second carbon is CH(OH)(p-tolyl), third is CH(OH), and fourth is CH3.

Wait, no, the butanoate is CH2CH(OH)(p-tolyl)CH(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, but butanoate only has four carbons. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-CH2-

Wait, but that would make it a five-carbon chain, which isn't correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3 is at the end. So, the four carbons are:

COOCH3 - CH2 - C(OH)(p-tolyl) - CH(OH) - CH3.

Wait, that's five carbons; perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Butanoate has four carbons in total. So, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3) - CH(OH)(p-tolyl) - CH(OH) - CH3.

Wait, that can't be right because that would be four carbons in a row after the ester group.

Wait, perhaps it's:

The ester is O-CO-OCH3 attached to a butanoate chain. The butanoate is CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, the starting molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, when this undergoes acid catalyzed rearrangement, the diol (on C2 and C3) will rearrange.

The mechanism: protonation of one OH (say, on C2), which makes it a better leaving group. Then, a hydride shift occurs from C3 to C2, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group on C2. The leaving group is water, which is lost.

So, after rearrangement, the C3 would have a hydrogen, and the C2 would have a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the substituents on C2 and C3 would determine where the groups go. So, the p-tolyl is on C2, and the other substituents are hydrogens.

So, the product would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C(O)-p-tolyl - CH2 - CH3.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the product would be a ketone on C2, with the p-tolyl attached. So, the structure would be:

COOCH3-CH2-C(O)(p-tolyl)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that would make it a pentanoate, not butanoate. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, the product would be a methyl ester of 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoic acid. So, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C(O)(p-tolyl)-CH2.

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain with a ketone on C3.

Wait, but the starting material was a butanoate, so the product would be a shorter chain? Or maybe the same chain but with a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. Which would make sense because the ketone is at position 3, and the p-tolyl is at position 2.

Looking at the options, option A says B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. Option B also has B as that. Option C and D have different structures for B.

So, the product B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So, looking at the starting materials for the first reaction, which must produce 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one.

The starting material A must be a vicinal diol. Looking at the options, option A says A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol.

So, the structure would be a cyclohexanol (position 1) with a substituent at position 1, which is a methyl group attached to two hydroxyl groups, each connected to a p-tolyl group.

So, structure is:

Cyclohexanol (OH at position 1) and a substituent at position 1 which is a methyl group with two hydroxyls, each linked to a p-tolyl.

Wait, but in reality, the substituent on the cyclohexane would have two OH groups adjacent. When the rearrangement happens, the diol would form a ketone.

But the product is a cyclohexanone with two p-tolyl groups on C2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent on the cyclohexane is a diol which, upon rearrangement, brings the p-tolyl groups to C2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)(p-tolyl) group. No, that would not make sense.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a diol on the same carbon. Oh wait, the substituent is a methyl group with two hydroxyls attached to p-tolyl groups. So, the substituent is (HO-p-tolyl)2CH- attached to the cyclohexane.

So, when the acid is added, the diol on the substituent undergoes rearrangement, leading to a ketone. The substituent would become a keto group, and the p-tolyl groups would be on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent would be a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane's position 1, and the diol is on the methyl group.

Upon rearrangement, the diol (on the methyl group) would form a ketone, so the substituent becomes a ketone group. So, the cyclohexane's position 1 would have a carbonyl group, and the p-tolyl groups would be on the adjacent carbon (position 2).

Wait, that would make the product 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, which matches the first reaction's product.

So, the starting material A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, which is option A or D.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Option D) A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B is methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate.

Wait, but the second reaction's product is B as the Pinacol rearrangement of the given dihydroxybutanoate, which we determined is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. So, B should be that, which is option A or B.

Looking at the options, option A and B have B as methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So, option A says A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol and B as methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Option D has a different B. So, for the first reaction, if the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, the starting material A would have to be a diol attached to the cyclohexane in a way that when it rearranges, the two p-tolyl groups end up on C2, and the ketone on C1.

So, the substituent on the cyclohexane (position 1) is a diol on a methyl group. Upon rearrangement, the methyl diol becomes a ketone, and the two p-tolyl groups move to C2.

So, the starting material is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, which is option A or D.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Option D: B is another structure.

Since the second reaction's product B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate, the correct options must have B as that. So, options A and B are possibilities.

Now, looking at the first reaction's product, 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, the starting material is a diol on a cyclohexane ring. So, the substituent on position 1 is a diol, leading to the product structure.

So, the starting material A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. Which is option A or D.

Wait, the options for A are:

Option A: A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol.

Option D: A is the same but with cyclopentan-1-ol.

So, if the product is a cyclohexanone, the starting material must be a cyclohexanol derivative.

So, option A is cyclohexan-1-ol, which would give the correct product.

So, putting it all together, option A has the correct A and B.

But wait, let's double-check.

Option A says:

A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol,

B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So, both reactions are correct.

So, the correct answer would be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement involves a vicinal diol undergoing acid-catalyzed rearrangement to form a ketone. In the first reaction, the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, a cyclohexanone with two p-tolyl groups on the second carbon and a ketone at the first carbon. The starting material must be a vicinal diol where the two hydroxyl groups are adjacent, each attached to a p-tolyl group. Upon rearrangement, the diol forms a ketone, and the two p-tolyl groups end up on the same carbon. The correct starting material for this reaction is **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol**, as it has the required diol structure on a cyclohexane ring.

In the second reaction, the starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate, a methyl ester with a vicinal diol on the second and third carbons, where the second carbon also has a p-tolyl group. Under acidic conditions, the diol undergoes rearrangement to form a ketone. The product of this reaction is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**, where the ketone is at the third carbon, and the p-tolyl group remains at the second carbon.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. This matches both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. The starting material A is incorrect because it involves a cyclopentane ring, which would not produce the cyclohexanone product.
- **Option C**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol, B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate. Both A and B are incorrect.
- **Option D**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate. While A is correct, B is incorrect because the product structure does not match the expected rearrangement.

The correct answer is **Option A**, as it provides the correct starting materials and products for both reactions.

Answer: A

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about the Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives two reactions and asks about the starting materials and products. The first reaction is A + H2SO4 producing 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. The second reaction is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate plus H2SO4 giving product B. I need to choose the correct options from A to D.

I remember that the Pinacol rearrangement involves a 1,2-diol (two adjacent hydroxyl groups) under acidic conditions. The mechanism typically involves protonation of one alcohol, which makes it a better leaving group, followed by a hydride or alkyl shift. This leads to the formation of a ketone.

So, for the first reaction, the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me try to draw its structure mentally. It's a cyclohexanone ring with two p-tolyl groups attached to the second carbon. So, the ketone is at position 1, and the two substituents are at position 2.

The starting material A must be a diol that upon rearrangement gives this product. In the Pinacol rearrangement, the diol would have two adjacent hydroxyl groups. When the rearrangement occurs, the two adjacent carbons become a carbonyl group. So, I think the diol should have two OH groups on adjacent carbons, each connected to a p-tolyl group.

Wait, but the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexanone. So, the diol must have been a cyclohexanol derivative with two adjacent diols, right? Let's think: The diol would have two OH groups on adjacent carbons of a cyclohexane ring, each attached to a p-tolyl group.

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the diol is a secondary alcohol with two adjacent hydroxyls. Oh wait, no, diols have two OH groups. So, for the product to have two p-tolyl groups on C2, the starting diol must have each OH attached to a carbon that will end up as adjacent carbons in the product. Hmm.

Wait, the Pinacol rearrangement transforms a 1,2-diol into a ketone. The general structure is that the diol is RCH(OH)CH(OH)R', and upon rearrangement, it becomes R'C(O)R, with a shift of a group.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The typical Pinacol structure is a vicinal diol, like HO-R1-R2-OH, where R1 and R2 are adjacent. Under acid, one OH gets protonated, becomes a good leaving group. Then a hydride or alkyl shift occurs, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

So, the product would have a carbonyl group where one of the R groups has moved.

In the first reaction, the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the cyclohexanone has two p-tolyl groups on C2. So, the starting diol must have had two OH groups on adjacent carbons, each attached to a p-tolyl group. Wait, but in the rearrangement, the OH groups are on adjacent carbons, so if we have two p-tolyl groups on adjacent carbons, but in the product, they end up on the same carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the starting diol is a cyclohexane with two adjacent OH groups, each attached to a p-tolyl group on adjacent carbons. When the rearrangement happens, the two OHs are on adjacent carbons, but when the shift happens, one of the groups moves to form a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diol where the two OH groups are on the same carbon. Wait, no, that's not possible because vicinal diols have adjacent OHs.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclohexanol with two adjacent p-tolyl groups and two OHs on those adjacent carbons. So, like, the structure would be cyclohexane with two adjacent CH(OH) groups, each attached to a p-tolyl. When the acid is added, one OH is protonated, then a hydride shift occurs, leading the formation of a carbonyl group on one of the adjacent carbons, with the other becoming a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the diol is a bicyclic structure or something else. Alternatively, maybe the diol is on a six-membered ring, like cyclohexane. For example, the diol could be 1,2-cyclohexanediol with each OH attached to a p-tolyl group on adjacent carbons.

Wait, no, that's not possible because each carbon can only have so many substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the diol is a cyclohexane ring where two adjacent carbons each have an OH and a p-tolyl group.

Wait, but that would make it di-p-tolylcyclohexanediol-1,2. Then, upon rearrangement, the two adjacent OH's would lose a water molecule, and the group would shift to form a ketone.

Wait, let's think about how the product is 2,2-di-p-tolyl. So, the product has two p-tolyl groups on the same carbon (C2), and the ketone is at C1.

So, the starting diol must have the two p-tolyl groups on adjacent carbons, with each attached to an OH. When one OH is protonated, a hydride shift occurs from the adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. So, the diol would have a structure like (p-tolyl)CH(OH)CH(OH)(p-tolyl), but that would be a four-carbon chain, not a ring. But wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring where two adjacent carbons have OH and p-tolyl groups each.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a diol where each of the two adjacent OHs is attached to a p-tolyl group. So, when the rearrangement happens, one of the p-tolyl groups moves, but that doesn't make sense because the product has two p-tolyl groups on the same carbon.

Alternatively, the starting diol has each of two adjacent carbons bearing an OH and a p-tolyl group. So, when the rearrangement occurs, the OHs are on adjacent carbons, and after a hydride shift, the p-tolyl groups end up on the same carbon as the ketone.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of the mechanism. In the Pinacol rearrangement, the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons. Under acid, one OH is protonated, making it a better leaving group. The adjacent OH donates a hydride, leading to the formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the diol is something like (R)CH(OH)CH(OH)(R'), and upon rearrangement, it becomes R'C(O)R with the loss of a water molecule. So, in our case, R and R' would be p-tolyl groups.

Wait, but in the product, both p-tolyl groups are on the same carbon. So, R and R' must have been on the same carbon in the starting material. Or perhaps the starting material is a 1,2-diol where each OH is attached to a carbon that's connected to a p-tolyl group. So, when the rearrangement occurs, one p-tolyl stays, and the other moves.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclohexanol where on two adjacent carbons, each has an OH and a p-tolyl group. So, the structure would be something like cyclohexane with two adjacent CH(OH)(p-tolyl) groups. Then, when the acid is added, the protonation and rearrangement would cause the formation of a ketone, with both p-tolyl groups on the same carbon.

So, the starting material A is a cyclohexane ring with two adjacent diols, each attached to a p-tolyl group. So, the structure would be 1,2-bis(p-tolylcyclohexanediol), right? But looking at the options, option A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol.

Wait, wait, what's that structure? 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So, the cyclohexanol has a substituent at position 1 which is a hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl group. Wait, that would be a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane at position 1, and that methyl has two hydroxyl groups, each attached to a p-tolyl group. Hmm, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexanol where the adjacent carbon (position 2) has a hydroxyl and a p-tolyl group. Wait, but the name is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diol where each of two adjacent carbons has an OH group and a p-tolyl group. So, the structure would be something like:

p-tolyl-O-C-OH-C-p-tolyl, but thatâ€™s not a ring.

Wait, maybe the diol is a bicyclic compound, but that might complicate things.

Looking at the options, option A says A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So, the cyclohexanol has a substituent at position 1, which is a hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl group. So, that substituent is a methyl group attached to two hydroxy groups, each attached to a p-tolyl.

Wait, that would imply that the substituent is like (HO-p-tolyl)2CH-. So, the group is a methyl with two hydroxyls, each attached to a p-tolyl. But wait, that would make a vicinal diol on a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but then when the acid is added, the diol would rearrange. So, each hydroxyl is on a different carbon of the methyl group. The protonation occurs on one OH, then a hydride shift from the adjacent carbon, leading to a ketone.

Wait, but the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the ketone is on C1, and C2 has two p-tolyl groups.

Hmm, maybe that's correct. So, the starting material A is a cyclohexanol (position 1) with a substituent at position 1, which is a methyl group with two adjacent hydroxyls, each attached to a p-tolyl group.

When the rearrangement occurs, the diol part (the methyl group) undergoes the Pinacol rearrangement. So, the diol (vicinal) would rearrange into a ketone. So, the methyl group would become a ketone with the p-tolyl groups attached.

Wait, but the product is a cyclohexanone with two p-tolyl groups on C2. So, perhaps the substituent on the cyclohexane, after rearrangement, brings the p-tolyl groups to C2.

Wait, maybe the rearrangement leads to the loss of the methyl group, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the group shifts.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look at the second part of the question to get some clues.

The second reaction is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate with H2SO4 giving product B. So, the starting material is a methyl ester of a dihydroxybutanoate with a p-tolyl group on C2.

The structure is CH2(COOCH3)(OH)CH2(OH)CH2-p-tolyl? Wait, no. Let me think. The starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. So, butanoate is four carbons. The 2-position has both a hydroxyl and a p-tolyl group. The 3-position has a hydroxyl.

So, the structure is:

p-tolyl-C(OH)(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, butanoate is CH2CH2CH2COOCH3, but with substituents. The 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate would have the structure:

CH2(COOCH3)-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-OH-CH2?

Wait, no, butanoate is CH3CH2CH2COO-, but the substituents are at 2 and 3. So, the structure is:

p-tolyl is on C2, hydroxyl on C2 and C3. So, it's:

CH2(COOCH3) is at C4, then C3 is CH(OH), C2 is CH(OH)(p-tolyl), and C1 is CH2?

Wait, I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me draw it:

Butanoate is four carbons. So, positions are 1,2,3,4 from the COOCH3.

So, position 1: CH2-

position 2: C(OH)(p-tolyl)

position 3: CH(OH)

position 4: COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, butanoate is CH2CH2CH2COOCH3, so the four carbons are:

1 (COOCH3), 2, 3, 4 (the methyl end). Hmm, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, no. The correct structure for 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate methyl ester would be:

The butanoate is CH2CH2CH2COOCH3, with the p-tolyl and two OHs on the second carbon. So, the ester is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-CH2

Wait, no. Because butanoate is four carbons in a row. The substituents are on the second carbon. So, the structure is:

COOCH3 is at C1, then C2 is CH(OH)(p-tolyl), C3 is CH(OH), and C4 is CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, butanoate has four carbons:

Positions 1 (COOCH3), 2, 3, 4 (CH3).

So, the starting ester is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-CH3

So, the ester is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

When this undergoes Pinacol rearrangement, what happens? The vicinal diols (on C2 and C3) would undergo rearrangement. So, the two OHs are on adjacent carbons (C2 and C3), each attached to a group.

Protonation occurs on one OH, let's say on C2. Then, a hydride shift occurs from C3 to C2, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group on C2.

Wait, but wait, when a rearrangement occurs, the adjacent diol becomes a ketone. Let me think about the mechanism. The diol is RCH(OH)CH(OH)R'. Upon acid, the first OH is protonated. The adjacent OH donates a hydride, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. The leaving group (water) departs, and the structure rearranges.

So, in this case, the diol is on C2 and C3. Let's say the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, no, the structure is:

COOCH3 is attached to the first carbon, then the second carbon is CH(OH)(p-tolyl), third is CH(OH), and fourth is CH3.

Wait, no, the butanoate is CH2CH(OH)(p-tolyl)CH(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, but butanoate only has four carbons. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-CH2-

Wait, but that would make it a five-carbon chain, which isn't correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3 is at the end. So, the four carbons are:

COOCH3 - CH2 - C(OH)(p-tolyl) - CH(OH) - CH3.

Wait, that's five carbons; perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Butanoate has four carbons in total. So, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3) - CH(OH)(p-tolyl) - CH(OH) - CH3.

Wait, that can't be right because that would be four carbons in a row after the ester group.

Wait, perhaps it's:

The ester is O-CO-OCH3 attached to a butanoate chain. The butanoate is CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, the starting molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, when this undergoes acid catalyzed rearrangement, the diol (on C2 and C3) will rearrange.

The mechanism: protonation of one OH (say, on C2), which makes it a better leaving group. Then, a hydride shift occurs from C3 to C2, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group on C2. The leaving group is water, which is lost.

So, after rearrangement, the C3 would have a hydrogen, and the C2 would have a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the substituents on C2 and C3 would determine where the groups go. So, the p-tolyl is on C2, and the other substituents are hydrogens.

So, the product would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C(O)-p-tolyl - CH2 - CH3.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the product would be a ketone on C2, with the p-tolyl attached. So, the structure would be:

COOCH3-CH2-C(O)(p-tolyl)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that would make it a pentanoate, not butanoate. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, the product would be a methyl ester of 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoic acid. So, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C(O)(p-tolyl)-CH2.

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain with a ketone on C3.

Wait, but the starting material was a butanoate, so the product would be a shorter chain? Or maybe the same chain but with a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. Which would make sense because the ketone is at position 3, and the p-tolyl is at position 2.

Looking at the options, option A says B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. Option B also has B as that. Option C and D have different structures for B.

So, the product B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So, looking at the starting materials for the first reaction, which must produce 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one.

The starting material A must be a vicinal diol. Looking at the options, option A says A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol.

So, the structure would be a cyclohexanol (position 1) with a substituent at position 1, which is a methyl group attached to two hydroxyl groups, each connected to a p-tolyl group.

So, structure is:

Cyclohexanol (OH at position 1) and a substituent at position 1 which is a methyl group with two hydroxyls, each linked to a p-tolyl.

Wait, but in reality, the substituent on the cyclohexane would have two OH groups adjacent. When the rearrangement happens, the diol would form a ketone.

But the product is a cyclohexanone with two p-tolyl groups on C2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent on the cyclohexane is a diol which, upon rearrangement, brings the p-tolyl groups to C2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)(p-tolyl) group. No, that would not make sense.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a diol on the same carbon. Oh wait, the substituent is a methyl group with two hydroxyls attached to p-tolyl groups. So, the substituent is (HO-p-tolyl)2CH- attached to the cyclohexane.

So, when the acid is added, the diol on the substituent undergoes rearrangement, leading to a ketone. The substituent would become a keto group, and the p-tolyl groups would be on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent would be a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane's position 1, and the diol is on the methyl group.

Upon rearrangement, the diol (on the methyl group) would form a ketone, so the substituent becomes a ketone group. So, the cyclohexane's position 1 would have a carbonyl group, and the p-tolyl groups would be on the adjacent carbon (position 2).

Wait, that would make the product 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, which matches the first reaction's product.

So, the starting material A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, which is option A or D.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Option D) A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B is methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate.

Wait, but the second reaction's product is B as the Pinacol rearrangement of the given dihydroxybutanoate, which we determined is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. So, B should be that, which is option A or B.

Looking at the options, option A and B have B as methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So, option A says A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol and B as methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Option D has a different B. So, for the first reaction, if the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, the starting material A would have to be a diol attached to the cyclohexane in a way that when it rearranges, the two p-tolyl groups end up on C2, and the ketone on C1.

So, the substituent on the cyclohexane (position 1) is a diol on a methyl group. Upon rearrangement, the methyl diol becomes a ketone, and the two p-tolyl groups move to C2.

So, the starting material is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, which is option A or D.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Option D: B is another structure.

Since the second reaction's product B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate, the correct options must have B as that. So, options A and B are possibilities.

Now, looking at the first reaction's product, 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, the starting material is a diol on a cyclohexane ring. So, the substituent on position 1 is a diol, leading to the product structure.

So, the starting material A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. Which is option A or D.

Wait, the options for A are:

Option A: A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol.

Option D: A is the same but with cyclopentan-1-ol.

So, if the product is a cyclohexanone, the starting material must be a cyclohexanol derivative.

So, option A is cyclohexan-1-ol, which would give the correct product.

So, putting it all together, option A has the correct A and B.

But wait, let's double-check.

Option A says:

A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol,

B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So, both reactions are correct.

So, the correct answer would be option A.


The Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement involves a vicinal diol undergoing acid-catalyzed rearrangement to form a ketone. In the first reaction, the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, a cyclohexanone with two p-tolyl groups on the second carbon and a ketone at the first carbon. The starting material must be a vicinal diol where the two hydroxyl groups are adjacent, each attached to a p-tolyl group. Upon rearrangement, the diol forms a ketone, and the two p-tolyl groups end up on the same carbon. The correct starting material for this reaction is **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol**, as it has the required diol structure on a cyclohexane ring.

In the second reaction, the starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate, a methyl ester with a vicinal diol on the second and third carbons, where the second carbon also has a p-tolyl group. Under acidic conditions, the diol undergoes rearrangement to form a ketone. The product of this reaction is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**, where the ketone is at the third carbon, and the p-tolyl group remains at the second carbon.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. This matches both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. The starting material A is incorrect because it involves a cyclopentane ring, which would not produce the cyclohexanone product.
- **Option C**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol, B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate. Both A and B are incorrect.
- **Option D**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate. While A is correct, B is incorrect because the product structure does not match the expected rearrangement.

The correct answer is **Option A**, as it provides the correct starting materials and products for both reactions.

Answer: A
