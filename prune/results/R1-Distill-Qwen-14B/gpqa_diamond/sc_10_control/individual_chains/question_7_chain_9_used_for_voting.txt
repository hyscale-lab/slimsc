Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about high-energy gamma-rays interacting with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The question is about finding the energy at which the lifetime of these gamma-rays is limited by the process of annihilation into electron-positron pairs. Hmm, I remember that when gamma-rays collide with CMB photons, they can produce electrons and positrons. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think it through.

The problem states that the average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV. Wait, that's a really low energy, which makes sense because CMB photons are very low energy. So the gamma-rays are high energy, and the CMB photons are like the background radiation.

I think the process here is called photon-photon annihilation. The gamma-ray (let's call its energy E_gamma) interacts with a CMB photon (E_photon ~ 1e-3 eV) to produce an electron-positron pair. The reaction is gamma + photon → e+ + e-.

Now, why does this limit the lifetime of the gamma-ray? Oh right, because if the gamma-ray is moving through the universe and interacts with enough CMB photons, it can annihilate, thereby limiting how long it can exist. So the lifetime is determined by the probability of this interaction happening. If the interaction probability is high, the gamma-ray won't travel far before annihilating, hence a shorter lifetime.

This must be related to the concept of pair production or photon-photon interactions. I remember something about the cross-section increasing with the energy of the photons involved. Wait, the cross-section for this process probably depends on the energies of both photons. Since one photon is from the CMB and is fixed at 1e-3 eV, and the other is the gamma-ray which is high energy, the cross-section will depend on E_gamma.

The cross-section for two photons to annihilate into electron-positron pairs is given by sigma ≈ (8π/3) * (α²/(s²)) * (m_e^2), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy, and α is the fine-structure constant. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that the cross-section for photon-photon to e+e- is proportional to 1/s^2, where s is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame. Hmm.

Wait, the center-of-mass energy squared s is (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (p_gamma c + p_photon c)^2. Since E_photon is much smaller than E_gamma (because the gamma-ray is high energy), we can approximate E_photon ≈ p_photon c (since for low energy photons, E≈pc). So s ≈ (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (E_gamma/c^2 c)²? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of energy and momentum.

Alternatively, in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is the sum of the two photon energies, and the total momentum is the sum of their momenta. But since photons are massless, their energy is equal to their momentum times c. So for the gamma-ray, E_gamma = p_gamma c, and for the CMB photon, E_photon = p_photon c. But since E_gamma is much larger than E_photon, p_gamma is much larger than p_photon.

Wait, so in the center-of-mass frame, the energy is sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ). Let me think: E1 = E_gamma, p1 = E_gamma/(c), E2 = E_photon, p2 = E_photon/(c). So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1/(c^2)) c + (E2/(c^2)) c )^2 = (E1+E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 = 0? Wait, that can't be right. No, wait, because photons are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta would add, but wait, no, actually, the direction matters. If they're moving head-on, the momenta would be in opposite directions, so the spatial part in the invariant s would subtract.

Wait, right. The invariant s is given by s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2, assuming they are moving towards each other (so their momenta are opposite in direction). Because the energy is a scalar, and the momentum vectors are opposite, so the invariant s becomes:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2.

But since E1 = p1 c and E2 = p2 c (for photons), s becomes:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 = 0? That can't be, because then s would be zero, which would imply that the cross-section is... wait, but that would imply that the process doesn't happen. But it does happen because e+e- are produced. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the threshold condition for pair production. The minimum energy required for the photon-photon collision to produce an electron-positron pair is when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is at least twice the electron mass. So s_min = (2 m_e c^2)^2.

So, the condition for the reaction to occur is that the center-of-mass energy is above this threshold. So, s must be greater than or equal to (2 m_e c^2)^2.

But wait, in the reaction, the CMB photon and the gamma-ray are colliding. So, in the center-of-mass frame, their energies add, but for the minimum energy, perhaps the photon is moving in the opposite direction.

Wait, perhaps I should write s as:

s = (E_gamma + E_CMB)^2 - (|p_gamma| c - |p_CMB| c)^2.

Since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta subtract. So, s = (E_gamma + E_CMB)^2 - ( (E_gamma/(c^2)) c - (E_CMB/(c^2)) c )^2.

Wait, E_gamma = p_gamma c, because it's a photon. Same for E_CMB. So, s = (E_gamma + E_CMB)^2 - ( (E_gamma/c) - (E_CMB/c) )^2 c^2.

Simplify that:

s = (E_gamma + E_CMB)^2 - (E_gamma - E_CMB)^2.

Expanding both terms:

= [E_gamma^2 + 2 E_gamma E_CMB + E_CMB^2] - [E_gamma^2 - 2 E_gamma E_CMB + E_CMB^2]

= E_gamma^2 + 2 E_gamma E_CMB + E_CMB^2 - E_gamma^2 + 2 E_gamma E_CMB - E_CMB^2

= 4 E_gamma E_CMB.

So, s = 4 E_gamma E_CMB.

Since E_CMB is given as 1e-3 eV, the center-of-mass energy squared s must be at least (2 m_e c^2)^2 for the pair production to occur.

So, set s >= (2 m_e c^2)^2.

Thus,

4 E_gamma E_CMB >= (2 m_e c^2)^2.

We can solve for E_gamma:

E_gamma >= ( (2 m_e c^2)^2 ) / (4 E_CMB )

Simplify:

E_gamma >= (4 m_e^2 c^4) / (4 E_CMB )

So, E_gamma >= (m_e^2 c^4) / E_CMB.

Wait, wait, let's compute this.

First, m_e c^2 is the rest energy of the electron, which is about 0.511 MeV, or 0.511e6 eV.

So m_e c^2 = 0.511e6 eV.

E_CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

So,

E_gamma >= ( (0.511e6 eV) )^2 / (1e-3 eV)

Calculate the numerator: (0.511e6)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 = 0.261 * 1e12 eV^2.

Divide by 1e-3 eV: 0.261e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261e15 eV.

Which is 2.61e14 eV.

Wait, but that's 2.61e14 eV, which is 2.61e8 GeV. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV.

Wait, no, 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So 1e14 eV is 1e5 GeV. Because 1e14 = 1e5 * 1e9 = 1e5 GeV.

So 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 0.511e6 eV is 5.11e5 eV, which is 511 keV.

So (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 eV^2 = 26.1121e10 eV^2.

Then, 26.1121e10 eV^2 / 1e-3 eV = 26.1121e13 eV.

Wait, 26e13 eV is 2.6e14 eV.

Which is 2.6e14 eV = 2.6e5 GeV, because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV.

So E_gamma >= approximately 2.6e5 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So that's the answer.

But wait, I thought the threshold condition is when s equals (2 m_e c^2)^2. So this is the minimum energy needed for the reaction to occur. If the gamma-ray has energy above this threshold, the process is possible. So the gamma-rays with energy above this will interact with CMB photons and thus have their lifetimes limited because they can annihilate.

So the question is asking from what energy gamma-rays have their lifetimes limited. That is, when their energy is above this threshold, the process becomes significant, limiting their lifetime.

So the answer should be around 2.6e5 GeV. Option C.

To determine the energy at which the lifetimes of high-energy gamma-rays are limited by their annihilation with CMB photons into electron-positron pairs, we analyze the process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$. The key is to find the threshold energy $E_\gamma$ where the center-of-mass energy squared $s$ equals the minimum energy required for pair production, which is $(2m_e c^2)^2$.

The invariant $s$ for the photon-photon system is given by:

\[
s = (E_\gamma + E_{\text{CMB}})^2 - (p_\gamma c - p_{\text{CMB}} c)^2,
\]

where $E_\gamma$ and $E_{\text{CMB}}$ are the energies of the gamma-ray and CMB photon, respectively, and $p_\gamma = E_\gamma / c$, $p_{\text{CMB}} = E_{\text{CMB}} / c$ are their momenta. Simplifying, we find:

\[
s = 4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}.
\]

For pair production to occur, $s$ must satisfy:

\[
s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Substituting $s = 4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}$ and solving for $E_\gamma$, we get:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(2m_e c^2)^2}{4 E_{\text{CMB}}}.
\]

The electron rest energy is $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$, and the average CMB photon energy is $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Substituting these values:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(2 \times 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV})^2}{4 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(2 \times 0.511 \times 10^6)^2 = (1.022 \times 10^6)^2 = 1.044 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2.
\]

Now divide by $4 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{1.044 \times 10^{12}}{4 \times 10^{-3}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Convert to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_\gamma \geq 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus, gamma-rays with energy above $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ will have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about high-energy gamma-rays interacting with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The question is about finding the energy at which the lifetime of these gamma-rays is limited by the process of annihilation into electron-positron pairs. Hmm, I remember that when gamma-rays collide with CMB photons, they can produce electrons and positrons. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think it through.

The problem states that the average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV. Wait, that's a really low energy, which makes sense because CMB photons are very low energy. So the gamma-rays are high energy, and the CMB photons are like the background radiation.

I think the process here is called photon-photon annihilation. The gamma-ray (let's call its energy E_gamma) interacts with a CMB photon (E_photon ~ 1e-3 eV) to produce an electron-positron pair. The reaction is gamma + photon → e+ + e-.

Now, why does this limit the lifetime of the gamma-ray? Oh right, because if the gamma-ray is moving through the universe and interacts with enough CMB photons, it can annihilate, thereby limiting how long it can exist. So the lifetime is determined by the probability of this interaction happening. If the interaction probability is high, the gamma-ray won't travel far before annihilating, hence a shorter lifetime.

This must be related to the concept of pair production or photon-photon interactions. I remember something about the cross-section increasing with the energy of the photons involved. Wait, the cross-section for this process probably depends on the energies of both photons. Since one photon is from the CMB and is fixed at 1e-3 eV, and the other is the gamma-ray which is high energy, the cross-section will depend on E_gamma.

The cross-section for two photons to annihilate into electron-positron pairs is given by sigma ≈ (8π/3) * (α²/(s²)) * (m_e^2), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy, and α is the fine-structure constant. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that the cross-section for photon-photon to e+e- is proportional to 1/s^2, where s is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame. Hmm.

Wait, the center-of-mass energy squared s is (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (p_gamma c + p_photon c)^2. Since E_photon is much smaller than E_gamma (because the gamma-ray is high energy), we can approximate E_photon ≈ p_photon c (since for low energy photons, E≈pc). So s ≈ (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (E_gamma/c^2 c)²? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of energy and momentum.

Alternatively, in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is the sum of the two photon energies, and the total momentum is the sum of their momenta. But since photons are massless, their energy is equal to their momentum times c. So for the gamma-ray, E_gamma = p_gamma c, and for the CMB photon, E_photon = p_photon c. But since E_gamma is much larger than E_photon, p_gamma is much larger than p_photon.

Wait, so in the center-of-mass frame, the energy is sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ). Let me think: E1 = E_gamma, p1 = E_gamma/(c), E2 = E_photon, p2 = E_photon/(c). So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1/(c^2)) c + (E2/(c^2)) c )^2 = (E1+E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 = 0? Wait, that can't be right. No, wait, because photons are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta would add, but wait, no, actually, the direction matters. If they're moving head-on, the momenta would be in opposite directions, so the spatial part in the invariant s would subtract.

Wait, right. The invariant s is given by s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2, assuming they are moving towards each other (so their momenta are opposite in direction). Because the energy is a scalar, and the momentum vectors are opposite, so the invariant s becomes:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2.

But since E1 = p1 c and E2 = p2 c (for photons), s becomes:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 = 0? That can't be, because then s would be zero, which would imply that the cross-section is... wait, but that would imply that the process doesn't happen. But it does happen because e+e- are produced. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the threshold condition for pair production. The minimum energy required for the photon-photon collision to produce an electron-positron pair is when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is at least twice the electron mass. So s_min = (2 m_e c^2)^2.

So, the condition for the reaction to occur is that the center-of-mass energy is above this threshold. So, s must be greater than or equal to (2 m_e c^2)^2.

But wait, in the reaction, the CMB photon and the gamma-ray are colliding. So, in the center-of-mass frame, their energies add, but for the minimum energy, perhaps the photon is moving in the opposite direction.

Wait, perhaps I should write s as:

s = (E_gamma + E_CMB)^2 - (|p_gamma| c - |p_CMB| c)^2.

Since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta subtract. So, s = (E_gamma + E_CMB)^2 - ( (E_gamma/(c^2)) c - (E_CMB/(c^2)) c )^2.

Wait, E_gamma = p_gamma c, because it's a photon. Same for E_CMB. So, s = (E_gamma + E_CMB)^2 - ( (E_gamma/c) - (E_CMB/c) )^2 c^2.

Simplify that:

s = (E_gamma + E_CMB)^2 - (E_gamma - E_CMB)^2.

Expanding both terms:

= [E_gamma^2 + 2 E_gamma E_CMB + E_CMB^2] - [E_gamma^2 - 2 E_gamma E_CMB + E_CMB^2]

= E_gamma^2 + 2 E_gamma E_CMB + E_CMB^2 - E_gamma^2 + 2 E_gamma E_CMB - E_CMB^2

= 4 E_gamma E_CMB.

So, s = 4 E_gamma E_CMB.

Since E_CMB is given as 1e-3 eV, the center-of-mass energy squared s must be at least (2 m_e c^2)^2 for the pair production to occur.

So, set s >= (2 m_e c^2)^2.

Thus,

4 E_gamma E_CMB >= (2 m_e c^2)^2.

We can solve for E_gamma:

E_gamma >= ( (2 m_e c^2)^2 ) / (4 E_CMB )

Simplify:

E_gamma >= (4 m_e^2 c^4) / (4 E_CMB )

So, E_gamma >= (m_e^2 c^4) / E_CMB.

Wait, wait, let's compute this.

First, m_e c^2 is the rest energy of the electron, which is about 0.511 MeV, or 0.511e6 eV.

So m_e c^2 = 0.511e6 eV.

E_CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

So,

E_gamma >= ( (0.511e6 eV) )^2 / (1e-3 eV)

Calculate the numerator: (0.511e6)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 = 0.261 * 1e12 eV^2.

Divide by 1e-3 eV: 0.261e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261e15 eV.

Which is 2.61e14 eV.

Wait, but that's 2.61e14 eV, which is 2.61e8 GeV. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV.

Wait, no, 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So 1e14 eV is 1e5 GeV. Because 1e14 = 1e5 * 1e9 = 1e5 GeV.

So 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 0.511e6 eV is 5.11e5 eV, which is 511 keV.

So (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 eV^2 = 26.1121e10 eV^2.

Then, 26.1121e10 eV^2 / 1e-3 eV = 26.1121e13 eV.

Wait, 26e13 eV is 2.6e14 eV.

Which is 2.6e14 eV = 2.6e5 GeV, because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV.

So E_gamma >= approximately 2.6e5 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So that's the answer.

But wait, I thought the threshold condition is when s equals (2 m_e c^2)^2. So this is the minimum energy needed for the reaction to occur. If the gamma-ray has energy above this threshold, the process is possible. So the gamma-rays with energy above this will interact with CMB photons and thus have their lifetimes limited because they can annihilate.

So the question is asking from what energy gamma-rays have their lifetimes limited. That is, when their energy is above this threshold, the process becomes significant, limiting their lifetime.

So the answer should be around 2.6e5 GeV. Option C.


To determine the energy at which the lifetimes of high-energy gamma-rays are limited by their annihilation with CMB photons into electron-positron pairs, we analyze the process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$. The key is to find the threshold energy $E_\gamma$ where the center-of-mass energy squared $s$ equals the minimum energy required for pair production, which is $(2m_e c^2)^2$.

The invariant $s$ for the photon-photon system is given by:

\[
s = (E_\gamma + E_{\text{CMB}})^2 - (p_\gamma c - p_{\text{CMB}} c)^2,
\]

where $E_\gamma$ and $E_{\text{CMB}}$ are the energies of the gamma-ray and CMB photon, respectively, and $p_\gamma = E_\gamma / c$, $p_{\text{CMB}} = E_{\text{CMB}} / c$ are their momenta. Simplifying, we find:

\[
s = 4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}.
\]

For pair production to occur, $s$ must satisfy:

\[
s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Substituting $s = 4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}$ and solving for $E_\gamma$, we get:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(2m_e c^2)^2}{4 E_{\text{CMB}}}.
\]

The electron rest energy is $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$, and the average CMB photon energy is $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Substituting these values:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(2 \times 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV})^2}{4 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(2 \times 0.511 \times 10^6)^2 = (1.022 \times 10^6)^2 = 1.044 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2.
\]

Now divide by $4 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{1.044 \times 10^{12}}{4 \times 10^{-3}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Convert to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_\gamma \geq 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus, gamma-rays with energy above $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ will have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**.

Answer: C
