Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about electrophilic substitution reactions of benzene derivatives with bromine. I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions—either ortho, meta, or para relative to themselves.

The problem gives six compounds, numbered 1 to 6. Each has a benzene ring with a different substituent. They all undergo an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the one with the smallest para fraction comes first, and the largest comes last.

Let me list out the substituents again:

1) С6H5-CH3 (toluene, methyl group)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (benzoyloxy ethyl, I think that's ethyl ester of benzoic acid)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, for each substitution, I need to think about where the bromine will add. The substituents will direct the bromine to specific positions. But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the para product's yield depends on the directing effect of the substituent.

I think activating groups are ortho/para directors, and deactivating groups are meta directors. But wait, it's the activating or deactivating that matters. Also, some groups are strong activating, others are deactivating.

Let me think about each substituent:

1. CH3 (toluene): This is an activating group. Methyl is an electron-donating group (since it's an alkyl group), so it's an ortho/para director. So substitution occurs mainly at ortho and para positions.

2. COOEt (ester group, like benzoyloxy ethyl?): The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. So it's a deactivating group. Wait, esters are typically meta directors. Because the carbonyl is an electron-withdrawing group by induction, making the ring less reactive. So for substitution, the ester group directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position.

Wait, no, wait. Ester groups are actually ortho/para directors, or meta? Hmm, I might be getting confused here. Wait, I think that the ester group (like COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group through the carbonyl, which makes the ring less reactive. So it's a deactivating group. But wait, the oxygen in the ester has lone pairs. So it's an electron-donating through resonance? No, wait, no. No, wait. The carbonyl is adjacent to the oxygen. So the ester group is like a meta director? Or ortho/para?

Wait, I think that the ester group is a meta director because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing, making the ring less reactive, and it's a deactivating group. So, the substituent would direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. So, in substitution reactions, the bromine would add mostly in the meta position relative to the ester group.

3. Cl: Chlorine is a substituent that's a bit tricky. It's more electronegative than carbon, so it's electron-withdrawing by induction. But the chlorine atom also has lone pairs which can donate electrons through resonance. So, the effect is that it's a deactivating (because of induction) but ortho/para-directing (because of resonance). So, in substitution, the Cl directs the incoming electrophile to ortho and para positions.

Wait, but I've heard that sometimes when the substituent is more electronegative, like Cl, the inductive effect dominates. So, Cl is a deactivating group and an ortho/para director. So substitution occurs at ortho and para.

4. NO2: Nitro group is a strong deactivating meta-director. Because it's highly electron-withdrawing through both induction and resonance. So, the nitro group directs substitution to the meta position.

5. C2H5: Ethyl group, similar to methyl. It's an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So substitution occurs at ortho and para.

6. COOH: Carboxylic acid group. The COOH is a strong deactivating group because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Also, the hydroxyl group is electron-donating, but I think the overall effect is deactivating. Wait, no. Wait, in the carboxylic acid group, the -COOH is attached to the ring. The carbonyl is electron-withdrawing, making the ring less reactive. So, the substituent is a meta director. Wait, I think that the -COOH group is deactivating and meta directing.

Wait, but wait: the -COOH group is strongly deactivating because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl and the carboxyl group. So, the substituent will direct substitution to the meta position.

Wait, but sometimes I've heard that substituents like -COOH are meta directors. So substituents like nitro, esters, and carboxylic acids are meta directors.

So, for each substituent:

1. CH3: activating, ortho/para → so substitution at ortho and para. So, the product would have more ortho and para isomers, but since the question is about the para-isomer's weight fraction, we need to think about how much of the product is para.

But wait, in some cases, the substituents have different abilities to direct. Also, steric factors might play a role, but I think the directing effects are more significant here.

Wait, for each substituent, when bromine is added, which position (ortho, meta, para) is favored?

Let me reiterate:

1. CH3 (activating, ortho/para): So substitution can occur at ortho and para positions. The ratio between ortho and para depends on the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state. For methyl, the para isomer is more favored than ortho because the steric hindrance is less than in the ortho position, especially when the substituent is in the para position relative to the incoming group.

Wait, no. For toluene (methylbenzene), the para isomer is the major product, but some ortho is also formed. So, the major product is para, but ortho is about 30% or so.

Wait, but in reality, for toluene, the para isomer is about 60%, ortho about 35%, and meta is negligible. So, the para fraction is significant.

2. COOEt (ester group, deactivating, meta director): So substitution occurs mainly at the meta position. So the para isomer would be minor. I think in this case, the para isomer is not the major product, but perhaps a small fraction.

Wait, wait, no. If the substituent is a meta director, then the substitution occurs at the meta position. So, the major product is meta. So, the para isomer would be a minor product.

Wait, but in some cases, if substitution occurs at meta, but there are two possible meta positions, which are equivalent in some cases. So, perhaps the meta product is about 50%, and the ortho and para are negligible? Wait, no. I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

Wait, let's think again. For each substituent, how does the substitution occur?

The substituent directs the incoming electrophile to specific positions. For example, a meta director means the substitution occurs at the meta position relative to the substituent.

But wait, substitution can't occur at all positions because the ring is symmetric. For instance, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the substituents would have specific positions.

Wait, but in all these cases, each substituent is at a single position on the benzene ring, so the question is about the major product when electrophilic substitution occurs once.

Wait, but the question says that for each compound, only one monobromo derivative is formed. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because in reality, substitution can occur in multiple positions, leading to different isomers. But the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, perhaps the substituent is such that it only allows substitution at one position? Or perhaps the substituent is so strong that it's the only possible position.

Wait, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the bromine is in excess, leading to the most favored product. But the question says each reaction forms one monobromo product, implying that perhaps each substituent directs exclusively to one position, or that the major product is the only one considered.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. For each substituent, when bromine adds, where does it go, and what is the ratio of para isomer?

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each compound, what's the fraction of para product relative to all possible products.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are such that only para is possible, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituent directing to certain positions. Let me think about each substituent:

1. CH3 (methyl): ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, the major products are ortho and para. So, the para isomer is a major fraction.

2. COOEt (ester): meta director. So, bromine adds mostly in the meta position. So, the para isomer is not the major product but would be a minor fraction.

3. Cl: ortho/para director. So, substitution occurs at ortho and para. So, the para isomer is a major fraction.

4. NO2: meta director. So, substitution occurs at meta. So, the para isomer is a minor fraction.

5. C2H5 (ethyl): similar to methyl, ortho/para director. So, substitution occurs at ortho and para, with para as the major.

6. COOH (carboxylic acid): meta director. So, substitution occurs at meta, so para is a minor fraction.

Wait, but for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para isomer is more favored because of less steric hindrance compared to the ortho position.

Wait, for toluene (methyl), the para isomer is about 60% and ortho about 35% (I think). So, the para fraction is higher than the ortho.

Similarly, for ethylbenzene (C2H5), when bromine adds, the para isomer is the major product.

Now, the nitro group (4), being a strong meta director, so substitution occurs at meta. So, the para isomer would be a minor fraction. Similarly, the ester (2) and COOH (6) are meta directors, so substitution occurs at meta, so para is a minor isomer.

Wait, but what about the Cl substituent (3)? It's an ortho/para director. So bromine can add at ortho and para. So, the para isomer is a major fraction.

So, now, for each substituent, the fraction of para isomer in the product:

1) CH3: high (major)
2) COOEt: low (meta is major)
3) Cl: high (para is major)
4) NO2: low (meta is major)
5) C2H5: high (para is major)
6) COOH: low (meta is major)

Wait, but wait, for substituents like Cl, are the para and ortho products formed in similar amounts, or is para more than ortho?

I think that for Cl, the para product is more than the ortho because of steric factors. Ortho is close, so less favored than para.

So, in the case of Cl, the para isomer is about 50% or higher.

But wait, in reality, chlorobenzene (Cl substituent) when brominated in electrophilic substitution, the major products are para and ortho. The para isomer is more than the ortho, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact percentages.

But for the purpose of this question, I think the key is to sort the substituents based on how much para they produce.

So, substituents that are ortho/para directors (activating) would have higher para fractions. Those that are meta directors (deactivating) would have lower para fractions.

Let me list the substituents and their para yield:

1) CH3 (ortho/para, activating): high para
2) COOEt (meta, deactivating): low para
3) Cl (ortho/para, deactivating but directing): high para
4) NO2 (meta, deactivating): low para
5) C2H5 (ortho/para, activating): high para
6) COOH (meta, deactivating): low para

So, the order of para fraction from lowest to highest would be:

Lowest: 2,4,6 → then 1,3,5.

Wait, but within the meta directors, their para fractions are low, but how do they compare? Are some meta directors more deactivating, leading to less substitution in the para position?

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the para fraction is the amount of para product formed relative to all products.

Wait, but if a substituent is a meta director, the para fraction would be low, but perhaps even lower than some other substituents. Let me think:

Substituents:

4) NO2: strong meta director → para fraction is very low

6) COOH: meta director → para fraction is low, but perhaps higher than NO2?

Similarly, 2) COOEt: meta director → para fraction is low, but higher than NO2?

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think about the actual substitution patterns.

Substituents that are meta directors lead to substitution at meta position. So, in such cases, the para product is a minor fraction. But for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para is a major product.

So, the substituents that are meta directors will have lower para fractions. The substituents that are ortho/para directors will have higher para fractions.

So, within the meta directors:

Which substituent would lead to the least para product? Probably the strongest deactivators, which would make the para product difficult to form.

Wait, but the para product's formation is more about the directing effect than the activation. So, if the substituent is a meta director, the bromine will add at meta, so the para product would be a minor product. But perhaps for some substituents, the para product is possible but in small amounts.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's ability to activate or deactivate affects the overall reactivity, but the question is only about the para fraction, not the overall reactivity.

Wait, the problem says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Hmm. That complicates things because usually, multiple products form, but the question says each reaction forms one product. That can't be possible in reality; perhaps the substituent is such that only one position is possible for substitution.

Wait, perhaps if the substituent is in a position where only one substitution is possible? Like in the case of a substituent that is on a ring such that substitution can only occur at a single position. But that's not the case for any of these substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is so strong that only one position is reactive.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine adds only once, and only the most favored position reacts. So, for each substituent, the major product is the only one considered, and the others are negligible.

In that case, the para fraction for each substituent would be:

If substituent is an ortho/para director, the major product is para. So, the para fraction is high.

If substituent is a meta director, the major product is meta, so para fraction is low.

So, for each compound:

1) CH3: para → high
2) COOEt: meta → low
3) Cl: para → high
4) NO2: meta → low
5) C2H5: para → high
6) COOH: meta → low

So, the para fractions for each are:

1: high
2: low
3: high
4: low
5: high
6: low

Now, among the low para fractions (substituents 2,4,6), how do they compare?

I think the strength of the deactivating effect may influence the para fraction. For example, a stronger deactivator might make the para product less likely, but wait, the directing effect is more about where substitution occurs than the overall reactivity. However, the overall reactivity does affect the rate of substitution. But the question is about the product distribution, not the rate.

Wait, but wait, if a substituent is a strong deactivator, the overall reaction might be slower, but that doesn't affect the product distribution in terms of isomer ratios. So, the para fraction is more about the substituent's directing effect.

So, substituents 2,4,6 are all meta directors. So, their para fractions are low, but perhaps in order of their para fractions from least to greatest.

Wait, but if all are meta directors, then their para fractions would be the same. But that's not the case because the substituents have different directing strengths. Wait, no, because the substituents are all meta directors, so their para fractions are low, but perhaps some have more ortho and para products than others.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the actual product distributions.

For each substituent:

1) Toluene (CH3): The para isomer is the major product, with about 60%, ortho about 30%, and meta negligible.

2) COOEt: The substituent is a meta director, so substitution occurs at meta. So, the major product is meta. So, the para isomer is a minor product, perhaps less than 10%.

3) Cl: substitution occurs at ortho and para, with para being major. So, para fraction is about 60%.

4) NO2: substitution occurs at meta. So, para is minor, perhaps less than 10%.

5) C2H5: like toluene, substitution at para and ortho. Para is major, around 60%.

6) COOH: substitution occurs at meta. So, para is minor, perhaps less than 10%.

So, the para fractions are:

1: ~60%

3: ~60%

5: ~60%

2: ~10%

4: ~10%

6: ~10%

Wait, but wait. For substituent 3 (Cl), is the para fraction higher than substituent 1 (CH3)?

Wait, I think that in chlorobenzene, substitution occurs more in the para position than ortho because of steric hindrance. So, for Cl, the para isomer is about 50-60%, and ortho about 30-40%.

Wait, but in toluene, the para isomer is higher, around 60-70%. So, substituent 1 (CH3) has a higher para fraction than substituent 3 (Cl).

Wait, perhaps the order is:

Highest para fraction:

1 (CH3) >5 (C2H5) >3 (Cl)

Wait, but I think in toluene, the para isomer is higher than for ethylbenzene, or maybe they're similar.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of activating groups. The more activating the substituent, the more the ring is activated, leading to more ortho and para substitution. But the ratio between ortho and para depends on the substituent's size, perhaps.

Wait, methyl is a smaller group than ethyl, so in toluene, the para isomer is more favored than in ethylbenzene because ethyl is bulkier. So, substituent 1 (methyl) would have a higher para fraction than substituent 5 (ethyl).

So, order of para fraction from high to low:

1 >5 >3.

Now, for the meta directors, substituents 2,4,6 have low para fractions. How to arrange them?

What's the order of their para fractions?

We have 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH).

I think that the substituent's deactivating strength affects the amount of para product.

Wait, but for meta directors, the para product is minor, but the actual amount could vary. For substituents that are strongly deactivating, perhaps the para fraction is even lower.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's ability to withdraw electrons affects the overall reactivity but not the product distribution once the substituent's position is fixed.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So, for substituents that are meta directors, their para fractions are low, but how do these compare between substituents?

Let me think about each:

2) COOEt (ester): the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group. So, it's a meta director. The para product would be a minor product.

4) NO2: a strong deactivating, meta director. So, the para product is minor.

6) COOH: a strong deactivating, meta director. So, the para product is minor.

So, para fractions are all low, but which is the lowest?

I think that the substituent's strength as a deactivator doesn't change the position of substitution but affects the rate. So, perhaps the para fractions are about the same for all meta directors.

But that can't be, so perhaps the para fraction is a function of the substituent's directing. For example, some meta directors might allow a small amount of para product, while others do not.

Wait, perhaps nitro groups are strong meta directors, leading to very little para product. Similarly, COOH is a strong deactivator, leading to little para product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent that's most strongly deactivating leads to the least para product. So, in terms of para fraction (from lowest to highest) for meta directors:

4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOEt).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps COOEt is less deactivating than COOH, so COOEt's para fraction is higher than COOH's.

Wait, no, I think that COOH is a stronger deactivator than COOEt.

Wait, the substituent's effect on the ring's electron density affects the reactivity but not the direction. So, perhaps the para fraction is determined only by whether it's a meta or ortho/para director.

But that leads me to believe that all meta directors have the same para fraction, which isn't the case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think of another approach. The question asks for the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, from the lowest to the highest.

So, the substituents that are meta directors have low para fractions, and those that are ortho/para have high para fractions.

So, the order from low to high:

Meta directors (lower para fractions) come first, then ortho/para directors.

Now, within the meta directors, how do their para fractions compare?

Well, perhaps the nitro group is a stronger deactivator than the ester group, which is stronger than the carboxylic acid.

Wait, no, I think that nitro is a stronger deactivator than COOH. Because the nitro group is a stronger EWG than COOH.

Wait, the order of deactivating strength: NO2 > COOH > COOEt.

So, the para fraction for substituents with stronger deactivators would be even lower. So, substituent 4 (NO2) has the lowest para fraction, followed by 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt).

So, the order of para fractions from lowest to highest would be:

4 < 6 < 2 <1 <5 <3.

Wait, that's substituent 4 (NO2) has the lowest para fraction, then 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt), then 1 (CH3), then 5 (C2H5), then 3 (Cl).

So, the order is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Looking at the options, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. So option C is the correct order.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for the given compounds undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents can either be ortho/para directors (activating groups) or meta directors (deactivating groups). The para fraction depends on the substituent's directing effect and its ability to stabilize the transition state.

### Analysis of Each Compound:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**: The methyl group (-CH3) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Substitution occurs predominantly at the ortho and para positions, with the para isomer being the major product.

2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Benzoyloxy Ethyl)**: The ester group (-COOEt) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Substitution occurs predominantly at the meta position, making the para isomer a minor product.

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**: The chlorine atom (-Cl) is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group due to resonance effects. Substitution occurs at both ortho and para positions, with the para isomer being the major product.

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**: The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Substitution occurs predominantly at the meta position, making the para isomer a minor product.

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**: The ethyl group (-C2H5) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Substitution occurs predominantly at the ortho and para positions, with the para isomer being the major product.

6. **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic Acid)**: The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Substitution occurs predominantly at the meta position, making the para isomer a minor product.

### Order of Increasing Para Fraction:
- Substituents that are meta directors (2, 4, 6) have low para fractions. Among these, the strength of the deactivating effect determines the relative para fractions: **4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOEt)**.
- Substituents that are ortho/para directors (1, 3, 5) have high para fractions. Among these, steric hindrance and directing effects lead to the order: **1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5) < 3 (Cl)**.

Thus, the order of increasing para fraction is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.

### Correct Option:
**C) 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about electrophilic substitution reactions of benzene derivatives with bromine. I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions—either ortho, meta, or para relative to themselves.

The problem gives six compounds, numbered 1 to 6. Each has a benzene ring with a different substituent. They all undergo an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the one with the smallest para fraction comes first, and the largest comes last.

Let me list out the substituents again:

1) С6H5-CH3 (toluene, methyl group)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (benzoyloxy ethyl, I think that's ethyl ester of benzoic acid)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, for each substitution, I need to think about where the bromine will add. The substituents will direct the bromine to specific positions. But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the para product's yield depends on the directing effect of the substituent.

I think activating groups are ortho/para directors, and deactivating groups are meta directors. But wait, it's the activating or deactivating that matters. Also, some groups are strong activating, others are deactivating.

Let me think about each substituent:

1. CH3 (toluene): This is an activating group. Methyl is an electron-donating group (since it's an alkyl group), so it's an ortho/para director. So substitution occurs mainly at ortho and para positions.

2. COOEt (ester group, like benzoyloxy ethyl?): The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. So it's a deactivating group. Wait, esters are typically meta directors. Because the carbonyl is an electron-withdrawing group by induction, making the ring less reactive. So for substitution, the ester group directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position.

Wait, no, wait. Ester groups are actually ortho/para directors, or meta? Hmm, I might be getting confused here. Wait, I think that the ester group (like COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group through the carbonyl, which makes the ring less reactive. So it's a deactivating group. But wait, the oxygen in the ester has lone pairs. So it's an electron-donating through resonance? No, wait, no. No, wait. The carbonyl is adjacent to the oxygen. So the ester group is like a meta director? Or ortho/para?

Wait, I think that the ester group is a meta director because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing, making the ring less reactive, and it's a deactivating group. So, the substituent would direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. So, in substitution reactions, the bromine would add mostly in the meta position relative to the ester group.

3. Cl: Chlorine is a substituent that's a bit tricky. It's more electronegative than carbon, so it's electron-withdrawing by induction. But the chlorine atom also has lone pairs which can donate electrons through resonance. So, the effect is that it's a deactivating (because of induction) but ortho/para-directing (because of resonance). So, in substitution, the Cl directs the incoming electrophile to ortho and para positions.

Wait, but I've heard that sometimes when the substituent is more electronegative, like Cl, the inductive effect dominates. So, Cl is a deactivating group and an ortho/para director. So substitution occurs at ortho and para.

4. NO2: Nitro group is a strong deactivating meta-director. Because it's highly electron-withdrawing through both induction and resonance. So, the nitro group directs substitution to the meta position.

5. C2H5: Ethyl group, similar to methyl. It's an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So substitution occurs at ortho and para.

6. COOH: Carboxylic acid group. The COOH is a strong deactivating group because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Also, the hydroxyl group is electron-donating, but I think the overall effect is deactivating. Wait, no. Wait, in the carboxylic acid group, the -COOH is attached to the ring. The carbonyl is electron-withdrawing, making the ring less reactive. So, the substituent is a meta director. Wait, I think that the -COOH group is deactivating and meta directing.

Wait, but wait: the -COOH group is strongly deactivating because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl and the carboxyl group. So, the substituent will direct substitution to the meta position.

Wait, but sometimes I've heard that substituents like -COOH are meta directors. So substituents like nitro, esters, and carboxylic acids are meta directors.

So, for each substituent:

1. CH3: activating, ortho/para → so substitution at ortho and para. So, the product would have more ortho and para isomers, but since the question is about the para-isomer's weight fraction, we need to think about how much of the product is para.

But wait, in some cases, the substituents have different abilities to direct. Also, steric factors might play a role, but I think the directing effects are more significant here.

Wait, for each substituent, when bromine is added, which position (ortho, meta, para) is favored?

Let me reiterate:

1. CH3 (activating, ortho/para): So substitution can occur at ortho and para positions. The ratio between ortho and para depends on the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state. For methyl, the para isomer is more favored than ortho because the steric hindrance is less than in the ortho position, especially when the substituent is in the para position relative to the incoming group.

Wait, no. For toluene (methylbenzene), the para isomer is the major product, but some ortho is also formed. So, the major product is para, but ortho is about 30% or so.

Wait, but in reality, for toluene, the para isomer is about 60%, ortho about 35%, and meta is negligible. So, the para fraction is significant.

2. COOEt (ester group, deactivating, meta director): So substitution occurs mainly at the meta position. So the para isomer would be minor. I think in this case, the para isomer is not the major product, but perhaps a small fraction.

Wait, wait, no. If the substituent is a meta director, then the substitution occurs at the meta position. So, the major product is meta. So, the para isomer would be a minor product.

Wait, but in some cases, if substitution occurs at meta, but there are two possible meta positions, which are equivalent in some cases. So, perhaps the meta product is about 50%, and the ortho and para are negligible? Wait, no. I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

Wait, let's think again. For each substituent, how does the substitution occur?

The substituent directs the incoming electrophile to specific positions. For example, a meta director means the substitution occurs at the meta position relative to the substituent.

But wait, substitution can't occur at all positions because the ring is symmetric. For instance, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the substituents would have specific positions.

Wait, but in all these cases, each substituent is at a single position on the benzene ring, so the question is about the major product when electrophilic substitution occurs once.

Wait, but the question says that for each compound, only one monobromo derivative is formed. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because in reality, substitution can occur in multiple positions, leading to different isomers. But the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, perhaps the substituent is such that it only allows substitution at one position? Or perhaps the substituent is so strong that it's the only possible position.

Wait, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the bromine is in excess, leading to the most favored product. But the question says each reaction forms one monobromo product, implying that perhaps each substituent directs exclusively to one position, or that the major product is the only one considered.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. For each substituent, when bromine adds, where does it go, and what is the ratio of para isomer?

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each compound, what's the fraction of para product relative to all possible products.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are such that only para is possible, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituent directing to certain positions. Let me think about each substituent:

1. CH3 (methyl): ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, the major products are ortho and para. So, the para isomer is a major fraction.

2. COOEt (ester): meta director. So, bromine adds mostly in the meta position. So, the para isomer is not the major product but would be a minor fraction.

3. Cl: ortho/para director. So, substitution occurs at ortho and para. So, the para isomer is a major fraction.

4. NO2: meta director. So, substitution occurs at meta. So, the para isomer is a minor fraction.

5. C2H5 (ethyl): similar to methyl, ortho/para director. So, substitution occurs at ortho and para, with para as the major.

6. COOH (carboxylic acid): meta director. So, substitution occurs at meta, so para is a minor fraction.

Wait, but for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para isomer is more favored because of less steric hindrance compared to the ortho position.

Wait, for toluene (methyl), the para isomer is about 60% and ortho about 35% (I think). So, the para fraction is higher than the ortho.

Similarly, for ethylbenzene (C2H5), when bromine adds, the para isomer is the major product.

Now, the nitro group (4), being a strong meta director, so substitution occurs at meta. So, the para isomer would be a minor fraction. Similarly, the ester (2) and COOH (6) are meta directors, so substitution occurs at meta, so para is a minor isomer.

Wait, but what about the Cl substituent (3)? It's an ortho/para director. So bromine can add at ortho and para. So, the para isomer is a major fraction.

So, now, for each substituent, the fraction of para isomer in the product:

1) CH3: high (major)
2) COOEt: low (meta is major)
3) Cl: high (para is major)
4) NO2: low (meta is major)
5) C2H5: high (para is major)
6) COOH: low (meta is major)

Wait, but wait, for substituents like Cl, are the para and ortho products formed in similar amounts, or is para more than ortho?

I think that for Cl, the para product is more than the ortho because of steric factors. Ortho is close, so less favored than para.

So, in the case of Cl, the para isomer is about 50% or higher.

But wait, in reality, chlorobenzene (Cl substituent) when brominated in electrophilic substitution, the major products are para and ortho. The para isomer is more than the ortho, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact percentages.

But for the purpose of this question, I think the key is to sort the substituents based on how much para they produce.

So, substituents that are ortho/para directors (activating) would have higher para fractions. Those that are meta directors (deactivating) would have lower para fractions.

Let me list the substituents and their para yield:

1) CH3 (ortho/para, activating): high para
2) COOEt (meta, deactivating): low para
3) Cl (ortho/para, deactivating but directing): high para
4) NO2 (meta, deactivating): low para
5) C2H5 (ortho/para, activating): high para
6) COOH (meta, deactivating): low para

So, the order of para fraction from lowest to highest would be:

Lowest: 2,4,6 → then 1,3,5.

Wait, but within the meta directors, their para fractions are low, but how do they compare? Are some meta directors more deactivating, leading to less substitution in the para position?

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the para fraction is the amount of para product formed relative to all products.

Wait, but if a substituent is a meta director, the para fraction would be low, but perhaps even lower than some other substituents. Let me think:

Substituents:

4) NO2: strong meta director → para fraction is very low

6) COOH: meta director → para fraction is low, but perhaps higher than NO2?

Similarly, 2) COOEt: meta director → para fraction is low, but higher than NO2?

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think about the actual substitution patterns.

Substituents that are meta directors lead to substitution at meta position. So, in such cases, the para product is a minor fraction. But for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para is a major product.

So, the substituents that are meta directors will have lower para fractions. The substituents that are ortho/para directors will have higher para fractions.

So, within the meta directors:

Which substituent would lead to the least para product? Probably the strongest deactivators, which would make the para product difficult to form.

Wait, but the para product's formation is more about the directing effect than the activation. So, if the substituent is a meta director, the bromine will add at meta, so the para product would be a minor product. But perhaps for some substituents, the para product is possible but in small amounts.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's ability to activate or deactivate affects the overall reactivity, but the question is only about the para fraction, not the overall reactivity.

Wait, the problem says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Hmm. That complicates things because usually, multiple products form, but the question says each reaction forms one product. That can't be possible in reality; perhaps the substituent is such that only one position is possible for substitution.

Wait, perhaps if the substituent is in a position where only one substitution is possible? Like in the case of a substituent that is on a ring such that substitution can only occur at a single position. But that's not the case for any of these substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is so strong that only one position is reactive.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine adds only once, and only the most favored position reacts. So, for each substituent, the major product is the only one considered, and the others are negligible.

In that case, the para fraction for each substituent would be:

If substituent is an ortho/para director, the major product is para. So, the para fraction is high.

If substituent is a meta director, the major product is meta, so para fraction is low.

So, for each compound:

1) CH3: para → high
2) COOEt: meta → low
3) Cl: para → high
4) NO2: meta → low
5) C2H5: para → high
6) COOH: meta → low

So, the para fractions for each are:

1: high
2: low
3: high
4: low
5: high
6: low

Now, among the low para fractions (substituents 2,4,6), how do they compare?

I think the strength of the deactivating effect may influence the para fraction. For example, a stronger deactivator might make the para product less likely, but wait, the directing effect is more about where substitution occurs than the overall reactivity. However, the overall reactivity does affect the rate of substitution. But the question is about the product distribution, not the rate.

Wait, but wait, if a substituent is a strong deactivator, the overall reaction might be slower, but that doesn't affect the product distribution in terms of isomer ratios. So, the para fraction is more about the substituent's directing effect.

So, substituents 2,4,6 are all meta directors. So, their para fractions are low, but perhaps in order of their para fractions from least to greatest.

Wait, but if all are meta directors, then their para fractions would be the same. But that's not the case because the substituents have different directing strengths. Wait, no, because the substituents are all meta directors, so their para fractions are low, but perhaps some have more ortho and para products than others.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the actual product distributions.

For each substituent:

1) Toluene (CH3): The para isomer is the major product, with about 60%, ortho about 30%, and meta negligible.

2) COOEt: The substituent is a meta director, so substitution occurs at meta. So, the major product is meta. So, the para isomer is a minor product, perhaps less than 10%.

3) Cl: substitution occurs at ortho and para, with para being major. So, para fraction is about 60%.

4) NO2: substitution occurs at meta. So, para is minor, perhaps less than 10%.

5) C2H5: like toluene, substitution at para and ortho. Para is major, around 60%.

6) COOH: substitution occurs at meta. So, para is minor, perhaps less than 10%.

So, the para fractions are:

1: ~60%

3: ~60%

5: ~60%

2: ~10%

4: ~10%

6: ~10%

Wait, but wait. For substituent 3 (Cl), is the para fraction higher than substituent 1 (CH3)?

Wait, I think that in chlorobenzene, substitution occurs more in the para position than ortho because of steric hindrance. So, for Cl, the para isomer is about 50-60%, and ortho about 30-40%.

Wait, but in toluene, the para isomer is higher, around 60-70%. So, substituent 1 (CH3) has a higher para fraction than substituent 3 (Cl).

Wait, perhaps the order is:

Highest para fraction:

1 (CH3) >5 (C2H5) >3 (Cl)

Wait, but I think in toluene, the para isomer is higher than for ethylbenzene, or maybe they're similar.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of activating groups. The more activating the substituent, the more the ring is activated, leading to more ortho and para substitution. But the ratio between ortho and para depends on the substituent's size, perhaps.

Wait, methyl is a smaller group than ethyl, so in toluene, the para isomer is more favored than in ethylbenzene because ethyl is bulkier. So, substituent 1 (methyl) would have a higher para fraction than substituent 5 (ethyl).

So, order of para fraction from high to low:

1 >5 >3.

Now, for the meta directors, substituents 2,4,6 have low para fractions. How to arrange them?

What's the order of their para fractions?

We have 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH).

I think that the substituent's deactivating strength affects the amount of para product.

Wait, but for meta directors, the para product is minor, but the actual amount could vary. For substituents that are strongly deactivating, perhaps the para fraction is even lower.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's ability to withdraw electrons affects the overall reactivity but not the product distribution once the substituent's position is fixed.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So, for substituents that are meta directors, their para fractions are low, but how do these compare between substituents?

Let me think about each:

2) COOEt (ester): the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group. So, it's a meta director. The para product would be a minor product.

4) NO2: a strong deactivating, meta director. So, the para product is minor.

6) COOH: a strong deactivating, meta director. So, the para product is minor.

So, para fractions are all low, but which is the lowest?

I think that the substituent's strength as a deactivator doesn't change the position of substitution but affects the rate. So, perhaps the para fractions are about the same for all meta directors.

But that can't be, so perhaps the para fraction is a function of the substituent's directing. For example, some meta directors might allow a small amount of para product, while others do not.

Wait, perhaps nitro groups are strong meta directors, leading to very little para product. Similarly, COOH is a strong deactivator, leading to little para product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent that's most strongly deactivating leads to the least para product. So, in terms of para fraction (from lowest to highest) for meta directors:

4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOEt).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps COOEt is less deactivating than COOH, so COOEt's para fraction is higher than COOH's.

Wait, no, I think that COOH is a stronger deactivator than COOEt.

Wait, the substituent's effect on the ring's electron density affects the reactivity but not the direction. So, perhaps the para fraction is determined only by whether it's a meta or ortho/para director.

But that leads me to believe that all meta directors have the same para fraction, which isn't the case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think of another approach. The question asks for the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, from the lowest to the highest.

So, the substituents that are meta directors have low para fractions, and those that are ortho/para have high para fractions.

So, the order from low to high:

Meta directors (lower para fractions) come first, then ortho/para directors.

Now, within the meta directors, how do their para fractions compare?

Well, perhaps the nitro group is a stronger deactivator than the ester group, which is stronger than the carboxylic acid.

Wait, no, I think that nitro is a stronger deactivator than COOH. Because the nitro group is a stronger EWG than COOH.

Wait, the order of deactivating strength: NO2 > COOH > COOEt.

So, the para fraction for substituents with stronger deactivators would be even lower. So, substituent 4 (NO2) has the lowest para fraction, followed by 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt).

So, the order of para fractions from lowest to highest would be:

4 < 6 < 2 <1 <5 <3.

Wait, that's substituent 4 (NO2) has the lowest para fraction, then 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt), then 1 (CH3), then 5 (C2H5), then 3 (Cl).

So, the order is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Looking at the options, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. So option C is the correct order.


To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for the given compounds undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents can either be ortho/para directors (activating groups) or meta directors (deactivating groups). The para fraction depends on the substituent's directing effect and its ability to stabilize the transition state.

### Analysis of Each Compound:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**: The methyl group (-CH3) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Substitution occurs predominantly at the ortho and para positions, with the para isomer being the major product.

2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Benzoyloxy Ethyl)**: The ester group (-COOEt) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Substitution occurs predominantly at the meta position, making the para isomer a minor product.

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**: The chlorine atom (-Cl) is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group due to resonance effects. Substitution occurs at both ortho and para positions, with the para isomer being the major product.

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**: The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Substitution occurs predominantly at the meta position, making the para isomer a minor product.

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**: The ethyl group (-C2H5) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Substitution occurs predominantly at the ortho and para positions, with the para isomer being the major product.

6. **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic Acid)**: The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Substitution occurs predominantly at the meta position, making the para isomer a minor product.

### Order of Increasing Para Fraction:
- Substituents that are meta directors (2, 4, 6) have low para fractions. Among these, the strength of the deactivating effect determines the relative para fractions: **4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOEt)**.
- Substituents that are ortho/para directors (1, 3, 5) have high para fractions. Among these, steric hindrance and directing effects lead to the order: **1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5) < 3 (Cl)**.

Thus, the order of increasing para fraction is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.

### Correct Option:
**C) 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**

Answer: C
