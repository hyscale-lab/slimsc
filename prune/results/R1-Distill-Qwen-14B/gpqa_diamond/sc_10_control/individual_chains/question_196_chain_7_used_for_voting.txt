Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that harmonic oscillators are systems that experience a restoring force proportional to their displacement. In the classical case, like a mass on a spring, the restoring force is F = -kx. But here, it's a relativistic case, so I have to think about how relativity affects the equations.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's think about how to approach this.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is (1/2)kA², which gets converted into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. So (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², leading to v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so we can't use that formula directly.

In relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just kinetic plus potential. The total energy includes rest mass energy. The energy of a relativistic oscillator would involve relativistic expressions for momentum and energy. Also, the equation of motion might change because of relativistic effects, especially since the speed can't exceed c.

Let me remember the relativistic harmonic oscillator equation. The force is F = -kx, but relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v, where gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)). The equation of motion would be d(p)/dt = F, so d/dt (gamma m v) = -kx.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using energy conservation in the relativistic context. The total energy E is the sum of rest energy mc² and kinetic energy K. At maximum amplitude A, the speed is zero, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, but wait, in a regular oscillator, that's when the speed is maximum. So the potential energy at amplitude A is (1/2)kA², but I'm not sure if that's the same in the relativistic case.

Wait, no. In the relativistic case, the potential energy would still be (1/2)kA², assuming the harmonic potential is still valid. But the kinetic energy can't be just (1/2)mv² because that's non-relativistic. The kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So when the oscillator is at x=A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. When it's at x=0, the velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic (plus rest mass energy). Wait, but in reality, the total energy is the sum of rest mass, potential, and kinetic. Wait, the potential energy here is ½ k x², but in relativity, does the potential energy expression change? I'm not sure. Maybe we can model the potential as V(x) = ½ k x², same as before.

So, let's set up the energy equation. At maximum displacement x=A, the velocity v is zero. So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and potential energy: E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy at that point is E = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy. But wait, in the non-relativistic case, K is (1/2)mv_max², but relativistically, K is (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, but the total energy at x=0 is E = mc² + K = mc² + (gamma -1) mc² = gamma mc². So at x=0, E = gamma mc².

But from the first part, E is mc² + (1/2)kA². So we have:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Hmm, because (1/2 kA²)/(mc²) is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). 

Wait, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term for simplicity, say, Q. So gamma = 1 + Q.

So, 1/gamma = 1/(1 + Q) = sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c^2)

So sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + Q)

Square both sides:

1 - (v_max)^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + Q)^2

So,

(v_max)^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2. 

1 - 1/(1+Q)^2 = [ (1+Q)^2 -1 ] / (1+Q)^2

Which is [1 + 2Q + Q² -1 ] / (1+Q)^2 = [ 2Q + Q² ] / (1+Q)^2

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ 2Q + Q² ] / (1 + Q)^2

But Q is (k A²)/(2 m c^2). Let me plug that back in.

So,

v_max² = c² * [ 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) = (k A²)/(m c² )

So numerator inside the brackets becomes (k A²)/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4)

Let me factor out (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 = Q^2, but perhaps it's better to write the numerator as:

= (k A²)/(m c^2) [ 1 + (k A²)/(4 m c^2) ]

Wait, no, because (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2 is (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4)

So, the numerator is [ (k A²)/(m c²) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ]

= [ (4 m k A^2 c^2 + k² A^4) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Wait, perhaps I should try to factor out (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) from both terms.

Wait, let me see: (k A²)/(m c²) is 2*(k A^2/(2 m c²)) = 2 Q.

Similarly, (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) = Q^2.

So numerator is 2 Q + Q^2.

But denominator is (1 + Q)^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ (2 Q + Q^2) ] / (1 + Q)^2

Factor numerator: Q (2 + Q) ?

Wait, 2Q + Q² = Q (Q + 2) ?

Wait, 2Q + Q² is Q² + 2Q, which is Q(Q+2). Hmm, but perhaps it's better to factor it as Q(2+Q). So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ Q (2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q)^2

But Q is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ Q (2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q)^2 )

Which simplifies to c * sqrt( Q (2 + Q) ) / (1 + Q )

Let me compute sqrt(Q (2 + Q)).

Wait, perhaps I can write the entire expression under the square root as [ Q (2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better approach. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let's go back. The way I set up energy conservation was E = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2, and E = gamma mc^2.

But wait, in the relativistic case, perhaps the potential energy isn't (1/2)kA^2. Maybe I need to rethink the potential energy expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum speed analysis doesn't directly involve energy conservation because of the relativistic dynamics. Let me think about the equation of motion.

The equation for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is a bit more complicated. The force F is -k x, but F = d(p)/dt, where p is relativistic momentum: p = gamma m v.

So, F = dp/dt = d/dt (gamma m v) = m gamma' v + m gamma a, where a is acceleration, and gamma' is derivative of gamma with respect to time.

But F is also equal to -k x, so:

m gamma' v + m gamma a = -k x

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to consider the equation in terms of x and v.

Alternatively, perhaps using the virial theorem or other relativistic mechanics principles, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: considering the velocity as a function of position. The equation of motion for a relativistic oscillator is d^2 x/dt^2 = -(k/m) x / gamma^3.

Wait, I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps using the Lagrangian formalism, but that might get too involved.

Alternatively, maybe considering the velocity in terms of energy.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the energy conservation approach, but make sure that the potential energy is correctly accounted for. So, let's re-examine that.

In the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is V(x) = (1/2) k x². That should hold regardless of whether the motion is relativistic or not. Because the potential is derived from the force, which is given as F = -k x, so the potential is the integral of F dx, which is (1/2)k x².

So, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. So, the total energy E is E = K + V.

Wait, but in this case, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)k A².

But wait, that can't be right because in relativity, the total energy includes the rest mass energy. So perhaps the correct total energy when at maximum displacement is E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

No, that makes sense. Because at x=A, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is rest energy plus potential energy.

At x=0, the speed is maximum, so the kinetic energy is maximum, and the potential energy is zero. So total energy at x=0 is E = mc² + K_max, where K_max is the maximum kinetic energy.

But in reality, when the oscillator is at x=0, the velocity is maximum, so K_max is (gamma -1) mc².

So setting the two expressions for E equal:

mc² + (1/2)k A² = mc² + (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, that would imply (1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) mc².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which is the same as I had earlier.

So then, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which gives,

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)) )

Square both sides,

1 - v_max²/c² = 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2

Rearranging,

v_max²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Wait, no, it's 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2.

So,

v_max² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 ], where Q = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 )

Which can be rewritten as c sqrt( ( (1 + Q)^2 -1 )/(1 + Q)^2 )

= c sqrt( (1 + 2 Q + Q² -1 ) / (1 + Q)^2 )

= c sqrt( (2 Q + Q² ) / (1 + Q)^2 )

= c sqrt( Q (2 + Q) ) / (1 + Q )

Wait, but let me compute this expression.

Wait, 2 Q + Q^2 = Q (2 + Q).

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ Q (2 + Q) ) ] / (1 + Q )^2

So, v_max = c * sqrt( Q (2+Q) ) / (1+Q )

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them directly match this expression. Let's see the options again.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m ))^2 )

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c² )) )

Option C: v_max = sqrt( k A²/m ), which is the non-relativistic case.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, our expression for v_max^2 is c^2 * [ Q (2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q )^2, where Q = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max^2 = c² * [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2

Simplify numerator:

(k A²)/(2 m c²) * [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] = [ (k A^2) (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) ] / (2 m c² )

Denominator is (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let me just compute the entire expression.

Let me denote Q = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v_max^2 = c² [ Q (2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q )^2.

So,

v_max = c sqrt( Q (2 + Q) ) / (1 + Q )

But none of the options seem to match this. Let me look at option D.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Wait, let's compute what's inside the square root:

1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 = [ (1 + Q)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + Q )^2

= (1 + 2 Q + Q^2 -1 ) / (1 + Q )^2

= (2 Q + Q² ) / (1 + Q )^2

Which is exactly the expression we have for v_max²/c².

Wait, yes! Because our earlier expression for v_max^2 is c^2 multiplied by (2 Q + Q²)/(1 + Q )^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 (2 Q + Q^2)/(1 + Q )^2 = c^2 * [ (2 Q + Q^2) ] / (1 + Q )^2

Which is the same as c^2 times [ (1 - 1/(1+Q )^2 ) ]

Wait, because 2 Q + Q^2 = (1 + Q )^2 - 1.

Yes, because (1 + Q )^2 = 1 + 2 Q + Q^2. So,

(1 + Q )^2 -1 = 2 Q + Q^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 ( (1 + Q )^2 -1 )/(1 + Q )^2 ) = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 ]

Which is exactly the expression inside option D.

Wait, looking at option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Which matches exactly with our result.

So the correct option is D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we use relativistic energy conservation. The total energy \( E \) of the system includes the rest energy \( mc^2 \), the potential energy \( V(x) = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \), and the relativistic kinetic energy \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, so the total energy is purely potential:  
   \[
   E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]  
   At the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and the total energy is purely kinetic:  
   \[
   E = mc^2 + (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \gamma mc^2.
   \]  
   Equating the two expressions for \( E \):  
   \[
   \gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]  
   Dividing through by \( mc^2 \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   The Lorentz factor is defined as \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}.
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 \):  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that harmonic oscillators are systems that experience a restoring force proportional to their displacement. In the classical case, like a mass on a spring, the restoring force is F = -kx. But here, it's a relativistic case, so I have to think about how relativity affects the equations.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's think about how to approach this.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is (1/2)kA², which gets converted into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. So (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², leading to v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so we can't use that formula directly.

In relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just kinetic plus potential. The total energy includes rest mass energy. The energy of a relativistic oscillator would involve relativistic expressions for momentum and energy. Also, the equation of motion might change because of relativistic effects, especially since the speed can't exceed c.

Let me remember the relativistic harmonic oscillator equation. The force is F = -kx, but relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v, where gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)). The equation of motion would be d(p)/dt = F, so d/dt (gamma m v) = -kx.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using energy conservation in the relativistic context. The total energy E is the sum of rest energy mc² and kinetic energy K. At maximum amplitude A, the speed is zero, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, but wait, in a regular oscillator, that's when the speed is maximum. So the potential energy at amplitude A is (1/2)kA², but I'm not sure if that's the same in the relativistic case.

Wait, no. In the relativistic case, the potential energy would still be (1/2)kA², assuming the harmonic potential is still valid. But the kinetic energy can't be just (1/2)mv² because that's non-relativistic. The kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So when the oscillator is at x=A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. When it's at x=0, the velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic (plus rest mass energy). Wait, but in reality, the total energy is the sum of rest mass, potential, and kinetic. Wait, the potential energy here is ½ k x², but in relativity, does the potential energy expression change? I'm not sure. Maybe we can model the potential as V(x) = ½ k x², same as before.

So, let's set up the energy equation. At maximum displacement x=A, the velocity v is zero. So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and potential energy: E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy at that point is E = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy. But wait, in the non-relativistic case, K is (1/2)mv_max², but relativistically, K is (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, but the total energy at x=0 is E = mc² + K = mc² + (gamma -1) mc² = gamma mc². So at x=0, E = gamma mc².

But from the first part, E is mc² + (1/2)kA². So we have:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Hmm, because (1/2 kA²)/(mc²) is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). 

Wait, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term for simplicity, say, Q. So gamma = 1 + Q.

So, 1/gamma = 1/(1 + Q) = sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c^2)

So sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + Q)

Square both sides:

1 - (v_max)^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + Q)^2

So,

(v_max)^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2. 

1 - 1/(1+Q)^2 = [ (1+Q)^2 -1 ] / (1+Q)^2

Which is [1 + 2Q + Q² -1 ] / (1+Q)^2 = [ 2Q + Q² ] / (1+Q)^2

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ 2Q + Q² ] / (1 + Q)^2

But Q is (k A²)/(2 m c^2). Let me plug that back in.

So,

v_max² = c² * [ 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) = (k A²)/(m c² )

So numerator inside the brackets becomes (k A²)/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4)

Let me factor out (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 = Q^2, but perhaps it's better to write the numerator as:

= (k A²)/(m c^2) [ 1 + (k A²)/(4 m c^2) ]

Wait, no, because (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2 is (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4)

So, the numerator is [ (k A²)/(m c²) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ]

= [ (4 m k A^2 c^2 + k² A^4) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Wait, perhaps I should try to factor out (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) from both terms.

Wait, let me see: (k A²)/(m c²) is 2*(k A^2/(2 m c²)) = 2 Q.

Similarly, (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) = Q^2.

So numerator is 2 Q + Q^2.

But denominator is (1 + Q)^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ (2 Q + Q^2) ] / (1 + Q)^2

Factor numerator: Q (2 + Q) ?

Wait, 2Q + Q² = Q (Q + 2) ?

Wait, 2Q + Q² is Q² + 2Q, which is Q(Q+2). Hmm, but perhaps it's better to factor it as Q(2+Q). So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ Q (2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q)^2

But Q is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ Q (2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q)^2 )

Which simplifies to c * sqrt( Q (2 + Q) ) / (1 + Q )

Let me compute sqrt(Q (2 + Q)).

Wait, perhaps I can write the entire expression under the square root as [ Q (2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better approach. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let's go back. The way I set up energy conservation was E = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2, and E = gamma mc^2.

But wait, in the relativistic case, perhaps the potential energy isn't (1/2)kA^2. Maybe I need to rethink the potential energy expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum speed analysis doesn't directly involve energy conservation because of the relativistic dynamics. Let me think about the equation of motion.

The equation for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is a bit more complicated. The force F is -k x, but F = d(p)/dt, where p is relativistic momentum: p = gamma m v.

So, F = dp/dt = d/dt (gamma m v) = m gamma' v + m gamma a, where a is acceleration, and gamma' is derivative of gamma with respect to time.

But F is also equal to -k x, so:

m gamma' v + m gamma a = -k x

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to consider the equation in terms of x and v.

Alternatively, perhaps using the virial theorem or other relativistic mechanics principles, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: considering the velocity as a function of position. The equation of motion for a relativistic oscillator is d^2 x/dt^2 = -(k/m) x / gamma^3.

Wait, I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps using the Lagrangian formalism, but that might get too involved.

Alternatively, maybe considering the velocity in terms of energy.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the energy conservation approach, but make sure that the potential energy is correctly accounted for. So, let's re-examine that.

In the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is V(x) = (1/2) k x². That should hold regardless of whether the motion is relativistic or not. Because the potential is derived from the force, which is given as F = -k x, so the potential is the integral of F dx, which is (1/2)k x².

So, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. So, the total energy E is E = K + V.

Wait, but in this case, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)k A².

But wait, that can't be right because in relativity, the total energy includes the rest mass energy. So perhaps the correct total energy when at maximum displacement is E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

No, that makes sense. Because at x=A, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is rest energy plus potential energy.

At x=0, the speed is maximum, so the kinetic energy is maximum, and the potential energy is zero. So total energy at x=0 is E = mc² + K_max, where K_max is the maximum kinetic energy.

But in reality, when the oscillator is at x=0, the velocity is maximum, so K_max is (gamma -1) mc².

So setting the two expressions for E equal:

mc² + (1/2)k A² = mc² + (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, that would imply (1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) mc².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which is the same as I had earlier.

So then, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which gives,

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)) )

Square both sides,

1 - v_max²/c² = 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2

Rearranging,

v_max²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Wait, no, it's 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2.

So,

v_max² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 ], where Q = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 )

Which can be rewritten as c sqrt( ( (1 + Q)^2 -1 )/(1 + Q)^2 )

= c sqrt( (1 + 2 Q + Q² -1 ) / (1 + Q)^2 )

= c sqrt( (2 Q + Q² ) / (1 + Q)^2 )

= c sqrt( Q (2 + Q) ) / (1 + Q )

Wait, but let me compute this expression.

Wait, 2 Q + Q^2 = Q (2 + Q).

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ Q (2 + Q) ) ] / (1 + Q )^2

So, v_max = c * sqrt( Q (2+Q) ) / (1+Q )

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them directly match this expression. Let's see the options again.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m ))^2 )

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c² )) )

Option C: v_max = sqrt( k A²/m ), which is the non-relativistic case.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, our expression for v_max^2 is c^2 * [ Q (2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q )^2, where Q = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max^2 = c² * [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2

Simplify numerator:

(k A²)/(2 m c²) * [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] = [ (k A^2) (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) ] / (2 m c² )

Denominator is (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let me just compute the entire expression.

Let me denote Q = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v_max^2 = c² [ Q (2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q )^2.

So,

v_max = c sqrt( Q (2 + Q) ) / (1 + Q )

But none of the options seem to match this. Let me look at option D.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Wait, let's compute what's inside the square root:

1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 = [ (1 + Q)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + Q )^2

= (1 + 2 Q + Q^2 -1 ) / (1 + Q )^2

= (2 Q + Q² ) / (1 + Q )^2

Which is exactly the expression we have for v_max²/c².

Wait, yes! Because our earlier expression for v_max^2 is c^2 multiplied by (2 Q + Q²)/(1 + Q )^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 (2 Q + Q^2)/(1 + Q )^2 = c^2 * [ (2 Q + Q^2) ] / (1 + Q )^2

Which is the same as c^2 times [ (1 - 1/(1+Q )^2 ) ]

Wait, because 2 Q + Q^2 = (1 + Q )^2 - 1.

Yes, because (1 + Q )^2 = 1 + 2 Q + Q^2. So,

(1 + Q )^2 -1 = 2 Q + Q^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 ( (1 + Q )^2 -1 )/(1 + Q )^2 ) = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 ]

Which is exactly the expression inside option D.

Wait, looking at option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Which matches exactly with our result.

So the correct option is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we use relativistic energy conservation. The total energy \( E \) of the system includes the rest energy \( mc^2 \), the potential energy \( V(x) = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \), and the relativistic kinetic energy \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, so the total energy is purely potential:  
   \[
   E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]  
   At the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and the total energy is purely kinetic:  
   \[
   E = mc^2 + (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \gamma mc^2.
   \]  
   Equating the two expressions for \( E \):  
   \[
   \gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]  
   Dividing through by \( mc^2 \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   The Lorentz factor is defined as \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}.
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 \):  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
