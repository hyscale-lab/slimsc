Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, let me think. The question is about identifying an organic compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are four different types of propenyl or butenyl acetates—cis and trans for both. 

First, I'll try to understand the structure of each possible compound. Acetates are esters, so their general structure is R-O-CO-O-R, wait no, wait. Wait, acetate is an ester where the acid is acetic acid. So the structure would be R-O-CO-CH3, right? Or wait, no, wait. Acetate esters have the formula R-O-COCH3. So the R group is the alkyl or alkenyl group attached to the oxygen.

The compounds in the options are either propenyl or butenyl acetates. Let me recall: propenyl would be CH2CH2CH2- but wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- group. Wait, no, wait. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but that's allyl, I think. Or wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-? Wait, no, actually, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, but I might be getting confused. Wait, no. Propenyl would have three carbons, with a double bond. So propenyl is like CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH=CH2? Wait no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent. Or perhaps CH3CH=CH-? Or maybe I should draw them out.

Wait, but the options are propenyl and butenyl. Propenyl is an allyl group, which is CH2=CHCH2-. But the substituent in the ester would be attached to the oxygen. So for propenyl acetate, it's OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3, so R is the propenyl group. So for propenyl acetate, R is CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, I think I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structures of each option:

- Cis-propenyl acetate: The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-? Or is it CH2CH=CH-OAc? Wait, wait. Wait, propenyl group is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. So I think the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But for the cis and trans, that would refer to substituents on the double bond. Wait, but wait, propenyl has three carbons. So perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc for propenyl acetate. But wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the ester would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, but wait—what about the substituents on the double bond? For cis and trans, the groups on either side of the double bond would be arranged. So for propenyl acetate, the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But that would be trans if the substituents on either side are opposite. Or wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe I should think about the actual structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the structure of the ester. Let's say the acetate is OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group. So for propenyl acetate, R is -CH2-CH=CH2? Or is it -CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere else?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituents. Let me try to imagine the structure of each option.

Wait, another approach: the NMR spectrum given is:

7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J=16 Hz.

5.5 ppm: 1H, dq (doublet of quadruplets? Or maybe doublet of something else. Not sure. Alternatively, it's a doublet with coupling to two different sets of protons.)

2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet. That's probably the acetate methyl group (COOCH3), which is usually around 2.0-2.2 ppm as a singlet.

1.6 ppm: 3H, d. That's a triplet? Wait, no, it's a doublet. So a doublet of 3H. That would be a methyl group attached to something. Since it's a doublet, perhaps it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Or maybe a methyl attached to a CH which is adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which is a large coupling. That suggests a trans coupling, perhaps between two protons across a double bond. So maybe this is a vinylic proton (on a double bond) that's coupled to another vinylic proton.

In the case of an ester with a propenyl group, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that would make the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, so the substituents on the double bond would be a CH2- group and a CH2-OAc group on one side, and on the other, perhaps a hydrogen. Wait, no, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not a double bond. Wait, no, but the options are propenyl and butenyl, which have double bonds.

Wait, let me go back. The given NMR has a peak at 7.0 ppm, which is a doublet. That's a downfield shift, likely a vinylic proton. So the molecule has a double bond with two protons that are split into a doublet. Wait, but with J=16 Hz, which is a large coupling, typical for trans coupling in double bonds.

So perhaps the structure has a double bond with two protons that are trans, such as in a trans configuration. So when you have a trans double bond, the protons on each end are on opposite sides, so they can couple with each other with a larger coupling constant (like 16 Hz), which is typical for trans coupling in alkenes.

Wait, but wait, in a trans configuration, the protons are on opposite sides. So in the case of a double bond with two substituents on either side, like in CH2=CH, but wait, perhaps I need to think of a more substituted double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl acetate). Or maybe it's CH2CH2CH2-OAc but that's not right. Wait, no, wait: propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, another thought: the 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets? Or a doublet with some splitting. Maybe it's a triplet. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl proton that's coupled to two other sets of protons.

Wait, let's think about the propenyl group. If the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the protons on the double bond would be on C1 and C2. So the CH2=CHCH2-OAc would have a structure like OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that's not right because propenyl has a double bond.

Wait, no, the correct structure for propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. So the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, attached to the oxygen of the acetate.

In that structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, no, that can't be right because CH2=CHCH2-O would have the double bond between C1 and C2, with CH2-O on one end and CH2 on the other. Wait, perhaps I need to draw it.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that can't be right because that's a single bond. Oh wait, no, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, no, that would give CH2=CHCH2-OAc, which is correct.

So in that structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, so the double bond is between the second and third carbons of the propenyl group.

Wait, no, perhaps the propenyl group is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the CH2-OAc on the C3.

In that structure, the protons on the double bond (C1 and C2) would be vinylic. The C2 is attached to a CH2-OAc group, and the C1 is attached to a CH2-.

Wait, but in that case, the vinylic protons are on C1 and C2. Let me think about their NMR shifts.

Protons on double bonds typically show up in the range of 4.5-7 ppm, depending on substitution and neighboring groups. So the 7.0 ppm peak is probably one of those vinylic protons.

Looking back at the NMR data:

7.0 ppm: 1H, d, J=16.0 Hz. So this is a doublet, which suggests that this proton is coupled to one other proton. The coupling constant is 16 Hz, which is a large value, typical for trans coupling across a double bond.

The 5.5 ppm: 1H, dq. Hmm, a doublet of quadruplets? Or a doublet with some other splitting. Wait, maybe it's more like a doublet of triplets? Or perhaps it's a doublet that's further split into a quartet. Alternatively, it's a doublet because of coupling with two different sets of protons.

Wait, perhaps the two vinylic protons are each coupled to each other (J=16 Hz) and perhaps one of them is also coupled to another set of protons, like the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but in the structure I was considering (CH2=CHCH2-OAc), the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the protons on C1 (let's say H1) and C2 (H2) are each attached to their respective carbons.

H1 is on C1 (CH2=), so it's a CH2 group. Wait, no, wait. Let me write it correctly.

Wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-CH3.

So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are two H's and a CH2 group. On C2, we have a CH2 group (from CH2-OAc) and two H's on C2? No, wait: no, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. So C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, and C3 is CH2.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me number the propenyl group:

1   2   3
CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

So C1: CH2, attached to C2 (double bond).

C2: CH, attached to C1 and C3 (which is CH2-OAc).

Wait, but that would make C2 a CH group with a double bond to C1 and a single bond to C3.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

In that structure, the vinylic protons would be on C2 (since C1 is CH2, so two H's; C2 is CH, so one H). Wait, no, wait: C1 is CH2, so two H's attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 is single bonded to C3 (CH2-OAc). So the vinylic protons would be on C2, but that's only one H? Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I got the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere else. Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc but with a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the propenyl group is CH2CH=CH-OAc. So the structure is CH2-CH=CH-OAc. Wait, but that would be CH2CH=CHOAc, which is CH2CH=CH-O-CO-CH3.

In that case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. So C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, and C3 is CH-OAc. So the vinylic protons would be on C2 and C3. But wait, C3 is attached to the oxygen, so perhaps it's a CH2-O group. Wait, no, if the structure is CH2-CH=CH-OAc, then the double bond is between C2 and C3. So C3 is CH-OAc, so it has one H. C2 is CH, so also one H. So in this case, the vinylic protons are H on C2 and H on C3.

So the two vinylic protons would be on C2 and C3.

In the NMR, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet, which suggests that each vinylic proton is coupled to another. If the structure is trans, then the coupling would be larger (like J=16 Hz). So perhaps the two vinylic protons are trans to each other. But wait, in the propenyl group as CH2-CH=CH-OAc, the C2 and C3 would be in a trans configuration?

Wait, maybe I should think about the diastereotopic groups. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there's only one vinylic proton, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the butenyl group is considered. Let me think about butenyl acetate.

Butenyl is four carbons, so butenyl acetate would have the structure CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. Or perhaps CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond somewhere else.

Wait, but butenyl could have the double bond at either position. For example, 1-propenyl (but-1-enyl) would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, butenyl could be 1,3-diene, but I think butenyl refers to a four-carbon chain with a double bond between C1 and C2 (but-1-enyl) or between C2 and C3 (but-2-enyl).

So, the options include cis and trans for both propenyl and butenyl acetates.

Now, looking at the NMR data again:

1H NMR:

7.0 (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz) → likely a vinylic proton, coupled to another vinylic proton with large J (trans).

5.5 (1H, dq) → perhaps another vinylic proton with more complex splitting, or maybe an allylic proton.

2.1 (3H, s) → acetate methyl group.

1.6 (3H, d) → another methyl group, perhaps attached to a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond.

So let's think about the possible structures.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc (cis would mean that the substituents on the double bond are on the same side. But in this structure, the substituents are CH2 and CH2-OAc. Wait, in CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the substituents on the double bond are a CH2 group (on C1) and a CH2-OAc group (on C2). So in this case, the substituents on the double bond are both CH2 groups, but that doesn't introduce cis or trans isomerism because the substituents are the same on both sides. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, no, wait. If the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, and C3 is CH2-OAc. So the substituents on the double bond are C1 (CH2-) and C2 (CH-CH2-OAc). Wait, but both substituents are CH2 groups? Or perhaps not. Because for the double bond, each carbon is bonded to two substituents. So C1 is bonded to two H's and a CH2 group. C2 is bonded to one H and a CH2-OAc group. So for the double bond in CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, the substituents on C1 are H and H, and on C2, it's H and CH2-OAc. So no possibility for cis or trans isomerism here, because the substituents are not all different. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Alternatively, perhaps the propenyl group is in a different arrangement. Maybe the structure is CH2CH=CH-OAc, which would have the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2-CH=CH-OAc. In this case, the substituents on the double bond are CH2 (from C1) and OAc (from C3). So in this case, the substituents on either side of the double bond are CH2 and OAc. So if the substituents on the same side, it would be cis, and opposite would be trans.

So for cis-propenyl acetate, the CH2 group (C1) and the OAc group (C3) are on the same side of the double bond.

In that case, the two vinylic protons (on C2 and C3?) would be on the same side, leading to a coupling between them. But wait, in this structure, the double bond is between C2 and C3. C2 is CH, and C3 is CH-OAc. So the structure is CH2-CH=CH-OAc. So the substituents on C2 (the double bond) are CH2 (from C1) and CH-OAc (from C3). So the substituents on the double bond are CH2 and OAc (through the CH). So for cis, the CH2 and OAc are on the same side.

So the vinylic protons would be on C2 and C3. Wait, but C3 is connected to OAc, so it's a CH-OAc group, which has one H. And C2 is a CH group, also with one H.

So in the NMR, you would have two protons on the double bond. Each would couple with the other. So each would be a doublet. But in the given data, at 7.0 ppm, there's a doublet. At 5.5 ppm, another proton (maybe another vinylic, but as a doublet of some sort).

Wait, but the NMR data shows two different protons in the vinyl region: one at 7.0 as a doublet, and another at 5.5 as a doublet of something. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps that's not the case. Let me think about the coupling.

In CH2-CH=CH-OAc, the protons on C2 and C3 would be on adjacent carbons. The proton on C2 (let's call it H2) is attached to C2, which is double bonded to C3. The proton on C3 (H3) is attached to C3, which is single bonded to OAc. So H2 and H3 are on adjacent carbons but not on the same double bond. Wait, no, H2 is on C2, which is double bonded to C3. So H2 is a vinylic proton, and H3 is also a vinylic proton because it's attached to C3, which is double bonded to C2.

So both H2 and H3 are vinylic. Each would be coupled to each other (J=16 Hz) if they are trans. If they are cis, the coupling would be smaller, but wait, in reality, the coupling between adjacent vinylic protons can be around 10-18 Hz. So the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16, which is trans.

So if the structure is CH2-CH=CH-OAc, and the substituents are trans, then the H2 and H3 would be trans, leading to a large coupling (J=16 Hz). So each would be a doublet.

But in the NMR, do they appear as two separate doublets or as a multiplet? In the data, there's a peak at 7.0 (1H, d), another at 5.5 (1H, dq).

Hmm, perhaps the structure is such that one of the vinylic protons is split into a doublet, and the other is split into a more complex pattern because it's coupled to another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a butenyl group, which has a longer chain, allowing for different coupling patterns.

Let me think about butenyl acetate. Suppose the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (but-1-enyl acetate). Then the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on the double bond would be CH3 (if it's butenyl) – wait, no, butenyl is four carbons, so CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

In this structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents are CH2CH2OAc on C2 and CH3 on C1? No, wait, no.

Wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So but-1-enyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-.

So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3.

In this case, the vinylic protons are on C1 and C2. C1 has two H's (CH2=), and C2 has two H's (CH2CH2OAc). Wait, no, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2CH2CH=CH-OAc. No, butenyl is four carbons, so butenyl could be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but but-2-enyl would be CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OAc. So the structure is CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc.

In this structure, the double bond is between C2 and C3 (but-2-enyl). Each of these carbons has substituents. C2 is bonded to CH2- and CH=, and C3 is bonded to CH- and CH2-OAc.

So the substituents on the double bond are CH2 (from C1) and CH2-OAc (from C4). So for cis or trans, the substituents can be on the same or opposite sides.

In this case, the vinylic protons are on C2 and C3. Each has two substituents. Let me think about the NMR.

In the case of trans butenyl acetate, the substituents (CH2 from C1 and CH2-OAc from C4) are on opposite sides. So the protons on C2 and C3 would be trans to each other, leading to a large J coupling (like 16 Hz).

In the NMR, each vinylic proton would be a doublet, but perhaps one of them is also coupled to another set of protons, like the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, in the data, at 7.0 ppm, it's a doublet (J=16). At 5.5, it's a doublet of quadruplets, perhaps. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm peak is an allylic proton, like a CH2 group next to the double bond.

Wait, let me think again.

The 1H NMR data:

- 7.0 ppm: 1H, d, J=16.0 Hz → likely a vinylic proton with one coupling.

- 5.5 ppm: 1H, dq → perhaps another vinylic proton with more complex coupling.

- 2.1 ppm: 3H, s → acetate methyl.

- 1.6 ppm: 3H, d → a methyl group adjacent to a CH group.

So, the 1.6 ppm doublet of 3H suggests a methyl attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH group, perhaps part of a double bond.

Wait, methyl groups adjacent to a double bond are often deshielded and appear around 1.6 ppm, especially if they are allylic.

So perhaps the structure has a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group, which is part of a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)2-OAc? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a CH which is part of a double bond.

Hmm. Let's think about the possible structures again.

If the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl), then the vinylic protons would be on the CH2=CH- part. So the H's on the CH2 would be at a lower ppm. Wait, but the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, so perhaps that's the H on the CH group.

Wait, perhaps in the structure, the CH2 is next to the double bond. For example, in CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the CH2 next to the double bond would have protons that are split into a doublet of quartets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (butenyl), with the double bond at position 1.

In that case, the CH2= would have two H's, and the adjacent CH2 would have two H's as well. The CH2 next to the double bond would be split by the neighboring double bond's protons.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc (butenyl), with the double bond between C2 and C3.

In this structure, the CH2 groups on either side would have protons that are split due to coupling with the vinylic protons.

But going back to the NMR data, the 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) could be a proton that's coupled to two different sets of protons.

Another approach: perhaps the structure is such that the 7.0 ppm proton is on a double bond, and the 5.5 ppm is an allylic proton.

Wait, allylic protons typically appear between 4.5-5.5 ppm, depending on substitution. So maybe the 5.5 ppm is an allylic proton, and the 7.0 is a vinylic.

So, if the structure has a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond, the CH2 protons would be allylic and appear around 5.5 ppm, perhaps as a doublet or a multiplet.

Wait, but in the data, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the CH2 is on either end. So for butenyl acetate (but-2-enyl), the structure is CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc.

In this case, the CH2 groups on C1 and C4 would have protons that are allylic to the double bond, and the protons on C2 and C3 (the vinylic ones) would be split into doublets.

So the vinylic protons on C2 and C3 (each attached to CH) would be each a doublet due to coupling with each other (J=16 Hz), and perhaps each is also coupled to the neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, but the NMR data shows only two signals in the vinyl region: 7.0 and 5.5 ppm. So perhaps one of the vinylic protons is split into a more complex pattern.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of unique proton environments.

In the structure CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc (but-2-enyl acetate):

- C1: CH2, which is attached to C2 (CH).

- C2: CH, attached to C1 (CH2) and C3 (CH).

- C3: CH, attached to C2 (CH) and C4 (CH2-OAc).

- C4: CH2-OAc.

So the vinylic protons are on C2 and C3. These are each CH groups, each with one proton.

Since the double bond is between C2 and C3, if the substituents are trans, then the protons on C2 and C3 would be on opposite sides, leading to a large coupling (J=16 Hz) between them.

So each of these vinylic protons would be a doublet (coupled to each other), but perhaps each is also coupled to the adjacent CH2 groups.

So the proton on C2 (H2) would be coupled to H3 (on C3), and also to the two protons on C1 (H1a and H1b). Similarly, H3 would be coupled to H2 and the two H's on C4 (H4a and H4b).

Wait, but the H2 and H3 are each only attached to one CH2 group (on C1 and C4, respectively). So H2 is adjacent to C1 (CH2) and C3 (CH). H3 is adjacent to C2 (CH) and C4 (CH2).

So in the NMR, H2 would couple with H3 (J=16 Hz) and also with the two H's on C1 (which are each J around 2-3 Hz for allylic coupling). Similarly, H3 would couple with H2 (J=16 Hz) and the two H's on C4 (J around 2-3 Hz).

So for H2, it's a doublet from H3 and perhaps a triplet from the two H's on C1. But wait, the coupling to the two H's on C1 would be similar, so the splitting would be a triplet. So H2's peak would split into a doublet of triplets. But in the data, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, and 5.5 is a doublet of something.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling between H2 and the CH2 groups is small and may not split the peaks significantly.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that one of the vinylic protons is also coupled to another proton, leading to a doublet of doublets.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see the options again.

The options are A) Cis-butenyl acetate, B) Trans-propenyl acetate, C) Cis-propenyl acetate, D) Trans-butenyl acetate.

So, let's think about the number of vinylic protons in each structure.

Propenyl acetate (CH2=CHCH2-OAc) has two vinylic protons on C2 (since C1 is CH2, which has two H's, and C2 is CH, which has one H attached to the double bond). Wait, no—C2 in propenyl would be CH, so one H, which is vinylic. C3 is CH2-OAc, so no H on the double bond. So only one vinylic proton in propenyl acetate.

Wait, that can't be right. Because in CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2, which is not vinylic, and C2 is CH, which has one H attached to the double bond. So only one vinylic proton.

But in the NMR data, there are two signals in the vinyl region (7.0 and 5.5 ppm). So if the structure has only one vinylic proton, how come there are two signals? That suggests that there are two different vinylic protons, which would only happen in a structure with two vinylic protons, like butenyl acetate.

So if the structure is butenyl acetate, which has two vinylic protons, that would explain the two signals in the NMR.

So the options with butenyl are A and D: Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate.

Now, considering that, let's think about the coupling.

In trans-butenyl acetate, the substituents on the double bond would be on opposite sides. So the two vinylic protons would be trans to each other, resulting in a large coupling (J=16 Hz). So each would be a doublet.

In the NMR data, one of these protons is at 7.0 ppm (doublet, J=16), and the other at 5.5 ppm (dq). So the 7.0 ppm is a clean doublet, perhaps due to only coupling with the other vinylic proton. The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets or something else, meaning it has more than one coupling.

But why is the 5.5 ppm signal a doublet of quadruplets? Maybe because the proton is also coupled to two other sets of protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm proton is also adjacent to a CH2 group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, in the butenyl structure, let's say the structure is CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc. Then the vinylic protons are on C2 (H2) and C3 (H3). H2 is attached to C2, which is next to C1 (CH2). H3 is attached to C3, next to C4 (CH2-OAc).

So H2 would be coupled to H3 (J=16 Hz) and to the two H's on C1 (each with J around 2-3 Hz). So H2's signal would split into a doublet of triplets or a triplet of doublets, but in the data, it's a clean doublet at 7.0 ppm.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the 5.5 ppm proton is a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, but CH2 groups adjacent to double bonds (allylic) usually have their protons around 4.5-5.5 ppm. So the 5.5 ppm peak could be an allylic CH2.

But the data says it's 1H, so a single proton, which doesn't fit a CH2 group.

Wait, but the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of something (dq). So maybe it's a CH group next to a double bond, and it's coupled to two other protons.

Wait, another possibility: the structure has a CH that's adjacent to a double bond and a CH2. So the CH proton would be split by coupling with the double bond protons and the CH2 protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3-OAc, but that's not one of the options. So probably not.

Wait, another angle: the 1.6 ppm signal is a doublet of 3H. So a methyl group attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH group.

So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)2-OAc. No, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, the structure could be CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. Wait, but that's a branching. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's butenyl.

Wait, let me think about the butenyl acetate. If the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, then the vinylic protons are on C1 and C2. C1 is CH2, so two H's, and C2 is CH2, two H's. Wait, no, that's not right. The double bond would be between C1 and C2, making them CH and CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. No, because that would make C1: CH2 (double bond), C2: CH2 (single bond). Wait, no, in CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so C1 is CH2 and C2 is CH2. Wait, no, CH2= would be C1: CH2, double bonded to C2: CH2? No, that's impossible because a double bond requires two substituents on each carbon.

Wait, no, a double bond is between two carbons, each with two substituents. So in CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, C1 is CH2, C2 is CH2. No, wait, no. The correct structure for but-1-enyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, which would make C1: CH2, double bonded to C2: CH2. Wait, that's not possible, because CH2=CH would require C1 to have a double bond to C2, each with two substituents.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: let's think about the splitting patterns.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (J=16 Hz), so this proton is coupled to one other proton with J=16. The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets (or some other splitting), so it's coupled to two different sets of protons.

If the structure is trans-butenyl acetate (option D), the vinylic protons would be trans, so each would be a doublet. The protons adjacent to the double bond (CH2 groups) would be allylic and split into multiplets.

In trans-butenyl acetate (CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, trans configuration), the vinylic protons (H2 and H3) are on opposite sides. Each of these would couple with each other (J=16 Hz), and each would also couple with the adjacent CH2 groups.

So H2 is on C2, which is adjacent to C1 (CH2) and C3 (CH). H3 is on C3, adjacent to C2 (CH) and C4 (CH2-OAc).

Thus, H2 would be coupled to H3 (J=16) and the two H's on C1 (J around 2-3 Hz each). Similarly, H3 would be coupled to H2 (J=16) and the two H's on C4 (J around 2-3 Hz each).

So for H2, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets (from coupling with H3 and the two H's on C1), but the data shows a clean doublet at 7.0. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling to the CH2 groups is not observed due to being too small or because they are equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the vinylic protons is coupled only to the other vinylic proton, leading to a doublet, while the other is coupled to both the vinylic and the adjacent CH2 groups, leading to a more complex splitting.

So, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is H2, which is coupled only to H3 (J=16), and the 5.5 ppm is H3, which is coupled to H2 (J=16) and the two H's on C4 (CH2-OAc), leading to a doublet of doublets or a triplet.

But in the data, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of something, which could be a doublet of doublets or a triplet.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 5.5 ppm peak is an allylic proton. For example, a CH2 group next to the double bond. But the data says it's 1H, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, the 5.5 ppm could be a vinylic proton that's also adjacent to a CH2 group, leading to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that one vinylic proton is coupled to another, and also to a CH group, leading to a doublet of doublets.

But I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Let me look for another angle.

The acetate methyl group is at 2.1 ppm, as expected. The 1.6 ppm is a doublet of 3H, which is a methyl group attached to a CH group, perhaps adjacent to a double bond.

In CH2=CHCH(CH3)2-OAc, the CH(CH3)2 group would have a CH group attached to two methyl groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl), but that would have only one vinylic proton. But in the NMR, there are two signals in the vinyl region, so that can't be.

Thus, the correct structure must have two vinylic protons, which implies a butenyl group.

So the options are A and D.

Now, the coupling between the vinylic protons is J=16 Hz, which is indicative of a trans configuration (since cis would typically have a smaller coupling, around 10 Hz, but I'm not entirely sure).

Wait, actually, the coupling constant J for trans vinylic protons is larger than for cis. So J=16 Hz suggests a trans configuration.

So trans-butenyl acetate (option D) would have the substituents on opposite sides, leading to a larger J.

In the NMR, each vinylic proton would be a doublet. But why do we have two different signals (7.0 and 5.5)?

Perhaps because the two vinylic protons are in different environments due to the substituents on either end of the double bond. For example, one end has an ethyl group (CH2CH2-OAc) and the other end has a methyl group or something else.

Wait, but in butenyl acetate, both ends are similar. Wait, no, in but-2-enyl acetate, the substituents on the double bond would be CH2 and CH2-OAc.

Wait, in the structure CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, the substituents on the double bond are CH2 (from C1) and CH2-OAc (from C4). So for trans configuration, these substituents are on opposite sides.

So the vinylic protons H2 and H3 would be on opposite sides, leading to a larger J (16 Hz).

Each of these protons would be in a different environment. H2 is attached to a CH2 group (C1), and H3 is attached to a CH2-OAc group (C4). So their chemical shifts would be different.

H2 would be more deshielded (higher ppm) because it's next to a CH2 group, perhaps leading to a downfield shift. H3 would be next to a CH2-OAc group, which is more electronegative, so perhaps also deshielded.

In the NMR, H2 could appear at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), and H3 at 5.5 ppm (dq, J=16 and perhaps other couplings).

Alternatively, perhaps H3 is coupled to H2 (J=16) and also to the two H's on C4 (CH2-OAc), leading to a doublet of doublets or a triplet.

But in the data, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets, which suggests coupling with two different sets of protons. Maybe it's coupled to H2 (J=16) and two H's on C4 (each with J around 2 Hz), making it a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

But the data says it's a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, perhaps the splitting is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is a proton that's coupled to two different protons with different J values. For example, coupling with H2 (J=16) and another proton with J=2, leading to a doublet of doublets, which could appear as a quartet if the couplings are similar, but not necessarily.

But I'm not sure. Let's try to match the options.

If the structure is trans-butenyl acetate (option D), then the NMR would show two vinylic protons as doublets (each coupling with J=16 Hz). One is at 7.0 ppm, the other at 5.5 ppm. The 5.5 ppm could also be coupled to the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a more complex splitting.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, in the structure CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, the end groups are CH2 and CH2-OAc. So the CH2 groups are on either end. Thus, the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would have protons that are allylic. But in the NMR, there's a signal at 5.5 ppm, which could be an allylic CH2.

Wait, but the 5.5 ppm is 1H, so it can't be a CH2 group. So this line of thought is probably incorrect.

Another possibility: perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2-OAc)-CH3. No, that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc. But that would be a branching, which isn't suggested by the options.

Wait, let me think about the 1.6 ppm signal again. It's a 3H doublet. So the H's are attached to a CH group which is adjacent to another CH group. For example, the structure could have a CH(CH3) group adjacent to a double bond.

So something like CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. In this case, the CH(CH3) group would have its H's as a doublet because the CH is adjacent to the double bond's CH2 group.

Wait, but that would give a CH(CH3) with two H's on the CH, but the NMR shows 3H as a doublet. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc with a CH3 group attached to the CH2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to summarize:

- The NMR has two vinylic protons (7.0 and 5.5 ppm), each as a doublet or more split.

- The 1.6 ppm is a 3H doublet, suggests a methyl attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH.

- The 2.1 ppm is the acetate methyl.

So perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. Let me check that.

In this structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C3 is CH(CH3), attached to OAc.

So the vinylic protons are on C2 (H2) and C1 (H1, but C1 is CH2, so two H's).

Wait, no, in CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 is CH2, so two H's. C2 is CH, so one H.

So the vinylic protons would be the H on C2 and the two H's on C1. But that can't be right because the H's on C1 (CH2) are not vinylic; they're adjacent to the double bond.

So in this structure, the vinylic proton is only on C2 (H2), and the H's on C1 (CH2) are allylic.

So the NMR would show H2 as a doublet (coupled with H's on C1, perhaps), and the H's on C1 as a quartet or triplet.

But the data shows two vinylic protons, so this can't be the structure.

Thus, I'm back to thinking the structure is butenyl acetate with two vinylic protons.

So with the NMR data as given, the correct structure is trans-butenyl acetate (option D), as the J=16 Hz indicates trans coupling, and the two vinylic protons would appear as doublets in the NMR spectrum at different chemical shifts.

Thus, the answer should be D) Trans-butenyl acetate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-propenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**  
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**  
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**  
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**  

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H)** corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate ester (-COOCH3), which is a characteristic signal for acetates.

2. **The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H)** suggests a methyl group attached to a CH group, which is likely adjacent to a double bond (allylic position).

3. **The 7.0 ppm doublet (1H, J = 16.0 Hz)** indicates a vinylic proton coupled to another vinylic proton with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), typical of a trans configuration across a double bond.

4. **The 5.5 ppm doublet of quadruplets (1H)** suggests another vinylic proton that is coupled to both the trans vinylic proton (J = 16 Hz) and possibly other protons, such as allylic protons.

### Elimination of Options:
- **Cis-Propenyl Acetate and Cis-Butenyl Acetate**: These would have smaller coupling constants (J < 10 Hz) for vinylic protons due to the cis configuration, which is inconsistent with the observed J = 16 Hz.

- **Trans-Propenyl Acetate**: Propenyl acetate has only one vinylic proton, which contradicts the presence of two distinct signals in the vinyl region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm). Thus, this option is eliminated.

- **Trans-Butenyl Acetate**: This structure has two vinylic protons on opposite sides of the double bond, leading to a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz). The two vinylic protons would appear as doublets in the NMR spectrum, consistent with the observed data. The 5.5 ppm signal can be explained by additional coupling of one vinylic proton to allylic protons.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data is consistent with **Trans-Butenyl Acetate**, as it explains the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), the presence of two vinylic protons, and the splitting patterns observed in the spectrum.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, let me think. The question is about identifying an organic compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are four different types of propenyl or butenyl acetates—cis and trans for both. 

First, I'll try to understand the structure of each possible compound. Acetates are esters, so their general structure is R-O-CO-O-R, wait no, wait. Wait, acetate is an ester where the acid is acetic acid. So the structure would be R-O-CO-CH3, right? Or wait, no, wait. Acetate esters have the formula R-O-COCH3. So the R group is the alkyl or alkenyl group attached to the oxygen.

The compounds in the options are either propenyl or butenyl acetates. Let me recall: propenyl would be CH2CH2CH2- but wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- group. Wait, no, wait. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but that's allyl, I think. Or wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-? Wait, no, actually, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, but I might be getting confused. Wait, no. Propenyl would have three carbons, with a double bond. So propenyl is like CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH=CH2? Wait no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent. Or perhaps CH3CH=CH-? Or maybe I should draw them out.

Wait, but the options are propenyl and butenyl. Propenyl is an allyl group, which is CH2=CHCH2-. But the substituent in the ester would be attached to the oxygen. So for propenyl acetate, it's OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3, so R is the propenyl group. So for propenyl acetate, R is CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, I think I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structures of each option:

- Cis-propenyl acetate: The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-? Or is it CH2CH=CH-OAc? Wait, wait. Wait, propenyl group is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. So I think the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But for the cis and trans, that would refer to substituents on the double bond. Wait, but wait, propenyl has three carbons. So perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc for propenyl acetate. But wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the ester would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, but wait—what about the substituents on the double bond? For cis and trans, the groups on either side of the double bond would be arranged. So for propenyl acetate, the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But that would be trans if the substituents on either side are opposite. Or wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe I should think about the actual structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the structure of the ester. Let's say the acetate is OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group. So for propenyl acetate, R is -CH2-CH=CH2? Or is it -CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere else?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituents. Let me try to imagine the structure of each option.

Wait, another approach: the NMR spectrum given is:

7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J=16 Hz.

5.5 ppm: 1H, dq (doublet of quadruplets? Or maybe doublet of something else. Not sure. Alternatively, it's a doublet with coupling to two different sets of protons.)

2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet. That's probably the acetate methyl group (COOCH3), which is usually around 2.0-2.2 ppm as a singlet.

1.6 ppm: 3H, d. That's a triplet? Wait, no, it's a doublet. So a doublet of 3H. That would be a methyl group attached to something. Since it's a doublet, perhaps it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Or maybe a methyl attached to a CH which is adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which is a large coupling. That suggests a trans coupling, perhaps between two protons across a double bond. So maybe this is a vinylic proton (on a double bond) that's coupled to another vinylic proton.

In the case of an ester with a propenyl group, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that would make the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, so the substituents on the double bond would be a CH2- group and a CH2-OAc group on one side, and on the other, perhaps a hydrogen. Wait, no, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not a double bond. Wait, no, but the options are propenyl and butenyl, which have double bonds.

Wait, let me go back. The given NMR has a peak at 7.0 ppm, which is a doublet. That's a downfield shift, likely a vinylic proton. So the molecule has a double bond with two protons that are split into a doublet. Wait, but with J=16 Hz, which is a large coupling, typical for trans coupling in double bonds.

So perhaps the structure has a double bond with two protons that are trans, such as in a trans configuration. So when you have a trans double bond, the protons on each end are on opposite sides, so they can couple with each other with a larger coupling constant (like 16 Hz), which is typical for trans coupling in alkenes.

Wait, but wait, in a trans configuration, the protons are on opposite sides. So in the case of a double bond with two substituents on either side, like in CH2=CH, but wait, perhaps I need to think of a more substituted double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl acetate). Or maybe it's CH2CH2CH2-OAc but that's not right. Wait, no, wait: propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, another thought: the 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets? Or a doublet with some splitting. Maybe it's a triplet. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl proton that's coupled to two other sets of protons.

Wait, let's think about the propenyl group. If the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the protons on the double bond would be on C1 and C2. So the CH2=CHCH2-OAc would have a structure like OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that's not right because propenyl has a double bond.

Wait, no, the correct structure for propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. So the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, attached to the oxygen of the acetate.

In that structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, no, that can't be right because CH2=CHCH2-O would have the double bond between C1 and C2, with CH2-O on one end and CH2 on the other. Wait, perhaps I need to draw it.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that can't be right because that's a single bond. Oh wait, no, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, no, that would give CH2=CHCH2-OAc, which is correct.

So in that structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, so the double bond is between the second and third carbons of the propenyl group.

Wait, no, perhaps the propenyl group is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the CH2-OAc on the C3.

In that structure, the protons on the double bond (C1 and C2) would be vinylic. The C2 is attached to a CH2-OAc group, and the C1 is attached to a CH2-.

Wait, but in that case, the vinylic protons are on C1 and C2. Let me think about their NMR shifts.

Protons on double bonds typically show up in the range of 4.5-7 ppm, depending on substitution and neighboring groups. So the 7.0 ppm peak is probably one of those vinylic protons.

Looking back at the NMR data:

7.0 ppm: 1H, d, J=16.0 Hz. So this is a doublet, which suggests that this proton is coupled to one other proton. The coupling constant is 16 Hz, which is a large value, typical for trans coupling across a double bond.

The 5.5 ppm: 1H, dq. Hmm, a doublet of quadruplets? Or a doublet with some other splitting. Wait, maybe it's more like a doublet of triplets? Or perhaps it's a doublet that's further split into a quartet. Alternatively, it's a doublet because of coupling with two different sets of protons.

Wait, perhaps the two vinylic protons are each coupled to each other (J=16 Hz) and perhaps one of them is also coupled to another set of protons, like the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but in the structure I was considering (CH2=CHCH2-OAc), the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the protons on C1 (let's say H1) and C2 (H2) are each attached to their respective carbons.

H1 is on C1 (CH2=), so it's a CH2 group. Wait, no, wait. Let me write it correctly.

Wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-CH3.

So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are two H's and a CH2 group. On C2, we have a CH2 group (from CH2-OAc) and two H's on C2? No, wait: no, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. So C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, and C3 is CH2.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me number the propenyl group:

1   2   3
CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

So C1: CH2, attached to C2 (double bond).

C2: CH, attached to C1 and C3 (which is CH2-OAc).

Wait, but that would make C2 a CH group with a double bond to C1 and a single bond to C3.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

In that structure, the vinylic protons would be on C2 (since C1 is CH2, so two H's; C2 is CH, so one H). Wait, no, wait: C1 is CH2, so two H's attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 is single bonded to C3 (CH2-OAc). So the vinylic protons would be on C2, but that's only one H? Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I got the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere else. Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc but with a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the propenyl group is CH2CH=CH-OAc. So the structure is CH2-CH=CH-OAc. Wait, but that would be CH2CH=CHOAc, which is CH2CH=CH-O-CO-CH3.

In that case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. So C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, and C3 is CH-OAc. So the vinylic protons would be on C2 and C3. But wait, C3 is attached to the oxygen, so perhaps it's a CH2-O group. Wait, no, if the structure is CH2-CH=CH-OAc, then the double bond is between C2 and C3. So C3 is CH-OAc, so it has one H. C2 is CH, so also one H. So in this case, the vinylic protons are H on C2 and H on C3.

So the two vinylic protons would be on C2 and C3.

In the NMR, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet, which suggests that each vinylic proton is coupled to another. If the structure is trans, then the coupling would be larger (like J=16 Hz). So perhaps the two vinylic protons are trans to each other. But wait, in the propenyl group as CH2-CH=CH-OAc, the C2 and C3 would be in a trans configuration?

Wait, maybe I should think about the diastereotopic groups. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there's only one vinylic proton, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the butenyl group is considered. Let me think about butenyl acetate.

Butenyl is four carbons, so butenyl acetate would have the structure CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. Or perhaps CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond somewhere else.

Wait, but butenyl could have the double bond at either position. For example, 1-propenyl (but-1-enyl) would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, butenyl could be 1,3-diene, but I think butenyl refers to a four-carbon chain with a double bond between C1 and C2 (but-1-enyl) or between C2 and C3 (but-2-enyl).

So, the options include cis and trans for both propenyl and butenyl acetates.

Now, looking at the NMR data again:

1H NMR:

7.0 (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz) → likely a vinylic proton, coupled to another vinylic proton with large J (trans).

5.5 (1H, dq) → perhaps another vinylic proton with more complex splitting, or maybe an allylic proton.

2.1 (3H, s) → acetate methyl group.

1.6 (3H, d) → another methyl group, perhaps attached to a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond.

So let's think about the possible structures.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc (cis would mean that the substituents on the double bond are on the same side. But in this structure, the substituents are CH2 and CH2-OAc. Wait, in CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the substituents on the double bond are a CH2 group (on C1) and a CH2-OAc group (on C2). So in this case, the substituents on the double bond are both CH2 groups, but that doesn't introduce cis or trans isomerism because the substituents are the same on both sides. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, no, wait. If the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, and C3 is CH2-OAc. So the substituents on the double bond are C1 (CH2-) and C2 (CH-CH2-OAc). Wait, but both substituents are CH2 groups? Or perhaps not. Because for the double bond, each carbon is bonded to two substituents. So C1 is bonded to two H's and a CH2 group. C2 is bonded to one H and a CH2-OAc group. So for the double bond in CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, the substituents on C1 are H and H, and on C2, it's H and CH2-OAc. So no possibility for cis or trans isomerism here, because the substituents are not all different. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Alternatively, perhaps the propenyl group is in a different arrangement. Maybe the structure is CH2CH=CH-OAc, which would have the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2-CH=CH-OAc. In this case, the substituents on the double bond are CH2 (from C1) and OAc (from C3). So in this case, the substituents on either side of the double bond are CH2 and OAc. So if the substituents on the same side, it would be cis, and opposite would be trans.

So for cis-propenyl acetate, the CH2 group (C1) and the OAc group (C3) are on the same side of the double bond.

In that case, the two vinylic protons (on C2 and C3?) would be on the same side, leading to a coupling between them. But wait, in this structure, the double bond is between C2 and C3. C2 is CH, and C3 is CH-OAc. So the structure is CH2-CH=CH-OAc. So the substituents on C2 (the double bond) are CH2 (from C1) and CH-OAc (from C3). So the substituents on the double bond are CH2 and OAc (through the CH). So for cis, the CH2 and OAc are on the same side.

So the vinylic protons would be on C2 and C3. Wait, but C3 is connected to OAc, so it's a CH-OAc group, which has one H. And C2 is a CH group, also with one H.

So in the NMR, you would have two protons on the double bond. Each would couple with the other. So each would be a doublet. But in the given data, at 7.0 ppm, there's a doublet. At 5.5 ppm, another proton (maybe another vinylic, but as a doublet of some sort).

Wait, but the NMR data shows two different protons in the vinyl region: one at 7.0 as a doublet, and another at 5.5 as a doublet of something. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps that's not the case. Let me think about the coupling.

In CH2-CH=CH-OAc, the protons on C2 and C3 would be on adjacent carbons. The proton on C2 (let's call it H2) is attached to C2, which is double bonded to C3. The proton on C3 (H3) is attached to C3, which is single bonded to OAc. So H2 and H3 are on adjacent carbons but not on the same double bond. Wait, no, H2 is on C2, which is double bonded to C3. So H2 is a vinylic proton, and H3 is also a vinylic proton because it's attached to C3, which is double bonded to C2.

So both H2 and H3 are vinylic. Each would be coupled to each other (J=16 Hz) if they are trans. If they are cis, the coupling would be smaller, but wait, in reality, the coupling between adjacent vinylic protons can be around 10-18 Hz. So the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16, which is trans.

So if the structure is CH2-CH=CH-OAc, and the substituents are trans, then the H2 and H3 would be trans, leading to a large coupling (J=16 Hz). So each would be a doublet.

But in the NMR, do they appear as two separate doublets or as a multiplet? In the data, there's a peak at 7.0 (1H, d), another at 5.5 (1H, dq).

Hmm, perhaps the structure is such that one of the vinylic protons is split into a doublet, and the other is split into a more complex pattern because it's coupled to another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a butenyl group, which has a longer chain, allowing for different coupling patterns.

Let me think about butenyl acetate. Suppose the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (but-1-enyl acetate). Then the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on the double bond would be CH3 (if it's butenyl) – wait, no, butenyl is four carbons, so CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

In this structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents are CH2CH2OAc on C2 and CH3 on C1? No, wait, no.

Wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So but-1-enyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-.

So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3.

In this case, the vinylic protons are on C1 and C2. C1 has two H's (CH2=), and C2 has two H's (CH2CH2OAc). Wait, no, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2CH2CH=CH-OAc. No, butenyl is four carbons, so butenyl could be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but but-2-enyl would be CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OAc. So the structure is CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc.

In this structure, the double bond is between C2 and C3 (but-2-enyl). Each of these carbons has substituents. C2 is bonded to CH2- and CH=, and C3 is bonded to CH- and CH2-OAc.

So the substituents on the double bond are CH2 (from C1) and CH2-OAc (from C4). So for cis or trans, the substituents can be on the same or opposite sides.

In this case, the vinylic protons are on C2 and C3. Each has two substituents. Let me think about the NMR.

In the case of trans butenyl acetate, the substituents (CH2 from C1 and CH2-OAc from C4) are on opposite sides. So the protons on C2 and C3 would be trans to each other, leading to a large J coupling (like 16 Hz).

In the NMR, each vinylic proton would be a doublet, but perhaps one of them is also coupled to another set of protons, like the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, in the data, at 7.0 ppm, it's a doublet (J=16). At 5.5, it's a doublet of quadruplets, perhaps. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm peak is an allylic proton, like a CH2 group next to the double bond.

Wait, let me think again.

The 1H NMR data:

- 7.0 ppm: 1H, d, J=16.0 Hz → likely a vinylic proton with one coupling.

- 5.5 ppm: 1H, dq → perhaps another vinylic proton with more complex coupling.

- 2.1 ppm: 3H, s → acetate methyl.

- 1.6 ppm: 3H, d → a methyl group adjacent to a CH group.

So, the 1.6 ppm doublet of 3H suggests a methyl attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH group, perhaps part of a double bond.

Wait, methyl groups adjacent to a double bond are often deshielded and appear around 1.6 ppm, especially if they are allylic.

So perhaps the structure has a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group, which is part of a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)2-OAc? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a CH which is part of a double bond.

Hmm. Let's think about the possible structures again.

If the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl), then the vinylic protons would be on the CH2=CH- part. So the H's on the CH2 would be at a lower ppm. Wait, but the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, so perhaps that's the H on the CH group.

Wait, perhaps in the structure, the CH2 is next to the double bond. For example, in CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the CH2 next to the double bond would have protons that are split into a doublet of quartets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (butenyl), with the double bond at position 1.

In that case, the CH2= would have two H's, and the adjacent CH2 would have two H's as well. The CH2 next to the double bond would be split by the neighboring double bond's protons.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc (butenyl), with the double bond between C2 and C3.

In this structure, the CH2 groups on either side would have protons that are split due to coupling with the vinylic protons.

But going back to the NMR data, the 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) could be a proton that's coupled to two different sets of protons.

Another approach: perhaps the structure is such that the 7.0 ppm proton is on a double bond, and the 5.5 ppm is an allylic proton.

Wait, allylic protons typically appear between 4.5-5.5 ppm, depending on substitution. So maybe the 5.5 ppm is an allylic proton, and the 7.0 is a vinylic.

So, if the structure has a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond, the CH2 protons would be allylic and appear around 5.5 ppm, perhaps as a doublet or a multiplet.

Wait, but in the data, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the CH2 is on either end. So for butenyl acetate (but-2-enyl), the structure is CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc.

In this case, the CH2 groups on C1 and C4 would have protons that are allylic to the double bond, and the protons on C2 and C3 (the vinylic ones) would be split into doublets.

So the vinylic protons on C2 and C3 (each attached to CH) would be each a doublet due to coupling with each other (J=16 Hz), and perhaps each is also coupled to the neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, but the NMR data shows only two signals in the vinyl region: 7.0 and 5.5 ppm. So perhaps one of the vinylic protons is split into a more complex pattern.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of unique proton environments.

In the structure CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc (but-2-enyl acetate):

- C1: CH2, which is attached to C2 (CH).

- C2: CH, attached to C1 (CH2) and C3 (CH).

- C3: CH, attached to C2 (CH) and C4 (CH2-OAc).

- C4: CH2-OAc.

So the vinylic protons are on C2 and C3. These are each CH groups, each with one proton.

Since the double bond is between C2 and C3, if the substituents are trans, then the protons on C2 and C3 would be on opposite sides, leading to a large coupling (J=16 Hz) between them.

So each of these vinylic protons would be a doublet (coupled to each other), but perhaps each is also coupled to the adjacent CH2 groups.

So the proton on C2 (H2) would be coupled to H3 (on C3), and also to the two protons on C1 (H1a and H1b). Similarly, H3 would be coupled to H2 and the two H's on C4 (H4a and H4b).

Wait, but the H2 and H3 are each only attached to one CH2 group (on C1 and C4, respectively). So H2 is adjacent to C1 (CH2) and C3 (CH). H3 is adjacent to C2 (CH) and C4 (CH2).

So in the NMR, H2 would couple with H3 (J=16 Hz) and also with the two H's on C1 (which are each J around 2-3 Hz for allylic coupling). Similarly, H3 would couple with H2 (J=16 Hz) and the two H's on C4 (J around 2-3 Hz).

So for H2, it's a doublet from H3 and perhaps a triplet from the two H's on C1. But wait, the coupling to the two H's on C1 would be similar, so the splitting would be a triplet. So H2's peak would split into a doublet of triplets. But in the data, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, and 5.5 is a doublet of something.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling between H2 and the CH2 groups is small and may not split the peaks significantly.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that one of the vinylic protons is also coupled to another proton, leading to a doublet of doublets.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see the options again.

The options are A) Cis-butenyl acetate, B) Trans-propenyl acetate, C) Cis-propenyl acetate, D) Trans-butenyl acetate.

So, let's think about the number of vinylic protons in each structure.

Propenyl acetate (CH2=CHCH2-OAc) has two vinylic protons on C2 (since C1 is CH2, which has two H's, and C2 is CH, which has one H attached to the double bond). Wait, no—C2 in propenyl would be CH, so one H, which is vinylic. C3 is CH2-OAc, so no H on the double bond. So only one vinylic proton in propenyl acetate.

Wait, that can't be right. Because in CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2, which is not vinylic, and C2 is CH, which has one H attached to the double bond. So only one vinylic proton.

But in the NMR data, there are two signals in the vinyl region (7.0 and 5.5 ppm). So if the structure has only one vinylic proton, how come there are two signals? That suggests that there are two different vinylic protons, which would only happen in a structure with two vinylic protons, like butenyl acetate.

So if the structure is butenyl acetate, which has two vinylic protons, that would explain the two signals in the NMR.

So the options with butenyl are A and D: Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate.

Now, considering that, let's think about the coupling.

In trans-butenyl acetate, the substituents on the double bond would be on opposite sides. So the two vinylic protons would be trans to each other, resulting in a large coupling (J=16 Hz). So each would be a doublet.

In the NMR data, one of these protons is at 7.0 ppm (doublet, J=16), and the other at 5.5 ppm (dq). So the 7.0 ppm is a clean doublet, perhaps due to only coupling with the other vinylic proton. The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets or something else, meaning it has more than one coupling.

But why is the 5.5 ppm signal a doublet of quadruplets? Maybe because the proton is also coupled to two other sets of protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm proton is also adjacent to a CH2 group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, in the butenyl structure, let's say the structure is CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc. Then the vinylic protons are on C2 (H2) and C3 (H3). H2 is attached to C2, which is next to C1 (CH2). H3 is attached to C3, next to C4 (CH2-OAc).

So H2 would be coupled to H3 (J=16 Hz) and to the two H's on C1 (each with J around 2-3 Hz). So H2's signal would split into a doublet of triplets or a triplet of doublets, but in the data, it's a clean doublet at 7.0 ppm.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the 5.5 ppm proton is a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, but CH2 groups adjacent to double bonds (allylic) usually have their protons around 4.5-5.5 ppm. So the 5.5 ppm peak could be an allylic CH2.

But the data says it's 1H, so a single proton, which doesn't fit a CH2 group.

Wait, but the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of something (dq). So maybe it's a CH group next to a double bond, and it's coupled to two other protons.

Wait, another possibility: the structure has a CH that's adjacent to a double bond and a CH2. So the CH proton would be split by coupling with the double bond protons and the CH2 protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3-OAc, but that's not one of the options. So probably not.

Wait, another angle: the 1.6 ppm signal is a doublet of 3H. So a methyl group attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH group.

So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)2-OAc. No, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, the structure could be CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. Wait, but that's a branching. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's butenyl.

Wait, let me think about the butenyl acetate. If the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, then the vinylic protons are on C1 and C2. C1 is CH2, so two H's, and C2 is CH2, two H's. Wait, no, that's not right. The double bond would be between C1 and C2, making them CH and CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. No, because that would make C1: CH2 (double bond), C2: CH2 (single bond). Wait, no, in CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so C1 is CH2 and C2 is CH2. Wait, no, CH2= would be C1: CH2, double bonded to C2: CH2? No, that's impossible because a double bond requires two substituents on each carbon.

Wait, no, a double bond is between two carbons, each with two substituents. So in CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, C1 is CH2, C2 is CH2. No, wait, no. The correct structure for but-1-enyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, which would make C1: CH2, double bonded to C2: CH2. Wait, that's not possible, because CH2=CH would require C1 to have a double bond to C2, each with two substituents.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: let's think about the splitting patterns.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (J=16 Hz), so this proton is coupled to one other proton with J=16. The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets (or some other splitting), so it's coupled to two different sets of protons.

If the structure is trans-butenyl acetate (option D), the vinylic protons would be trans, so each would be a doublet. The protons adjacent to the double bond (CH2 groups) would be allylic and split into multiplets.

In trans-butenyl acetate (CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, trans configuration), the vinylic protons (H2 and H3) are on opposite sides. Each of these would couple with each other (J=16 Hz), and each would also couple with the adjacent CH2 groups.

So H2 is on C2, which is adjacent to C1 (CH2) and C3 (CH). H3 is on C3, adjacent to C2 (CH) and C4 (CH2-OAc).

Thus, H2 would be coupled to H3 (J=16) and the two H's on C1 (J around 2-3 Hz each). Similarly, H3 would be coupled to H2 (J=16) and the two H's on C4 (J around 2-3 Hz each).

So for H2, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets (from coupling with H3 and the two H's on C1), but the data shows a clean doublet at 7.0. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling to the CH2 groups is not observed due to being too small or because they are equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the vinylic protons is coupled only to the other vinylic proton, leading to a doublet, while the other is coupled to both the vinylic and the adjacent CH2 groups, leading to a more complex splitting.

So, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is H2, which is coupled only to H3 (J=16), and the 5.5 ppm is H3, which is coupled to H2 (J=16) and the two H's on C4 (CH2-OAc), leading to a doublet of doublets or a triplet.

But in the data, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of something, which could be a doublet of doublets or a triplet.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 5.5 ppm peak is an allylic proton. For example, a CH2 group next to the double bond. But the data says it's 1H, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, the 5.5 ppm could be a vinylic proton that's also adjacent to a CH2 group, leading to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that one vinylic proton is coupled to another, and also to a CH group, leading to a doublet of doublets.

But I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Let me look for another angle.

The acetate methyl group is at 2.1 ppm, as expected. The 1.6 ppm is a doublet of 3H, which is a methyl group attached to a CH group, perhaps adjacent to a double bond.

In CH2=CHCH(CH3)2-OAc, the CH(CH3)2 group would have a CH group attached to two methyl groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl), but that would have only one vinylic proton. But in the NMR, there are two signals in the vinyl region, so that can't be.

Thus, the correct structure must have two vinylic protons, which implies a butenyl group.

So the options are A and D.

Now, the coupling between the vinylic protons is J=16 Hz, which is indicative of a trans configuration (since cis would typically have a smaller coupling, around 10 Hz, but I'm not entirely sure).

Wait, actually, the coupling constant J for trans vinylic protons is larger than for cis. So J=16 Hz suggests a trans configuration.

So trans-butenyl acetate (option D) would have the substituents on opposite sides, leading to a larger J.

In the NMR, each vinylic proton would be a doublet. But why do we have two different signals (7.0 and 5.5)?

Perhaps because the two vinylic protons are in different environments due to the substituents on either end of the double bond. For example, one end has an ethyl group (CH2CH2-OAc) and the other end has a methyl group or something else.

Wait, but in butenyl acetate, both ends are similar. Wait, no, in but-2-enyl acetate, the substituents on the double bond would be CH2 and CH2-OAc.

Wait, in the structure CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, the substituents on the double bond are CH2 (from C1) and CH2-OAc (from C4). So for trans configuration, these substituents are on opposite sides.

So the vinylic protons H2 and H3 would be on opposite sides, leading to a larger J (16 Hz).

Each of these protons would be in a different environment. H2 is attached to a CH2 group (C1), and H3 is attached to a CH2-OAc group (C4). So their chemical shifts would be different.

H2 would be more deshielded (higher ppm) because it's next to a CH2 group, perhaps leading to a downfield shift. H3 would be next to a CH2-OAc group, which is more electronegative, so perhaps also deshielded.

In the NMR, H2 could appear at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), and H3 at 5.5 ppm (dq, J=16 and perhaps other couplings).

Alternatively, perhaps H3 is coupled to H2 (J=16) and also to the two H's on C4 (CH2-OAc), leading to a doublet of doublets or a triplet.

But in the data, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets, which suggests coupling with two different sets of protons. Maybe it's coupled to H2 (J=16) and two H's on C4 (each with J around 2 Hz), making it a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

But the data says it's a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, perhaps the splitting is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is a proton that's coupled to two different protons with different J values. For example, coupling with H2 (J=16) and another proton with J=2, leading to a doublet of doublets, which could appear as a quartet if the couplings are similar, but not necessarily.

But I'm not sure. Let's try to match the options.

If the structure is trans-butenyl acetate (option D), then the NMR would show two vinylic protons as doublets (each coupling with J=16 Hz). One is at 7.0 ppm, the other at 5.5 ppm. The 5.5 ppm could also be coupled to the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a more complex splitting.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, in the structure CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, the end groups are CH2 and CH2-OAc. So the CH2 groups are on either end. Thus, the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would have protons that are allylic. But in the NMR, there's a signal at 5.5 ppm, which could be an allylic CH2.

Wait, but the 5.5 ppm is 1H, so it can't be a CH2 group. So this line of thought is probably incorrect.

Another possibility: perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2-OAc)-CH3. No, that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc. But that would be a branching, which isn't suggested by the options.

Wait, let me think about the 1.6 ppm signal again. It's a 3H doublet. So the H's are attached to a CH group which is adjacent to another CH group. For example, the structure could have a CH(CH3) group adjacent to a double bond.

So something like CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. In this case, the CH(CH3) group would have its H's as a doublet because the CH is adjacent to the double bond's CH2 group.

Wait, but that would give a CH(CH3) with two H's on the CH, but the NMR shows 3H as a doublet. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc with a CH3 group attached to the CH2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to summarize:

- The NMR has two vinylic protons (7.0 and 5.5 ppm), each as a doublet or more split.

- The 1.6 ppm is a 3H doublet, suggests a methyl attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH.

- The 2.1 ppm is the acetate methyl.

So perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. Let me check that.

In this structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C3 is CH(CH3), attached to OAc.

So the vinylic protons are on C2 (H2) and C1 (H1, but C1 is CH2, so two H's).

Wait, no, in CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 is CH2, so two H's. C2 is CH, so one H.

So the vinylic protons would be the H on C2 and the two H's on C1. But that can't be right because the H's on C1 (CH2) are not vinylic; they're adjacent to the double bond.

So in this structure, the vinylic proton is only on C2 (H2), and the H's on C1 (CH2) are allylic.

So the NMR would show H2 as a doublet (coupled with H's on C1, perhaps), and the H's on C1 as a quartet or triplet.

But the data shows two vinylic protons, so this can't be the structure.

Thus, I'm back to thinking the structure is butenyl acetate with two vinylic protons.

So with the NMR data as given, the correct structure is trans-butenyl acetate (option D), as the J=16 Hz indicates trans coupling, and the two vinylic protons would appear as doublets in the NMR spectrum at different chemical shifts.

Thus, the answer should be D) Trans-butenyl acetate.


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-propenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**  
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**  
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**  
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**  

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H)** corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate ester (-COOCH3), which is a characteristic signal for acetates.

2. **The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H)** suggests a methyl group attached to a CH group, which is likely adjacent to a double bond (allylic position).

3. **The 7.0 ppm doublet (1H, J = 16.0 Hz)** indicates a vinylic proton coupled to another vinylic proton with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), typical of a trans configuration across a double bond.

4. **The 5.5 ppm doublet of quadruplets (1H)** suggests another vinylic proton that is coupled to both the trans vinylic proton (J = 16 Hz) and possibly other protons, such as allylic protons.

### Elimination of Options:
- **Cis-Propenyl Acetate and Cis-Butenyl Acetate**: These would have smaller coupling constants (J < 10 Hz) for vinylic protons due to the cis configuration, which is inconsistent with the observed J = 16 Hz.

- **Trans-Propenyl Acetate**: Propenyl acetate has only one vinylic proton, which contradicts the presence of two distinct signals in the vinyl region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm). Thus, this option is eliminated.

- **Trans-Butenyl Acetate**: This structure has two vinylic protons on opposite sides of the double bond, leading to a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz). The two vinylic protons would appear as doublets in the NMR spectrum, consistent with the observed data. The 5.5 ppm signal can be explained by additional coupling of one vinylic proton to allylic protons.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data is consistent with **Trans-Butenyl Acetate**, as it explains the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), the presence of two vinylic protons, and the splitting patterns observed in the spectrum.
