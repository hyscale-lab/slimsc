Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So, the supernova occurred in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame?

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the reference frames here. So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at some speed. But from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Oh right, because in an inertial frame, if object A is moving towards object B at speed v in A's frame, then in B's frame, A is moving towards it at speed v as well. Because the frames are inertial, right? So perhaps the speed is the same in both frames when they're moving towards each other.

Wait, no, that's only if they're moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, but wait, 60,000 km/s is like a fifth the speed of light. Because the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 2e5 km/s, which is 0.2c.

Wait, but in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh wait, the question says both are inertial frames, so perhaps it's using a Galilean transformation since the speeds are not that high? Or does it require using the Lorentz transformation? Hmm, but 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I think I might need to consider relativistic effects here.

Wait, but the problem is about the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame. So I think I need to find the proper time or something. Wait, no. The question gives 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So I need to find the corresponding time in the galaxy's frame, and then multiply by the speed to get the distance.

Wait, or maybe the other way around. Let me think. Let's say in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. I need to find how much time passes in the galaxy's frame during that same interval. Because the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame would be speed multiplied by the galaxy's frame's time.

Wait, but wait. The ejecta is moving towards the center in the galaxy's frame. From the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at some velocity, say v. So in galaxy frame, the ejecta's velocity is v, so distance is v * t, where t is the time in galaxy frame.

But the problem says, from the ejecta frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's speed is 60,000 km/s. Wait, but in reality, the ejecta's speed in the galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s. Because if the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v in the ejecta's frame, then in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v. So it's a case of relative velocity.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's model this.

Let me denote the galaxy's frame as S and the ejecta's frame as S'. The supernova occurs at the origin of S, perhaps. So in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center (which is at, say, x = 0, and the supernova is at origin x=0, y=0, etc. So the ejecta is moving towards negative x direction? Or maybe positive? Wait, it's moving towards the center, so perhaps S is the galaxy's rest frame, and the ejecta is moving towards x=-infinity, but that's probably not the case. Wait, perhaps the ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center, so in S, the ejecta's velocity is v, say along the x-axis towards the center (let's say negative x direction). So in S, the ejecta's velocity is v = -60,000 km/s? Or wait, let's see.

Wait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame (S'), the center of the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in S', the galaxy's center is approaching at 6e4 km/s. That would mean in S (the galaxy's frame), the ejecta is approaching the center at 6e4 km/s. So the velocity of the ejecta in S is u = 6e4 km/s towards the center.

Wait, but wait, if in S' (ejecta's frame), the center is moving towards the ejecta at 6e4 km/s, then in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 6e4 km/s. Because velocities are symmetric in that way when the frames are moving relative to each other.

Wait, but in reality, you can't just say that because of Galilean addition; you have to consider the direction in which the frames are moving. So perhaps the ejecta is moving at velocity u in S, and the center is moving at velocity u' in S'.

Wait, but since the supernova occurs in the galaxy, perhaps both frames are moving relative to each other. So perhaps the ejecta is moving at velocity u in S, and the frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S along the x-axis.

Wait, maybe the simplest approach is to model it as a relative velocity problem with time dilation.

So, the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame (S' frame), and we need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the S (galaxy) frame during that time. But wait, time in S is different due to time dilation.

Wait, but wait, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity u. So the distance the ejecta travels is u multiplied by the time in S. So I need to find the time in the galaxy's frame, which is S, that corresponds to the 50 seconds in S'.

But wait, time dilation depends on the relative velocity between the frames. So the gamma factor is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)), where v is the relative velocity between S and S'.

Wait, but what is v here? Because in S', the galaxy is moving at 6e4 km/s towards the ejecta. So the relative velocity between the frames is 6e4 km/s. So v is 6e4 km/s.

Wait, but wait, in relativity, the speed of the galaxy in S' is v, so the speed of S' relative to S is v. So considering that, the gamma factor would be 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

So, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

But I need to calculate the time in S. Since in S', the time is 50 seconds, but in S, the time would be longer due to time dilation. So t = gamma * t'.

Wait, but which direction? Because the events happen in such a way that the time in S is the proper time or not.

Wait, the process is that the ejecta is moving, and in its frame, 50 seconds pass. So the time in galaxy's frame would be longer if the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of c.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about which frame is which. Let me think again. S is the galaxy's frame, and S' is the ejecta's frame. The ejecta is moving at velocity u in S. From S', the galaxy is moving towards it at velocity u as well.

Wait, according to the problem statement, from the ejecta's frame, the center of the galaxy is moving towards it at 6e4 km/s. So, in S', the velocity of the galaxy (at rest in S) is u' = +6e4 km/s (towards the ejecta). So, according to S', the galaxy is moving towards it at 6e4 km/s. Therefore, the velocity of S' relative to S is 6e4 km/s towards the ejecta. Wait, no, because in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center (galaxy) at 6e4 km/s. So S' is moving at velocity u = 6e4 km/s relative to S along the x-axis. So in S, the ejecta is moving at u = 6e4 km/s towards the galaxy.

Wait, but then, in S, the galaxy is stationary, and the ejecta is moving towards it. So, in the galaxy's frame (S), the time elapsed during the ejecta's journey is t. But in the ejecta's frame (S'), the time is t' = 50 seconds.

But wait, how do t and t' relate? Using the Lorentz transformation.

Wait, but the events in question are the supernova occurring at the origin in S (so x=0, t=0), and then after some time, the ejecta has moved a certain distance. But wait, no, the ejecta is moving, so the events are the supernova (at origin, t=0) and the ejecta being at position x = d (distance) at time t in S.

In the ejecta's frame, S', the same two events would have a different time and position.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of proper time. The proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the object, which in this case is the ejecta. So the proper time tau (t') is 50 seconds. The distance in the galaxy's frame (d) would be u * t, where u is the speed of the ejecta, and t is the time in S. But t and t' are related by time dilation.

So, t = gamma * t' ?

Wait, but wait, time dilation is such that the moving clock runs slower. So, if t' is the proper time in S', then in S, the time is longer. So yes, t = gamma * t'.

So, let's compute gamma.

v = 6e4 km/s = 60,000 km/s. Let's convert that to meters per second: 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s.

Wait, the speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v is 0.2c (since 6e7 / 3e8 = 0.2). So v=0.2c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) ) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0204.

Wait, let me calculate sqrt(0.96). Let's see, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 is about 1.0204. So gamma is approximately 1.0204.

So, t = gamma * t' = 1.0204 * 50 ≈ 51.02 seconds.

Wait, but wait, no, wait. Because the direction matters. The time in S is the time between the events as measured in S. Let me think about the Lorentz transformation. The Lorentz transformation for time is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c²). But in this case, the event in question is the same starting point. Let me model the events.

In S (galaxy's frame), the supernova occurs at (x=0, t=0). The ejecta, which is moving at velocity u = 6e4 km/s towards the center (so along the negative x direction if the center is at x=0), will be at position x = u * t after time t. So at time t, the ejecta is at x = u * t.

In S' (ejecta's frame), the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at velocity u. So in S', the supernova occurs at x' = 0, t'=0. The center of the galaxy (origin in S) is moving towards the ejecta at u, so at time t', the center is at x' = -u * t'.

Wait, but the ejecta is at rest in S', so the position of the ejecta doesn't change in S'. So in S', when the supernova occurs, the ejecta is at x'=0. But as time progresses, the galaxy (center) moves towards the ejecta, which is at rest. So when the galaxy's center is at x' = -u * t', the ejecta remains at x'=0.

Wait, but the position of the galaxy's center in S' is x' = -u t'.

But in the problem, the question is about the time elapsed in S' being 50 seconds. So the time in S' is t' =50 s. So the corresponding time in S is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c²).

Wait, but in the event where the supernova occurs, x'=0, t'=0. So for that event, t = gamma * t' = gamma * 0 = 0.

Now, after some time t' =50 s in S', what is the position of the galaxy's center in S'? It's x' = -u * t' = -6e4 km/s *50 s. Wait, 6e4 km/s is 6e4 *1e3 m/s. But let's compute it in kilometers.

Wait, 6e4 km/s *50 s = 6e4 *50 = 3e6 km. So x' = -3e6 km.

So, the position in S' is x' = -3e6 km.

Now, how about the time in S? Using the Lorentz transformation:

t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² )

So, let's compute (v x')/c².

v is 6e4 km/s. Wait, but let's convert to m/s for consistency. v = 60,000 km/s = 6e4 *1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s.

x' is -3e6 km = -3e6 *1e3 m = -3e9 m.

So,

(v x')/c² = (6e7 m/s * (-3e9 m)) / (9e16 m²/s²) )

Wait,

(6e7 * (-3e9 )) = -1.8e17 m²/s.

Divide by 9e16 m²/s²:

-1.8e17 /9e16 = -2 s.

So,

t = gamma * (t' + (-2)) )

t' is 50 s, so t = gamma*(50 -2) = gamma *48.

Gamma is approximately 1.0204.

So t ≈1.0204 *48 ≈49.0 seconds.

Wait, that's interesting. So in the galaxy's frame, the time elapsed is about 49 seconds, not 50. But wait, how?

Wait, that seems counterintuitive, because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 6e4 km/s, so the time should be less than in the ejecta's frame because of length contraction? Wait, no, the time between events would depend on the relative motion.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the setup is that the supernova occurs at the origin in S (galaxy frame), and the ejecta is moving towards the center at 6e4 km/s. So in S, the ejecta's position at time t is x = u * t.

In S', the ejecta is at rest, so the position is x' =0, but the galaxy (origin in S) is moving towards the ejecta at speed u.

So, the position of the galaxy's center in S' is x' = -u t' because as time t' increases, the galaxy moves towards the ejecta.

But in the problem, the events are the supernova (t'=0, x'=0) and another event which is the ejecta reaching a certain point. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the events. Let's model it as the event where the ejecta (origin in S') is at rest, and the galaxy's center moves towards it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. The time in the ejecta's frame is t' =50 s. So the question is, what is the distance the ejecta has traveled in S (galaxy frame) during this time.

Wait, but in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity u=6e4 km/s. So, the distance would be u * t, where t is the time in S.

But I need to find t in S corresponding to t'=50 s in S'. But how?

Wait, perhaps using the time dilation formula: t = gamma * t' ?

But earlier, when I used the Lorentz transformation with the specific event, I found that t was 49 s.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the distance the ejecta travels in S (galaxy frame) during the time t. That distance is d = u * t.

But I need to find t, the time in S frame corresponding to the ejecta's frame t' of 50 s.

Wait, perhaps using the relation between the two times. Since the frames are moving relative to each other, the time in S is longer than in S' by a factor of gamma. So t = gamma * t'.

But earlier, when I considered the specific event, the time in S was less than in S' due to some other factors. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the distance is simply u multiplied by t', but adjusted for length contraction or time dilation.

Wait, another approach: the proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the object. So for the ejecta, the proper time is t'=50 s. The time in S (galaxy frame) would be longer because the ejecta is moving. So, t = gamma * t'.

Wait, gamma is approx 1.0204, so t ≈50 *1.0204 ≈51.02 s.

Wait, but then the distance in S would be u * t = 6e4 km/s *51.02 s ≈3,061,200 km. But looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. That's close.

But wait, earlier when I applied the Lorentz transformation, I got t=48.992 s (approx 49.0 s). So the distance would be 6e4 km/s *49 s = 2.94e6 km, which is option A.

Hmm, so which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I applied the Lorentz transformation earlier. Let me think again.

In the supernova's frame (S), the ejecta is moving at u =6e4 km/s. So, in S, the time elapsed for the ejecta to travel a certain distance is t. The ejecta's proper time is t', so t' = t / gamma. Because the proper time is the shortest time between two events.

Wait, I think that's correct. So, t' = t / gamma. So, t = gamma * t'.

So, t = gamma *50 ≈1.0204 *50 ≈51.02 s.

So, the distance in S is u * t = 6e4 km/s * 51.02 s ≈3,061,200 km. Looking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km. That's very close, so perhaps that's the correct answer.

But wait, earlier when I used the Lorentz transformation, I got a different result. Let me see what I did wrong.

Wait, perhaps I confused the direction of the velocity. Let me re-express the Lorentz transformation correctly.

The Lorentz transformation for time is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² )

In the supernova's frame S, the two events are (x=0, t=0) and (x= d, t= t).

In the ejecta's frame S', the two events are (x'=0, t'=0) and (x' =0, t'=50 s) because the ejecta is at rest. So in S', x' remains 0, and the time is 50 s.

So, using the Lorentz transformation:

t = gamma ( t' + (v x')/c^2 )

But x' =0, because in S', the supernova and the ejecta are at the same point. So x' =0.

So, t = gamma * t' = 1.0204 *50 ≈51.02 s.

So, the time in S is approximately 51.02 seconds. Then, the distance d = u * t =6e4 km/s *51.02 s ≈3,061,200 km.

Which is approximately option D, 3,060,000 km. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but why earlier when I considered the position of the galaxy's center in S' did I get a different result? Because in that case, the x' was not zero. Oh, because that scenario was about the galaxy's center moving, not the ejecta's position.

So, in the correct scenario, the two events (supernova and the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame) have x' =0 and t' =50 s. So, in that case, t = gamma * t' ≈51.02 s. So the distance is 6e4 *51.02 ≈3,061,200 km.

But the options don't have exactly that. Option D is 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the approximation in gamma leads to this.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely. Let me compute gamma accurately.

v =6e4 km/s =6e4 *1e3 m/s =6e7 m/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

v²/c² = (6e7)^2 / (3e8)^2 = (3.6e15) / (9e16) ) = 3.6/9e-1 = 0.4e-1=0.04. So, v²/c² =0.04.

So, 1 - 0.04 =0.96.

sqrt(0.96)= approximately 0.9797958971.

So, gamma=1/0.9797958971≈1.020305.

So, t=gamma *50 ≈1.020305 *50≈51.01526 s.

So, d=6e4 km/s *51.01526 s=6e4 *51.01526 km.

Calculating that:

6e4 is 60,000.

60,000 *51.01526 = let's compute 60,000 *50 =3,000,000, and 60,000 *1.01526=60,000 *1=60,000; 60,000 *0.01526= 915.6. So total is 60,000 +915.6=60,915.6.

So, total distance is 3,000,000 +60,915.6=3,060,915.6 km.

Which is approximately 3,060,916 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. So that's the closest.

Wait, but let me check the options again:

Options:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B)3,000,000 km.

C)2,880,000 km.

D)3,060,000 km.

So, 3,060,916 is very close to D, which is 3,060,000.

So the correct answer should be D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame (S) and the ejecta's reference frame (S'). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Relative Velocity and Frames**:  
   In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \). By symmetry of inertial frames, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center at the same speed in the Galaxy's frame (S). Thus, the ejecta's velocity in S is \( u = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \).

2. **Time Dilation**:  
   The problem specifies that \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) passes in the ejecta's frame (S'). Due to time dilation, the time in the Galaxy's frame (S) is longer and related by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]  
   where  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} = 6 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{(6 \times 10^7)^2}{(3 \times 10^8)^2} = 0.04
   \]  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0203
   \]  
   Thus,  
   \[
   t = \gamma t' = 1.0203 \times 50 \approx 51.02 \, \text{s}.
   \]

3. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given by:  
   \[
   d = u \cdot t
   \]  
   Substituting \( u = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t = 51.02 \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   d = 60,000 \times 51.02 \approx 3,061,200 \, \text{km}.
   \]  
   Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is **3,060,000 km**.

4. **Critical Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A (2,940,000 km)**: Too low, as it does not account for the relativistic time dilation factor.  
   - **Option B (3,000,000 km)**: Close but slightly lower than the calculated value.  
   - **Option C (2,880,000 km)**: Far too low, inconsistent with the relativistic calculation.  
   - **Option D (3,060,000 km)**: Matches the calculated value closely, considering rounding approximations.

Thus, the correct answer is **D**.  
**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So, the supernova occurred in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame?

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the reference frames here. So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at some speed. But from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Oh right, because in an inertial frame, if object A is moving towards object B at speed v in A's frame, then in B's frame, A is moving towards it at speed v as well. Because the frames are inertial, right? So perhaps the speed is the same in both frames when they're moving towards each other.

Wait, no, that's only if they're moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, but wait, 60,000 km/s is like a fifth the speed of light. Because the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 2e5 km/s, which is 0.2c.

Wait, but in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh wait, the question says both are inertial frames, so perhaps it's using a Galilean transformation since the speeds are not that high? Or does it require using the Lorentz transformation? Hmm, but 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I think I might need to consider relativistic effects here.

Wait, but the problem is about the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame. So I think I need to find the proper time or something. Wait, no. The question gives 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So I need to find the corresponding time in the galaxy's frame, and then multiply by the speed to get the distance.

Wait, or maybe the other way around. Let me think. Let's say in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. I need to find how much time passes in the galaxy's frame during that same interval. Because the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame would be speed multiplied by the galaxy's frame's time.

Wait, but wait. The ejecta is moving towards the center in the galaxy's frame. From the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at some velocity, say v. So in galaxy frame, the ejecta's velocity is v, so distance is v * t, where t is the time in galaxy frame.

But the problem says, from the ejecta frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's speed is 60,000 km/s. Wait, but in reality, the ejecta's speed in the galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s. Because if the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v in the ejecta's frame, then in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v. So it's a case of relative velocity.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's model this.

Let me denote the galaxy's frame as S and the ejecta's frame as S'. The supernova occurs at the origin of S, perhaps. So in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center (which is at, say, x = 0, and the supernova is at origin x=0, y=0, etc. So the ejecta is moving towards negative x direction? Or maybe positive? Wait, it's moving towards the center, so perhaps S is the galaxy's rest frame, and the ejecta is moving towards x=-infinity, but that's probably not the case. Wait, perhaps the ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center, so in S, the ejecta's velocity is v, say along the x-axis towards the center (let's say negative x direction). So in S, the ejecta's velocity is v = -60,000 km/s? Or wait, let's see.

Wait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame (S'), the center of the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in S', the galaxy's center is approaching at 6e4 km/s. That would mean in S (the galaxy's frame), the ejecta is approaching the center at 6e4 km/s. So the velocity of the ejecta in S is u = 6e4 km/s towards the center.

Wait, but wait, if in S' (ejecta's frame), the center is moving towards the ejecta at 6e4 km/s, then in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 6e4 km/s. Because velocities are symmetric in that way when the frames are moving relative to each other.

Wait, but in reality, you can't just say that because of Galilean addition; you have to consider the direction in which the frames are moving. So perhaps the ejecta is moving at velocity u in S, and the center is moving at velocity u' in S'.

Wait, but since the supernova occurs in the galaxy, perhaps both frames are moving relative to each other. So perhaps the ejecta is moving at velocity u in S, and the frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S along the x-axis.

Wait, maybe the simplest approach is to model it as a relative velocity problem with time dilation.

So, the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame (S' frame), and we need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the S (galaxy) frame during that time. But wait, time in S is different due to time dilation.

Wait, but wait, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity u. So the distance the ejecta travels is u multiplied by the time in S. So I need to find the time in the galaxy's frame, which is S, that corresponds to the 50 seconds in S'.

But wait, time dilation depends on the relative velocity between the frames. So the gamma factor is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)), where v is the relative velocity between S and S'.

Wait, but what is v here? Because in S', the galaxy is moving at 6e4 km/s towards the ejecta. So the relative velocity between the frames is 6e4 km/s. So v is 6e4 km/s.

Wait, but wait, in relativity, the speed of the galaxy in S' is v, so the speed of S' relative to S is v. So considering that, the gamma factor would be 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

So, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

But I need to calculate the time in S. Since in S', the time is 50 seconds, but in S, the time would be longer due to time dilation. So t = gamma * t'.

Wait, but which direction? Because the events happen in such a way that the time in S is the proper time or not.

Wait, the process is that the ejecta is moving, and in its frame, 50 seconds pass. So the time in galaxy's frame would be longer if the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of c.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about which frame is which. Let me think again. S is the galaxy's frame, and S' is the ejecta's frame. The ejecta is moving at velocity u in S. From S', the galaxy is moving towards it at velocity u as well.

Wait, according to the problem statement, from the ejecta's frame, the center of the galaxy is moving towards it at 6e4 km/s. So, in S', the velocity of the galaxy (at rest in S) is u' = +6e4 km/s (towards the ejecta). So, according to S', the galaxy is moving towards it at 6e4 km/s. Therefore, the velocity of S' relative to S is 6e4 km/s towards the ejecta. Wait, no, because in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center (galaxy) at 6e4 km/s. So S' is moving at velocity u = 6e4 km/s relative to S along the x-axis. So in S, the ejecta is moving at u = 6e4 km/s towards the galaxy.

Wait, but then, in S, the galaxy is stationary, and the ejecta is moving towards it. So, in the galaxy's frame (S), the time elapsed during the ejecta's journey is t. But in the ejecta's frame (S'), the time is t' = 50 seconds.

But wait, how do t and t' relate? Using the Lorentz transformation.

Wait, but the events in question are the supernova occurring at the origin in S (so x=0, t=0), and then after some time, the ejecta has moved a certain distance. But wait, no, the ejecta is moving, so the events are the supernova (at origin, t=0) and the ejecta being at position x = d (distance) at time t in S.

In the ejecta's frame, S', the same two events would have a different time and position.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of proper time. The proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the object, which in this case is the ejecta. So the proper time tau (t') is 50 seconds. The distance in the galaxy's frame (d) would be u * t, where u is the speed of the ejecta, and t is the time in S. But t and t' are related by time dilation.

So, t = gamma * t' ?

Wait, but wait, time dilation is such that the moving clock runs slower. So, if t' is the proper time in S', then in S, the time is longer. So yes, t = gamma * t'.

So, let's compute gamma.

v = 6e4 km/s = 60,000 km/s. Let's convert that to meters per second: 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s.

Wait, the speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v is 0.2c (since 6e7 / 3e8 = 0.2). So v=0.2c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) ) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0204.

Wait, let me calculate sqrt(0.96). Let's see, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 is about 1.0204. So gamma is approximately 1.0204.

So, t = gamma * t' = 1.0204 * 50 ≈ 51.02 seconds.

Wait, but wait, no, wait. Because the direction matters. The time in S is the time between the events as measured in S. Let me think about the Lorentz transformation. The Lorentz transformation for time is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c²). But in this case, the event in question is the same starting point. Let me model the events.

In S (galaxy's frame), the supernova occurs at (x=0, t=0). The ejecta, which is moving at velocity u = 6e4 km/s towards the center (so along the negative x direction if the center is at x=0), will be at position x = u * t after time t. So at time t, the ejecta is at x = u * t.

In S' (ejecta's frame), the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at velocity u. So in S', the supernova occurs at x' = 0, t'=0. The center of the galaxy (origin in S) is moving towards the ejecta at u, so at time t', the center is at x' = -u * t'.

Wait, but the ejecta is at rest in S', so the position of the ejecta doesn't change in S'. So in S', when the supernova occurs, the ejecta is at x'=0. But as time progresses, the galaxy (center) moves towards the ejecta, which is at rest. So when the galaxy's center is at x' = -u * t', the ejecta remains at x'=0.

Wait, but the position of the galaxy's center in S' is x' = -u t'.

But in the problem, the question is about the time elapsed in S' being 50 seconds. So the time in S' is t' =50 s. So the corresponding time in S is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c²).

Wait, but in the event where the supernova occurs, x'=0, t'=0. So for that event, t = gamma * t' = gamma * 0 = 0.

Now, after some time t' =50 s in S', what is the position of the galaxy's center in S'? It's x' = -u * t' = -6e4 km/s *50 s. Wait, 6e4 km/s is 6e4 *1e3 m/s. But let's compute it in kilometers.

Wait, 6e4 km/s *50 s = 6e4 *50 = 3e6 km. So x' = -3e6 km.

So, the position in S' is x' = -3e6 km.

Now, how about the time in S? Using the Lorentz transformation:

t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² )

So, let's compute (v x')/c².

v is 6e4 km/s. Wait, but let's convert to m/s for consistency. v = 60,000 km/s = 6e4 *1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s.

x' is -3e6 km = -3e6 *1e3 m = -3e9 m.

So,

(v x')/c² = (6e7 m/s * (-3e9 m)) / (9e16 m²/s²) )

Wait,

(6e7 * (-3e9 )) = -1.8e17 m²/s.

Divide by 9e16 m²/s²:

-1.8e17 /9e16 = -2 s.

So,

t = gamma * (t' + (-2)) )

t' is 50 s, so t = gamma*(50 -2) = gamma *48.

Gamma is approximately 1.0204.

So t ≈1.0204 *48 ≈49.0 seconds.

Wait, that's interesting. So in the galaxy's frame, the time elapsed is about 49 seconds, not 50. But wait, how?

Wait, that seems counterintuitive, because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 6e4 km/s, so the time should be less than in the ejecta's frame because of length contraction? Wait, no, the time between events would depend on the relative motion.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the setup is that the supernova occurs at the origin in S (galaxy frame), and the ejecta is moving towards the center at 6e4 km/s. So in S, the ejecta's position at time t is x = u * t.

In S', the ejecta is at rest, so the position is x' =0, but the galaxy (origin in S) is moving towards the ejecta at speed u.

So, the position of the galaxy's center in S' is x' = -u t' because as time t' increases, the galaxy moves towards the ejecta.

But in the problem, the events are the supernova (t'=0, x'=0) and another event which is the ejecta reaching a certain point. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the events. Let's model it as the event where the ejecta (origin in S') is at rest, and the galaxy's center moves towards it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. The time in the ejecta's frame is t' =50 s. So the question is, what is the distance the ejecta has traveled in S (galaxy frame) during this time.

Wait, but in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity u=6e4 km/s. So, the distance would be u * t, where t is the time in S.

But I need to find t in S corresponding to t'=50 s in S'. But how?

Wait, perhaps using the time dilation formula: t = gamma * t' ?

But earlier, when I used the Lorentz transformation with the specific event, I found that t was 49 s.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the distance the ejecta travels in S (galaxy frame) during the time t. That distance is d = u * t.

But I need to find t, the time in S frame corresponding to the ejecta's frame t' of 50 s.

Wait, perhaps using the relation between the two times. Since the frames are moving relative to each other, the time in S is longer than in S' by a factor of gamma. So t = gamma * t'.

But earlier, when I considered the specific event, the time in S was less than in S' due to some other factors. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the distance is simply u multiplied by t', but adjusted for length contraction or time dilation.

Wait, another approach: the proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the object. So for the ejecta, the proper time is t'=50 s. The time in S (galaxy frame) would be longer because the ejecta is moving. So, t = gamma * t'.

Wait, gamma is approx 1.0204, so t ≈50 *1.0204 ≈51.02 s.

Wait, but then the distance in S would be u * t = 6e4 km/s *51.02 s ≈3,061,200 km. But looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. That's close.

But wait, earlier when I applied the Lorentz transformation, I got t=48.992 s (approx 49.0 s). So the distance would be 6e4 km/s *49 s = 2.94e6 km, which is option A.

Hmm, so which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I applied the Lorentz transformation earlier. Let me think again.

In the supernova's frame (S), the ejecta is moving at u =6e4 km/s. So, in S, the time elapsed for the ejecta to travel a certain distance is t. The ejecta's proper time is t', so t' = t / gamma. Because the proper time is the shortest time between two events.

Wait, I think that's correct. So, t' = t / gamma. So, t = gamma * t'.

So, t = gamma *50 ≈1.0204 *50 ≈51.02 s.

So, the distance in S is u * t = 6e4 km/s * 51.02 s ≈3,061,200 km. Looking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km. That's very close, so perhaps that's the correct answer.

But wait, earlier when I used the Lorentz transformation, I got a different result. Let me see what I did wrong.

Wait, perhaps I confused the direction of the velocity. Let me re-express the Lorentz transformation correctly.

The Lorentz transformation for time is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² )

In the supernova's frame S, the two events are (x=0, t=0) and (x= d, t= t).

In the ejecta's frame S', the two events are (x'=0, t'=0) and (x' =0, t'=50 s) because the ejecta is at rest. So in S', x' remains 0, and the time is 50 s.

So, using the Lorentz transformation:

t = gamma ( t' + (v x')/c^2 )

But x' =0, because in S', the supernova and the ejecta are at the same point. So x' =0.

So, t = gamma * t' = 1.0204 *50 ≈51.02 s.

So, the time in S is approximately 51.02 seconds. Then, the distance d = u * t =6e4 km/s *51.02 s ≈3,061,200 km.

Which is approximately option D, 3,060,000 km. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but why earlier when I considered the position of the galaxy's center in S' did I get a different result? Because in that case, the x' was not zero. Oh, because that scenario was about the galaxy's center moving, not the ejecta's position.

So, in the correct scenario, the two events (supernova and the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame) have x' =0 and t' =50 s. So, in that case, t = gamma * t' ≈51.02 s. So the distance is 6e4 *51.02 ≈3,061,200 km.

But the options don't have exactly that. Option D is 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the approximation in gamma leads to this.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely. Let me compute gamma accurately.

v =6e4 km/s =6e4 *1e3 m/s =6e7 m/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

v²/c² = (6e7)^2 / (3e8)^2 = (3.6e15) / (9e16) ) = 3.6/9e-1 = 0.4e-1=0.04. So, v²/c² =0.04.

So, 1 - 0.04 =0.96.

sqrt(0.96)= approximately 0.9797958971.

So, gamma=1/0.9797958971≈1.020305.

So, t=gamma *50 ≈1.020305 *50≈51.01526 s.

So, d=6e4 km/s *51.01526 s=6e4 *51.01526 km.

Calculating that:

6e4 is 60,000.

60,000 *51.01526 = let's compute 60,000 *50 =3,000,000, and 60,000 *1.01526=60,000 *1=60,000; 60,000 *0.01526= 915.6. So total is 60,000 +915.6=60,915.6.

So, total distance is 3,000,000 +60,915.6=3,060,915.6 km.

Which is approximately 3,060,916 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. So that's the closest.

Wait, but let me check the options again:

Options:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B)3,000,000 km.

C)2,880,000 km.

D)3,060,000 km.

So, 3,060,916 is very close to D, which is 3,060,000.

So the correct answer should be D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame (S) and the ejecta's reference frame (S'). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Relative Velocity and Frames**:  
   In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \). By symmetry of inertial frames, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center at the same speed in the Galaxy's frame (S). Thus, the ejecta's velocity in S is \( u = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \).

2. **Time Dilation**:  
   The problem specifies that \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) passes in the ejecta's frame (S'). Due to time dilation, the time in the Galaxy's frame (S) is longer and related by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]  
   where  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} = 6 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{(6 \times 10^7)^2}{(3 \times 10^8)^2} = 0.04
   \]  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0203
   \]  
   Thus,  
   \[
   t = \gamma t' = 1.0203 \times 50 \approx 51.02 \, \text{s}.
   \]

3. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given by:  
   \[
   d = u \cdot t
   \]  
   Substituting \( u = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t = 51.02 \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   d = 60,000 \times 51.02 \approx 3,061,200 \, \text{km}.
   \]  
   Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is **3,060,000 km**.

4. **Critical Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A (2,940,000 km)**: Too low, as it does not account for the relativistic time dilation factor.  
   - **Option B (3,000,000 km)**: Close but slightly lower than the calculated value.  
   - **Option C (2,880,000 km)**: Far too low, inconsistent with the relativistic calculation.  
   - **Option D (3,060,000 km)**: Matches the calculated value closely, considering rounding approximations.

Thus, the correct answer is **D**.  
**Answer: D**
