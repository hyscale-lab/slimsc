Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually represented with complex numbers, right? Hmm, but the elements here are real. Oh, maybe it's okay because they can still be normalized. Wait, the state is a column vector, so it's a 3-dimensional vector. Let me note down the state vector: |ψ⟩ = [-1; 2; 1].

Then, there are two observables, P and Q, each represented by their respective matrices. The operator for P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, that looks a bit symmetric. Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

And the operator Q is a diagonal matrix: first row [1,0,0], second [0,0,0], third [0,0,-1]. So Q is diagonal, which probably means its eigenvectors are the basis vectors. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, and -1.

The question is, if we measure Q just after measuring P, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q? So the measurements are in order: first P, then Q. And we're looking for the combined probability of both outcomes.

Wait, but when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So first, when I measure P, the system will collapse into an eigenstate of P. Then, after that, measuring Q will be on that collapsed state.

But I'm a bit confused about whether the order affects the probabilities. Oh, right, the question says measure Q just after P, so it's P first, then Q.

So I need to find the probability that when P is measured, the outcome is 0, and then Q is measured on the resulting state, and the outcome is -1.

Wait, but no, actually, the order is P measurement first, then Q measurement, but the question is about getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements. So the sequence is: first, measure P and get 0, then measure Q on the new state and get -1.

So the total probability is the product of the probability of getting P=0 times the probability of getting Q=-1 given that P=0 was measured.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the probability of the combined outcome, which would be the product of getting P=0 and then Q=-1.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P. Because when you measure P, the state collapses into one of P's eigenvectors, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector component in the original state.

Wait, but actually, operator P is a matrix. Let me check if P is Hermitian, because observables must have real eigenvalues. Let me see: P's elements are real, so it's symmetric. So yes, it's Hermitian. So that's good.

So eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P need to be found. Let me try to find the eigenvalues first.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So for a 3x3 matrix, that's a bit of work. Let's compute the determinant:

| -λ    1/√2      0   |
|1/√2  -λ     1/√2   |
| 0     1/√2   -λ    |

The determinant would be:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (0)(1/√2) ] + 0 [ ... ].

Let me compute each term:

First term: -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/√2) [ (-λ / √2 ) - 0 ) ] → - (1/√2)( -λ / √2 ) = (1/√2)( λ / √2 ) = λ/(2)

Third term is zero.

So determinant equation:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 = 0.

Let me factor out λ:

λ [ - (λ² - 1/2) + 1/2 ] = 0.

Wait, wait: Wait, the determinant is computed as:

= -λ (λ² - (1/√2)^2 ) - (1/√2) ( (1/√2)(-λ) )

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the determinant more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for symmetries or patterns in the matrix.

Looking at operator P, perhaps it's a symmetric matrix with certain properties. Let me see:

Looking at P's structure, the diagonal is zero, and the off-diagonal elements have 1/sqrt(2) in certain positions.

Wait, perhaps P has a particular structure that can be diagonalized more easily. Alternatively, perhaps it's a permutation matrix multiplied by 1/sqrt(2), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe P is the position representation of a spin-1 system or something, but perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by considering the matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the matrix P as a sum of certain terms.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the trace of P, which is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

Wait, the trace of P is 0+0+0=0. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

P is a symmetric matrix, so its eigenvalues are real.

The determinant is the product of eigenvalues, which for trace zero could be 0, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can guess the eigenvalues. Let me think: when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues.

Looking at the structure of P, perhaps the eigenvalues are symmetric. Maybe one is 1, another is 1, and the third is -2? Because their sum is zero. Wait, but that would be 1 +1 + (-2) = 0. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are sqrt(2), -sqrt(2), 0. Because sqrt(2) - sqrt(2) +0=0.

Wait, but let's test this. Let me compute P squared:

P squared would be P multiplied by P.

But maybe that's a bit time-consuming, but perhaps it's worth trying. Let me compute P^2.

P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0.

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2.

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0.

So P^2 = P * P.

Let me compute each element.

Element (1,1): (0)(0) + (1/√2)(1/√2) + (0)(0) ) =
0 + (1/2) + 0 = 1/2.

Element (1,2): 0*1/√2 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0.

Element (1,3): 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2.

Similarly, element (2,1): 1/√2 * 0 + 0 *1/√2 +1/√2 *0 = 0.

Element (2,2): (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) ) = 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1.

Element (2,3): 1/√2 *0 + 0*(1/√2) +1/√2 *0 = 0.

Element (3,1):0 *0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) +0 *0 = 1/2.

Element (3,2): 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 +0*(1/√2) = 0.

Element (3,3): 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) +0 *0 = 1/2.

So P^2 is:

[ [1/2, 0, 1/2],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1/2, 0, 1/2] ]

Hmm, interesting. Now, if P^2 is this matrix, perhaps we can find eigenvalues by noting that it's a diagonal in some basis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the eigenvalues of P. Let's consider that the eigenvalues of P may be sqrt(2), -sqrt(2), 0. Let's see if that makes sense.

Wait, when I compute P^2, if P has eigenvalues λ, then P^2 has eigenvalues λ^2.

So suppose that the eigenvalues of P are a, b, c. Then the eigenvalues of P^2 are a², b², c².

Wait, from the trace of P, a + b + c = 0.

The trace of P^2 is 1/2 + 1 + 1/2 = 2. So the sum of squares a² + b² + c² = 2.

Hmm, if I suppose the eigenvalues are sqrt(2), -sqrt(2), and 0, then their squares would be 2, 2, 0. Sum is 4, which doesn't match the trace of P^2 which is 2. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the eigenvalues are 1, -1, 0. Their squares would be 1, 1, 0. Sum is 2, which matches the trace of P^2. So that's a possibility.

Wait, let's see. So the eigenvalues could be 1, -1, 0.

Because then the sum is 0, and sum of squares is 2. That fits.

So P has eigenvalues 1, -1, 0.

So when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 1, -1, and 0.

Now, the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

We need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0, then measuring Q gives -1.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, find the eigenstates of P corresponding to each eigenvalue.

But wait, perhaps a simpler approach is to find the eigenvectors of P for each eigenvalue, then find the projection of |ψ⟩ onto each eigenvector, square the magnitude to get the probability.

But finding eigenvectors might be time-consuming, but perhaps for eigenvalue 0, it's easier.

Let me try to find the eigenvectors for P.

Starting with eigenvalue 0.

We have (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So the matrix equation is:

[0 1/√2 0 ] [x]   [0]
[1/√2 0 1/√2][y] = [0]
[0 1/√2 0 ] [z]   [0]

Which gives us the equations:

1. (1/√2) y = 0 → y = 0.

2. (1/√2)x + (1/√2) z = 0 → x + z = 0 → z = -x.

3. (1/√2) y = 0 → same as first equation, which gives y=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form (x, 0, -x), which can be written as x*(1, 0, -1). So the normalized eigenvector is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

Wait, because the vector is [1; 0; -1], its norm squared is 1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized vector is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is |v0⟩ = [1; 0; -1]/sqrt(2).

Now, what about the other eigenvalues, 1 and -1?

Let me try to find the eigenvectors for λ=1.

Equation: (P - I)|v> = 0.

So P - I is:

[-1, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, -1, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, -1]

The equations are:

- x + (1/√2) y = 0 → x = y /√2.

(1/√2) x - y + (1/√2) z = 0.

0 x + (1/√2) y - z = 0 → z = (1/√2) y.

Let me substitute x = y/√2 into the second equation.

(1/√2)(y/√2) - y + (1/√2) z = 0 → (y/2) - y + (z)/(√2) = 0.

Simplify: (-y/2) + (z)/(√2) = 0 → (z)/(√2) = y/2 → z = (y/2) * sqrt(2) = y * (sqrt(2)/2) = y*(1/√2).

But from the third equation, z = y/√2. So that's consistent.

So let me express everything in terms of y.

x = y /√2.

z = y /√2.

So the eigenvectors are of the form [ y/√2, y, y/√2 ] = y [1/√2, 1, 1/√2 ].

To normalize this, the norm squared is (1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 = (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2) / sqrt(2) → which is (1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2))?

Wait, wait: Let me compute the norm.

The vector is [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]. The squared norm is:

(1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

1^2 = 1.

(1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

Total: 1/2 +1 + 1/2 = 2. So to normalize, we divide by sqrt(2).

So the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2) / sqrt(2) → [1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2)]? Wait, let me compute each component.

Wait, original vector is [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]. Let me write it as [a, b, c] = [1/√2, 1, 1/√2].

The norm is sqrt( (1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2) +1 + (1/2) )= sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

So the normalized vector is [1/√2, 1, 1/√2] / sqrt(2) = [1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2)]? Wait:

No, because (1/√2) / sqrt(2) = (1/(√2)) * (1/√2) ) = 1/(2).

Wait, 1/sqrt(2) is (sqrt(2)/2). So, perhaps another approach: Let me compute each component.

Each component a, b, c = [1/√2, 1, 1/√2].

Divide each by sqrt(2) gives:

a' = (1/√2) / sqrt(2) = 1/(2).

b' = 1 / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)/2.

c' = (1/√2)/sqrt(2) = 1/(2).

So the normalized eigenvector for λ=1 is [1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2].

Wait, let me check the norm again:

(1/2)^2 = 1/4.

(sqrt(2)/2)^2 = (2)/(4) = 1/2.

(1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Sum: 1/4 +1/2 +1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

So |v1⟩ = [1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2].

Similarly, for eigenvalue λ=-1, the eigenvector can be found by solving (P + I)|v> =0.

P + I:

[1, 1/√2, 0]

[1/√2, 1, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 1]

The equations are:

x + (1/√2) y = 0 → x = - y /√2.

(1/√2) x + y + (1/√2) z = 0.

(1/√2) y + z = 0 → z= - (1/√2) y.

Substituting x= - y/√2 into the second equation:

(1/√2)(- y/√2) ) + y + (1/√2)(- y/√2 ) = 0.

Compute each term:

(1/√2)(- y/√2 ) = (- y)/(2).

Similarly, (1/√2)(- y/√2 ) = (- y)/(2).

So the equation becomes:

(-y/2) + y + (-y/2 ) = 0.

Combine terms:

(-y/2 - y/2) = -y → -y + y = 0 → 0=0.

So the equations are consistent, and z = - y/√2.

So the eigenvector is [x, y, z] = [ -y/√2, y, -y/√2 ].

We can factor out y, and choose y=1 for simplicity.

So the vector is [ -1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ].

The norm squared is ( (-1/√2)^2 ) + (1)^2 + ( (-1/√2)^2 ) = (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) = 2.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ -1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ] / sqrt(2).

Which simplifies to [ -1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), -1/(2) ].

Wait, let me compute each component:

-1/√2 divided by sqrt(2) is (-1/√2) * (1/√2) )= -1/(2).

Similarly, 1 divided by sqrt(2) is sqrt(2)/2.

Same for the third component.

So |v-1⟩ = [ -1/2, sqrt(2)/2, -1/2 ].

Now, we have the three eigenvectors of P:

- |v0⟩ = [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2) (eigenvalue 0)
- |v1⟩ = [1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2] (eigenvalue 1)
- |v-1⟩ = [ -1/2, sqrt(2)/2, -1/2 ] (eigenvalue -1)

Now, the initial state |ψ⟩ is [-1; 2; 1].

We need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0, which is the square of the amplitude of |v0⟩ in |ψ⟩.

The amplitude is the inner product ⟨v0 | ψ⟩.

|v0⟩ is [1; 0; -1]/sqrt(2).

So ⟨v0 | ψ⟩ = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] * [-1; 2; 1 ].

Dot product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

The magnitude squared is ( (-sqrt(2))^2 ) = 2.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the inner product is (-2)/sqrt(2) → which is -sqrt(2), because 2/sqrt(2)=sqrt(2).

Ah yes, because 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) )= sqrt(2).

Wait, let me compute it correctly.

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = -1/sqrt(2).

(-1/sqrt(2))*1 = -1/sqrt(2).

Total: (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

So the inner product is -sqrt(2).

The magnitude squared is ( -sqrt(2) )^2 = 2.

The probability of measuring P=0 is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude, which is 2. But wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Wait, that's a problem. Because the magnitude squared is 2, which is greater than 1. But probabilities can't be more than 1. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me double-check the calculations.

|v0⟩ is [1;0;-1]/sqrt(2).

So ⟨v0| = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

|ψ⟩ is [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So inner product:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 ) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, but this gives a squared magnitude of (-sqrt(2))^2 = 2. That's impossible for a probability.

Hmm. So that suggests that perhaps the state |v0⟩ is not normalized correctly, or perhaps I made a mistake in finding the eigenvector.

Wait, no, earlier I thought the |v0⟩ has a norm squared of 1, because [1,0, -1] has a norm squared of 2, and we divide by sqrt(2), so 2/(sqrt(2))^2=2/2=1.

Wait, the vector is [1;0;-1], which has length sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So when we normalize, we have [1,0,-1]/sqrt(2). So any vector multiplied by this should have inner product correctly.

Wait, but then the inner product with |ψ⟩ is -sqrt(2), which has magnitude squared of 2. That's more than 1, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

I must have made a mistake in finding the eigenvectors or in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, let's compute the inner product again.

⟨v0|ψ⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1.

Which is (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2/sqrt(2)) = -sqrt(2).

Hmm, yes, that's correct. But the squared magnitude is 2, which is impossible. So this suggests that perhaps |v0⟩ is not a unit vector, which contradicts earlier calculation.

Wait, |v0⟩ is [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2). Let me compute its norm:

(1/sqrt(2))^2 + 0^2 + (-1/sqrt(2))^2 = (1/2)+(0)+(1/2) )= 1. So yes, it's a unit vector.

So the inner product squared is 2, which is impossible. So that means I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the initial state vector |ψ⟩ is not normalized.

Let me check |ψ⟩. Its norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So |ψ⟩ is not normalized. So perhaps the state should be normalized first.

Ah! That's a mistake. The state vector given is [-1, 2, 1]^T, and its norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is [-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)].

So I need to normalize |ψ⟩ before computing the inner product.

That changes things. So |ψ⟩ is [ -1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(6).

So, recomputing the inner product with |v0⟩:

⟨v0| ψ ⟩ = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] * [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]

= (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).

= (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).

= (-2)/(sqrt(12)).

sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1/sqrt(3)) )^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to |v0⟩, which is [1; 0; -1]/sqrt(2).

Now, we need to measure Q on this state and find the probability of getting Q=-1.

The operator Q is given by the diagonal matrix:

[1 0 0;

0 0 0;

0 0 -1].

The eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

We need to find the probability that measuring Q gives -1.

The eigenvectors of Q corresponding to each eigenvalue are the basis vectors.

Because Q is diagonal, its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue 1 is |e1⟩ = [1;0;0].

Eigenvalue 0: |e2⟩ = [0;1;0].

Eigenvalue -1: |e3⟩ = [0;0;1].

So, the state after P measurement is |v0⟩ = [1; 0; -1]/sqrt(2).

To find the probability that measuring Q gives -1, we take the inner product of |v0⟩ with |e3⟩ and square its magnitude.

So ⟨e3 | v0 ⟩ = [0 0 1] * [1;0;-1]/sqrt(2) = (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) ) / sqrt(2) = (-1)/sqrt(2).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1/sqrt(2))^2 )= 1/2.

So the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.

Wait, but wait. The state |v0⟩ is [1; 0; -1]/sqrt(2). Let me write this as (1/sqrt(2))|e1> + ( -1/sqrt(2) )|e3>.

So when you measure Q, the state is a superposition of |e1⟩ and |e3⟩, which are the eigenstates of Q for eigenvalues 1 and -1.

So the probability of Q=1 is |⟨e1 | v0 ⟩|^2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

Similarly, the probability of Q=-1 is |⟨e3 | v0 ⟩|^2 = ( -1/sqrt(2) )^2 = 1/2.

The probability of Q=0 is zero, as |v0⟩ has no component in |e2⟩.

So the probability of getting Q=-1 after measuring P=0 is 1/2.

Now, the overall probability is the product of the two probabilities: P(P=0) * P(Q=-1 | P=0) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

So the answer is 1/6, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the quantum system step by step.

### Step 1: Normalize the initial state
The initial state is given as a column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The norm of this vector is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4 + 1} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is given by:

\[
P = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are \( 1, -1, 0 \). The corresponding normalized eigenvectors are:

1. For \( \lambda = 0 \):
   \[
   |v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. For \( \lambda = 1 \):
   \[
   |v_1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. For \( \lambda = -1 \):
   \[
   |v_{-1}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

### Step 3: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the projection of \( |\psi\rangle \) onto \( |v_0\rangle \). The amplitude is:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}} \left( (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the magnitude:

\[
P(P = 0) = \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: State after measuring \( P = 0 \)
If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the state collapses to \( |v_0\rangle \):

\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with eigenvectors being the standard basis vectors:

1. \( |e_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \) (eigenvalue \( 1 \)),
2. \( |e_2\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \) (eigenvalue \( 0 \)),
3. \( |e_3\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) (eigenvalue \( -1 \)).

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the projection of \( |v_0\rangle \) onto \( |e_3\rangle \):

\[
\langle e_3 | v_0 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(Q = -1) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 6: Total probability
The total probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P = 0 \text{ and } Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1 | P = 0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}
\]

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually represented with complex numbers, right? Hmm, but the elements here are real. Oh, maybe it's okay because they can still be normalized. Wait, the state is a column vector, so it's a 3-dimensional vector. Let me note down the state vector: |ψ⟩ = [-1; 2; 1].

Then, there are two observables, P and Q, each represented by their respective matrices. The operator for P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, that looks a bit symmetric. Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

And the operator Q is a diagonal matrix: first row [1,0,0], second [0,0,0], third [0,0,-1]. So Q is diagonal, which probably means its eigenvectors are the basis vectors. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, and -1.

The question is, if we measure Q just after measuring P, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q? So the measurements are in order: first P, then Q. And we're looking for the combined probability of both outcomes.

Wait, but when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So first, when I measure P, the system will collapse into an eigenstate of P. Then, after that, measuring Q will be on that collapsed state.

But I'm a bit confused about whether the order affects the probabilities. Oh, right, the question says measure Q just after P, so it's P first, then Q.

So I need to find the probability that when P is measured, the outcome is 0, and then Q is measured on the resulting state, and the outcome is -1.

Wait, but no, actually, the order is P measurement first, then Q measurement, but the question is about getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements. So the sequence is: first, measure P and get 0, then measure Q on the new state and get -1.

So the total probability is the product of the probability of getting P=0 times the probability of getting Q=-1 given that P=0 was measured.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the probability of the combined outcome, which would be the product of getting P=0 and then Q=-1.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P. Because when you measure P, the state collapses into one of P's eigenvectors, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector component in the original state.

Wait, but actually, operator P is a matrix. Let me check if P is Hermitian, because observables must have real eigenvalues. Let me see: P's elements are real, so it's symmetric. So yes, it's Hermitian. So that's good.

So eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P need to be found. Let me try to find the eigenvalues first.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So for a 3x3 matrix, that's a bit of work. Let's compute the determinant:

| -λ    1/√2      0   |
|1/√2  -λ     1/√2   |
| 0     1/√2   -λ    |

The determinant would be:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (0)(1/√2) ] + 0 [ ... ].

Let me compute each term:

First term: -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/√2) [ (-λ / √2 ) - 0 ) ] → - (1/√2)( -λ / √2 ) = (1/√2)( λ / √2 ) = λ/(2)

Third term is zero.

So determinant equation:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 = 0.

Let me factor out λ:

λ [ - (λ² - 1/2) + 1/2 ] = 0.

Wait, wait: Wait, the determinant is computed as:

= -λ (λ² - (1/√2)^2 ) - (1/√2) ( (1/√2)(-λ) )

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the determinant more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for symmetries or patterns in the matrix.

Looking at operator P, perhaps it's a symmetric matrix with certain properties. Let me see:

Looking at P's structure, the diagonal is zero, and the off-diagonal elements have 1/sqrt(2) in certain positions.

Wait, perhaps P has a particular structure that can be diagonalized more easily. Alternatively, perhaps it's a permutation matrix multiplied by 1/sqrt(2), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe P is the position representation of a spin-1 system or something, but perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by considering the matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the matrix P as a sum of certain terms.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the trace of P, which is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

Wait, the trace of P is 0+0+0=0. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

P is a symmetric matrix, so its eigenvalues are real.

The determinant is the product of eigenvalues, which for trace zero could be 0, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can guess the eigenvalues. Let me think: when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues.

Looking at the structure of P, perhaps the eigenvalues are symmetric. Maybe one is 1, another is 1, and the third is -2? Because their sum is zero. Wait, but that would be 1 +1 + (-2) = 0. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are sqrt(2), -sqrt(2), 0. Because sqrt(2) - sqrt(2) +0=0.

Wait, but let's test this. Let me compute P squared:

P squared would be P multiplied by P.

But maybe that's a bit time-consuming, but perhaps it's worth trying. Let me compute P^2.

P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0.

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2.

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0.

So P^2 = P * P.

Let me compute each element.

Element (1,1): (0)(0) + (1/√2)(1/√2) + (0)(0) ) =
0 + (1/2) + 0 = 1/2.

Element (1,2): 0*1/√2 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0.

Element (1,3): 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2.

Similarly, element (2,1): 1/√2 * 0 + 0 *1/√2 +1/√2 *0 = 0.

Element (2,2): (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) ) = 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1.

Element (2,3): 1/√2 *0 + 0*(1/√2) +1/√2 *0 = 0.

Element (3,1):0 *0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) +0 *0 = 1/2.

Element (3,2): 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 +0*(1/√2) = 0.

Element (3,3): 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) +0 *0 = 1/2.

So P^2 is:

[ [1/2, 0, 1/2],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1/2, 0, 1/2] ]

Hmm, interesting. Now, if P^2 is this matrix, perhaps we can find eigenvalues by noting that it's a diagonal in some basis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the eigenvalues of P. Let's consider that the eigenvalues of P may be sqrt(2), -sqrt(2), 0. Let's see if that makes sense.

Wait, when I compute P^2, if P has eigenvalues λ, then P^2 has eigenvalues λ^2.

So suppose that the eigenvalues of P are a, b, c. Then the eigenvalues of P^2 are a², b², c².

Wait, from the trace of P, a + b + c = 0.

The trace of P^2 is 1/2 + 1 + 1/2 = 2. So the sum of squares a² + b² + c² = 2.

Hmm, if I suppose the eigenvalues are sqrt(2), -sqrt(2), and 0, then their squares would be 2, 2, 0. Sum is 4, which doesn't match the trace of P^2 which is 2. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the eigenvalues are 1, -1, 0. Their squares would be 1, 1, 0. Sum is 2, which matches the trace of P^2. So that's a possibility.

Wait, let's see. So the eigenvalues could be 1, -1, 0.

Because then the sum is 0, and sum of squares is 2. That fits.

So P has eigenvalues 1, -1, 0.

So when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 1, -1, and 0.

Now, the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

We need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0, then measuring Q gives -1.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, find the eigenstates of P corresponding to each eigenvalue.

But wait, perhaps a simpler approach is to find the eigenvectors of P for each eigenvalue, then find the projection of |ψ⟩ onto each eigenvector, square the magnitude to get the probability.

But finding eigenvectors might be time-consuming, but perhaps for eigenvalue 0, it's easier.

Let me try to find the eigenvectors for P.

Starting with eigenvalue 0.

We have (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So the matrix equation is:

[0 1/√2 0 ] [x]   [0]
[1/√2 0 1/√2][y] = [0]
[0 1/√2 0 ] [z]   [0]

Which gives us the equations:

1. (1/√2) y = 0 → y = 0.

2. (1/√2)x + (1/√2) z = 0 → x + z = 0 → z = -x.

3. (1/√2) y = 0 → same as first equation, which gives y=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form (x, 0, -x), which can be written as x*(1, 0, -1). So the normalized eigenvector is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

Wait, because the vector is [1; 0; -1], its norm squared is 1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized vector is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is |v0⟩ = [1; 0; -1]/sqrt(2).

Now, what about the other eigenvalues, 1 and -1?

Let me try to find the eigenvectors for λ=1.

Equation: (P - I)|v> = 0.

So P - I is:

[-1, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, -1, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, -1]

The equations are:

- x + (1/√2) y = 0 → x = y /√2.

(1/√2) x - y + (1/√2) z = 0.

0 x + (1/√2) y - z = 0 → z = (1/√2) y.

Let me substitute x = y/√2 into the second equation.

(1/√2)(y/√2) - y + (1/√2) z = 0 → (y/2) - y + (z)/(√2) = 0.

Simplify: (-y/2) + (z)/(√2) = 0 → (z)/(√2) = y/2 → z = (y/2) * sqrt(2) = y * (sqrt(2)/2) = y*(1/√2).

But from the third equation, z = y/√2. So that's consistent.

So let me express everything in terms of y.

x = y /√2.

z = y /√2.

So the eigenvectors are of the form [ y/√2, y, y/√2 ] = y [1/√2, 1, 1/√2 ].

To normalize this, the norm squared is (1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 = (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2) / sqrt(2) → which is (1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2))?

Wait, wait: Let me compute the norm.

The vector is [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]. The squared norm is:

(1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

1^2 = 1.

(1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

Total: 1/2 +1 + 1/2 = 2. So to normalize, we divide by sqrt(2).

So the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2) / sqrt(2) → [1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2)]? Wait, let me compute each component.

Wait, original vector is [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]. Let me write it as [a, b, c] = [1/√2, 1, 1/√2].

The norm is sqrt( (1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2) +1 + (1/2) )= sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

So the normalized vector is [1/√2, 1, 1/√2] / sqrt(2) = [1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2)]? Wait:

No, because (1/√2) / sqrt(2) = (1/(√2)) * (1/√2) ) = 1/(2).

Wait, 1/sqrt(2) is (sqrt(2)/2). So, perhaps another approach: Let me compute each component.

Each component a, b, c = [1/√2, 1, 1/√2].

Divide each by sqrt(2) gives:

a' = (1/√2) / sqrt(2) = 1/(2).

b' = 1 / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)/2.

c' = (1/√2)/sqrt(2) = 1/(2).

So the normalized eigenvector for λ=1 is [1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2].

Wait, let me check the norm again:

(1/2)^2 = 1/4.

(sqrt(2)/2)^2 = (2)/(4) = 1/2.

(1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Sum: 1/4 +1/2 +1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

So |v1⟩ = [1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2].

Similarly, for eigenvalue λ=-1, the eigenvector can be found by solving (P + I)|v> =0.

P + I:

[1, 1/√2, 0]

[1/√2, 1, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 1]

The equations are:

x + (1/√2) y = 0 → x = - y /√2.

(1/√2) x + y + (1/√2) z = 0.

(1/√2) y + z = 0 → z= - (1/√2) y.

Substituting x= - y/√2 into the second equation:

(1/√2)(- y/√2) ) + y + (1/√2)(- y/√2 ) = 0.

Compute each term:

(1/√2)(- y/√2 ) = (- y)/(2).

Similarly, (1/√2)(- y/√2 ) = (- y)/(2).

So the equation becomes:

(-y/2) + y + (-y/2 ) = 0.

Combine terms:

(-y/2 - y/2) = -y → -y + y = 0 → 0=0.

So the equations are consistent, and z = - y/√2.

So the eigenvector is [x, y, z] = [ -y/√2, y, -y/√2 ].

We can factor out y, and choose y=1 for simplicity.

So the vector is [ -1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ].

The norm squared is ( (-1/√2)^2 ) + (1)^2 + ( (-1/√2)^2 ) = (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) = 2.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ -1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ] / sqrt(2).

Which simplifies to [ -1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), -1/(2) ].

Wait, let me compute each component:

-1/√2 divided by sqrt(2) is (-1/√2) * (1/√2) )= -1/(2).

Similarly, 1 divided by sqrt(2) is sqrt(2)/2.

Same for the third component.

So |v-1⟩ = [ -1/2, sqrt(2)/2, -1/2 ].

Now, we have the three eigenvectors of P:

- |v0⟩ = [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2) (eigenvalue 0)
- |v1⟩ = [1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2] (eigenvalue 1)
- |v-1⟩ = [ -1/2, sqrt(2)/2, -1/2 ] (eigenvalue -1)

Now, the initial state |ψ⟩ is [-1; 2; 1].

We need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0, which is the square of the amplitude of |v0⟩ in |ψ⟩.

The amplitude is the inner product ⟨v0 | ψ⟩.

|v0⟩ is [1; 0; -1]/sqrt(2).

So ⟨v0 | ψ⟩ = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] * [-1; 2; 1 ].

Dot product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

The magnitude squared is ( (-sqrt(2))^2 ) = 2.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the inner product is (-2)/sqrt(2) → which is -sqrt(2), because 2/sqrt(2)=sqrt(2).

Ah yes, because 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) )= sqrt(2).

Wait, let me compute it correctly.

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = -1/sqrt(2).

(-1/sqrt(2))*1 = -1/sqrt(2).

Total: (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

So the inner product is -sqrt(2).

The magnitude squared is ( -sqrt(2) )^2 = 2.

The probability of measuring P=0 is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude, which is 2. But wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Wait, that's a problem. Because the magnitude squared is 2, which is greater than 1. But probabilities can't be more than 1. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me double-check the calculations.

|v0⟩ is [1;0;-1]/sqrt(2).

So ⟨v0| = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

|ψ⟩ is [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So inner product:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 ) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, but this gives a squared magnitude of (-sqrt(2))^2 = 2. That's impossible for a probability.

Hmm. So that suggests that perhaps the state |v0⟩ is not normalized correctly, or perhaps I made a mistake in finding the eigenvector.

Wait, no, earlier I thought the |v0⟩ has a norm squared of 1, because [1,0, -1] has a norm squared of 2, and we divide by sqrt(2), so 2/(sqrt(2))^2=2/2=1.

Wait, the vector is [1;0;-1], which has length sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So when we normalize, we have [1,0,-1]/sqrt(2). So any vector multiplied by this should have inner product correctly.

Wait, but then the inner product with |ψ⟩ is -sqrt(2), which has magnitude squared of 2. That's more than 1, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

I must have made a mistake in finding the eigenvectors or in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, let's compute the inner product again.

⟨v0|ψ⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1.

Which is (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2/sqrt(2)) = -sqrt(2).

Hmm, yes, that's correct. But the squared magnitude is 2, which is impossible. So this suggests that perhaps |v0⟩ is not a unit vector, which contradicts earlier calculation.

Wait, |v0⟩ is [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2). Let me compute its norm:

(1/sqrt(2))^2 + 0^2 + (-1/sqrt(2))^2 = (1/2)+(0)+(1/2) )= 1. So yes, it's a unit vector.

So the inner product squared is 2, which is impossible. So that means I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the initial state vector |ψ⟩ is not normalized.

Let me check |ψ⟩. Its norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So |ψ⟩ is not normalized. So perhaps the state should be normalized first.

Ah! That's a mistake. The state vector given is [-1, 2, 1]^T, and its norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is [-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)].

So I need to normalize |ψ⟩ before computing the inner product.

That changes things. So |ψ⟩ is [ -1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(6).

So, recomputing the inner product with |v0⟩:

⟨v0| ψ ⟩ = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] * [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]

= (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).

= (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).

= (-2)/(sqrt(12)).

sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1/sqrt(3)) )^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to |v0⟩, which is [1; 0; -1]/sqrt(2).

Now, we need to measure Q on this state and find the probability of getting Q=-1.

The operator Q is given by the diagonal matrix:

[1 0 0;

0 0 0;

0 0 -1].

The eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

We need to find the probability that measuring Q gives -1.

The eigenvectors of Q corresponding to each eigenvalue are the basis vectors.

Because Q is diagonal, its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue 1 is |e1⟩ = [1;0;0].

Eigenvalue 0: |e2⟩ = [0;1;0].

Eigenvalue -1: |e3⟩ = [0;0;1].

So, the state after P measurement is |v0⟩ = [1; 0; -1]/sqrt(2).

To find the probability that measuring Q gives -1, we take the inner product of |v0⟩ with |e3⟩ and square its magnitude.

So ⟨e3 | v0 ⟩ = [0 0 1] * [1;0;-1]/sqrt(2) = (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) ) / sqrt(2) = (-1)/sqrt(2).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1/sqrt(2))^2 )= 1/2.

So the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.

Wait, but wait. The state |v0⟩ is [1; 0; -1]/sqrt(2). Let me write this as (1/sqrt(2))|e1> + ( -1/sqrt(2) )|e3>.

So when you measure Q, the state is a superposition of |e1⟩ and |e3⟩, which are the eigenstates of Q for eigenvalues 1 and -1.

So the probability of Q=1 is |⟨e1 | v0 ⟩|^2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

Similarly, the probability of Q=-1 is |⟨e3 | v0 ⟩|^2 = ( -1/sqrt(2) )^2 = 1/2.

The probability of Q=0 is zero, as |v0⟩ has no component in |e2⟩.

So the probability of getting Q=-1 after measuring P=0 is 1/2.

Now, the overall probability is the product of the two probabilities: P(P=0) * P(Q=-1 | P=0) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

So the answer is 1/6, which is option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the quantum system step by step.

### Step 1: Normalize the initial state
The initial state is given as a column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The norm of this vector is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4 + 1} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is given by:

\[
P = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are \( 1, -1, 0 \). The corresponding normalized eigenvectors are:

1. For \( \lambda = 0 \):
   \[
   |v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. For \( \lambda = 1 \):
   \[
   |v_1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. For \( \lambda = -1 \):
   \[
   |v_{-1}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

### Step 3: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the projection of \( |\psi\rangle \) onto \( |v_0\rangle \). The amplitude is:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}} \left( (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the magnitude:

\[
P(P = 0) = \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: State after measuring \( P = 0 \)
If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the state collapses to \( |v_0\rangle \):

\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with eigenvectors being the standard basis vectors:

1. \( |e_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \) (eigenvalue \( 1 \)),
2. \( |e_2\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \) (eigenvalue \( 0 \)),
3. \( |e_3\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) (eigenvalue \( -1 \)).

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the projection of \( |v_0\rangle \) onto \( |e_3\rangle \):

\[
\langle e_3 | v_0 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(Q = -1) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 6: Total probability
The total probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P = 0 \text{ and } Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1 | P = 0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}
\]
