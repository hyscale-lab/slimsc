Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure.

First reaction: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and since it's heated, maybe it's an elimination reaction. Wait, but wait—bromine and KOH under heat usually lead to elimination, like dehydrohalogenation. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two adjacent bromines. If both leave, that would form a double bond. So, elimination would form an alkene. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The NMR spectrum of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm with 2H, which is probably a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen, considering the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe a ketone?

Wait, when you have two adjacent Br atoms in a molecule and you treat with KOH, it's possible that it's a double elimination, but maybe it's a Dieckmann-type elimination? No, Dieckmann is for cyclic esters. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but given the NMR and IR, perhaps it's forming an epoxide? No, because the IR doesn't show the typical epoxide absorption. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming a ketone via a different mechanism.

Wait, another possibility. If KOH is in excess, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But with two Br atoms, perhaps it's a di-elimination, forming a double bond. But then why the NMR shows a CH₂ at 4.79 ppm? That might be next to an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide turning into a carbonyl. Wait, if both Br leave, and the structure forms a double bond, but maybe that's followed by some kind of oxidation? No, KOH isn't oxidizing. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination? Hofmann usually involves quaternary ammonium salts, so maybe not here. Alternatively, maybe the two Br atoms are adjacent, so elimination would form a double bond. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Maybe the product is something else.

Wait, let's think again. When a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent halides) is treated with a strong base like KOH, it can undergo an elimination to form an alkene. But in this case, the product's NMR shows a CH₂ group around 4.79, which is typical for an -O-CH₂- group. Hmm, perhaps it's an epoxide. But wait, epoxide formation usually requires a peroxide or other oxidizing conditions, not just KOH.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane is brominated in a way that when KOH is applied, it forms an oxide. Wait, maybe it's forming a diketone, but that would require two eliminations. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol-like elimination, but that's when you have two adjacent diols, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps the product is actually a cyclopropane. No, that doesn't fit the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. Wait, if both Br are removed, and the carbon becomes a carbonyl. But with two Br atoms, maybe it's a double elimination leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a conjugated diene, but then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Unless the base is causing some kind of oxidation. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing the formation of a geminal diol, but that would require some kind of peroxide.

Wait, maybe I should look at the IR data. The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, probably a ketone or an ester. The NMR shows a triplet for the 2H at 4.79. That could be an oxygen-bearing CH₂ group, maybe like an ether or a ketone.

Wait, maybe when the two Br atoms are removed, the structure forms a carbonyl. Because in the structure of adamantane, if two adjacent CH2Br groups lose HBr, perhaps the adjacent carbons become a carbonyl. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a CH2 group. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two adjacent CH2Br groups. If each CH2Br loses HBr, then those two CH2s would become CH2 groups, but that doesn't form a carbonyl. Hmm, perhaps they combine into a single bond? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a double bond, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Wait, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond, but then maybe some other reaction. Or perhaps the base causes the formation of a ketone via some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantanone. Let me think about adamantane. Adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. If one of the CH2 groups is oxidized to a carbonyl, that would be adamantanone. But how would KOH cause that? Maybe through some elimination.

Wait, another approach: the first step is heating with KOH. So, KOH is a strong base, and when it reacts with vicinal dihalides (two adjacent Xs), it can cause elimination to form an alkene. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, it would eliminate two HBr molecules and form a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-diene adamantane, but wait, that doesn't explain the NMR and IR data.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. The IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. Let me think: if two adjacent Br atoms are eliminated as HBr, but then maybe the structure rearranges to form a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the base isn't just causing elimination but some kind of dehydrohalogenation with a subsequent ring opening.

Wait, perhaps after elimination, a cyclopropane forms. No, that doesn't fit the data.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has four rings. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons. So if those two positions each have Br, then upon elimination, perhaps the two adjacent CH2Br groups lose HBr, forming a double bond between those two carbons. So the product would be an adamantane with a double bond, making it an adamantine diene. But then, why the NMR shows a CH2 at 4.79 and a carbonyl in IR?

Wait, maybe the dehydrohalogenation isn't the only thing happening. Maybe the KOH is causing some kind of epoxidation? No, because KOH isn't an oxidizing agent for that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-elimination forming a ketone via some conjugate mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing the formation of a gem-diol, but that would require water. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone with an adjacent CH2 group. The H's at 4.79 ppm are likely split into a triplet, which suggests that the adjacent CH2 is next to another CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclic ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, another possibility: if the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and upon elimination, the two CH2Br groups lose HBr to form a carbonyl group. So, two CH2Br groups become a C=O.

Wait, that could happen if the two adjacent CH2Br groups lose HBr and form a double bond, but that wouldn't create a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the loss of HBr from each forms a ketone. But how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing an oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Oh wait, but perhaps it's causing a Hofmann-like elimination, but that requires an amine.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on the first step. Let me think about the next step to see if that gives me any clues.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So perhaps product 1 is an aromatic compound, but wait, adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is formed via some kind of alkylation or acylation.

Wait, product 1's NMR has a triplet at 4.79 (2H), which might be an -OCH₂CH₂- group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group with adjacent CH₂.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ether, but again, with a carbonyl in IR, that doesn't fit.

Wait, let's consider the IR again. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl, possibly a ketone. Let's say product 1 is a ketone. Then, when treated with Al(OR)3 (aluminum isopropoxide), which is a strong Lewis acid, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen condensation or some other carbonyl rearrangement. Or maybe it's a ring-opening.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is a diketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation to form a conjugated diene, and product 1 is an alkene. Then, treating with Al isopropoxide could lead to some addition or perhaps a dihydroxylation? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an ester or an acyl chloride, but I don't see how with Al isopropoxide.

Wait, perhaps the first step is forming an epoxide. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cyclopropane ring. No, but then the NMR wouldn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should look for similar reactions. 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH. Oh! Wait, maybe it's an example of the oxymercuration or some other elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the IR shows a strong absorbance at 1720, which is a ketone. So perhaps the first reaction converts the dihalide into a ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and their elimination leads to a carbonyl. Let's imagine each Br is on a CH2 group. If each CH2Br loses HBr, the adjacent carbons would each have a hydrogen removed, and perhaps the two carbons would form a double bond. But that would give an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, unless there's a neighboring group effect. For example, if the base abstracts a proton that leads to the formation of a carbonyl. But I'm not seeing how that would happen with two adjacent Br atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a ring-opening of the adamantane structure. But adamantane is quite stable and doesn't readily open under basic conditions.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about another possibility. If product 1 is an epoxide, but I'm not seeing the IR matching. Alternatively, product 1 could be a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, maybe the first step is a double elimination, forming an alkene, and product 1 is an adamantane diene. Then, when this is treated with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps it's undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction. But that requires a diene and a dienophile, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is reacting with itself in some way under the influence of Al isopropoxide.

But I'm not making progress on this. Let's try a different approach. Let's think about product 3.

Ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. Ozonolysis of a diene would typically break each double bond into fragments, forming carbonyl groups.

So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl-containing compounds. But product 3's NMR is being considered, and the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

Wait, but before that, product 2 is formed from product 1 by heating with Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another thought: product 1 is a diene (from elimination), product 2 is perhaps a dihydroxy compound (from some addition), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol or an enol ether.

Wait, let's try to outline each step.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid).

Assuming it's an elimination, product 1 is an alkene. But given the NMR, there's a CH2 group at 4.79, which might be next to an oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. How? Because each Br is on a CH2 group, two eliminations would form a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the mechanism is such that two adjacent CH2Br groups lose HBr and form a carbonyl. Wait, that would require each CH2Br to lose a hydrogen and the bromide, leading to a C=O. So, perhaps:

CH2Br-CH2Br → after elimination → C=O.

But in reality, elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps in this case, the structure is such that the two CH2Br groups are part of a ring. So, eliminating both HBr would result in a ring contraction, forming a carbonyl.

Ah, perhaps that's the case. For example, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons in a six-membered ring, eliminating both HBr would form a five-membered ring with a carbonyl group.

Wait, considering adamantane's structure, perhaps eliminating the two Brs in 1,3-dibromoadamantane leads to a structure where two adjacent CH2Br groups lose HBr, forming a carbonyl. So, the product would be a ketone.

If that's the case, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 1 would have a carbonyl group (IR at 1720 cm⁻¹). The NMR shows a triplet for 2H at 4.79, which would be adjacent to the carbonyl. So, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, making it a ketone.

So, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is often used in the formation of enol ethers or in some acylation reactions. But without a ring, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether formed via some kind of conjugate addition. Or perhaps it's a Claisen rearrangement, but that requires specific structures.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide to form an enol. Enols can tautomerize to ketones, but I'm not sure how that would form product 2.

Wait, another angle: perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some alkylation. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an enol ether, and product 2 is an acetal or something else.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of product 2 would break any double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond; therefore, product 1 must have formed a diene or an enol.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide undergoes some kind of dehydration to form an enol, which then isomerizes to form a double bond. So product 2 would have a double bond, making it susceptible to ozonolysis.

If that's the case, then product 2 has a double bond. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

So, let's outline:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (ketone) via elimination of two HBr.

2. Product 1 → product 2 (enol or diene) via Al isopropoxide, perhaps forming a conjugated diene.

3. Ozonolysis of product 2 → product 3, which has carbonyl groups.

Now, in product 3's NMR, the most deshielded hydrogen (likely next to a carbonyl) has a certain coupling pattern.

So, for product 3, let's think about the structure. Suppose product 2 is a diene, perhaps a conjugated diene. Ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would break each double bond into carbonyl groups. Wait, no, ozonolysis of a single double bond would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but product 2 might have a single double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave that into two carbonyl compounds.

But what about the coupling pattern in product 3?

The most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, perhaps it's a CH group next to a carbonyl.

If that CH is adjacent to another CH group, which in turn is adjacent to another, the coupling could be a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets, etc.

Wait, let's imagine the structure after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 is a diene, say, CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂- (but more likely, something with a bridge structure). Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, for example, if the structure is CH₂=CH-..., ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups, each with adjacent CH₂ groups.

Wait, but in the case of a bridge structure, the ozonolysis would create two carbonyl groups connected by the bridge.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, such as two ketone groups connected by a bridge.

The most deshielded hydrogen would be on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. Looking at the NMR, the triplet at 4.79 ppm in product 1 might correspond to an OCH₂ group, but in product 3, perhaps it's a CH₂ next to a carbonyl.

Wait, but in product 3, after ozonolysis, perhaps each CH₂ group next to the carbonyl would be split into a certain coupling pattern.

So, if a CH₂ is next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH₂, each of the two Hs on the CH₂ would be split by the neighboring CH₂. But if the neighboring CH₂ has two Hs, then each H in the first CH₂ would be a triplet (coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH₂).

Wait, but in product 3, the most deshielded H is perhaps on a CH₂ next to a carbonyl. So, each H would be split by the adjacent CH₂ group. Let's say the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. Then, the middle CH₂ groups would each have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. But that's a possibility.

Wait, but product 3 is the result of ozonolysis, which tends to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has a double bond in a certain position, product 3 would have carbonyls in those positions.

Wait, another possibility: product 2 is an enol ether. For example, if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether (like a conjugated dienol ether) that can undergo ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an alkene formed from product 1 via some elimination.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone (say, adamantanone), and product 2 is an enol, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide could form a conjugated diene.

If product 2 is a diene, then ozonolysis would cleave each double bond. But if it's a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded H is probably adjacent to a carbonyl. If it's a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, and that CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂ group, then each H in the first CH₂ would be split by the adjacent CH₂ group with two Hs. So each H would be a triplet.

But wait, if the CH₂ is next to another CH₂, which is next to another group, perhaps the splitting is more complex.

Wait, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3. Let's think about the structure after ozonolysis.

Assume product 2 is a conjugated dienol ether, which upon ozonolysis breaks into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 might have a structure like O=C-R, where R is a bridge or some substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, with each carbonyl group adjacent to a CH₂ group.

So, in product 3, the Hs on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would be split by neighboring Hs. If each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂, each H would see two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. But if there's more splitting, perhaps a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. Suppose the product after ozonolysis is a diketone with a bridge. For example, the structure could be something like:

O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O

In this case, each CH₂ group is between two carbonyl groups. The Hs on each CH₂ would be split by the adjacent CH₂ groups. So, each H on the first CH₂ would be next to two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. Each H would couple with two Hs on the next CH₂, leading to a triplet. But wait, each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂, so each H would split into a triplet, but perhaps there's another coupling.

Alternatively, if each CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group, and perhaps the other end is a CH group, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, another possibility: after ozonolysis, the product has a structure like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. Then, the middle CH₂ would be between two CH₂ groups. Each H in the middle would be split by the adjacent CH₂ groups on both sides, leading to additional splitting.

Wait, if a CH₂ is between two CH₂ groups, each H in the central CH₂ would couple with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other. So, each H would have (n+1)(m+1) where n and m are the neighboring Hs. So, 2+1 and 2+1 → 3×3 = 9 peaks → a nonet. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH₂ is next to a CH group. For example, O=C-CH₂-CH(CH3)-C=O. Then, the CH₂ would be next to a CH with three Hs. Wait, but then each H on the CH₂ would couple with the CH's Hs, leading to a quartet (if coupled with one H) or a triplet of doublets, etc. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, another angle: the most deshielded H in product 3 would likely be on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say that CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group which is next to another CH group. So, each H on the first CH₂ would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet. Additionally, if the adjacent CH₂ is next to a CH group with one H, each H on the first CH₂ would also couple with that H, leading to a triplet of triplets. But that depends on the structure.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ is next to a CH group, which is next to another CH₂, the splitting might be a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to be certain. Let's try to think about the options given.

The options are: triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

The most deshielded H would likely be on a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl. If that CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂, each H would be a triplet because of coupling with two Hs. But if that CH₂ is also next to a CH group (with one H), each H would split again into a doublet, making it a triplet of doublets, which isn't one of the options. Alternatively, if the adjacent group has two Hs, then it would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the CH₂ is next to a CH₂ group, which is next to a CH group. So each H on the first CH₂ would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH₂ (triplet), and each triplet would itself be split by the CH group's Hs. But if the CH group has one H, each H would split into a doublet, leading to a triplet of doublets. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ is next to a CH group with two Hs, perhaps the coupling would be a triplet of triplets. Wait, but a CH group can't have two Hs unless it's a CH₂.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the CH₂ is between two CH groups. Each CH has one H. So each H on the central CH₂ would couple with two Hs (from each adjacent CH), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, no, because each CH only has one H. So each H on the CH₂ would see one H from each adjacent CH, leading to a doublet of doublets. But that's not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about product 3 again.

Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis of a diene typically gives a diketone if the diene is conjugated. So, product 3 could be a diketone.

If product 3 is a diketone, the structure would have two carbonyl groups. The Hs adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded. Let's say the structure is something like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. The CH₂ groups in the middle would each have two Hs.

Each H on the CH₂ would be coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH₂ group. So, each H would have a triplet coupling pattern.

But wait, the question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H, which would be the one closest to the carbonyl. So, the Hs on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would be more deshielded than the middle CH₂.

So, the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyl would each have two Hs, and each H would be coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. So, each H would be a triplet.

But let's think about the actual splitting. Each H on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl is adjacent to another CH₂ group. So, each H in the first CH₂ would be split by the two Hs in the adjacent CH₂. So, each would be a triplet.

But wait, the problem states to exclude Hs that exchange with the solvent. So, any acidic protons like -OH are not considered.

So, in product 3, the most deshielded H is on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl. Each H is split by the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is a triplet. So the answer might be A.

But wait, another possibility: if the CH₂ is next to another group, like a CH group with one H, then each H would be a doublet from coupling with that H and a triplet from the adjacent CH₂.

Wait, but if the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH(CH3)-C=O, then the CH₂ would be next to a CH(CH3) group. Each H on the CH₂ would be coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH(CH3), leading to a triplet. Additionally, if the CH(CH3) has another H, perhaps it's a more complex splitting, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH₂ is next to a CH₂ group, which is next to another CH₂. In that case, each H would be coupled with two Hs on each adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but if the CH₂ is next to two CH₂ groups, the splitting would be more complex. For example, each H on the central CH₂ would be coupled with two Hs on each side, leading to (2+1) × (2+1) = 9 peaks, a nonet, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let's think about the options again. The options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

If the most deshielded H is on a CH₂ next to another CH₂ group, each H would be a triplet. So option A is triplet.

But wait, another scenario: perhaps the CH₂ is next to a CH group with two Hs. Then, each H would be coupled with two Hs, leading to a triplet. But if that CH group is also next to another CH group, perhaps the splitting becomes a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ is between two CH groups, each with one H. Then, each H on the CH₂ would couple with two Hs (from each CH), leading to a triplet of doublets. But that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the CH₂ is part of a cyclopropane ring. Then, each H would have two adjacent Hs, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH₂ is next to a CH₂ group, which is next to another CH₂ group. So each H would be split by two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let me imagine the structure as O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. The middle CH₂ would be next to two CH₂ groups, each with two Hs. Each H in the middle would be split by four Hs in total (two from each adjacent CH₂), but that's not possible because each H can only couple with adjacent Hs.

Wait, no, each H on the middle CH₂ would couple with the two Hs on each adjacent CH₂. So, each H would have two couplings: one with two Hs on the left and one with two Hs on the right. So, the splitting would be (n+1)(m+1), where n=2 and m=2. So, (2+1)(2+1) = 9, a nonet. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH(CH2X)-C=O, where X is some group. Then, the CH₂ would be next to a CH group. Each H on the CH₂ would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH group, leading to a triplet. But again, the CH group would have one H, so each H on the CH₂ would be a doublet, not a triplet.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is an enol, which upon ozonolysis forms another structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a conjugated diene, and ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyls. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

If product 3 is a simple diketone, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyls would be on CH₂ groups. Each CH₂ would be adjacent to another CH₂ group, leading to triplet coupling.

But then, the triplet would be the correct answer.

Wait, but the options include triplet of triplets, which suggests more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ group is next to a CH group and a CH₂ group. So, each H on the CH₂ would be coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH₂ and one H from the adjacent CH. That would lead to a triplet of doublets, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the CH₂ is next to a CH group with two Hs. Then, each H would be a triplet from the adjacent CH₂ and a doublet from the adjacent CH group, leading to a triplet of doublets. Again, not an option.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again. The options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

The most deshielded H is on a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl. If the CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group, each H would be a triplet. So the answer would be A) triplet.

But then why is the option B) triplet of triplets present? Maybe there's another coupling. Perhaps the CH₂ is next to two different groups, each providing a triplet. For example, if the CH₂ is next to a CH group with two Hs and another CH group with two Hs, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ is part of a cyclopropane ring, leading to each H being coupled with two Hs from each adjacent ring CH₂, but that's speculative.

Wait, another possibility: the CH₂ is next to a CH group with two Hs and another CH group with two Hs. So, each H on the CH₂ would see two Hs from each adjacent group, leading to (2+1)(2+1)=9, a nonet, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ is next to a CH group with one H and another CH group with one H. Then, each H on the CH₂ would be coupled with two Hs, leading to a triplet. So, the answer would be A) triplet.

Another angle: perhaps the product 3 is a diketone with a bridge, making the CH₂ groups each adjacent to two other CH₂ groups, leading to more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 3's structure is such that the most deshielded H is on a CH group, not a CH₂. But that would require the structure to have a CH next to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps ozonolysis of product 2, which is a diene, forms two carbonyl groups, each attached to a CH group. For example, O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. No, that would still have CH₂ groups.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the options and the reasoning that the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would be a triplet, I'll go with option A) triplet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Heating with KOH**  
   - The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, undergoes elimination of two HBr molecules.  
   - The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the formation of a carbonyl group (likely a ketone).  
   - The NMR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), suggesting a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.  
   - Thus, product 1 is likely a ketone.

2. **Reaction 2: Heating with Al isopropoxide**  
   - Al isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates a rearrangement or forms a reactive intermediate (e.g., an enol or diene).  
   - Product 2 is formed, which contains a double bond or a reactive structure susceptible to ozonolysis.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis followed by dimethyl sulfide**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl-containing products.  
   - Product 3 is a diketone or a carbonyl-containing compound.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group.  

4. **Coupling Pattern Analysis**  
   - The CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl is deshielded and coupled with neighboring hydrogens.  
   - If the CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂ group, each hydrogen on the CH₂ would be split into a triplet due to coupling with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂.  
   - This results in a coupling pattern of a **triplet** for the most deshielded hydrogen.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

ANSWER: A

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure.

First reaction: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and since it's heated, maybe it's an elimination reaction. Wait, but wait—bromine and KOH under heat usually lead to elimination, like dehydrohalogenation. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two adjacent bromines. If both leave, that would form a double bond. So, elimination would form an alkene. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The NMR spectrum of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm with 2H, which is probably a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen, considering the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe a ketone?

Wait, when you have two adjacent Br atoms in a molecule and you treat with KOH, it's possible that it's a double elimination, but maybe it's a Dieckmann-type elimination? No, Dieckmann is for cyclic esters. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but given the NMR and IR, perhaps it's forming an epoxide? No, because the IR doesn't show the typical epoxide absorption. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming a ketone via a different mechanism.

Wait, another possibility. If KOH is in excess, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But with two Br atoms, perhaps it's a di-elimination, forming a double bond. But then why the NMR shows a CH₂ at 4.79 ppm? That might be next to an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide turning into a carbonyl. Wait, if both Br leave, and the structure forms a double bond, but maybe that's followed by some kind of oxidation? No, KOH isn't oxidizing. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination? Hofmann usually involves quaternary ammonium salts, so maybe not here. Alternatively, maybe the two Br atoms are adjacent, so elimination would form a double bond. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Maybe the product is something else.

Wait, let's think again. When a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent halides) is treated with a strong base like KOH, it can undergo an elimination to form an alkene. But in this case, the product's NMR shows a CH₂ group around 4.79, which is typical for an -O-CH₂- group. Hmm, perhaps it's an epoxide. But wait, epoxide formation usually requires a peroxide or other oxidizing conditions, not just KOH.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane is brominated in a way that when KOH is applied, it forms an oxide. Wait, maybe it's forming a diketone, but that would require two eliminations. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol-like elimination, but that's when you have two adjacent diols, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps the product is actually a cyclopropane. No, that doesn't fit the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. Wait, if both Br are removed, and the carbon becomes a carbonyl. But with two Br atoms, maybe it's a double elimination leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a conjugated diene, but then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Unless the base is causing some kind of oxidation. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing the formation of a geminal diol, but that would require some kind of peroxide.

Wait, maybe I should look at the IR data. The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, probably a ketone or an ester. The NMR shows a triplet for the 2H at 4.79. That could be an oxygen-bearing CH₂ group, maybe like an ether or a ketone.

Wait, maybe when the two Br atoms are removed, the structure forms a carbonyl. Because in the structure of adamantane, if two adjacent CH2Br groups lose HBr, perhaps the adjacent carbons become a carbonyl. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a CH2 group. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two adjacent CH2Br groups. If each CH2Br loses HBr, then those two CH2s would become CH2 groups, but that doesn't form a carbonyl. Hmm, perhaps they combine into a single bond? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a double bond, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Wait, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond, but then maybe some other reaction. Or perhaps the base causes the formation of a ketone via some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantanone. Let me think about adamantane. Adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. If one of the CH2 groups is oxidized to a carbonyl, that would be adamantanone. But how would KOH cause that? Maybe through some elimination.

Wait, another approach: the first step is heating with KOH. So, KOH is a strong base, and when it reacts with vicinal dihalides (two adjacent Xs), it can cause elimination to form an alkene. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, it would eliminate two HBr molecules and form a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-diene adamantane, but wait, that doesn't explain the NMR and IR data.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. The IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. Let me think: if two adjacent Br atoms are eliminated as HBr, but then maybe the structure rearranges to form a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the base isn't just causing elimination but some kind of dehydrohalogenation with a subsequent ring opening.

Wait, perhaps after elimination, a cyclopropane forms. No, that doesn't fit the data.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has four rings. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons. So if those two positions each have Br, then upon elimination, perhaps the two adjacent CH2Br groups lose HBr, forming a double bond between those two carbons. So the product would be an adamantane with a double bond, making it an adamantine diene. But then, why the NMR shows a CH2 at 4.79 and a carbonyl in IR?

Wait, maybe the dehydrohalogenation isn't the only thing happening. Maybe the KOH is causing some kind of epoxidation? No, because KOH isn't an oxidizing agent for that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-elimination forming a ketone via some conjugate mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing the formation of a gem-diol, but that would require water. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone with an adjacent CH2 group. The H's at 4.79 ppm are likely split into a triplet, which suggests that the adjacent CH2 is next to another CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclic ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, another possibility: if the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and upon elimination, the two CH2Br groups lose HBr to form a carbonyl group. So, two CH2Br groups become a C=O.

Wait, that could happen if the two adjacent CH2Br groups lose HBr and form a double bond, but that wouldn't create a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the loss of HBr from each forms a ketone. But how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing an oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Oh wait, but perhaps it's causing a Hofmann-like elimination, but that requires an amine.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on the first step. Let me think about the next step to see if that gives me any clues.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So perhaps product 1 is an aromatic compound, but wait, adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is formed via some kind of alkylation or acylation.

Wait, product 1's NMR has a triplet at 4.79 (2H), which might be an -OCH₂CH₂- group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group with adjacent CH₂.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ether, but again, with a carbonyl in IR, that doesn't fit.

Wait, let's consider the IR again. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl, possibly a ketone. Let's say product 1 is a ketone. Then, when treated with Al(OR)3 (aluminum isopropoxide), which is a strong Lewis acid, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen condensation or some other carbonyl rearrangement. Or maybe it's a ring-opening.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is a diketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation to form a conjugated diene, and product 1 is an alkene. Then, treating with Al isopropoxide could lead to some addition or perhaps a dihydroxylation? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an ester or an acyl chloride, but I don't see how with Al isopropoxide.

Wait, perhaps the first step is forming an epoxide. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cyclopropane ring. No, but then the NMR wouldn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should look for similar reactions. 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH. Oh! Wait, maybe it's an example of the oxymercuration or some other elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the IR shows a strong absorbance at 1720, which is a ketone. So perhaps the first reaction converts the dihalide into a ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and their elimination leads to a carbonyl. Let's imagine each Br is on a CH2 group. If each CH2Br loses HBr, the adjacent carbons would each have a hydrogen removed, and perhaps the two carbons would form a double bond. But that would give an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, unless there's a neighboring group effect. For example, if the base abstracts a proton that leads to the formation of a carbonyl. But I'm not seeing how that would happen with two adjacent Br atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a ring-opening of the adamantane structure. But adamantane is quite stable and doesn't readily open under basic conditions.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about another possibility. If product 1 is an epoxide, but I'm not seeing the IR matching. Alternatively, product 1 could be a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, maybe the first step is a double elimination, forming an alkene, and product 1 is an adamantane diene. Then, when this is treated with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps it's undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction. But that requires a diene and a dienophile, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is reacting with itself in some way under the influence of Al isopropoxide.

But I'm not making progress on this. Let's try a different approach. Let's think about product 3.

Ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. Ozonolysis of a diene would typically break each double bond into fragments, forming carbonyl groups.

So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl-containing compounds. But product 3's NMR is being considered, and the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

Wait, but before that, product 2 is formed from product 1 by heating with Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another thought: product 1 is a diene (from elimination), product 2 is perhaps a dihydroxy compound (from some addition), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol or an enol ether.

Wait, let's try to outline each step.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid).

Assuming it's an elimination, product 1 is an alkene. But given the NMR, there's a CH2 group at 4.79, which might be next to an oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. How? Because each Br is on a CH2 group, two eliminations would form a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the mechanism is such that two adjacent CH2Br groups lose HBr and form a carbonyl. Wait, that would require each CH2Br to lose a hydrogen and the bromide, leading to a C=O. So, perhaps:

CH2Br-CH2Br → after elimination → C=O.

But in reality, elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps in this case, the structure is such that the two CH2Br groups are part of a ring. So, eliminating both HBr would result in a ring contraction, forming a carbonyl.

Ah, perhaps that's the case. For example, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons in a six-membered ring, eliminating both HBr would form a five-membered ring with a carbonyl group.

Wait, considering adamantane's structure, perhaps eliminating the two Brs in 1,3-dibromoadamantane leads to a structure where two adjacent CH2Br groups lose HBr, forming a carbonyl. So, the product would be a ketone.

If that's the case, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 1 would have a carbonyl group (IR at 1720 cm⁻¹). The NMR shows a triplet for 2H at 4.79, which would be adjacent to the carbonyl. So, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, making it a ketone.

So, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is often used in the formation of enol ethers or in some acylation reactions. But without a ring, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether formed via some kind of conjugate addition. Or perhaps it's a Claisen rearrangement, but that requires specific structures.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide to form an enol. Enols can tautomerize to ketones, but I'm not sure how that would form product 2.

Wait, another angle: perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some alkylation. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an enol ether, and product 2 is an acetal or something else.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of product 2 would break any double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond; therefore, product 1 must have formed a diene or an enol.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide undergoes some kind of dehydration to form an enol, which then isomerizes to form a double bond. So product 2 would have a double bond, making it susceptible to ozonolysis.

If that's the case, then product 2 has a double bond. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

So, let's outline:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (ketone) via elimination of two HBr.

2. Product 1 → product 2 (enol or diene) via Al isopropoxide, perhaps forming a conjugated diene.

3. Ozonolysis of product 2 → product 3, which has carbonyl groups.

Now, in product 3's NMR, the most deshielded hydrogen (likely next to a carbonyl) has a certain coupling pattern.

So, for product 3, let's think about the structure. Suppose product 2 is a diene, perhaps a conjugated diene. Ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would break each double bond into carbonyl groups. Wait, no, ozonolysis of a single double bond would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but product 2 might have a single double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave that into two carbonyl compounds.

But what about the coupling pattern in product 3?

The most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, perhaps it's a CH group next to a carbonyl.

If that CH is adjacent to another CH group, which in turn is adjacent to another, the coupling could be a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets, etc.

Wait, let's imagine the structure after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 is a diene, say, CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂- (but more likely, something with a bridge structure). Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, for example, if the structure is CH₂=CH-..., ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups, each with adjacent CH₂ groups.

Wait, but in the case of a bridge structure, the ozonolysis would create two carbonyl groups connected by the bridge.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, such as two ketone groups connected by a bridge.

The most deshielded hydrogen would be on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. Looking at the NMR, the triplet at 4.79 ppm in product 1 might correspond to an OCH₂ group, but in product 3, perhaps it's a CH₂ next to a carbonyl.

Wait, but in product 3, after ozonolysis, perhaps each CH₂ group next to the carbonyl would be split into a certain coupling pattern.

So, if a CH₂ is next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH₂, each of the two Hs on the CH₂ would be split by the neighboring CH₂. But if the neighboring CH₂ has two Hs, then each H in the first CH₂ would be a triplet (coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH₂).

Wait, but in product 3, the most deshielded H is perhaps on a CH₂ next to a carbonyl. So, each H would be split by the adjacent CH₂ group. Let's say the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. Then, the middle CH₂ groups would each have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. But that's a possibility.

Wait, but product 3 is the result of ozonolysis, which tends to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has a double bond in a certain position, product 3 would have carbonyls in those positions.

Wait, another possibility: product 2 is an enol ether. For example, if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether (like a conjugated dienol ether) that can undergo ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an alkene formed from product 1 via some elimination.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone (say, adamantanone), and product 2 is an enol, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide could form a conjugated diene.

If product 2 is a diene, then ozonolysis would cleave each double bond. But if it's a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded H is probably adjacent to a carbonyl. If it's a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, and that CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂ group, then each H in the first CH₂ would be split by the adjacent CH₂ group with two Hs. So each H would be a triplet.

But wait, if the CH₂ is next to another CH₂, which is next to another group, perhaps the splitting is more complex.

Wait, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3. Let's think about the structure after ozonolysis.

Assume product 2 is a conjugated dienol ether, which upon ozonolysis breaks into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 might have a structure like O=C-R, where R is a bridge or some substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, with each carbonyl group adjacent to a CH₂ group.

So, in product 3, the Hs on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would be split by neighboring Hs. If each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂, each H would see two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. But if there's more splitting, perhaps a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. Suppose the product after ozonolysis is a diketone with a bridge. For example, the structure could be something like:

O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O

In this case, each CH₂ group is between two carbonyl groups. The Hs on each CH₂ would be split by the adjacent CH₂ groups. So, each H on the first CH₂ would be next to two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. Each H would couple with two Hs on the next CH₂, leading to a triplet. But wait, each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂, so each H would split into a triplet, but perhaps there's another coupling.

Alternatively, if each CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group, and perhaps the other end is a CH group, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, another possibility: after ozonolysis, the product has a structure like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. Then, the middle CH₂ would be between two CH₂ groups. Each H in the middle would be split by the adjacent CH₂ groups on both sides, leading to additional splitting.

Wait, if a CH₂ is between two CH₂ groups, each H in the central CH₂ would couple with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other. So, each H would have (n+1)(m+1) where n and m are the neighboring Hs. So, 2+1 and 2+1 → 3×3 = 9 peaks → a nonet. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH₂ is next to a CH group. For example, O=C-CH₂-CH(CH3)-C=O. Then, the CH₂ would be next to a CH with three Hs. Wait, but then each H on the CH₂ would couple with the CH's Hs, leading to a quartet (if coupled with one H) or a triplet of doublets, etc. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, another angle: the most deshielded H in product 3 would likely be on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say that CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group which is next to another CH group. So, each H on the first CH₂ would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet. Additionally, if the adjacent CH₂ is next to a CH group with one H, each H on the first CH₂ would also couple with that H, leading to a triplet of triplets. But that depends on the structure.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ is next to a CH group, which is next to another CH₂, the splitting might be a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to be certain. Let's try to think about the options given.

The options are: triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

The most deshielded H would likely be on a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl. If that CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂, each H would be a triplet because of coupling with two Hs. But if that CH₂ is also next to a CH group (with one H), each H would split again into a doublet, making it a triplet of doublets, which isn't one of the options. Alternatively, if the adjacent group has two Hs, then it would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the CH₂ is next to a CH₂ group, which is next to a CH group. So each H on the first CH₂ would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH₂ (triplet), and each triplet would itself be split by the CH group's Hs. But if the CH group has one H, each H would split into a doublet, leading to a triplet of doublets. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ is next to a CH group with two Hs, perhaps the coupling would be a triplet of triplets. Wait, but a CH group can't have two Hs unless it's a CH₂.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the CH₂ is between two CH groups. Each CH has one H. So each H on the central CH₂ would couple with two Hs (from each adjacent CH), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, no, because each CH only has one H. So each H on the CH₂ would see one H from each adjacent CH, leading to a doublet of doublets. But that's not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about product 3 again.

Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis of a diene typically gives a diketone if the diene is conjugated. So, product 3 could be a diketone.

If product 3 is a diketone, the structure would have two carbonyl groups. The Hs adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded. Let's say the structure is something like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. The CH₂ groups in the middle would each have two Hs.

Each H on the CH₂ would be coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH₂ group. So, each H would have a triplet coupling pattern.

But wait, the question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H, which would be the one closest to the carbonyl. So, the Hs on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would be more deshielded than the middle CH₂.

So, the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyl would each have two Hs, and each H would be coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. So, each H would be a triplet.

But let's think about the actual splitting. Each H on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl is adjacent to another CH₂ group. So, each H in the first CH₂ would be split by the two Hs in the adjacent CH₂. So, each would be a triplet.

But wait, the problem states to exclude Hs that exchange with the solvent. So, any acidic protons like -OH are not considered.

So, in product 3, the most deshielded H is on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl. Each H is split by the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is a triplet. So the answer might be A.

But wait, another possibility: if the CH₂ is next to another group, like a CH group with one H, then each H would be a doublet from coupling with that H and a triplet from the adjacent CH₂.

Wait, but if the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH(CH3)-C=O, then the CH₂ would be next to a CH(CH3) group. Each H on the CH₂ would be coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH(CH3), leading to a triplet. Additionally, if the CH(CH3) has another H, perhaps it's a more complex splitting, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH₂ is next to a CH₂ group, which is next to another CH₂. In that case, each H would be coupled with two Hs on each adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but if the CH₂ is next to two CH₂ groups, the splitting would be more complex. For example, each H on the central CH₂ would be coupled with two Hs on each side, leading to (2+1) × (2+1) = 9 peaks, a nonet, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let's think about the options again. The options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

If the most deshielded H is on a CH₂ next to another CH₂ group, each H would be a triplet. So option A is triplet.

But wait, another scenario: perhaps the CH₂ is next to a CH group with two Hs. Then, each H would be coupled with two Hs, leading to a triplet. But if that CH group is also next to another CH group, perhaps the splitting becomes a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ is between two CH groups, each with one H. Then, each H on the CH₂ would couple with two Hs (from each CH), leading to a triplet of doublets. But that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the CH₂ is part of a cyclopropane ring. Then, each H would have two adjacent Hs, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH₂ is next to a CH₂ group, which is next to another CH₂ group. So each H would be split by two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let me imagine the structure as O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. The middle CH₂ would be next to two CH₂ groups, each with two Hs. Each H in the middle would be split by four Hs in total (two from each adjacent CH₂), but that's not possible because each H can only couple with adjacent Hs.

Wait, no, each H on the middle CH₂ would couple with the two Hs on each adjacent CH₂. So, each H would have two couplings: one with two Hs on the left and one with two Hs on the right. So, the splitting would be (n+1)(m+1), where n=2 and m=2. So, (2+1)(2+1) = 9, a nonet. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH(CH2X)-C=O, where X is some group. Then, the CH₂ would be next to a CH group. Each H on the CH₂ would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH group, leading to a triplet. But again, the CH group would have one H, so each H on the CH₂ would be a doublet, not a triplet.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is an enol, which upon ozonolysis forms another structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a conjugated diene, and ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyls. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

If product 3 is a simple diketone, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyls would be on CH₂ groups. Each CH₂ would be adjacent to another CH₂ group, leading to triplet coupling.

But then, the triplet would be the correct answer.

Wait, but the options include triplet of triplets, which suggests more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ group is next to a CH group and a CH₂ group. So, each H on the CH₂ would be coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH₂ and one H from the adjacent CH. That would lead to a triplet of doublets, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the CH₂ is next to a CH group with two Hs. Then, each H would be a triplet from the adjacent CH₂ and a doublet from the adjacent CH group, leading to a triplet of doublets. Again, not an option.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again. The options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

The most deshielded H is on a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl. If the CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group, each H would be a triplet. So the answer would be A) triplet.

But then why is the option B) triplet of triplets present? Maybe there's another coupling. Perhaps the CH₂ is next to two different groups, each providing a triplet. For example, if the CH₂ is next to a CH group with two Hs and another CH group with two Hs, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ is part of a cyclopropane ring, leading to each H being coupled with two Hs from each adjacent ring CH₂, but that's speculative.

Wait, another possibility: the CH₂ is next to a CH group with two Hs and another CH group with two Hs. So, each H on the CH₂ would see two Hs from each adjacent group, leading to (2+1)(2+1)=9, a nonet, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ is next to a CH group with one H and another CH group with one H. Then, each H on the CH₂ would be coupled with two Hs, leading to a triplet. So, the answer would be A) triplet.

Another angle: perhaps the product 3 is a diketone with a bridge, making the CH₂ groups each adjacent to two other CH₂ groups, leading to more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 3's structure is such that the most deshielded H is on a CH group, not a CH₂. But that would require the structure to have a CH next to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps ozonolysis of product 2, which is a diene, forms two carbonyl groups, each attached to a CH group. For example, O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. No, that would still have CH₂ groups.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the options and the reasoning that the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would be a triplet, I'll go with option A) triplet.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Heating with KOH**  
   - The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, undergoes elimination of two HBr molecules.  
   - The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the formation of a carbonyl group (likely a ketone).  
   - The NMR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), suggesting a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.  
   - Thus, product 1 is likely a ketone.

2. **Reaction 2: Heating with Al isopropoxide**  
   - Al isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates a rearrangement or forms a reactive intermediate (e.g., an enol or diene).  
   - Product 2 is formed, which contains a double bond or a reactive structure susceptible to ozonolysis.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis followed by dimethyl sulfide**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl-containing products.  
   - Product 3 is a diketone or a carbonyl-containing compound.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group.  

4. **Coupling Pattern Analysis**  
   - The CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl is deshielded and coupled with neighboring hydrogens.  
   - If the CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂ group, each hydrogen on the CH₂ would be split into a triplet due to coupling with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂.  
   - This results in a coupling pattern of a **triplet** for the most deshielded hydrogen.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.
