Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read through it again. So, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but usually quantum states are represented as vectors with complex numbers and normalized, right? So I should probably check the norm of this vector.

Wait, the vector has components -1, 2, 1. Let me compute the squared magnitude: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm squared is 6. That means it's not normalized. So maybe I should normalize it first because probabilities depend on it.

So the normalized state would be the original vector divided by sqrt(6). So the state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Next, the operators for observables P and Q are given. Let me write down their matrices.

P's matrix is:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Wait, that's a 3x3 matrix. Let me think about its structure. It seems like it's a symmetric matrix, which is good because observables should be Hermitian.

Q's matrix is diagonal:
First row: 1,0,0
Second row:0,0,0
Third row:0,0,-1.

So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. Wait, no—wait, the question says someone measures Q just after measuring P. But the problem asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements.

Wait, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of the operator. So the process here is: first measure P, then measure Q. But wait, the measurements are done in sequence: first P, then Q. So the probability is the probability that, after P is measured and the state collapses, measuring Q gives -1.

Wait, but the problem says: the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So, first we get 0 for P, which means the state collapses into an eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0. Then, the subsequent measurement of Q must give -1.

But wait, perhaps I should compute the probabilities step by step.

So, first, find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of P. Because when you measure P, the possible results are its eigenvalues, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector.

Alternatively, since P is a 3x3 matrix, perhaps it's easier to compute the probability that P yields 0 and then, given that, Q yields -1.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's see.

First, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Because without that, I can't proceed.

But wait, looking at P's matrix, perhaps it's a sparse matrix. Let me look for the eigenvalues.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]

Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Hmm. Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

I can try to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. Let's call the eigenvalues λ. The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So,

| -λ    1/√2      0     |
|1/√2  -λ    1/√2 |
|0     1/√2   -λ    |

Computing the determinant:

Expanding the first row:

-λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] ) - (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] ) + 0 * something.

So:

= -λ [ ( (-λ)(-λ) ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ]  - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ) ]

Simplify each part.

First term:

-λ [ λ^2 - (1/2) ].

Second term:

- (1/√2) [ ( -λ / √2 ) ].

So the second term becomes (λ) / (√2 * √2) ) = λ/2.

So putting it together:

-λ ( λ² - 1/2 ) + λ/2 = 0

Multiply out:

-λ³ + (λ)(1/2) ) + λ/2 = 0

So:

-λ³ + ( (1/2)λ + (1/2)λ ) = 0 → -λ³ + λ = 0.

Factor: λ ( -λ² + 1 ) =0. So λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, so P has three possible outcomes: 1, 0, -1.

So when measuring P, the possible outcomes are these, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvectors.

But the question is about getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So first, the state after measuring P=0 is the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0, normalized.

So, let's find the eigenvectors for P when λ=0.

The equation (P - 0 I) |v> =0 → P|v>=0.

So, the matrix for P is as written. So the equations are:

(1) (0)(v1) + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

(2) (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + (0) v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 =0.

(3) 0 v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 =0 → v2=0.

So from (1) and (3), v2=0.

From (2), v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors are vectors where v2=0 and v1= -v3. Let's write this as:

v1 = a,

v2=0,

v3= -a.

So the eigenvector is a*(1, 0, -1). But we need to normalize it.

So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) because the norm is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2).

Wait, wait, sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstate for P=0 is |ψ_p0> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6). So when we measure P, the probability of getting 0 is the square of the inner product between |ψ> and |ψ_p0>.

So compute <ψ_p0 | ψ>.

Wait, |ψ> is the original state divided by sqrt(6). So |ψ> = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

So the inner product is ψ_p0^† ψ.

Compute it:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * (1/sqrt(6) )

Which is [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(6)) ) ]

So that's (-2) / (sqrt(12)) ) → sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2 sqrt(3). So it becomes (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= -1/(sqrt(3)).

The magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

If that happens, the state collapses into |ψ_p0>.

Then, we measure Q. What's the probability of getting -1 in that state?

So the operator Q is diagonal: diag(1, 0, -1). Its eigenstates are the standard basis vectors.

So the eigenstates are |1> = (1,0,0), |0> = (0,1,0), |-1> = (0,0,1).

Wait, no, wait. Q acting on |1> gives 1*|1>, and on | -1> gives (-1) | -1> ?

Wait, no, because the matrix Q is:

[1 0 0

0 0 0

0 0 -1 ]

So it's diagonal and the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

So |1> is (1,0,0)^T, |0> is (0,1,0)^T, and |-1> is (0,0,1)^T.

So, the state after measuring P=0 is |ψ_p0> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

So to find the probability that measuring Q gives -1, we compute the inner product between |ψ_p0> and | -1> (the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue -1).

The inner product is (0, 0, 1) ⋅ (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T. Wait, no, actually, the inner product is the complex conjugate transpose of |ψ_p0> multiplied by | -1>.

But since all elements are real, it's just the dot product.

So |ψ_p0> ⋅ | -1> = 0*0 + 0*0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 → -1/sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of getting -1 in Q, given that P was measured to be 0, is 1/2.

So the combined probability is P(P=0) * P(Q=-1 | P=0) → (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Because when you have two measurements, the total probability is the product of the probability of the first outcome and the conditional probability of the second given the first.

So yes, 1/3 multiplied by 1/2 gives 1/6. So the answer would be 1/6.

Looking at the options, D is 1/6.

Wait, but let me double-check where I could have made a mistake.

Wait, another approach is to compute the probability amplitude for the combined event P=0 and Q=-1.

But perhaps the order is important. Since we measure P first, the state after the first measurement affects the second measurement.

So the steps are correct. First, compute the amplitude for P=0, then find the amplitude for Q=-1 in that state.

So the overall probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the correct answer is option D) 1/6.

To solve the problem, we analyze the sequence of measurements and compute the probabilities step by step.

### Step 1: Normalize the initial state
The given state vector is \( \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is calculated as:

\[
\| \psi \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is given by:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found by solving \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector is determined by solving \( P | \psi_p0 \rangle = 0 \). This gives the eigenvector:

\[
| \psi_p0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the inner product between the normalized state \( | \psi \rangle \) and the eigenvector \( | \psi_p0 \rangle \):

\[
P(P = 0) = \langle \psi_p0 | \psi \rangle^2.
\]

Compute the inner product:

\[
\langle \psi_p0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} \right) + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P = 0) = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors \( |1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( |0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( |-1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \( | \psi_p0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the inner product between \( | \psi_p0 \rangle \) and \( |-1\rangle \):

\[
P(Q = -1 | P = 0) = \langle -1 | \psi_p0 \rangle^2.
\]

Compute the inner product:

\[
\langle -1 | \psi_p0 \rangle = 0 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 0 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(Q = -1 | P = 0) = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Total probability
The total probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P = 0 \text{ and } Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1 | P = 0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}
\]

P's matrix is:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Wait, that's a 3x3 matrix. Let me think about its structure. It seems like it's a symmetric matrix, which is good because observables should be Hermitian.

Q's matrix is diagonal:

Alternatively, since P is a 3x3 matrix, perhaps it's easier to compute the probability that P yields 0 and then, given that, Q yields -1.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's see.

First, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Because without that, I can't proceed.

But wait, looking at P's matrix, perhaps it's a sparse matrix. Let me look for the eigenvalues.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]

Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Hmm. Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

I can try to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. Let's call the eigenvalues λ. The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So,

| -λ    1/√2      0     |
|1/√2  -λ    1/√2 |
|0     1/√2   -λ    |

Computing the determinant:

Expanding the first row:

-λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] ) - (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] ) + 0 * something.

So:

= -λ [ ( (-λ)(-λ) ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ]  - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ) ]

Simplify each part.

First term:

-λ [ λ^2 - (1/2) ].

Second term:

- (1/√2) [ ( -λ / √2 ) ].

So the second term becomes (λ) / (√2 * √2) ) = λ/2.

So putting it together:

-λ ( λ² - 1/2 ) + λ/2 = 0

Multiply out:

-λ³ + (λ)(1/2) ) + λ/2 = 0

So:

-λ³ + ( (1/2)λ + (1/2)λ ) = 0 → -λ³ + λ = 0.

Factor: λ ( -λ² + 1 ) =0. So λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, so P has three possible outcomes: 1, 0, -1.

So when measuring P, the possible outcomes are these, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvectors.

But the question is about getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So first, the state after measuring P=0 is the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0, normalized.

So, let's find the eigenvectors for P when λ=0.

The equation (P - 0 I) |v> =0 → P|v>=0.

So, the matrix for P is as written. So the equations are:

(1) (0)(v1) + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

(2) (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + (0) v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 =0.

(3) 0 v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 =0 → v2=0.

So from (1) and (3), v2=0.

From (2), v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors are vectors where v2=0 and v1= -v3. Let's write this as:

v1 = a,

v2=0,

v3= -a.

So the eigenvector is a*(1, 0, -1). But we need to normalize it.

So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) because the norm is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2).

Wait, wait, sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstate for P=0 is |ψ_p0> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6). So when we measure P, the probability of getting 0 is the square of the inner product between |ψ> and |ψ_p0>.

So compute <ψ_p0 | ψ>.

Wait, |ψ> is the original state divided by sqrt(6). So |ψ> = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

So the inner product is ψ_p0^† ψ.

Compute it:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * (1/sqrt(6) )

Which is [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(6)) ) ]

So that's (-2) / (sqrt(12)) ) → sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2 sqrt(3). So it becomes (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= -1/(sqrt(3)).

The magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

If that happens, the state collapses into |ψ_p0>.

Then, we measure Q. What's the probability of getting -1 in that state?

So the operator Q is diagonal: diag(1, 0, -1). Its eigenstates are the standard basis vectors.

So the eigenstates are |1> = (1,0,0), |0> = (0,1,0), |-1> = (0,0,1).

Wait, no, wait. Q acting on |1> gives 1*|1>, and on | -1> gives (-1) | -1> ?

Wait, no, because the matrix Q is:

[1 0 0

0 0 0

0 0 -1 ]

So it's diagonal and the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

So |1> is (1,0,0)^T, |0> is (0,1,0)^T, and |-1> is (0,0,1)^T.

So, the state after measuring P=0 is |ψ_p0> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

So to find the probability that measuring Q gives -1, we compute the inner product between |ψ_p0> and | -1> (the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue -1).

The inner product is (0, 0, 1) ⋅ (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T. Wait, no, actually, the inner product is the complex conjugate transpose of |ψ_p0> multiplied by | -1>.

But since all elements are real, it's just the dot product.

So |ψ_p0> ⋅ | -1> = 0*0 + 0*0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 → -1/sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of getting -1 in Q, given that P was measured to be 0, is 1/2.

So the combined probability is P(P=0) * P(Q=-1 | P=0) → (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Because when you have two measurements, the total probability is the product of the probability of the first outcome and the conditional probability of the second given the first.

So yes, 1/3 multiplied by 1/2 gives 1/6. So the answer would be 1/6.

Looking at the options, D is 1/6.

Wait, but let me double-check where I could have made a mistake.

Wait, another approach is to compute the probability amplitude for the combined event P=0 and Q=-1.

But perhaps the order is important. Since we measure P first, the state after the first measurement affects the second measurement.

So the steps are correct. First, compute the amplitude for P=0, then find the amplitude for Q=-1 in that state.

So the overall probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the correct answer is option D) 1/6.


To solve the problem, we analyze the sequence of measurements and compute the probabilities step by step.

### Step 1: Normalize the initial state
The given state vector is \( \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is calculated as:

\[
\| \psi \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is given by:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found by solving \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector is determined by solving \( P | \psi_p0 \rangle = 0 \). This gives the eigenvector:

\[
| \psi_p0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the inner product between the normalized state \( | \psi \rangle \) and the eigenvector \( | \psi_p0 \rangle \):

\[
P(P = 0) = \langle \psi_p0 | \psi \rangle^2.
\]

Compute the inner product:

\[
\langle \psi_p0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} \right) + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P = 0) = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors \( |1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( |0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( |-1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \( | \psi_p0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the inner product between \( | \psi_p0 \rangle \) and \( |-1\rangle \):

\[
P(Q = -1 | P = 0) = \langle -1 | \psi_p0 \rangle^2.
\]

Compute the inner product:

\[
\langle -1 | \psi_p0 \rangle = 0 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 0 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(Q = -1 | P = 0) = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Total probability
The total probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P = 0 \text{ and } Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1 | P = 0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}
\]
