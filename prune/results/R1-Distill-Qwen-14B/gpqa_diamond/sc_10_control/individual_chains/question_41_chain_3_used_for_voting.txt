Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question is about a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and toward the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So the light is going through the glass which is itself moving. I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects the way light propagates, but I'm not exactly sure how.

First, I'll recall that in a medium with refractive index n, the speed of light is v_medium = c/n. But wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. What happens when the medium is moving?

Oh right, this must relate to the concept of relativistic velocities or maybe the Doppler effect. Wait, no, Doppler is about frequency and wavelength changes. Hmm, maybe I should think about the velocity addition formulas from special relativity.

Wait, but wait, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? Or is that only in a vacuum? Because in a medium, the speed is different. Oh, but wait, the problem states that the glass is moving, but the light is inside the glass. So the speed of the light in the glass is v = c/n relative to the glass. But since the glass itself is moving, how does that affect the speed as observed in the lab frame?

Hmm, perhaps I should model this using velocity addition. Let me think: in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at v = c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity u = v (the same direction as the light) relative to the lab. So I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab.

Wait, but wait, if the glass is moving at velocity u in the same direction as the light, which is also moving in that direction, then the speed of the light in the lab frame would be the sum of the glass's speed and the light's speed in the glass, but that can't be right because velocities don't just add up linearly when they're in the same direction, especially at high speeds. But v is probably much smaller than c, so maybe a non-relativistic approach is okay here?

Wait no, because even for small velocities, the relativistic addition might give a different result. Let me think about the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, I need to get this right. The formula is when you have a velocity u in one frame, and you want to find the velocity in another frame moving at speed v relative to the first. Wait, but in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the glass's frame, the light's speed is v_light_medium = c/n. So in the lab frame, what is the observed speed?

Wait, so the glass's frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame S. So according to S', the light is moving at u' = c/n. So to find u, which is the speed of the light in S (the lab frame), we apply the velocity addition formula.

So the formula is u = (u' + v_glass) / (1 + (u' * v_glass)/c² )

Wait, but wait, the direction matters. Since the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Wait, wait, the glass is moving toward the observer, which is in the same direction as the light beam? Or is the light moving toward the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam towards the observer?

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is moving toward the observer, and the glass is moving toward the observer as well, but in the same direction as the beam. So I think the beam's direction is towards the observer, and the glass is moving in that same direction (towards the observer) at velocity v.

So in the frame of the glass (S'), the light is moving at speed u' = c/n towards the observer. The glass (S') is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So in the lab frame (S), what is the speed of the light?

Wait, no, I think I got the frames mixed. Let me clarify. The lab is the rest frame. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The light is propagating through the glass towards the observer, so the direction is the same as the glass's motion.

In the glass's frame (S'), the light's speed is u' = c/n. But S' is moving at velocity v with respect to the lab frame S. So to find the speed in S, we use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but when adding velocities, the formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

Wait, assuming that u' and v are in the same direction. So in this case, u' is the speed of light in the glass's frame, which is c/n. And v is the speed of the glass relative to the lab. So u would be the speed of the light in the lab frame.

So substituting, u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator. Let's compute the denominator:

1 + ( (c v) / (n c²) ) ) = 1 + v/(n c )

So u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

Wait, I think I need to compute this carefully. Let me rewrite the denominator:

Denominator = 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + (v) / (n c )

So denominator = (n c + v ) / (n c )

So the entire expression for u is:

u = [ (c/n + v) ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

Which is the same as:

u = [ ( (c + n v) / n ) ] * [ (n c) / (n c + v) ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (c + n v) * n c 

Denominator: n * (n c + v )

Wait, let's compute this:

u = [ (c + n v) * n c ) ] / [ (n (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator.

The n in numerator and denominator cancels out.

So u = [ (c + n v ) * c ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, but wait, the question is about the speed of light in glass relative to the observer. Wait, no, the question is the speed of the light as observed in the lab. Wait, no, the question says: "What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory?" Wait, no, that's not the correct way. Wait, no: the speed of light in the glass is v = c/n, but that's in the frame of the glass. The speed relative to the lab is what we're calculating. Wait, but in my calculation, I found u, which is the speed in the lab frame.

Wait, but the question says, "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory". Wait, that phrasing is a bit confusing. Because the speed of light in the glass is v = c/n, but that's in the glass's frame. But the question is asking what is the speed of the light as observed in the lab, so that's the u I calculated.

Wait, but let me re-read the question. It says, "What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory?" Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Wait, perhaps it's asking for the speed of the light as it moves through the glass, which is c/n, but that's in the glass's frame. But the lab sees the light moving at a different speed.

Wait, no, the question is about the speed of the light in the glass as perceived by the lab. So the correct approach is to compute u using the velocity addition formula.

So the expression I arrived at is u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, let me compute this numerator and denominator.

Wait, so numerator is (c + n v) * c = c² + n v c.

Denominator is n c + v.

So u = (c² + n v c) / (n c + v )

Hmm, I can factor out c in numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator is c (c + n v )

Denominator is (n c + v ) = c (n) + v.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, let's factor c from denominator:

Denominator = c (n ) + v = c (n + v/c )

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Wait, maybe we can write the expression as:

u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Let me factor the numerator and denominator differently. Let me see: can I factor out something from numerator and denominator?

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor c in the denominator:

Denominator: n c + v = c (n) + v.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to divide numerator and denominator by c.

So:

u = [ (c + n v ) * c ] / [ c (n) + v ]

Divide numerator and denominator by c:

u = [ (1 + (n v)/c ) ] * c / [ n + v/(c) ]

So,

u = c * (1 + (n v)/c ) / (n + v/c )

Simplify:

= c * [ (c + n v ) / c ] / [ (n c + v ) / c ]

Which brings us back to the same expression.

Wait, but perhaps I can manipulate this differently. Let me see:

Let me write both numerator and denominator in terms of c.

u = [c² + n v c ] / [n c + v ]

Let me factor c² from numerator and c from denominator.

u = c² (1 + (n v )/(c²) ) / [ c (n + v/(c) ) ]

Which is c * [ 1 + (n v)/c² ) ] / [n + v/c ]

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor n from the denominator.

Wait, denominator: n c + v = n (c) + v.

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor v from the denominator:

n c + v = v ( (n c)/v +1 )

But not sure.

Wait, but perhaps I can factor something else. Let me see:

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-derive the expression.

The velocity addition formula is:

u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' v)/(c²) ]

In this case, u' is the speed of the light in the glass's frame, which is c/n.

So substituting:

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator:

Denominator = 1 + (v)/(n c )

So,

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c ) ]

Which is the same as:

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v ) ]

The n's cancel:

u = c (c + n v ) / (n c + v )

So that's the same as before.

Hmm. Now, looking at the options:

Option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Option B is 1.

Option C is (1 +n v)/(n - v )

Wait, my expression is [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

But c is 1, according to the question. So substitute c =1.

So, u becomes [ (1) (1 + n v) ] / (n *1 + v )

Which is (1 + n v) / (n + v )

So that's option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Does this make sense? Because according to the velocity addition formula, when the medium is moving towards the observer (same direction as light), the observed speed of light would approach c, but in this case, the medium is moving in the same direction as the light, which is towards the observer.

Wait, but when the medium is moving towards you, and the light is moving in that direction as well, perhaps the observed speed of light increases. Wait, but according to our calculation, when v is small, the numerator is about 1 + small term, denominator is about 1, so u is about 1. That makes sense, because in the limit of v approaching zero, u approaches 1. So the speed of light observed in the lab is c in vacuum, but here the medium is moving, so maybe it's not exactly c, but close to c.

Wait, but wait, what about the actual speed? Wait, the speed of light in the medium is c/n. So in the lab frame, the speed would be higher than c/n, but in this case, according to the expression, when v is positive (same direction), the observed speed u is (1 + n v)/(n + v ), which when v is positive, makes u higher than (1)/(n ), which is c/n when c=1.

Wait, let me take an example. Suppose n=1, so the medium is vacuum, and the glass is moving at speed v. Then u would be (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1, which is correct, because in a vacuum, the speed remains c regardless of the frame's motion.

Another example, n=2. Suppose v is small, like 0.1. Then u = (1 + 2*0.1)/(2 + 0.1 ) → (1.2 )/(2.1 ) ≈ 0.571. Wait, but in the medium at rest, the speed is 0.5. So when the medium is moving in the same direction as the light, the observed speed is higher than 0.5.

Wait, but according to the velocity addition formula, the speed of light should approach c (which here is 1) when the medium is moving at a significant fraction of c. But in this case, when n=2 and v is 0.5, then u = (1 + 2*0.5 )/(2 +0.5 ) → (2)/(2.5 )= 0.8, which is less than 1. Hmm, but when the medium is moving in the same direction as the light, the observed speed is higher than c/n.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. Because the medium is moving in the same direction as the light, so the light's speed as seen in the lab should be higher than in the medium's rest frame.

Wait, but another way to look at it: in the medium's frame, the light is moving at 0.5 (if n=2). The medium is moving at 0.5 towards the observer. So when you add these velocities, non-relativistically, you'd get 1.0, but relativistically, you have to use the formula.

Wait, but with n=2, v=0.5:

u = (0.5 + 0.5 ) / (1 + (0.5 * 0.5 ) )

Wait, that's 1 / (1 + 0.25 ) = 1/1.25 = 0.8.

Which matches our earlier calculation. So the speed is 0.8, which is higher than 0.5, which is correct.

But wait, let's check what the options say. Option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v). So when n=2 and v=0.5, that's (1 +1)/(2.5) = 2/2.5=0.8, which matches our calculation.

So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem states that the glass is moving toward the observer in the same direction as the beam. So the light's speed in the lab frame is u = (c + n v )/(n +v ), with c=1.

Wait, but wait, let me think about another example. Suppose n=1. So the glass is moving at speed v, same direction as the light. Then u = (1 + 1*v)/(1 +v ) = (1 +v)/(1 +v )=1, which is correct because in a vacuum, the speed is always 1.

Another example: n=3, v=0. Let's see. Then u = (1+0)/(3+0 )= 1/3, which is correct because in the medium's rest frame, the speed is 1/3.

If the medium is moving in the opposite direction, say v = -v, but that's not the case here.

So, I think option A is correct.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, which is also toward the observer. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass and \( c = 1 \) is the speed of light in a vacuum.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) (since \( c = 1 \)) into the formula:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n \) to eliminate the fraction:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Now, compare this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) — This matches the derived expression.
- **Option B**: \( 1 \) — Incorrect, as this would only be valid if the medium were a vacuum (\( n = 1 \)) and \( v = 0 \).
- **Option C**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \) — Incorrect, as the denominator does not match the derived expression.
- **Option D**: \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \) — Incorrect, as the numerator does not match the derived expression.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question is about a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and toward the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Oh right, this must relate to the concept of relativistic velocities or maybe the Doppler effect. Wait, no, Doppler is about frequency and wavelength changes. Hmm, maybe I should think about the velocity addition formulas from special relativity.

Wait, but wait, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? Or is that only in a vacuum? Because in a medium, the speed is different. Oh, but wait, the problem states that the glass is moving, but the light is inside the glass. So the speed of the light in the glass is v = c/n relative to the glass. But since the glass itself is moving, how does that affect the speed as observed in the lab frame?

Hmm, perhaps I should model this using velocity addition. Let me think: in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at v = c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity u = v (the same direction as the light) relative to the lab. So I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab.

But v is probably much smaller than c, so maybe a non-relativistic approach is okay here?

Wait no, because even for small velocities, the relativistic addition might give a different result. Let me think about the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, I need to get this right. The formula is when you have a velocity u in one frame, and you want to find the velocity in another frame moving at speed v relative to the first. Wait, but in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the glass's frame, the light's speed is v_light_medium = c/n. So in the lab frame, what is the observed speed?

Wait, so the glass's frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame S. So according to S', the light is moving at u' = c/n. So to find u, which is the speed of the light in S (the lab frame), we apply the velocity addition formula.

So the formula is u = (u' + v_glass) / (1 + (u' * v_glass)/c² )

Wait, but wait, the direction matters. Since the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Wait, wait, the glass is moving toward the observer, which is in the same direction as the light beam? Or is the light moving toward the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam towards the observer?

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is moving toward the observer, and the glass is moving toward the observer as well, but in the same direction as the beam. So I think the beam's direction is towards the observer, and the glass is moving in that same direction (towards the observer) at velocity v.

So in the frame of the glass (S'), the light is moving at speed u' = c/n towards the observer. The glass (S') is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So in the lab frame (S), what is the speed of the light?

Wait, no, I think I got the frames mixed. Let me clarify. The lab is the rest frame. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The light is propagating through the glass towards the observer, so the direction is the same as the glass's motion.

In the glass's frame (S'), the light's speed is u' = c/n. But S' is moving at velocity v with respect to the lab frame S. So to find the speed in S, we use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but when adding velocities, the formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

Wait, assuming that u' and v are in the same direction. So in this case, u' is the speed of light in the glass's frame, which is c/n. And v is the speed of the glass relative to the lab. So u would be the speed of the light in the lab frame.

So substituting, u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator. Let's compute the denominator:

1 + ( (c v) / (n c²) ) ) = 1 + v/(n c )

So u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

Wait, I think I need to compute this carefully. Let me rewrite the denominator:

Denominator = 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + (v) / (n c )

So denominator = (n c + v ) / (n c )

So the entire expression for u is:

u = [ (c/n + v) ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

Which is the same as:

u = [ ( (c + n v) / n ) ] * [ (n c) / (n c + v) ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (c + n v) * n c 

Denominator: n * (n c + v )

Wait, let's compute this:

u = [ (c + n v) * n c ) ] / [ (n (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator.

The n in numerator and denominator cancels out.

So u = [ (c + n v ) * c ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, but wait, the question is about the speed of light in glass relative to the observer. Wait, no, the question is the speed of the light as observed in the lab. Wait, no, the question says: "What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory?" Wait, no, that's not the correct way. Wait, no: the speed of light in the glass is v = c/n, but that's in the frame of the glass. The speed relative to the lab is what we're calculating. Wait, but in my calculation, I found u, which is the speed in the lab frame.

Wait, but the question says, "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory". Wait, that phrasing is a bit confusing. Because the speed of light in the glass is v = c/n, but that's in the glass's frame. But the question is asking what is the speed of the light as observed in the lab, so that's the u I calculated.

Wait, but let me re-read the question. It says, "What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory?" Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Wait, perhaps it's asking for the speed of the light as it moves through the glass, which is c/n, but that's in the glass's frame. But the lab sees the light moving at a different speed.

Wait, no, the question is about the speed of the light in the glass as perceived by the lab. So the correct approach is to compute u using the velocity addition formula.

So the expression I arrived at is u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, let me compute this numerator and denominator.

Wait, so numerator is (c + n v) * c = c² + n v c.

Denominator is n c + v.

So u = (c² + n v c) / (n c + v )

Hmm, I can factor out c in numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator is c (c + n v )

Denominator is (n c + v ) = c (n) + v.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, let's factor c from denominator:

Denominator = c (n ) + v = c (n + v/c )

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Wait, maybe we can write the expression as:

u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Let me factor the numerator and denominator differently. Let me see: can I factor out something from numerator and denominator?

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor c in the denominator:

Denominator: n c + v = c (n) + v.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to divide numerator and denominator by c.

So:

u = [ (c + n v ) * c ] / [ c (n) + v ]

Divide numerator and denominator by c:

u = [ (1 + (n v)/c ) ] * c / [ n + v/(c) ]

So,

u = c * (1 + (n v)/c ) / (n + v/c )

Simplify:

= c * [ (c + n v ) / c ] / [ (n c + v ) / c ]

Which brings us back to the same expression.

Wait, but perhaps I can manipulate this differently. Let me see:

Let me write both numerator and denominator in terms of c.

u = [c² + n v c ] / [n c + v ]

Let me factor c² from numerator and c from denominator.

u = c² (1 + (n v )/(c²) ) / [ c (n + v/(c) ) ]

Which is c * [ 1 + (n v)/c² ) ] / [n + v/c ]

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor n from the denominator.

Wait, denominator: n c + v = n (c) + v.

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor v from the denominator:

n c + v = v ( (n c)/v +1 )

But not sure.

Wait, but perhaps I can factor something else. Let me see:

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-derive the expression.

The velocity addition formula is:

u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' v)/(c²) ]

In this case, u' is the speed of the light in the glass's frame, which is c/n.

So substituting:

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator:

Denominator = 1 + (v)/(n c )

So,

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c ) ]

Which is the same as:

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v ) ]

The n's cancel:

u = c (c + n v ) / (n c + v )

So that's the same as before.

Hmm. Now, looking at the options:

Option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Option B is 1.

Option C is (1 +n v)/(n - v )

Wait, my expression is [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

But c is 1, according to the question. So substitute c =1.

So, u becomes [ (1) (1 + n v) ] / (n *1 + v )

Which is (1 + n v) / (n + v )

So that's option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Does this make sense? Because according to the velocity addition formula, when the medium is moving towards the observer (same direction as light), the observed speed of light would approach c, but in this case, the medium is moving in the same direction as the light, which is towards the observer.

Wait, but when the medium is moving towards you, and the light is moving in that direction as well, perhaps the observed speed of light increases. Wait, but according to our calculation, when v is small, the numerator is about 1 + small term, denominator is about 1, so u is about 1. That makes sense, because in the limit of v approaching zero, u approaches 1. So the speed of light observed in the lab is c in vacuum, but here the medium is moving, so maybe it's not exactly c, but close to c.

Wait, but wait, what about the actual speed? Wait, the speed of light in the medium is c/n. So in the lab frame, the speed would be higher than c/n, but in this case, according to the expression, when v is positive (same direction), the observed speed u is (1 + n v)/(n + v ), which when v is positive, makes u higher than (1)/(n ), which is c/n when c=1.

Wait, let me take an example. Suppose n=1, so the medium is vacuum, and the glass is moving at speed v. Then u would be (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1, which is correct, because in a vacuum, the speed remains c regardless of the frame's motion.

Another example, n=2. Suppose v is small, like 0.1. Then u = (1 + 2*0.1)/(2 + 0.1 ) → (1.2 )/(2.1 ) ≈ 0.571. Wait, but in the medium at rest, the speed is 0.5. So when the medium is moving in the same direction as the light, the observed speed is higher than 0.5.

Wait, but according to the velocity addition formula, the speed of light should approach c (which here is 1) when the medium is moving at a significant fraction of c. But in this case, when n=2 and v is 0.5, then u = (1 + 2*0.5 )/(2 +0.5 ) → (2)/(2.5 )= 0.8, which is less than 1. Hmm, but when the medium is moving in the same direction as the light, the observed speed is higher than c/n.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. Because the medium is moving in the same direction as the light, so the light's speed as seen in the lab should be higher than in the medium's rest frame.

Wait, but another way to look at it: in the medium's frame, the light is moving at 0.5 (if n=2). The medium is moving at 0.5 towards the observer. So when you add these velocities, non-relativistically, you'd get 1.0, but relativistically, you have to use the formula.

Wait, but with n=2, v=0.5:

u = (0.5 + 0.5 ) / (1 + (0.5 * 0.5 ) )

Wait, that's 1 / (1 + 0.25 ) = 1/1.25 = 0.8.

Which matches our earlier calculation. So the speed is 0.8, which is higher than 0.5, which is correct.

But wait, let's check what the options say. Option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v). So when n=2 and v=0.5, that's (1 +1)/(2.5) = 2/2.5=0.8, which matches our calculation.

So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem states that the glass is moving toward the observer in the same direction as the beam. So the light's speed in the lab frame is u = (c + n v )/(n +v ), with c=1.

Wait, but wait, let me think about another example. Suppose n=1. So the glass is moving at speed v, same direction as the light. Then u = (1 + 1*v)/(1 +v ) = (1 +v)/(1 +v )=1, which is correct because in a vacuum, the speed is always 1.

Another example: n=3, v=0. Let's see. Then u = (1+0)/(3+0 )= 1/3, which is correct because in the medium's rest frame, the speed is 1/3.

If the medium is moving in the opposite direction, say v = -v, but that's not the case here.

So, I think option A is correct.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, which is also toward the observer. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass and \( c = 1 \) is the speed of light in a vacuum.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) (since \( c = 1 \)) into the formula:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n \) to eliminate the fraction:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Now, compare this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) — This matches the derived expression.
- **Option B**: \( 1 \) — Incorrect, as this would only be valid if the medium were a vacuum (\( n = 1 \)) and \( v = 0 \).
- **Option C**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \) — Incorrect, as the denominator does not match the derived expression.
- **Option D**: \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \) — Incorrect, as the numerator does not match the derived expression.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
