Okay, let's try to work through this problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2 using the given metric. I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me look at the metric provided. The metric is given in terms of dx² and dy², so it's a two-dimensional metric. The line element ds² is equal to (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2-dimensional spacetime metric, right? But the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh wait, pseudospheres are surfaces with constant negative curvature, right? So maybe this metric is describing the geometry of a pseudosphere.

Wait, no. Pseudospheres are surfaces in 3D, but here the metric is two-dimensional. So perhaps this metric is representing the intrinsic geometry of a pseudosphere. Or maybe it's part of a higher-dimensional space—like the 3D metric, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere, which is a 2D surface.

Alternatively, maybe the metric is representing a 2D surface embedded in 3D space. But regardless, I'm supposed to find the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. So I need to compute the area using the given metric.

The area of a surface in a metric is found by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, but wait, since it's 2D, the area is just the integral of sqrt(det g) over the surface. But wait, no—wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So the total area would be the integral of sqrt(det g) over all x and y.

But wait, the metric is given as ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). So the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy is the same, and the cross terms g_xy and g_yx are zero. So the determinant of the metric tensor is g_xx * g_yy - g_xy², but since cross terms are zero, it's (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So the square root of the determinant would be 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, but the area is then the integral over x and y of 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy. Wait, but that's only valid within the domain where the metric is defined, right? The denominator 4 - x² - y² must be positive because the metric coefficient is 32 divided by that. So 4 - x² - y² >0 → x² + y² <4. So the domain is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. That makes sense because if the radius r=2, the region where 4 - x² - y² is positive is the interior of a circle with radius 2.

So the area would be the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. Wait, but that integral seems a bit tricky. Let's see. I can switch to polar coordinates because the region is a circle. Let me set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, where r goes from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So dx dy becomes r dr dθ. Then the integral becomes the integral from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ. Let's factor out constants: 32 * ∫(θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫(r=0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

First, the θ integral is straightforward. ∫dθ from 0 to 2π is 2π. So now we have 32 * 2π * ∫(r=0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr. Let's compute the integral ∫r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me make a substitution: let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr. So the integral becomes ∫ [r dr/(4 - r²)] = ∫ (-1/2) du/u. So the limits when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0. So:

∫ (from r=0 to 2) [r/(4−r²)] dr = ∫ (u=4 to 0) (-1/(2u)) du. The negative sign flips the limits, so it becomes ∫ (u=0 to4) (1/(2u)) du.

But wait, 1/(2u) integrated is (1/2) ln|u| + C. So evaluating from 0 to4: (1/2)(ln4 - ln0). But ln0 is negative infinity, so this would cause the integral to diverge. Oh no! That means the integral is infinite?

Wait, that's a problem. So the area is 32 * 2π * [ (1/2) (ln4 - ln0) ) ].

But ln0 is -infinity, so ln4 - (-∞) is infinity. So the integral becomes infinite. So the area would be infinite. So the answer would be option D, which is +infinity.

But wait, why does the integral diverge? Because as r approaches 2, the denominator 4−r² approaches zero, making the integrand blow up. So the singularity is at r=2, which is the boundary of the domain. So in integrating up to r=2, the integral would diverge, leading to an infinite area. So the pseudosphere has infinite area?

Wait, but pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature, and I thought their area is finite. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm confusing pseudospheres with spheres. Wait, a regular sphere (positive curvature) has finite area, but a pseudosphere (with negative curvature) might have infinite area if it's like the hyperbolic plane, but no, a pseudosphere is a finite surface. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. The metric given here is similar to the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, which has infinite area. Oh wait, because in the Poincaré disk model, the entire hyperbolic plane is represented within a finite disk, but the area is still infinite because the density increases as you approach the boundary. So maybe the area computed here is indeed infinite, which would make option D the correct answer.

So the options are:

A) 0 → no, the area isn't zero.

B) 4π(x² + y²) → but x and y are variables, not constants. So this can't be the total area.

C) 4π(x² - y²) → same issue as B.

D) +infinity → which seems to be the case based on the integral.

So the answer should be D) +infinity.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional surface. The task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). The area of a surface in a general metric is determined by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the surface. For this metric, the determinant is:

\[
\text{det}(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

The square root of the determinant is:

\[
\sqrt{\text{det}(g)} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}.
\]

The area is then given by the integral:

\[
\text{Area} = \int \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dx \, dy = \int \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The domain of integration is where the metric is defined, which requires \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), or equivalently \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). This corresponds to a circle of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the integral becomes:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \) evaluates to \( 2\pi \), leaving:

\[
\text{Area} = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To compute \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). The limits of integration change: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u| \), so:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \frac{1}{2} \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

As \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), the integral diverges. This means the area is infinite. Therefore, the pseudosphere described by this metric has infinite area.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as \( x \) and \( y \) are variables, not constants, and this does not represent the total area.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect for the same reason as B.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the integral diverges, leading to an infinite area.

∫ (from r=0 to 2) [r/(4−r²)] dr = ∫ (u=4 to 0) (-1/(2u)) du. The negative sign flips the limits, so it becomes ∫ (u=0 to4) (1/(2u)) du.

But wait, 1/(2u) integrated is (1/2) ln|u| + C. So evaluating from 0 to4: (1/2)(ln4 - ln0). But ln0 is negative infinity, so this would cause the integral to diverge. Oh no! That means the integral is infinite?

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional surface. The task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). The area of a surface in a general metric is determined by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the surface. For this metric, the determinant is:

\[
\text{det}(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

The square root of the determinant is:

\[
\sqrt{\text{det}(g)} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}.
\]

The area is then given by the integral:

\[
\text{Area} = \int \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dx \, dy = \int \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The domain of integration is where the metric is defined, which requires \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), or equivalently \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). This corresponds to a circle of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the integral becomes:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \) evaluates to \( 2\pi \), leaving:

\[
\text{Area} = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To compute \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). The limits of integration change: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u| \), so:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \frac{1}{2} \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

As \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), the integral diverges. This means the area is infinite. Therefore, the pseudosphere described by this metric has infinite area.
