Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question. Let's read it again carefully. The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite quantities that pop up in calculations. Regularization helps make these infinities manageable so that you can renormalize the theory, basically absorbing those infinities into physical parameters like mass and charge.

Wait, but the question is about a theory that never requires regularization. So which of these theories don't have these issues at high energies?

Let me think about each option.

Starting with option D) Classical Electrodynamics. Well, classical theories don't really have the same issues as quantum theories. In classical electrodynamics, even at high energies, the equations are just differential equations, and you don't get infinities because you're not dealing with the quantum mechanical effects that lead to divergences. So maybe this is the answer because it doesn't require regularization—since it's not a quantum theory, it doesn't have the same problems.

But wait, the other options are all quantum theories. So let's think about each.

Option C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). I know QED is a well-understood theory. It does have issues with divergences, especially in loop calculations. For example, the calculation of the electron self-energy leads to divergent integrals. Therefore, regularization is necessary in QED. So option C requires regularization.

Option B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory with asymptotic freedom. It definitely has issues with divergences, right? So you need regularization in QCD when doing calculations, especially at high energies where the coupling becomes weaker. So B does require regularization.

Option A) Superstring Theory. Hmm, superstring theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining general relativity with quantum mechanics. I think string theories generally avoid some of the divergences that happen in point particle theories because they replace points with strings, which have more structure. But wait, do they still require regularization? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I remember that in superstring theory, the theory is finite in certain aspects, but I'm not sure if regularization is needed. Alternatively, superstring theory might not require the same kind of divergent regularization as in QFT because the structure of the theory is different. Or does it? Maybe it's because string theory is background-dependent and has other methods of dealing with high-energy issues. Alternatively, I might be confusing it with something else.

Wait, another thought. The question is about which theory never requires regularization. So if a theory is free of divergences, it wouldn't need regularization. But isn't that the case for some theories?

Wait, classical electrodynamics is a theory that is finite. It doesn't have any divergences because it's not a quantum theory. So in that case, it doesn't require regularization because there are no infinities. So the answer would be D.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D is Classical Electrodynamics. So that theory doesn't require regularization because it's classical. So the correct answer is D.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options:

- **Option A: Superstring Theory**  
  Superstring theory is a quantum theory that replaces point particles with strings, which introduces additional structure. While it avoids some divergences found in point-particle theories, it still requires regularization in certain contexts, such as loop calculations. Thus, it does require regularization.

- **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
  QCD is the theory of the strong interaction and is a non-abelian gauge theory. It deals with divergences in loop calculations, particularly at high energies, where the coupling becomes weaker. Regularization is necessary in QCD to handle these divergences.

- **Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
  QED is the quantum theory of electromagnetism. It is well-known to have issues with divergences, such as those arising in electron self-energy calculations. Regularization is a standard tool in QED to manage these infinities.

- **Option D: Classical Electrodynamics**  
  Classical electrodynamics is a purely classical theory described by Maxwell's equations. It does not involve quantum mechanical effects or divergences that require regularization. Since it is not a quantum theory, it never requires regularization at high energies.

The only theory that does not require regularization is **Classical Electrodynamics**, as it is free from the divergences that necessitate regularization in quantum theories.
