Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's see what each of the techniques tells me.

First, the FTIR spectrum. I remember that IR is useful for identifying functional groups. The problem says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait—carboxylic acids also have a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl. Oh, right, so if there's a broad peak at 3000, that's likely an O-H group, maybe an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. 

The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is often a carbonyl (C=O), like in ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe an acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest something else. Wait, maybe that's a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Or perhaps it's an amide? But the options don't have nitrogen, so maybe it's a carbonyl with conjugation, like an ester or maybe a ketone with some conjugation.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond somewhere, maybe part of an ester or another carbonyl group.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass for something like (CH3)2O, which is 45 g/mol. Or maybe it's a different fragment. Alternatively, m/z 45 could be an acetyl group (CH3CO- would be 43, but maybe with something else). Wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular ion for CH3CH2O- but wait, that's 45 minus the charge. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment from a larger molecule breaking down. For example, if there's an ester group, maybe the ester cleaves, releasing the alcohol part. Let's think: if the compound is an ester, say R-O-CO-O-R', then the fragments could include the acyl part. Alternatively, for a methyl group, but I'm not sure.

Now, considering the options:

Option A: C6H12O2
Option B: C6H10O
Option C: C6H10O2
Option D: C6H12O

Let's think about degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N here.

For C6H12O2: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14 -12)/2 = 1. So one ring or double bond.

But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So with DoU 1, perhaps one double bond or one ring. But if the compound has a double bond and a ring, that would be two DoU. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, another formula: C6H10O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be two double bonds, a ring and a double bond, etc.

Wait the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. So if DoU is two, that suggests another double bond or a ring.

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, which is a common functional group.

Ester general formula is R-O-CO-O-R'. Wait, no, esters are RCOOR'. The formula for an ester is (R is an alkyl group, say CnH2n+1) and (another R' is another alkyl, say CmH2m+1). So the ester would have formula Cn+1+m H2(n+m)+2 O2.

Wait, perhaps it's an ester of a diol and a diacid, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, a simple ester. Let's think about C6H12O2. Suppose it's an ester: RCOOR', where R and R' are alkyl groups.

Suppose R is CH3 and R' is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but wait, that might give a different formula. Wait, perhaps an ester such as methyl something.

Wait, the molecular formula for an ester RCOOR' is (for R = CnH2n+1, R'= CmH2m+1) would be Cn+1 + m H2(n + m +1) O2.

Wait, maybe I should think about the options. Let's check each option's possible structure.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU is (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or one double bond. But the NMR has vinyl H, so double bond is present. So maybe a double bond and no ring. Alternatively, a ring and a double bond (but that would require DoU 2).

Alternatively, a cyclic ester? No, that's a lactide, but that's a different scenario.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So the compound has a carbonyl group, probably an ester or a ketone. If it's an ester, then the formula would be RCOOR', which would fit a C6H12O2. Because, for example, an ester with formula C5H10O2 would be, but wait, let's calculate.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: an ester has the formula R-O-CO-R'. Wait no, it's RCOOR', so the formula is (R is CnH2n-1, R' is CmH2m+1). So the ester has (n + m + 2) carbons? Hmm, perhaps I need to think more clearly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ortho ester or something else, but I think it's more straightforward.

So, for the IR, there's a broad O-H peak, probably from an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H around 3000 and a strong carbonyl around 1700. But if the compound were a carboxylic acid, then the formula would have O2? Wait, a carboxylic acid is RCOOH, which has formula CnH2nO2. So if it's, say, C6H12O2, that fits (n=6 would be C6H12O2, but wait, that would require 2n=12, so n=6: C6H12O2. So a carboxylic acid like hexanoic acid would have C6H12O2. But then, in the NMR, would there be vinyl hydrogens? No, because a carboxylic acid is just a straight chain, unless there's a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but the NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond is present. So if it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, perhaps an alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid.

Wait, but then the molecular formula would be different. Let's see: for an alpha,beta-unsaturated acid, like CH2=CHCOOH, which is acrylic acid: C3H4O2. So for a six-carbon compound, maybe something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. So the formula would be C6H10O2, right? Because each double bond reduces two H's.

Wait, but the options don't have all of that.

Alternatively, maybe it's not a carboxylic acid. Because the IR has a broad peak but also a strong peak at 1650. Wait, maybe that's a conjugated carbonyl? Like an ester with an adjacent double bond.

Alternatively, the IR peaks: 3000 (broad, O-H), 1700 (C=O), and 1650 (maybe another C=O conjugated, or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents, but the options don't have benzene rings. So perhaps the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester where the carbonyl is conjugated with a double bond.

So maybe the structure is something like an ester with a double bond. For example, a vinyl ester: CH2=CHCOOOR or something like that. Wait, but let's think about the mass spec.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z 45. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHO (maybe? Let me calculate: 12*4 + 1*9 = 48? Wait, no. Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. What's 45?

Carbon: 12, Hydrogen: 1, Oxygen: 16.

So 45: 12*a + 1*b +16*c =45.

Possible combinations: 3 carbons, like (CH3)2O is 45? Let's see: (CH3)2O is C2H6O, so 2*12=24 +6=30 +16=46. No, that's 46. Hmm.

Alternatively, CH3COO- is 59. Hmm, not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a fragment from the compound. For example, if the compound is an ester, like RCOOR', the ester group might break into RCOO+ and R'–. The RCOO+ would have a mass of (12n + 2n + 16*2 + maybe) ?

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the compound can be determined by looking at the molecular ion in the mass spec. But the problem only gives a fragment at m/z 45, which might not be the molecular ion.

Hmm, perhaps the molecular formula can be determined via each technique.

Wait, let's think about the possible formulas.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So either a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (14-10)/2=2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation: (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or one double bond.

Now, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So, at least one double bond. So, for each option, let's see if the possible structure has a double bond.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=1. So either a ring or a double bond. If it's a double bond, then that fits. So it could be an ester with a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=2. So probably two double bonds or a ring and a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So same as B, but with two O's.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=1. So, a ring or a double bond.

So, looking for a compound with a double bond (due to vinyl H in NMR) and a carbonyl group (due to IR). Also, the O-H in IR suggests either an alcohol or an acid. 

If the compound is an ester, which has both oxygen atoms, then the formula would have O2, which points to options A or C.

Wait, but the O-H in IR—esters don't have O-H unless it's an acid or an alcohol. So if the compound is an ester, how do we get the O-H? Maybe I'm wrong, perhaps it's not an ester.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. Like a diol with a ketone. But that would require more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a beta-keto ester, which would have a structure like RCOCOR'. But that might not fit the options.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which would have a ring and an ester group. If it's a lactone, the structure would have a ring (so DoU increases by 1) and a carbonyl. So for a six-carbon lactone, the formula would be C6H10O2. Because the lactone is formed by cyclization of a hydroxy acid. For example, a five-membered ring lactone would come from a four-carbon hydroxy acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think again. The FTIR shows a broad O-H, which is strong and broad, so likely an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If it's an alcohol, then the compound would have -OH group. So the formula would include O, but the options are given so we have to match.

Now, looking at the mass spec: m/z 45. Let's think of possible fragments. 45 could be (CH3)2CHO (molecular weight 45?), wait:

CH3CH2CHO is 72 (no). Wait, 45 is less. Let's think, maybe it's a methyl group plus something else. Alternatively, a fragment with a carbonyl group. Like CH3CO would be 43 (CH3CO+ is 43?), but 45 is two more. Maybe CH3COO-? That's 60. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is an ethyl group attached to something. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH2 (ethylene), but that's 28. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a fragment where a CH2 group is attached to something else. Another thought: if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which has a degree of unsaturation 2, perhaps it's an ester with a double bond. So something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that's a longer chain. Let's calculate the formula: CH2=CHCOO- would be C3H4O2, and the R' would be, say, C3H7, so the ester would be C3H4O2 + C3H7 = C6H11O2. Hmm, but that would be C6H11O2, which isn't one of the options. Wait, our options are C6H10O2, which is DoU 2.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the molecular formula. The molecular ion (if the mass spec gives it) would have a molecular weight that is the sum of the isotopes. But the problem only gives a fragment at 45. So perhaps the molecular weight is higher, but the fragment is 45.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's see: 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32. Total 72+10+32=114 g/mol.

Alternatively, if the molecular formula is C6H12O2: 6*12=72, 12=12, 2*16=32. 72+12+32=116.

Hmm, but in the mass spec, the fragment is 45. Let's think about what parts of the molecule could give m/z 45.

Another thought: the m/z 45 could be a cleavage fragment, like the loss of a larger group. For example, if the compound is an ester, perhaps the ester group breaks apart, releasing the RCOO+ group. The RCOO+ would have a molecular weight of, say, if R is CH2CH2..., but perhaps let's think of possible R groups.

Wait, 45 is a common mass for (CH3)2CHO. Wait, (CH3)2CHO is 45? Let's calculate: (CH3)2CHO - that's C3H7O. Molecular weight: 3*12 +7*1 +16 = 36 +7 +16=59. No, that's not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a CH2CH2CO- group. CH2CH2CO- is C3H4O. Molecular weight: 3*12 +4 +16=36+4+16=56. Not 45.

Hmm, maybe it's a smaller fragment. Like CH2CH2O (which is C2H5O). Molecular weight: 24 +5 +16=45. Ah, yes! Because 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens, and one oxygen: 2*12=24, 5=5, 16=16. 24+5=29 +16=45.

So the fragment at m/z 45 could be CH2CH2O ( -O-CH2CH3) perhaps. So that would suggest an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) is present in the molecule. Because when the molecule fragments, the ethoxy group breaks off, giving a fragment of 45 (m/z).

So if the compound has an ethoxy group, then the formula would include OCH2CH3, which contributes two carbons and five hydrogens plus an oxygen.

Looking at the options, let's see which could have an ethoxy group.

If the formula is C6H10O2, then subtracting the ethoxy (C2H5O), we get C4H5O. But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the entire R group is contributing to this.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the unknown is one of the options, and it includes an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3). So the formula would have at least 2 carbons from the ethoxy.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. The ethoxy group has 2 C, so the remaining would be C4H11O. That doesn't make sense because O is already accounted for.

Option C: C6H10O2. If it has an ethoxy group, the remaining would be C4H7O. Hmm, possible. For example, if the compound is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that would be longer than six carbons). Alternatively, perhaps a cyclic ester like a five-membered ring, where the ester is part of the ring.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with an ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl. Let's see:

For example, ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. The formula is C5H8O2. Hmm, but our options are C6H10O2, which is more carbons. So maybe it's a longer ester.

Wait, perhaps the formula is C6H10O2. Let's say the molecule is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's 3 carbons (CH2=CHCOO-) and 3 carbons (CH2CH2CH3), so that's 6 carbons. Let's check the formula: C6H10O2.

Wait, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 is C6H10O2. Let me count:

CH2=CHCOO- is 3 carbons (CH2-CH-COO-) and the ethyl group is 3 carbons (CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the ethyl group is CH2CH3, which is two carbons. So CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 would have 3 (from acrylate) + 3 (from the ester group) = 6 carbons. Wait, no. CH2=CHCOO is three carbons (CH2, CH, COO), and the ester's R' is CH2CH2CH3? Which is three carbons. So 3 + 3 =6. So the formula would be C6H8O2? Wait, wait, let me calculate the hydrogens.

The structure: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3.

CH2=CHCOO-: each CH2 has 2 H, the CH has 2 H (since it's double bonded), the COO- would have no H.

Wait, actually, structure is CH2=CH-COO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, the double bond is between the first and second carbon of the acrylate.

So the acrylate part is CH2=CHCOO-.

So the formula for CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 would be:

Carbons: 3 (CH2=CHCOO-) +3 (CH2CH2CH3) =6.

Hydrogens: CH2=CHCOO- has (CH2 has 2 H, CH has 2 H), the COO has no H. Then the ester group is OCH2CH2CH3, which has 2*3 =6 H (each CH2 has 2 H, and the CH3 has 3 H). Wait, wait, let me count again.

CH2=CHCOO-:

CH2: 2 H.

CH: 2 H (since it's double bonded, no H on the double bond).

COO: no H.

So 2 +2 =4 H from the acrylate part.

The ethyl group (OCH2CH2CH3):

O connected to CH2CH2CH3.

CH2: 2 H each.

CH2CH2CH3: each CH2 has 2 H, so the group is CH2CH2CH3: 2 (first CH2) + 2 (second CH2) +3 (CH3) =7 H.

But wait, the O is connected to the first CH2: so the group is CH2CH2CH3. So the ester oxygen is connected to CH2-CH2-CH3.

So the ethyl group contributes 2 (from OCH2) + 2 (from CH2) +3 (from CH3) =7 H.

Wait, but the O is connected to the first CH2: so the entire group is OCH2CH2CH3, which has 2 (OCH2) + 2 (CH2) +3 (CH3) =7 H.

Wait, but the ester group is O-CO-O-R. So the R is CH2CH2CH3, which has 7 H.

Wait, but the entire molecule would have:

From the acrylate: CH2=CHCOO- has 4 H.

From the ester group: OCH2CH2CH3 has 7 H.

Wait, but wait, the carbonyl is between the CH2 and the O, so that structure may have fewer Hs. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula of the ester would be C5H8O2 for ethyl acrylate. But our options are C6H10O2 for option C.

Wait, maybe the compound is methyl vinyl acetate or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester or something else.

But let's get back to the problem.

We have the fragment at m/z 45, which we thought was OCH2CH3 (45). So the compound likely has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3).

So which of the options include an OCH2CH3 group?

Looking at the options, the formula C6H10O2 could have an ethoxy group.

If the formula is C6H10O2 and it includes OCH2CH3, then the remaining part would be C4H7O. Wait, but that would require the remaining part to have formula C4H7O. That seems a bit difficult because O is already present.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an ester with ethoxy and another group.

Let me think: if the formula is C6H10O2, and it's an ester (RCOO-R'), then R and R' must add up to 6 carbons.

Assuming R' is ethyl (2 carbons), then R would be 4 carbons. So R is a 4-carbon group, and R' is 2 carbons.

So R is a 4-carbon group attached to a carbonyl, and R' is ethyl.

But R would have to contribute H and O as well.

Wait, the formula for RCOOR' would be (n from R) + (m from R') carbons. For RCOOR', the formula is (n+1 + m) C, (2n + 2 + 2m +1?) Hmm, perhaps not the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone), which would contribute a ring structure. A six-membered lactone would have the formula C6H10O2.

Wait, a lactone is an ester formed from a cyclic hydroxy acid. For example, a six-membered lactone (gamma-lactone would be 5-membered, but let's not get into that). So the formula for a six-membered lactone would be C6H10O2.

So, in that case, the IR would show the ester carbonyl (around 1700), and perhaps the O-H from the acid would be present as a broad peak. But wait, in a lactone, the acid is part of the ring, so the O-H is not present as a free -OH. Hmm, maybe not. So the broad peak might be due to something else.

Wait, but if the compound is a diol? No, the IR has a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester and an alcohol. But that would require more O's, perhaps.

Wait, another thought: the FTIR has a strong peak at 1700 (carbonyl), 1650 (perhaps conjugated), and a broad O-H. Maybe it's a beta-keto acid, which has two carbonyl groups but that's more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an ortho ester, which has the structure R-O-CO-O-R'. But I think that's less common.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone with an alcohol group. Let's see.

If the compound is a ketone and an alcohol, the formula would have two O's. So for C6H12O2, that fits option A. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So, if it's a ketone with a double bond and an alcohol group, the formula would be C6H12O2 (DoU=1: a double bond). Wait, but DoU for C6H12O2 is (14-12)/2=1. So it would have one degree of unsaturation: either a ring or a double bond.

So, a compound with a double bond would fit that.

But then, the IR's 1700 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl (could be a ketone), the 1650 could be another C=O (but that would require two carbonyls), but that would be unlikely without another O. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me summarize:

- IR: broad O-H (alcohol or acid), strong C=O (ester, ketone, acid).
- NMR: vinyl H → double bond.
- Mass spec: fragment at 45 → possibly OCH2CH3 (ethyl group).

So, the compound probably has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) and a carbonyl group, along with a double bond.

Which option fits:

Option A: C6H12O2 → DoU 1. Could have a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2 → DoU 2. Could have a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.

Looking for a formula that includes an ethoxy group and a carbonyl group.

If the formula is C6H10O2, which has two O's, that could fit an ester (O from ester group) and perhaps another O from a carbonyl or an alcohol.

Wait, the IR's broad O-H suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If it's an ester, the O-H would come from an alcohol group somewhere else.

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester with a hydroxyl group, perhaps a hemiacetal or something. But that's getting complicated.

Another angle: the molecular formula must have the correct number of H and O.

If the fragment is OCH2CH3 (45), then the ethoxy group is present.

So, the molecular formula must include OCH2CH3.

So, for the formula C6H10O2, subtracting OCH2CH3 (C2H5O), we get C4H5O. But C4H5O doesn't fit any known structure without being something like a cyclic ether or a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with ethyl group and another group.

For example, ethyl propionate is CH3CH2COOCH2CH3. Its formula is C5H10O2. But our options don't have that.

Wait, but the options have C6H10O2. So perhaps the ester is between a four-carbon acid and an ethyl group.

For example, butyl propionate: CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Let's see, the formula would be C6H12O2. Wait, but that's option A.

But our fragment is 45, which points to an ethyl group. So if the ester is ethyl something, perhaps the formula aligns with option C.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has a different structure.

Another approach: Degrees of Unsaturation.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2.

So two degrees: could be two double bonds, a ring and a double bond, etc.

If it's an ester with a double bond and a ring, that would fit. Or maybe a diene and an ester.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps I should correlate the mass spec.

The fragment at m/z 45. If that is OCH2CH3 (45), then the compound likely has an ethyl group attached via an oxygen.

Which option includes OCH2CH3?

Looking back, the options:

Option C is C6H10O2.

If the compound is ethyl something with four more carbons, but that's getting too vague.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an ethyl group. But a six-membered lactone would have the formula C6H10O2. So that's option C. But in a lactone, the structure is cyclic, and there's no free O-H group because the acid is part of the ring. Hmm, but that would contradict the broad O-H peak in IR. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: the fragment at m/z 45 could be from a different part of the molecule. For example, if the molecule has a ketone group, maybe a (CH3)2CO group, which is 58 (m/z 58?), but that's not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the cleavage of the molecule, such as the loss of a larger group. For instance, if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, then the fragment might be the ethyl ester group (OCH2CH3) which is 45.

But that would make the formula C6H10O2, since the ester is CH2=CHCOO-OCH2CH2CH3. Wait, actually, that's 3 carbons from the ester acid part and 3 from the ester alcohol part, making 6. Let's count H:

CH2=CHCOO-OCH2CH2CH3.

CH2=CHCOO-: The structure is CH2-CH-COO-O-.

So, CH2 has 2 H, CH has 2 H (since it's double bonded), COO has no H. Then the ester group OCH2CH2CH3 has 2 (OCH2) + 2 (CH2) +3 (CH3) =7 H.

So the total H from the ester group is 7.

The acrylate part (CH2=CHCOO-) has 4 H: 2 from CH2 and 2 from CH.

So total H: 4 (from acrylate) + 7 (from ethyl) =11. But the formula would be C6H11O2, which isn't one of the options.

But wait, the options have C6H10O2 (option C) and C6H12O2 (option A). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a double bond in the ester group, reducing the number of H's.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Possible structures: ester (RCOOR'), where R and R' are alkyl groups.

If the ester is ethyl something, then R would be C5H11COO-.

Wait, but that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, if the ester is methyl propionate, but that would have fewer carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with a ring, but that's unclear.

Another factor: the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So, the compound must have a double bond. So, DoU must be at least 1.

Looking back, the options:

A) C6H12O2 → DoU 1.

C) C6H10O2 → DoU 2.

So, which of these can have a double bond and an ester group?

Option A: C6H12O2 with DoU 1. So, a single double bond or a ring.

But for an ester with a double bond, the DoU would be 1 (from the double bond). So, the formula would have to have DoU 1, which is option A or D.

Wait, but option D is C6H12O, which has DoU (14-12)/2=1. So that could have a double bond or a ring.

But the O count is important. The IR has a C=O and an O-H, suggesting two O's. So the formula must have O2. So options are A, C.

Thus, the correct formula is either A or C.

Option A: C6H12O2.

If it's an ester with a double bond, then the structure would have a double bond and an ester group. For example, ethyl pentenoate. But the exact structure depends on that.

Wait, but the mass spec fragment is at 45, which is OCH2CH3. So the ester group must be ethyl.

Thus, the compound is ethyl something with a double bond, and the formula would be C6H12O2.

Wait, but ethyl would contribute 2 carbons, and the rest 4. So the acid part would be 4 carbons, but with a double bond.

For example, ethyl 4-pentenoate would be CH2=CHCH2CH2COOCH2CH3. Wait, that's 5 carbons in the acid part? No, wait, 4-pentenoate would have 5 carbons in the acid, but that's getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester, but that's unlikely.

Another approach: molecular formula for option A is C6H12O2.

If the compound is an ester (RCOO R'), R and R' must sum to 6 carbons.

If R' is ethyl (2 carbons), then R must be 4 carbons.

So R would be a 4-carbon group attached to the carbonyl.

If R has a double bond, then the formula would have C=C. So for example, R is CH2CH2CH2CH2 (but that's a single bond). No, if R is CH2CHCH2CH3, but that's a single bond. Alternatively, R is CH2=CHCH2CH2-.

Wait, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2COOCH2CH3.

So the formula is C7H12O2. Wait, but that's too many carbons. Because R is 4 carbons (CH2=CHCH2CH2-), which is 4 carbons, plus the COO (2 O's), and the ethyl (2 carbons). So total 4+2 (from COO and ethyl?), no, wait, the COO is part of the acid. So I'm getting confused.

Maybe a better way is to calculate the molecular formula for each possible structure.

If the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), with DoU 2.

So, for a structure like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3.

Wait, that would be:

CH2=CHCOO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

That's 3 (from CH2=CHCOO-) +3 (from OCH2CH2CH3) =6 carbons.

Hydrogens: CH2=CHCOO- has 4 H, OCH2CH2CH3 has 7 H → total 11 H. But the formula is C6H10O2, so I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me count each C and H.

CH2=CHCOO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

The groups:

CH2=CHCOO-: CH2 (2 H), CH (2 H), COO (no H). So 4 H.

OCH2CH2CH3: O connected to CH2. Each CH2 has 2 H. So:

OCH2 → 2 H.

CH2 → 2 H.

CH3 →3 H.

Total H from ester group: 2 + 2 +3 =7 H.

So total H is 4 (from acid part) +7 (from ester part) =11 H. But the formula for option C is C6H10O2, which has 10 H. So that's a discrepancy.

Hmm, perhaps the structure isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a ring and a double bond, which would account for the DoU of 2.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps I should rely on the mass spec.

The fragment at m/z 45 is likely OCH2CH3, which is the ethyl group. So the compound includes an ethoxy group.

Looking at the options, the only options that include O2 are A and C.

So, if the compound is an ester with ethoxy and four more carbons, but that doesn't fit cleanly.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about what each option's possible structures could be.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Possible structures: ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, a cyclic ester (lactone) with six carbons.

But a lactone would have a ring, so DoU 1 (for the ring), which fits option A.

But then, does the IR show a broad O-H? In a lactone, the O-H is part of the ring and may not show a broad peak because it's not a free -OH.

Hmm, but the IR shows a broad O-H, which suggests a free -OH group, like an alcohol.

So, perhaps the structure isn't a lactone.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Possible structures: ester with a double bond and an alcohol group. But that would mean more O's. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, the structure is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, which would have a conjugated double bond and ester group.

For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that would have more than six carbons.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, which is ethyl acrylate. Its formula is C5H8O2, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: The mass spec fragment at 45. If the molecular ion is at, say, 114 (for C6H10O2), then 114-45=69. So perhaps the molecule breaks into a 45 fragment and a 69 fragment. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H10O2, and the ethoxy group is present. So, subtracting the 45 fragment (OCH2CH3), the remaining would be C4H7O. But that doesn't make much sense because C4H7O isn't a common structure.

Wait, perhaps the compound is ethyl something with a double bond. For example, ethyl propenoate (but that's C5H8O2), which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester with an ethyl substituent, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to piece it together.

The IR indicates a carbonyl (ester, acid, ketone), an O-H (alcohol or acid), and possibly a conjugated carbonyl.

The NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond.

The mass spec has a fragment at 45, likely OCH2CH3.

Thus, the compound must have an ethoxy group and a carbonyl group, along with a double bond.

The formula with O2 and six carbons that includes an ethoxy group is option C: C6H10O2.

So, putting it all together, the correct formula is option C: C6H10O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound is characterized using FTIR, $^1$H NMR, and mass spectrometry. Here's the analysis:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**:
   - A broad absorption at 3000 cm$^-$ suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
   - A strong absorption at 1700 cm$^-$ indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), possibly from an ester, ketone, or carboxylic acid.
   - A peak at 1650 cm$^-$ suggests a conjugated carbonyl group or another functional group.

2. **$^1$H NMR Spectrum**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment at m/z = 45 is observed. This is consistent with the ethoxy group (OCH$_2$CH$_3$), as its molecular weight is 45.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A (C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_2$)**:
     - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1, suggesting either a ring or a double bond.
     - The IR and NMR data indicate a double bond and a carbonyl group, which fits. However, the broad O-H peak suggests the presence of an alcohol or carboxylic acid, which is less consistent with this formula.
   - **Option B (C$_6$H$_{10}$O)**:
     - DoU = 2, suggesting two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.
     - This formula lacks the second oxygen required for the carbonyl group indicated by the IR spectrum, making it unlikely.
   - **Option C (C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$)**:
     - DoU = 2, consistent with a double bond and an additional unsaturation (e.g., a ring or another double bond).
     - The IR spectrum supports the presence of a carbonyl group, and the broad O-H peak aligns with an alcohol or carboxylic acid. The NMR data for vinyl hydrogens and the mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 (OCH$_2$CH$_3$) are also consistent with this formula.
   - **Option D (C$_6$H$_{12}$O)**:
     - DoU = 1, suggesting a ring or a double bond.
     - This formula lacks the second oxygen required for the carbonyl group indicated by the IR spectrum, making it unlikely.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The compound must have an ethoxy group (OCH$_2$CH$_3$), a carbonyl group, and a double bond. These features are best matched by **Option C (C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$)**, which has the correct degrees of unsaturation and functional groups to explain the spectroscopic data.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's see what each of the techniques tells me.

First, the FTIR spectrum. I remember that IR is useful for identifying functional groups. The problem says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait—carboxylic acids also have a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl. Oh, right, so if there's a broad peak at 3000, that's likely an O-H group, maybe an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. 

The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is often a carbonyl (C=O), like in ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe an acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest something else. Wait, maybe that's a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Or perhaps it's an amide? But the options don't have nitrogen, so maybe it's a carbonyl with conjugation, like an ester or maybe a ketone with some conjugation.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond somewhere, maybe part of an ester or another carbonyl group.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass for something like (CH3)2O, which is 45 g/mol. Or maybe it's a different fragment. Alternatively, m/z 45 could be an acetyl group (CH3CO- would be 43, but maybe with something else). Wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular ion for CH3CH2O- but wait, that's 45 minus the charge. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment from a larger molecule breaking down. For example, if there's an ester group, maybe the ester cleaves, releasing the alcohol part. Let's think: if the compound is an ester, say R-O-CO-O-R', then the fragments could include the acyl part. Alternatively, for a methyl group, but I'm not sure.

Now, considering the options:

Option A: C6H12O2
Option B: C6H10O
Option C: C6H10O2
Option D: C6H12O

Let's think about degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N here.

For C6H12O2: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14 -12)/2 = 1. So one ring or double bond.

But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So with DoU 1, perhaps one double bond or one ring. But if the compound has a double bond and a ring, that would be two DoU. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, another formula: C6H10O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be two double bonds, a ring and a double bond, etc.

Wait the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. So if DoU is two, that suggests another double bond or a ring.

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, which is a common functional group.

Ester general formula is R-O-CO-O-R'. Wait, no, esters are RCOOR'. The formula for an ester is (R is an alkyl group, say CnH2n+1) and (another R' is another alkyl, say CmH2m+1). So the ester would have formula Cn+1+m H2(n+m)+2 O2.

Wait, perhaps it's an ester of a diol and a diacid, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, a simple ester. Let's think about C6H12O2. Suppose it's an ester: RCOOR', where R and R' are alkyl groups.

Suppose R is CH3 and R' is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but wait, that might give a different formula. Wait, perhaps an ester such as methyl something.

Wait, the molecular formula for an ester RCOOR' is (for R = CnH2n+1, R'= CmH2m+1) would be Cn+1 + m H2(n + m +1) O2.

Wait, maybe I should think about the options. Let's check each option's possible structure.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU is (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or one double bond. But the NMR has vinyl H, so double bond is present. So maybe a double bond and no ring. Alternatively, a ring and a double bond (but that would require DoU 2).

Alternatively, a cyclic ester? No, that's a lactide, but that's a different scenario.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So the compound has a carbonyl group, probably an ester or a ketone. If it's an ester, then the formula would be RCOOR', which would fit a C6H12O2. Because, for example, an ester with formula C5H10O2 would be, but wait, let's calculate.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: an ester has the formula R-O-CO-R'. Wait no, it's RCOOR', so the formula is (R is CnH2n-1, R' is CmH2m+1). So the ester has (n + m + 2) carbons? Hmm, perhaps I need to think more clearly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ortho ester or something else, but I think it's more straightforward.

So, for the IR, there's a broad O-H peak, probably from an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H around 3000 and a strong carbonyl around 1700. But if the compound were a carboxylic acid, then the formula would have O2? Wait, a carboxylic acid is RCOOH, which has formula CnH2nO2. So if it's, say, C6H12O2, that fits (n=6 would be C6H12O2, but wait, that would require 2n=12, so n=6: C6H12O2. So a carboxylic acid like hexanoic acid would have C6H12O2. But then, in the NMR, would there be vinyl hydrogens? No, because a carboxylic acid is just a straight chain, unless there's a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but the NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond is present. So if it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, perhaps an alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid.

Wait, but then the molecular formula would be different. Let's see: for an alpha,beta-unsaturated acid, like CH2=CHCOOH, which is acrylic acid: C3H4O2. So for a six-carbon compound, maybe something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. So the formula would be C6H10O2, right? Because each double bond reduces two H's.

Wait, but the options don't have all of that.

Alternatively, maybe it's not a carboxylic acid. Because the IR has a broad peak but also a strong peak at 1650. Wait, maybe that's a conjugated carbonyl? Like an ester with an adjacent double bond.

Alternatively, the IR peaks: 3000 (broad, O-H), 1700 (C=O), and 1650 (maybe another C=O conjugated, or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents, but the options don't have benzene rings. So perhaps the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester where the carbonyl is conjugated with a double bond.

So maybe the structure is something like an ester with a double bond. For example, a vinyl ester: CH2=CHCOOOR or something like that. Wait, but let's think about the mass spec.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z 45. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHO (maybe? Let me calculate: 12*4 + 1*9 = 48? Wait, no. Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. What's 45?

Carbon: 12, Hydrogen: 1, Oxygen: 16.

So 45: 12*a + 1*b +16*c =45.

Possible combinations: 3 carbons, like (CH3)2O is 45? Let's see: (CH3)2O is C2H6O, so 2*12=24 +6=30 +16=46. No, that's 46. Hmm.

Alternatively, CH3COO- is 59. Hmm, not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a fragment from the compound. For example, if the compound is an ester, like RCOOR', the ester group might break into RCOO+ and R'–. The RCOO+ would have a mass of (12n + 2n + 16*2 + maybe) ?

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the compound can be determined by looking at the molecular ion in the mass spec. But the problem only gives a fragment at m/z 45, which might not be the molecular ion.

Hmm, perhaps the molecular formula can be determined via each technique.

Wait, let's think about the possible formulas.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So either a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (14-10)/2=2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation: (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or one double bond.

Now, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So, at least one double bond. So, for each option, let's see if the possible structure has a double bond.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=1. So either a ring or a double bond. If it's a double bond, then that fits. So it could be an ester with a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=2. So probably two double bonds or a ring and a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So same as B, but with two O's.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=1. So, a ring or a double bond.

So, looking for a compound with a double bond (due to vinyl H in NMR) and a carbonyl group (due to IR). Also, the O-H in IR suggests either an alcohol or an acid. 

If the compound is an ester, which has both oxygen atoms, then the formula would have O2, which points to options A or C.

Wait, but the O-H in IR—esters don't have O-H unless it's an acid or an alcohol. So if the compound is an ester, how do we get the O-H? Maybe I'm wrong, perhaps it's not an ester.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. Like a diol with a ketone. But that would require more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a beta-keto ester, which would have a structure like RCOCOR'. But that might not fit the options.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which would have a ring and an ester group. If it's a lactone, the structure would have a ring (so DoU increases by 1) and a carbonyl. So for a six-carbon lactone, the formula would be C6H10O2. Because the lactone is formed by cyclization of a hydroxy acid. For example, a five-membered ring lactone would come from a four-carbon hydroxy acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think again. The FTIR shows a broad O-H, which is strong and broad, so likely an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If it's an alcohol, then the compound would have -OH group. So the formula would include O, but the options are given so we have to match.

Now, looking at the mass spec: m/z 45. Let's think of possible fragments. 45 could be (CH3)2CHO (molecular weight 45?), wait:

CH3CH2CHO is 72 (no). Wait, 45 is less. Let's think, maybe it's a methyl group plus something else. Alternatively, a fragment with a carbonyl group. Like CH3CO would be 43 (CH3CO+ is 43?), but 45 is two more. Maybe CH3COO-? That's 60. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is an ethyl group attached to something. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH2 (ethylene), but that's 28. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a fragment where a CH2 group is attached to something else. Another thought: if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which has a degree of unsaturation 2, perhaps it's an ester with a double bond. So something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that's a longer chain. Let's calculate the formula: CH2=CHCOO- would be C3H4O2, and the R' would be, say, C3H7, so the ester would be C3H4O2 + C3H7 = C6H11O2. Hmm, but that would be C6H11O2, which isn't one of the options. Wait, our options are C6H10O2, which is DoU 2.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the molecular formula. The molecular ion (if the mass spec gives it) would have a molecular weight that is the sum of the isotopes. But the problem only gives a fragment at 45. So perhaps the molecular weight is higher, but the fragment is 45.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's see: 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32. Total 72+10+32=114 g/mol.

Alternatively, if the molecular formula is C6H12O2: 6*12=72, 12=12, 2*16=32. 72+12+32=116.

Hmm, but in the mass spec, the fragment is 45. Let's think about what parts of the molecule could give m/z 45.

Another thought: the m/z 45 could be a cleavage fragment, like the loss of a larger group. For example, if the compound is an ester, perhaps the ester group breaks apart, releasing the RCOO+ group. The RCOO+ would have a molecular weight of, say, if R is CH2CH2..., but perhaps let's think of possible R groups.

Wait, 45 is a common mass for (CH3)2CHO. Wait, (CH3)2CHO is 45? Let's calculate: (CH3)2CHO - that's C3H7O. Molecular weight: 3*12 +7*1 +16 = 36 +7 +16=59. No, that's not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a CH2CH2CO- group. CH2CH2CO- is C3H4O. Molecular weight: 3*12 +4 +16=36+4+16=56. Not 45.

Hmm, maybe it's a smaller fragment. Like CH2CH2O (which is C2H5O). Molecular weight: 24 +5 +16=45. Ah, yes! Because 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens, and one oxygen: 2*12=24, 5=5, 16=16. 24+5=29 +16=45.

So the fragment at m/z 45 could be CH2CH2O ( -O-CH2CH3) perhaps. So that would suggest an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) is present in the molecule. Because when the molecule fragments, the ethoxy group breaks off, giving a fragment of 45 (m/z).

So if the compound has an ethoxy group, then the formula would include OCH2CH3, which contributes two carbons and five hydrogens plus an oxygen.

Looking at the options, let's see which could have an ethoxy group.

If the formula is C6H10O2, then subtracting the ethoxy (C2H5O), we get C4H5O. But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the entire R group is contributing to this.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the unknown is one of the options, and it includes an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3). So the formula would have at least 2 carbons from the ethoxy.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. The ethoxy group has 2 C, so the remaining would be C4H11O. That doesn't make sense because O is already accounted for.

Option C: C6H10O2. If it has an ethoxy group, the remaining would be C4H7O. Hmm, possible. For example, if the compound is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that would be longer than six carbons). Alternatively, perhaps a cyclic ester like a five-membered ring, where the ester is part of the ring.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with an ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl. Let's see:

For example, ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. The formula is C5H8O2. Hmm, but our options are C6H10O2, which is more carbons. So maybe it's a longer ester.

Wait, perhaps the formula is C6H10O2. Let's say the molecule is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's 3 carbons (CH2=CHCOO-) and 3 carbons (CH2CH2CH3), so that's 6 carbons. Let's check the formula: C6H10O2.

Wait, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 is C6H10O2. Let me count:

CH2=CHCOO- is 3 carbons (CH2-CH-COO-) and the ethyl group is 3 carbons (CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the ethyl group is CH2CH3, which is two carbons. So CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 would have 3 (from acrylate) + 3 (from the ester group) = 6 carbons. Wait, no. CH2=CHCOO is three carbons (CH2, CH, COO), and the ester's R' is CH2CH2CH3? Which is three carbons. So 3 + 3 =6. So the formula would be C6H8O2? Wait, wait, let me calculate the hydrogens.

The structure: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3.

CH2=CHCOO-: each CH2 has 2 H, the CH has 2 H (since it's double bonded), the COO- would have no H.

Wait, actually, structure is CH2=CH-COO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, the double bond is between the first and second carbon of the acrylate.

So the acrylate part is CH2=CHCOO-.

So the formula for CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 would be:

Carbons: 3 (CH2=CHCOO-) +3 (CH2CH2CH3) =6.

Hydrogens: CH2=CHCOO- has (CH2 has 2 H, CH has 2 H), the COO has no H. Then the ester group is OCH2CH2CH3, which has 2*3 =6 H (each CH2 has 2 H, and the CH3 has 3 H). Wait, wait, let me count again.

CH2=CHCOO-:

CH2: 2 H.

CH: 2 H (since it's double bonded, no H on the double bond).

COO: no H.

So 2 +2 =4 H from the acrylate part.

The ethyl group (OCH2CH2CH3):

O connected to CH2CH2CH3.

CH2: 2 H each.

CH2CH2CH3: each CH2 has 2 H, so the group is CH2CH2CH3: 2 (first CH2) + 2 (second CH2) +3 (CH3) =7 H.

But wait, the O is connected to the first CH2: so the group is CH2CH2CH3. So the ester oxygen is connected to CH2-CH2-CH3.

So the ethyl group contributes 2 (from OCH2) + 2 (from CH2) +3 (from CH3) =7 H.

Wait, but the O is connected to the first CH2: so the entire group is OCH2CH2CH3, which has 2 (OCH2) + 2 (CH2) +3 (CH3) =7 H.

Wait, but the ester group is O-CO-O-R. So the R is CH2CH2CH3, which has 7 H.

Wait, but the entire molecule would have:

From the acrylate: CH2=CHCOO- has 4 H.

From the ester group: OCH2CH2CH3 has 7 H.

Wait, but wait, the carbonyl is between the CH2 and the O, so that structure may have fewer Hs. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula of the ester would be C5H8O2 for ethyl acrylate. But our options are C6H10O2 for option C.

Wait, maybe the compound is methyl vinyl acetate or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester or something else.

But let's get back to the problem.

We have the fragment at m/z 45, which we thought was OCH2CH3 (45). So the compound likely has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3).

So which of the options include an OCH2CH3 group?

Looking at the options, the formula C6H10O2 could have an ethoxy group.

If the formula is C6H10O2 and it includes OCH2CH3, then the remaining part would be C4H7O. Wait, but that would require the remaining part to have formula C4H7O. That seems a bit difficult because O is already present.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an ester with ethoxy and another group.

Let me think: if the formula is C6H10O2, and it's an ester (RCOO-R'), then R and R' must add up to 6 carbons.

Assuming R' is ethyl (2 carbons), then R would be 4 carbons. So R is a 4-carbon group, and R' is 2 carbons.

So R is a 4-carbon group attached to a carbonyl, and R' is ethyl.

But R would have to contribute H and O as well.

Wait, the formula for RCOOR' would be (n from R) + (m from R') carbons. For RCOOR', the formula is (n+1 + m) C, (2n + 2 + 2m +1?) Hmm, perhaps not the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone), which would contribute a ring structure. A six-membered lactone would have the formula C6H10O2.

Wait, a lactone is an ester formed from a cyclic hydroxy acid. For example, a six-membered lactone (gamma-lactone would be 5-membered, but let's not get into that). So the formula for a six-membered lactone would be C6H10O2.

So, in that case, the IR would show the ester carbonyl (around 1700), and perhaps the O-H from the acid would be present as a broad peak. But wait, in a lactone, the acid is part of the ring, so the O-H is not present as a free -OH. Hmm, maybe not. So the broad peak might be due to something else.

Wait, but if the compound is a diol? No, the IR has a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester and an alcohol. But that would require more O's, perhaps.

Wait, another thought: the FTIR has a strong peak at 1700 (carbonyl), 1650 (perhaps conjugated), and a broad O-H. Maybe it's a beta-keto acid, which has two carbonyl groups but that's more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an ortho ester, which has the structure R-O-CO-O-R'. But I think that's less common.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone with an alcohol group. Let's see.

If the compound is a ketone and an alcohol, the formula would have two O's. So for C6H12O2, that fits option A. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So, if it's a ketone with a double bond and an alcohol group, the formula would be C6H12O2 (DoU=1: a double bond). Wait, but DoU for C6H12O2 is (14-12)/2=1. So it would have one degree of unsaturation: either a ring or a double bond.

So, a compound with a double bond would fit that.

But then, the IR's 1700 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl (could be a ketone), the 1650 could be another C=O (but that would require two carbonyls), but that would be unlikely without another O. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me summarize:

- IR: broad O-H (alcohol or acid), strong C=O (ester, ketone, acid).
- NMR: vinyl H → double bond.
- Mass spec: fragment at 45 → possibly OCH2CH3 (ethyl group).

So, the compound probably has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) and a carbonyl group, along with a double bond.

Which option fits:

Option A: C6H12O2 → DoU 1. Could have a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2 → DoU 2. Could have a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.

Looking for a formula that includes an ethoxy group and a carbonyl group.

If the formula is C6H10O2, which has two O's, that could fit an ester (O from ester group) and perhaps another O from a carbonyl or an alcohol.

Wait, the IR's broad O-H suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If it's an ester, the O-H would come from an alcohol group somewhere else.

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester with a hydroxyl group, perhaps a hemiacetal or something. But that's getting complicated.

Another angle: the molecular formula must have the correct number of H and O.

If the fragment is OCH2CH3 (45), then the ethoxy group is present.

So, the molecular formula must include OCH2CH3.

So, for the formula C6H10O2, subtracting OCH2CH3 (C2H5O), we get C4H5O. But C4H5O doesn't fit any known structure without being something like a cyclic ether or a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with ethyl group and another group.

For example, ethyl propionate is CH3CH2COOCH2CH3. Its formula is C5H10O2. But our options don't have that.

Wait, but the options have C6H10O2. So perhaps the ester is between a four-carbon acid and an ethyl group.

For example, butyl propionate: CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Let's see, the formula would be C6H12O2. Wait, but that's option A.

But our fragment is 45, which points to an ethyl group. So if the ester is ethyl something, perhaps the formula aligns with option C.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has a different structure.

Another approach: Degrees of Unsaturation.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2.

So two degrees: could be two double bonds, a ring and a double bond, etc.

If it's an ester with a double bond and a ring, that would fit. Or maybe a diene and an ester.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps I should correlate the mass spec.

The fragment at m/z 45. If that is OCH2CH3 (45), then the compound likely has an ethyl group attached via an oxygen.

Which option includes OCH2CH3?

Looking back, the options:

Option C is C6H10O2.

If the compound is ethyl something with four more carbons, but that's getting too vague.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an ethyl group. But a six-membered lactone would have the formula C6H10O2. So that's option C. But in a lactone, the structure is cyclic, and there's no free O-H group because the acid is part of the ring. Hmm, but that would contradict the broad O-H peak in IR. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: the fragment at m/z 45 could be from a different part of the molecule. For example, if the molecule has a ketone group, maybe a (CH3)2CO group, which is 58 (m/z 58?), but that's not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the cleavage of the molecule, such as the loss of a larger group. For instance, if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, then the fragment might be the ethyl ester group (OCH2CH3) which is 45.

But that would make the formula C6H10O2, since the ester is CH2=CHCOO-OCH2CH2CH3. Wait, actually, that's 3 carbons from the ester acid part and 3 from the ester alcohol part, making 6. Let's count H:

CH2=CHCOO-OCH2CH2CH3.

CH2=CHCOO-: The structure is CH2-CH-COO-O-.

So, CH2 has 2 H, CH has 2 H (since it's double bonded), COO has no H. Then the ester group OCH2CH2CH3 has 2 (OCH2) + 2 (CH2) +3 (CH3) =7 H.

So the total H from the ester group is 7.

The acrylate part (CH2=CHCOO-) has 4 H: 2 from CH2 and 2 from CH.

So total H: 4 (from acrylate) + 7 (from ethyl) =11. But the formula would be C6H11O2, which isn't one of the options.

But wait, the options have C6H10O2 (option C) and C6H12O2 (option A). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a double bond in the ester group, reducing the number of H's.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Possible structures: ester (RCOOR'), where R and R' are alkyl groups.

If the ester is ethyl something, then R would be C5H11COO-.

Wait, but that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, if the ester is methyl propionate, but that would have fewer carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with a ring, but that's unclear.

Another factor: the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So, the compound must have a double bond. So, DoU must be at least 1.

Looking back, the options:

A) C6H12O2 → DoU 1.

C) C6H10O2 → DoU 2.

So, which of these can have a double bond and an ester group?

Option A: C6H12O2 with DoU 1. So, a single double bond or a ring.

But for an ester with a double bond, the DoU would be 1 (from the double bond). So, the formula would have to have DoU 1, which is option A or D.

Wait, but option D is C6H12O, which has DoU (14-12)/2=1. So that could have a double bond or a ring.

But the O count is important. The IR has a C=O and an O-H, suggesting two O's. So the formula must have O2. So options are A, C.

Thus, the correct formula is either A or C.

Option A: C6H12O2.

If it's an ester with a double bond, then the structure would have a double bond and an ester group. For example, ethyl pentenoate. But the exact structure depends on that.

Wait, but the mass spec fragment is at 45, which is OCH2CH3. So the ester group must be ethyl.

Thus, the compound is ethyl something with a double bond, and the formula would be C6H12O2.

Wait, but ethyl would contribute 2 carbons, and the rest 4. So the acid part would be 4 carbons, but with a double bond.

For example, ethyl 4-pentenoate would be CH2=CHCH2CH2COOCH2CH3. Wait, that's 5 carbons in the acid part? No, wait, 4-pentenoate would have 5 carbons in the acid, but that's getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester, but that's unlikely.

Another approach: molecular formula for option A is C6H12O2.

If the compound is an ester (RCOO R'), R and R' must sum to 6 carbons.

If R' is ethyl (2 carbons), then R must be 4 carbons.

So R would be a 4-carbon group attached to the carbonyl.

If R has a double bond, then the formula would have C=C. So for example, R is CH2CH2CH2CH2 (but that's a single bond). No, if R is CH2CHCH2CH3, but that's a single bond. Alternatively, R is CH2=CHCH2CH2-.

Wait, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2COOCH2CH3.

So the formula is C7H12O2. Wait, but that's too many carbons. Because R is 4 carbons (CH2=CHCH2CH2-), which is 4 carbons, plus the COO (2 O's), and the ethyl (2 carbons). So total 4+2 (from COO and ethyl?), no, wait, the COO is part of the acid. So I'm getting confused.

Maybe a better way is to calculate the molecular formula for each possible structure.

If the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), with DoU 2.

So, for a structure like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3.

Wait, that would be:

CH2=CHCOO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

That's 3 (from CH2=CHCOO-) +3 (from OCH2CH2CH3) =6 carbons.

Hydrogens: CH2=CHCOO- has 4 H, OCH2CH2CH3 has 7 H → total 11 H. But the formula is C6H10O2, so I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me count each C and H.

CH2=CHCOO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

The groups:

CH2=CHCOO-: CH2 (2 H), CH (2 H), COO (no H). So 4 H.

OCH2CH2CH3: O connected to CH2. Each CH2 has 2 H. So:

OCH2 → 2 H.

CH2 → 2 H.

CH3 →3 H.

Total H from ester group: 2 + 2 +3 =7 H.

So total H is 4 (from acid part) +7 (from ester part) =11 H. But the formula for option C is C6H10O2, which has 10 H. So that's a discrepancy.

Hmm, perhaps the structure isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a ring and a double bond, which would account for the DoU of 2.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps I should rely on the mass spec.

The fragment at m/z 45 is likely OCH2CH3, which is the ethyl group. So the compound includes an ethoxy group.

Looking at the options, the only options that include O2 are A and C.

So, if the compound is an ester with ethoxy and four more carbons, but that doesn't fit cleanly.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about what each option's possible structures could be.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Possible structures: ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, a cyclic ester (lactone) with six carbons.

But a lactone would have a ring, so DoU 1 (for the ring), which fits option A.

But then, does the IR show a broad O-H? In a lactone, the O-H is part of the ring and may not show a broad peak because it's not a free -OH.

Hmm, but the IR shows a broad O-H, which suggests a free -OH group, like an alcohol.

So, perhaps the structure isn't a lactone.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Possible structures: ester with a double bond and an alcohol group. But that would mean more O's. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, the structure is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, which would have a conjugated double bond and ester group.

For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that would have more than six carbons.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, which is ethyl acrylate. Its formula is C5H8O2, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: The mass spec fragment at 45. If the molecular ion is at, say, 114 (for C6H10O2), then 114-45=69. So perhaps the molecule breaks into a 45 fragment and a 69 fragment. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H10O2, and the ethoxy group is present. So, subtracting the 45 fragment (OCH2CH3), the remaining would be C4H7O. But that doesn't make much sense because C4H7O isn't a common structure.

Wait, perhaps the compound is ethyl something with a double bond. For example, ethyl propenoate (but that's C5H8O2), which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester with an ethyl substituent, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to piece it together.

The IR indicates a carbonyl (ester, acid, ketone), an O-H (alcohol or acid), and possibly a conjugated carbonyl.

The NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond.

The mass spec has a fragment at 45, likely OCH2CH3.

Thus, the compound must have an ethoxy group and a carbonyl group, along with a double bond.

The formula with O2 and six carbons that includes an ethoxy group is option C: C6H10O2.

So, putting it all together, the correct formula is option C: C6H10O2.


The unknown compound is characterized using FTIR, $^1$H NMR, and mass spectrometry. Here's the analysis:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**:
   - A broad absorption at 3000 cm$^-$ suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
   - A strong absorption at 1700 cm$^-$ indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), possibly from an ester, ketone, or carboxylic acid.
   - A peak at 1650 cm$^-$ suggests a conjugated carbonyl group or another functional group.

2. **$^1$H NMR Spectrum**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment at m/z = 45 is observed. This is consistent with the ethoxy group (OCH$_2$CH$_3$), as its molecular weight is 45.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A (C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_2$)**:
     - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1, suggesting either a ring or a double bond.
     - The IR and NMR data indicate a double bond and a carbonyl group, which fits. However, the broad O-H peak suggests the presence of an alcohol or carboxylic acid, which is less consistent with this formula.
   - **Option B (C$_6$H$_{10}$O)**:
     - DoU = 2, suggesting two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.
     - This formula lacks the second oxygen required for the carbonyl group indicated by the IR spectrum, making it unlikely.
   - **Option C (C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$)**:
     - DoU = 2, consistent with a double bond and an additional unsaturation (e.g., a ring or another double bond).
     - The IR spectrum supports the presence of a carbonyl group, and the broad O-H peak aligns with an alcohol or carboxylic acid. The NMR data for vinyl hydrogens and the mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 (OCH$_2$CH$_3$) are also consistent with this formula.
   - **Option D (C$_6$H$_{12}$O)**:
     - DoU = 1, suggesting a ring or a double bond.
     - This formula lacks the second oxygen required for the carbonyl group indicated by the IR spectrum, making it unlikely.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The compound must have an ethoxy group (OCH$_2$CH$_3$), a carbonyl group, and a double bond. These features are best matched by **Option C (C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$)**, which has the correct degrees of unsaturation and functional groups to explain the spectroscopic data.
