Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice science question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me read through the problem again and take notes.

So, the setup is that there are two planets orbiting a star. Both have been detected using the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. 

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. 

The star's forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å is shifting because of the planets. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2's impact is 0.04 Å. 

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, assuming same albedo. So I need to find T1/T2 or T2/T1?

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on several factors. The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Since albedos are same, that part cancels out in the ratio.

Wait, but I think the exact formula is T_eq = T_star * ( R_star / (2a) )^0.5 * ( (1 - A) / (1 + e * cos θ) )^0.25. But since the orbits are circular, e is zero. So it simplifies to T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.25. But since A is same, the (1 - A) part is same for both, so the ratio would only depend on a and R_star and T_star.

But wait, how do I find the semi-major axes (a) for each planet? I think that's the key here. Because the RV method gives the mass function, but perhaps more importantly, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the star's mass, and the distance.

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which gives the star's velocity towards and away from us. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by (v) = ( (G * (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) * sin i ) / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) * (M_planet/M_star)^{2/3} ) ) ) but maybe that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the distance (a). The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * M_planet * sin i ) ) / ( (2 * π * c) * (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, but perhaps another approach is better. Since both planets cause a Doppler shift, their RV semi-amplitudes are given by the shifts. The forbidden line shift is due to the Doppler effect, so the shift (Δλ/λ) is proportional to velocity. The Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ = v/c, where v is the velocity. 

Wait, the shift given is up to 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. The star's line is at 6300 Å. So the fractional shift is Δλ/λ = 0.03 / 6300 ≈ 4.76e-6 for Planet1, and 0.04/6300≈6.35e-6 for Planet2.

These fractional shifts correspond to the velocity of the star towards and away from us, so v = c * (Δλ/λ). Let's compute these velocities.

Speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s, but let me calculate using the exact numbers.

v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c = (0.03 / 6300) * 3e5 km/s.

Wait, c is 3e5 km/s, so 0.03/6300 = 3e-3 /6.3e3 = ~4.76e-7. Multiply by c=3e5 km/s: v1=4.76e-7 * 3e5 = 0.1428 km/s = 142.8 m/s.

Similarly, v2 = (0.04 /6300) * 3e5 = (approx 6.35e-6) *3e5 = 1.905e0 km/s = 190.5 m/s.

So Planet2 causes a larger Doppler shift (higher velocity) than Planet1.

Now, how does the RV semi-amplitude K relate to the planet's mass and the orbital distance a.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (8 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But perhaps a better approach is to use the formula that relates K to the planet's orbital period and the star's velocity.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the following formula for K:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * ( (1 + M_planet/M_star) )^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1/( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) )) ) * ( (2 pi) / P )^(1/3) )

Hmm, this seems complicated. Wait, perhaps a simpler formula exists. 

I remember that K is given by:

K = ( (v) ) = ( ( (G * M_planet) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 + m/M)^(1/3) )) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 + m/M)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi) / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should instead think about the formula for K in terms of the planet's mass and the orbital period.

Wait, another formula I found is:

K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi) / ( P ) )^(1/3) ) / (c )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.

The RV method's semi-amplitude K is also given by:

K = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) )

But perhaps knowing that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so M_* is 1.5 times the Sun's mass.

So, M_* = 1.5 M_sun, and M_p for Planet1 is 7 Earth masses. But Earth mass is about 3e-6 solar masses, so 7 Earth masses is 2.1e-5 solar masses. Similarly for Planet2, 5 Earth masses is about 1.5e-5 solar masses.

So M_p << M_*, so M_* ≈ M_* + M_p.

So, K ≈ ( (2 pi G) / c )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But wait, I can rearrange this to solve for P in terms of K and M_p.

Alternatively, for a circular orbit, the period P is related to the semi-major axis a via Kepler's third law:

P^2 = (4 pi^2 / G (M_* + M_p)) a^3

Again, since M_p is much smaller than M_*, P^2 ≈ (4 pi^2 / (G M_* )) a^3.

So, a^3 = (G M_* P^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

But how does this tie into K?

Wait, let me think about combining these equations.

We have K = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( c M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, let me write this as:

K = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( c M_*^(2/3) ) ) * (1/ P^(1/3) )

But from Kepler's law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3)/(G M_* )

So, P = sqrt( (4 pi^2 a^3)/( G M_* ) )

So, P^(1/3) = ( (4 pi^2 a^3)/( G M_* ) )^(1/6 )

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe instead, express a in terms of P and M_*, then substitute into the K equation.

Alternatively, let's think about the ratio of K for the two planets. Since K1 and K2 are given, and M_p1 and M_p2 are given, and M_* is same for both, perhaps we can find a ratio of a1 and a2.

Wait, because for each planet,

K ∝ (M_p) / ( P^(1/3) )

But from Kepler's law, P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_*, so P ∝ a^(3/2) / sqrt(M_*)

So, P^(1/3) ∝ a^(1/2) / M_*^(1/6)

Putting this into K's equation:

K ∝ (M_p ) / ( a^(1/2) / M_*^(1/6) )

Which simplifies to:

K ∝ ( M_p * M_*^(1/6) ) / a^(1/2 )

Or,

K ∝ ( M_p ) * ( M_* )^(1/6) / sqrt(a )

So, rearranged,

sqrt(a) ∝ ( M_p * M_*^(1/6) ) / K

So, sqrt(a) is proportional to ( M_p / K ) * M_*^(1/6 )

But since M_* is same for both planets, the ratio of a1/a2 would be:

sqrt(a1)/sqrt(a2) = ( (M_p1 / K1) ) / ( (M_p2 / K2) )

So,

sqrt( a1/a2 ) = ( M_p1 K2 ) / ( M_p2 K1 )

Because I think it's (M_p1 * M_*^(1/6) / K1 ) / ( M_p2 * M_*^(1/6) / K2 ) ) = ( M_p1 K2 ) / ( M_p2 K1 )

So,

sqrt( a1/a2 ) = ( M_p1 K2 ) / ( M_p2 K1 )

Squaring both sides,

a1/a2 = ( M_p1^2 K2^2 ) / ( M_p2^2 K1^2 )

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the proportionality. Let me try again.

From earlier, K ∝ ( M_p * M_*^(1/6) ) / sqrt(a )

So,

K = k * ( M_p * M_*^(1/6) ) / sqrt(a )

Where k is a constant.

So, for each planet,

K1 = k * ( M_p1 * M_*^(1/6) ) / sqrt(a1 )

K2 = k * ( M_p2 * M_*^(1/6) ) / sqrt(a2 )

Divide K1 by K2,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1) )

So,

sqrt(a1/a2) = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( K2 / K1 )

So,

a1/a2 = [ ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( K2 / K1 ) ]^2

Let me plug in the numbers.

M_p1 =7 Earth masses.

M_p2=5 Earth masses.

K1=0.03 Å shift, K2=0.04 Å shift.

So,

a1/a2 = [ (7/5) * (0.04/0.03) ]^2

Let's calculate (7/5) =1.4, (0.04/0.03)=1.3333...

So,

1.4 * 1.3333 ≈ 1.8667

Square that: (1.8667)^2 ≈ 3.483.

So, a1/a2 ≈ 3.483.

So, a1 is about 3.48 times a2.

Wait, but wait, I thought the velocity shift gave K, but maybe I should think about the ratio of K in terms of the actual velocities.

Wait, the shifts are 0.03 and 0.04 Å, but those correspond to velocities. So in the K terms, they are the velocity amplitudes.

So K1 is 142.8 m/s, K2 is 190.5 m/s.

So,

K1=142.8, K2=190.5.

So,

K2/K1 = 190.5 / 142.8 ≈ 1.333.

So,

a1/a2 = [ (7/5) * (190.5/142.8) ]^2.

Compute 190.5 / 142.8 ≈1.333.

7/5=1.4.

1.4 *1.333≈1.866.

So, squared gives approx 3.48.

So, a1 is about 3.48 times larger than a2.

Which means Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.

Wait, no, because a1 is the semi-major axis of Planet1. So if a1 is larger than a2, Planet1 is farther out.

Now, the equilibrium temperature formula is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.25

Since albedo is same, (1 - A) is same, so the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 is sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) )

Which simplifies to sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because,

sqrt( ( R/(2a1) ) / ( R/(2a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We found that a1/a2≈3.483, so a2/a1≈1/3.483≈0.287.

So,

sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

Wait, that's approximately 0.536.

So the ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 is about 0.536. So Planet1's equilibrium temperature is about 53.6% of Planet2's.

Wait, but the question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So T1 over T2. So 0.536.

Looking at the options. Option C is ~0.53, which matches.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Compute K2/K1: 190.5 /142.8 = approx 1.333.

M_p1 =7, M_p2=5. So 7/5=1.4.

So 1.4 * 1.333=1.866.

Squared, 1.866^2= about 3.48.

So a1/a2=3.48, so a2/a1=0.287.

T_eq ratio = sqrt( a2/a1 )=sqrt(0.287)= approx 0.536.

So, the ratio is T1/T2=0.536.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is the closest.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - A\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo (\(A\)), the \((1 - A)\) term cancels out in the ratio. Thus, the equilibrium temperature ratio depends only on the semi-major axes (\(a_1\) and \(a_2\)) of the planets:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude formula. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p \cdot \sin i}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

Given that \(M_{\text{star}} \gg M_p\), we approximate \(M_{\text{star}} + M_p \approx M_{\text{star}}\). The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes gives:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1} \cdot \sqrt{a_2}}{M_{p2} \cdot \sqrt{a_1}}
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_{p1} \cdot K_2}{M_{p2} \cdot K_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}, \, M_{p2} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\)
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}, \, K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{7}{5} \cdot \frac{0.04}{0.03}\right)^2
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(1.4 \cdot 1.333\right)^2 = (1.866)^2 \approx 3.48
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 3.48 \cdot a_2\). Substituting this into the equilibrium temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3.48}} \approx \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately \(0.536\), which corresponds to option **C**.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice science question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me read through the problem again and take notes.

So, the setup is that there are two planets orbiting a star. Both have been detected using the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. 

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. 

The star's forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å is shifting because of the planets. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2's impact is 0.04 Å. 

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, assuming same albedo. So I need to find T1/T2 or T2/T1?

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on several factors. The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Since albedos are same, that part cancels out in the ratio.

Wait, but I think the exact formula is T_eq = T_star * ( R_star / (2a) )^0.5 * ( (1 - A) / (1 + e * cos θ) )^0.25. But since the orbits are circular, e is zero. So it simplifies to T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.25. But since A is same, the (1 - A) part is same for both, so the ratio would only depend on a and R_star and T_star.

But wait, how do I find the semi-major axes (a) for each planet? I think that's the key here. Because the RV method gives the mass function, but perhaps more importantly, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the star's mass, and the distance.

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which gives the star's velocity towards and away from us. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by (v) = ( (G * (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) * sin i ) / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) * (M_planet/M_star)^{2/3} ) ) ) but maybe that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the distance (a). The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * M_planet * sin i ) ) / ( (2 * π * c) * (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, but perhaps another approach is better. Since both planets cause a Doppler shift, their RV semi-amplitudes are given by the shifts. The forbidden line shift is due to the Doppler effect, so the shift (Δλ/λ) is proportional to velocity. The Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ = v/c, where v is the velocity. 

Wait, the shift given is up to 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. The star's line is at 6300 Å. So the fractional shift is Δλ/λ = 0.03 / 6300 ≈ 4.76e-6 for Planet1, and 0.04/6300≈6.35e-6 for Planet2.

These fractional shifts correspond to the velocity of the star towards and away from us, so v = c * (Δλ/λ). Let's compute these velocities.

Speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s, but let me calculate using the exact numbers.

v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c = (0.03 / 6300) * 3e5 km/s.

Wait, c is 3e5 km/s, so 0.03/6300 = 3e-3 /6.3e3 = ~4.76e-7. Multiply by c=3e5 km/s: v1=4.76e-7 * 3e5 = 0.1428 km/s = 142.8 m/s.

Similarly, v2 = (0.04 /6300) * 3e5 = (approx 6.35e-6) *3e5 = 1.905e0 km/s = 190.5 m/s.

So Planet2 causes a larger Doppler shift (higher velocity) than Planet1.

Now, how does the RV semi-amplitude K relate to the planet's mass and the orbital distance a.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (8 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But perhaps a better approach is to use the formula that relates K to the planet's orbital period and the star's velocity.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the following formula for K:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * ( (1 + M_planet/M_star) )^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1/( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) )) ) * ( (2 pi) / P )^(1/3) )

Hmm, this seems complicated. Wait, perhaps a simpler formula exists. 

I remember that K is given by:

K = ( (v) ) = ( ( (G * M_planet) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 + m/M)^(1/3) )) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 + m/M)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi) / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should instead think about the formula for K in terms of the planet's mass and the orbital period.

Wait, another formula I found is:

K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi) / ( P ) )^(1/3) ) / (c )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.

The RV method's semi-amplitude K is also given by:

K = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) )

But perhaps knowing that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so M_* is 1.5 times the Sun's mass.

So, M_* = 1.5 M_sun, and M_p for Planet1 is 7 Earth masses. But Earth mass is about 3e-6 solar masses, so 7 Earth masses is 2.1e-5 solar masses. Similarly for Planet2, 5 Earth masses is about 1.5e-5 solar masses.

So M_p << M_*, so M_* ≈ M_* + M_p.

So, K ≈ ( (2 pi G) / c )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But wait, I can rearrange this to solve for P in terms of K and M_p.

Alternatively, for a circular orbit, the period P is related to the semi-major axis a via Kepler's third law:

P^2 = (4 pi^2 / G (M_* + M_p)) a^3

Again, since M_p is much smaller than M_*, P^2 ≈ (4 pi^2 / (G M_* )) a^3.

So, a^3 = (G M_* P^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

But how does this tie into K?

Wait, let me think about combining these equations.

We have K = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( c M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, let me write this as:

K = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( c M_*^(2/3) ) ) * (1/ P^(1/3) )

But from Kepler's law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3)/(G M_* )

So, P = sqrt( (4 pi^2 a^3)/( G M_* ) )

So, P^(1/3) = ( (4 pi^2 a^3)/( G M_* ) )^(1/6 )

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe instead, express a in terms of P and M_*, then substitute into the K equation.

Alternatively, let's think about the ratio of K for the two planets. Since K1 and K2 are given, and M_p1 and M_p2 are given, and M_* is same for both, perhaps we can find a ratio of a1 and a2.

Wait, because for each planet,

K ∝ (M_p) / ( P^(1/3) )

But from Kepler's law, P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_*, so P ∝ a^(3/2) / sqrt(M_*)

So, P^(1/3) ∝ a^(1/2) / M_*^(1/6)

Putting this into K's equation:

K ∝ (M_p ) / ( a^(1/2) / M_*^(1/6) )

Which simplifies to:

K ∝ ( M_p * M_*^(1/6) ) / a^(1/2 )

Or,

K ∝ ( M_p ) * ( M_* )^(1/6) / sqrt(a )

So, rearranged,

sqrt(a) ∝ ( M_p * M_*^(1/6) ) / K

So, sqrt(a) is proportional to ( M_p / K ) * M_*^(1/6 )

But since M_* is same for both planets, the ratio of a1/a2 would be:

sqrt(a1)/sqrt(a2) = ( (M_p1 / K1) ) / ( (M_p2 / K2) )

So,

sqrt( a1/a2 ) = ( M_p1 K2 ) / ( M_p2 K1 )

Because I think it's (M_p1 * M_*^(1/6) / K1 ) / ( M_p2 * M_*^(1/6) / K2 ) ) = ( M_p1 K2 ) / ( M_p2 K1 )

So,

sqrt( a1/a2 ) = ( M_p1 K2 ) / ( M_p2 K1 )

Squaring both sides,

a1/a2 = ( M_p1^2 K2^2 ) / ( M_p2^2 K1^2 )

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the proportionality. Let me try again.

From earlier, K ∝ ( M_p * M_*^(1/6) ) / sqrt(a )

So,

K = k * ( M_p * M_*^(1/6) ) / sqrt(a )

Where k is a constant.

So, for each planet,

K1 = k * ( M_p1 * M_*^(1/6) ) / sqrt(a1 )

K2 = k * ( M_p2 * M_*^(1/6) ) / sqrt(a2 )

Divide K1 by K2,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1) )

So,

sqrt(a1/a2) = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( K2 / K1 )

So,

a1/a2 = [ ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( K2 / K1 ) ]^2

Let me plug in the numbers.

M_p1 =7 Earth masses.

M_p2=5 Earth masses.

K1=0.03 Å shift, K2=0.04 Å shift.

So,

a1/a2 = [ (7/5) * (0.04/0.03) ]^2

Let's calculate (7/5) =1.4, (0.04/0.03)=1.3333...

So,

1.4 * 1.3333 ≈ 1.8667

Square that: (1.8667)^2 ≈ 3.483.

So, a1/a2 ≈ 3.483.

So, a1 is about 3.48 times a2.

Wait, but wait, I thought the velocity shift gave K, but maybe I should think about the ratio of K in terms of the actual velocities.

Wait, the shifts are 0.03 and 0.04 Å, but those correspond to velocities. So in the K terms, they are the velocity amplitudes.

So K1 is 142.8 m/s, K2 is 190.5 m/s.

So,

K1=142.8, K2=190.5.

So,

K2/K1 = 190.5 / 142.8 ≈ 1.333.

So,

a1/a2 = [ (7/5) * (190.5/142.8) ]^2.

Compute 190.5 / 142.8 ≈1.333.

7/5=1.4.

1.4 *1.333≈1.866.

So, squared gives approx 3.48.

So, a1 is about 3.48 times larger than a2.

Which means Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.

Wait, no, because a1 is the semi-major axis of Planet1. So if a1 is larger than a2, Planet1 is farther out.

Now, the equilibrium temperature formula is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.25

Since albedo is same, (1 - A) is same, so the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 is sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) )

Which simplifies to sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because,

sqrt( ( R/(2a1) ) / ( R/(2a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We found that a1/a2≈3.483, so a2/a1≈1/3.483≈0.287.

So,

sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

Wait, that's approximately 0.536.

So the ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 is about 0.536. So Planet1's equilibrium temperature is about 53.6% of Planet2's.

Wait, but the question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So T1 over T2. So 0.536.

Looking at the options. Option C is ~0.53, which matches.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Compute K2/K1: 190.5 /142.8 = approx 1.333.

M_p1 =7, M_p2=5. So 7/5=1.4.

So 1.4 * 1.333=1.866.

Squared, 1.866^2= about 3.48.

So a1/a2=3.48, so a2/a1=0.287.

T_eq ratio = sqrt( a2/a1 )=sqrt(0.287)= approx 0.536.

So, the ratio is T1/T2=0.536.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is the closest.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - A\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo (\(A\)), the \((1 - A)\) term cancels out in the ratio. Thus, the equilibrium temperature ratio depends only on the semi-major axes (\(a_1\) and \(a_2\)) of the planets:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude formula. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p \cdot \sin i}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

Given that \(M_{\text{star}} \gg M_p\), we approximate \(M_{\text{star}} + M_p \approx M_{\text{star}}\). The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes gives:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1} \cdot \sqrt{a_2}}{M_{p2} \cdot \sqrt{a_1}}
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_{p1} \cdot K_2}{M_{p2} \cdot K_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}, \, M_{p2} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\)
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}, \, K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{7}{5} \cdot \frac{0.04}{0.03}\right)^2
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(1.4 \cdot 1.333\right)^2 = (1.866)^2 \approx 3.48
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 3.48 \cdot a_2\). Substituting this into the equilibrium temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3.48}} \approx \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately \(0.536\), which corresponds to option **C**.
