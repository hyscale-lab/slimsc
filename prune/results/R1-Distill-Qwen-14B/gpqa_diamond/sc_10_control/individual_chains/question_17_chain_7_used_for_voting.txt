Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. They want the concentration of free calcium ions. Oh right, because EDTA forms a complex with Ca²+.

Wait, I remember that the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The Kf is given, which is 5e10. That's a pretty big K, so the complex is stable, meaning most of the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex, and the free ion concentration is really low.

The solution is at ideal pH, so I don't have to worry about the EDTA being in a different protonated form. T is 25°C, which is standard conditions, so activity coefficients are probably assumed to be 1—so concentrations are used directly.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me think about how to approach this. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But since EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, each molecule binds six calcium ions? No, wait, no, each calcium is bound by one EDTA molecule. So, the dissociation of one CaEDTA^2- gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait, the initial solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. That's the only source of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in solution. So, when the complex dissociates, let's set up the equation.

Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. So, the concentration of Ca²+ is x, and the concentration of EDTA^4- is also x, because each complex gives one of each. The concentration of the complex would then be 0.02 - x. But since K is very large (5e10), x will be very small. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the Kf expression is Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-]. Plugging in the values, Kf = (x)(x)/(0.02 - x) ≈ (x²)/0.02.

So 5e10 = x² / 0.02. Solving for x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9. So x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4? Wait wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again. 5e10 times 0.02 is 5e10 * 2e-2 = 1e9. So x squared is 1e9. Taking the square root gives x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4. Wait, that's 3.16e4 M? That can't be right because the solution is only 0.02 M complex. Oh wait, wait wait—no, wait, no. Wait, 5e10 multiplied by 0.02 is 1e9. So x squared equals 1e9. So x is sqrt(1e9) which is about 3.16e4 M? That can't be possible because the concentration can't be higher than the original solution. That must mean I made a mistake.

Wait, hold on. Let me think again. The Kf is [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-]. So the initial concentration of complex is 0.02 M, and when it dissociates, the [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x. As Kf is large, x is much smaller than 0.02, so [CaEDTA^2-] ≈0.02.

So Kf = (x)(x) / 0.02 ≈ x² / 0.02 =5e10.

So x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9.

x = sqrt(1e9) = 31622.7766... Wait, that's 3.16e4 M. But that can't be right because the initial concentration is 0.02 M. So 3e4 M is way higher than that. That's impossible.

Oh wait, wait! Oh no, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me calculate Kf again.

Wait, Kf is 5e10, which is 5 * 10^10. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 5e10 * 2e-2 = 1e9. So x squared is 1e9, x is about 3e4 M. Which is way larger than 0.02 M. That can't be.

Wait, but that suggests that x is 3e4, which is way bigger than 0.02, which would mean our assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 is invalid. So the previous approach won't work.

Hmm, so I need to set up the equation without the approximation. Let me set up the exact equation.

The Kf equation is:

Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-]

Assuming that initially, the solution has only CaEDTA^2- at 0.02 M. So when it dissociates:

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] = x

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x

So Kf = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) = 5e10

So x² = 5e10 * (0.02 - x)

But since 5e10 is a very large number, the denominator (0.02 - x) must be small to make the fraction large. So perhaps x is close to 0.02, but that can't be because if x is close to 0.02, then 0.02 - x is small, making the denominator small, but the numerator is x^2 which is about (0.02)^2 = 4e-4.

Wait, let's try plugging in x =0.02. Then, the numerator is (0.02)^2 =4e-4. Denominator is (0.02 -0.02)=0, which would make the Kf infinite. But Kf is 5e10, so maybe the x is not that close to 0.02.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the complex doesn't dissociate much because Kf is so large, so x is very small.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave x as 3e4, which is impossible because you can't have more Ca²+ than the complex. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in solution, the total concentration of EDTA is more than just the free EDTA? Wait, but the initial solution is just the complex. So the EDTA is all in the complex, unless it dissociates.

Wait, wait, maybe I should consider the total EDTA concentration. Hmm, no, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the total EDTA is 0.02 M, all in the form of the complex. So when it dissociates, the EDTA comes from the complex.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the formation of the complex. The complex has a high Kf, so most of the Ca²+ is in the complex form. So the free Ca²+ concentration is very low.

So the formula is [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2-] / Kf. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me think. The formation equation is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) =5e10.

Wait, but in solution, the only source of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- is the dissociation of the complex. So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then the total EDTA is 0.02 M as well.

Wait, but let's think about the initial situation. The solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-.

So when the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, the concentration of each is x.

So [Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] =x

[CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 -x

But Kf = (x^2)/(0.02 -x) =5e10.

So x² =5e10*(0.02 -x)

Hmm. Let's rearrange this equation.

x² =5e10 * (0.02 -x)

x² =1e9 -5e10 x

x² +5e10 x -1e9 =0

This is a quadratic equation: x² +5e10 x -1e9 =0.

Wait, solving for x in quadratic equation ax² +bx +c =0, x= [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)]/(2a)

Here a=1, b=5e10, c= -1e9.

Discriminant D = (5e10)^2 +4*1*1e9 =25e20 +4e9≈25e20, since 4e9 is negligible compared to 25e20.

So sqrt(D)= sqrt(25e20)=5e10.

So x = [ -5e10 ±5e10 ] /2

Possible solutions:

x = [(-5e10 +5e10)]/2=0/2=0 → Not valid, since x must be positive.

x= [(-5e10 -5e10)]/2 = (-1e11)/2 → Negative, which is impossible.

Wait, so this can't be right. Hmm, that suggests that the quadratic equation as set up might have no solution, but that can't be the case because the complex must dissociate a little.

Wait, perhaps my approach is incorrect. Maybe I should consider another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is that the initial concentration is of the complex, so [CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 M. So the total concentration of EDTA is 0.02 M.

But when the complex dissociates, the EDTA can come from the complex, and the Ca²+ comes from the same source.

So the total concentration of EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 M.

Wait, but I'm confusing EDTA with the complex. Wait, EDTA is a ligand; in the solution, it can be either free EDTA^4- or bound as CaEDTA^2-.

So the total [EDTA] = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

Similarly, the total [Ca²+] comes from the dissociation of the complex. So [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2-] would only be the case if the solution had added Ca, but here the only source is the complex.

Wait, no. No, the Ca²+ in solution comes from the dissociation of the complex. So [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2-] would be incorrect. Wait, no—when the complex dissociates, each molecule gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait, the complex is CaEDTA^2-. So when it dissociates, for every mole that dissociates, you get one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

So, [Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] =x

[CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 -x

And the total EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] =x + (0.02 -x) =0.02 M.

Which makes sense.

So the Kf equation is correct as I set it up earlier: Kf = x²/(0.02 -x) =5e10.

But when I tried solving this, the quadratic equation didn't give a valid solution. So perhaps I should reconsider the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the Kf expression. Because Kf is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, so the complex is mostly intact. So x is very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So using the approximation, Kf ≈x² /0.02 =5e10 → x²=5e10 *0.02=1e9 → x= sqrt(1e9)=3.16e4 M.

But that's impossible because the initial concentration is 0.02 M. So this suggests that the approximation isn't valid. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I should not approximate and instead consider the exact solution.

Wait, let's try solving x²/(0.02 -x) =5e10.

Multiply both sides by (0.02 -x):

x² =5e10*(0.02 -x)

x²=1e9 -5e10 x

Bring all terms to one side:

x² +5e10 x -1e9 =0.

Quadratic equation: a=1, b=5e10, c=-1e9.

Discriminant D = (5e10)^2 -4*1*(-1e9) =25e20 +4e9 =25e20 (since 4e9 is negligible).

So sqrt(D)=5e10.

Solutions:

x = [-5e10 ±5e10 ]/(2*1)

So two solutions:

x = (-5e10 +5e10)/(2) =0 → Not possible, as x must be positive.

x= (-5e10 -5e10)/2= (-1e11)/2 → Negative, which is impossible.

Hmm, that's a problem. So the quadratic equation suggests no positive solution. That can't be right. So perhaps the approximation isn't valid, but in reality, x can't be larger than 0.02.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign when moving terms.

Wait, equation after substitution is x² +5e10 x -1e9 =0. So a=1, b=5e10, c=-1e9.

So discriminant D = (5e10)^2 -4*1*(-1e9) = 25e20 +4e9 = 25e20 + 0.004e20 = 25.004e20.

Which is approximately 25e20.

So sqrt(D)= sqrt(25.004e20)=5e10 * sqrt(1.00016) ≈5e10 *1.00008.

So approximately 5.0004e10.

So,

x = [ -5e10 ±5.0004e10 ] /2.

Taking positive solution:

x = [ (-5e10 +5.0004e10 ) ] /2 = (0.0004e10)/2 = (4e6)/2=2e6.

Wait, 0.0004e10 is 4e6, so x= 2e6 M. That's still way larger than 0.02 M.

Wait, that can't be possible. 2e6 M is way beyond the concentration of the solution. So clearly, this approach isn't working. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is that when the complex dissociates, the concentration of EDTA is not just x, but the solution is in equilibrium with the complex.

Wait, another thought: the concentration of free Ca²+ is given by the expression [Ca²+] = (Kf * [CaEDTA^2-]) / (1 + Kf * [EDTA^4-])

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think about the Kf expression.

Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-].

We can rearrange this to get [Ca²+] = (Kf [CaEDTA^2-])/[EDTA^4-].

But [EDTA^4-] is equal to the concentration of free EDTA which, considering that the total EDTA comes from the complex, is [EDTA^4-] = [CaEDTA^2-] (if all EDTA is in complex, which it isn't, but perhaps in some cases). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's consider that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the total EDTA is 0.02 M, which includes the free EDTA and the EDTA in the complex.

So [EDTA_total] = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 M.

But the [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] =x, because each complex dissociation gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

So, [EDTA^4-] =x, [CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 -x.

So,

x + (0.02 -x) =0.02 → which holds.

So,

Kf = (x)(x)/(0.02 -x) =5e10.

So,

x² =5e10 (0.02 -x)

x² =1e9 -5e10 x.

Bringing all terms to one side:

x² +5e10 x -1e9 =0.

But earlier attempts to solve this led to x being 2e6, which is way too high.

Wait, but 2e6 is 2,000,000 M, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when Kf is so large, the amount of dissociation is negligible, so x is very small compared to 0.02, and the approximation holds: 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

Then, x² ≈5e10 *0.02 → x²=1e9 →x= sqrt(1e9)=3.16e4 M. But that's 31,600 M, which is way beyond 0.02 M.

That's impossible, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, another possibility: The problem might be asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. But the complex is stoichiometric, meaning that all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex. Wait, no, because the complex is in solution. So the solution has free Ca²+ and the complex.

Wait, perhaps the solution is that the free Ca²+ is negligible, so the concentration is the same as the complex concentration times the fraction that dissociates.

But wait, the Kf is 5e10, which is extremely large, meaning the complex is almost completely formed. So [Ca²+] should be very small.

Thus, the free Ca²+ is [Ca²+] = sqrt( Kf * [CaEDTA^2-] * Kf's units? Wait, no.

Wait, the expression for [Ca²+] is [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2-] * (Kf) / (1 + Kf * [EDTA^4-]).

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Another approach: the formation of the complex can be represented as:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-; Kf =5e10.

At equilibrium, the concentrations are:

[Ca²+] = x,

[EDTA^4-] =x,

[CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 -x.

But wait, maybe I should consider the total EDTA concentration.

Total EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 M.

So,

x + (0.02 -x) =0.02 → which holds.

So, Kf = (x^2)/(0.02 -x) =5e10.

But when Kf is very large, 5e10, the denominator must be very small to make the ratio large. So 0.02 -x is approximately zero, making x ≈0.02.

Wait, but if x is about 0.02, then [Ca²+] is 0.02 M, which would mean the complex is almost completely dissociated. But that can't be right because Kf is supposed to be large, keeping the complex intact.

Wait, this is confusing. Perhaps I should think in terms of the reciprocal.

Wait, maybe I should consider the reverse reaction. The dissociation of the complex:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-; K =1/Kf = 2e-11.

So, the dissociation equilibrium has K=2e-11.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So,

At equilibrium,

[CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 -x,

[Ca²+] =x,

[EDTA^4-]=x.

So,

K =x²/(0.02 -x) =2e-11.

So,

x² =2e-11*(0.02 -x)

x² =4e-13 -2e-11 x.

Bringing all terms to one side:

x² +2e-11 x -4e-13 =0.

Now, since K is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So,

x² ≈ (2e-11)(0.02) → x²=4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5 → wait, 4e-13 is 4*10^-13, sqrt is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, which is 1e-6 M. So x would be approximately 2e-6.5 ≈6.3e-7 M.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 10^-13 is (10^-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13)= 2 * 1e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches.

So the concentration of free Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex at 25 °C, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the dissociation constant is \( K = \frac{1}{K_f} = 2 \times 10^{-11} \). The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the equilibrium concentrations are:

- \([CaEDTA^{2-}] = 0.02 - x\),
- \([Ca^{2+}] = x\),
- \([EDTA^{4-}] = x\),

where \(x\) is the concentration of free calcium ions. Substituting these into the dissociation equilibrium expression:

\[
K = \frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[CaEDTA^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}
\]

Since \(K\) is very small (\(2 \times 10^{-11}\)), \(x\) is much smaller than 0.02, so we approximate \(0.02 - x \approx 0.02\). This simplifies the equation to:

\[
K \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Substituting \(K = 2 \times 10^{-11}\):

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Solving for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. They want the concentration of free calcium ions. Oh right, because EDTA forms a complex with Ca²+.

Wait, I remember that the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The Kf is given, which is 5e10. That's a pretty big K, so the complex is stable, meaning most of the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex, and the free ion concentration is really low.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me think about how to approach this. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But since EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, each molecule binds six calcium ions? No, wait, no, each calcium is bound by one EDTA molecule. So, the dissociation of one CaEDTA^2- gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait, the initial solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. That's the only source of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in solution. So, when the complex dissociates, let's set up the equation.

Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. So, the concentration of Ca²+ is x, and the concentration of EDTA^4- is also x, because each complex gives one of each. The concentration of the complex would then be 0.02 - x. But since K is very large (5e10), x will be very small. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the Kf expression is Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-]. Plugging in the values, Kf = (x)(x)/(0.02 - x) ≈ (x²)/0.02.

So 5e10 = x² / 0.02. Solving for x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9. So x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4? Wait wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again. 5e10 times 0.02 is 5e10 * 2e-2 = 1e9. So x squared is 1e9. Taking the square root gives x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4. Wait, that's 3.16e4 M? That can't be right because the solution is only 0.02 M complex. Oh wait, wait wait—no, wait, no. Wait, 5e10 multiplied by 0.02 is 1e9. So x squared equals 1e9. So x is sqrt(1e9) which is about 3.16e4 M? That can't be possible because the concentration can't be higher than the original solution. That must mean I made a mistake.

Wait, hold on. Let me think again. The Kf is [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-]. So the initial concentration of complex is 0.02 M, and when it dissociates, the [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x. As Kf is large, x is much smaller than 0.02, so [CaEDTA^2-] ≈0.02.

So Kf = (x)(x) / 0.02 ≈ x² / 0.02 =5e10.

So x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9.

x = sqrt(1e9) = 31622.7766... Wait, that's 3.16e4 M. But that can't be right because the initial concentration is 0.02 M. So 3e4 M is way higher than that. That's impossible.

Oh wait, wait! Oh no, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me calculate Kf again.

Wait, Kf is 5e10, which is 5 * 10^10. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 5e10 * 2e-2 = 1e9. So x squared is 1e9, x is about 3e4 M. Which is way larger than 0.02 M. That can't be.

Wait, but that suggests that x is 3e4, which is way bigger than 0.02, which would mean our assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 is invalid. So the previous approach won't work.

Hmm, so I need to set up the equation without the approximation. Let me set up the exact equation.

The Kf equation is:

Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-]

Assuming that initially, the solution has only CaEDTA^2- at 0.02 M. So when it dissociates:

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] = x

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x

So Kf = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) = 5e10

So x² = 5e10 * (0.02 - x)

But since 5e10 is a very large number, the denominator (0.02 - x) must be small to make the fraction large. So perhaps x is close to 0.02, but that can't be because if x is close to 0.02, then 0.02 - x is small, making the denominator small, but the numerator is x^2 which is about (0.02)^2 = 4e-4.

Wait, let's try plugging in x =0.02. Then, the numerator is (0.02)^2 =4e-4. Denominator is (0.02 -0.02)=0, which would make the Kf infinite. But Kf is 5e10, so maybe the x is not that close to 0.02.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the complex doesn't dissociate much because Kf is so large, so x is very small.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave x as 3e4, which is impossible because you can't have more Ca²+ than the complex. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

So the formula is [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2-] / Kf. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me think. The formation equation is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) =5e10.

Wait, but in solution, the only source of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- is the dissociation of the complex. So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then the total EDTA is 0.02 M as well.

Wait, but let's think about the initial situation. The solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-.

So when the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, the concentration of each is x.

So [Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] =x

[CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 -x

But Kf = (x^2)/(0.02 -x) =5e10.

So x² =5e10*(0.02 -x)

Hmm. Let's rearrange this equation.

x² =5e10 * (0.02 -x)

x² =1e9 -5e10 x

x² +5e10 x -1e9 =0

This is a quadratic equation: x² +5e10 x -1e9 =0.

Wait, solving for x in quadratic equation ax² +bx +c =0, x= [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)]/(2a)

Here a=1, b=5e10, c= -1e9.

Discriminant D = (5e10)^2 +4*1*1e9 =25e20 +4e9≈25e20, since 4e9 is negligible compared to 25e20.

So sqrt(D)= sqrt(25e20)=5e10.

So x = [ -5e10 ±5e10 ] /2

Possible solutions:

x = [(-5e10 +5e10)]/2=0/2=0 → Not valid, since x must be positive.

x= [(-5e10 -5e10)]/2 = (-1e11)/2 → Negative, which is impossible.

Wait, so this can't be right. Hmm, that suggests that the quadratic equation as set up might have no solution, but that can't be the case because the complex must dissociate a little.

Wait, perhaps my approach is incorrect. Maybe I should consider another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is that the initial concentration is of the complex, so [CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 M. So the total concentration of EDTA is 0.02 M.

But when the complex dissociates, the EDTA can come from the complex, and the Ca²+ comes from the same source.

So the total concentration of EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 M.

Wait, but I'm confusing EDTA with the complex. Wait, EDTA is a ligand; in the solution, it can be either free EDTA^4- or bound as CaEDTA^2-.

So the total [EDTA] = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

Similarly, the total [Ca²+] comes from the dissociation of the complex. So [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2-] would only be the case if the solution had added Ca, but here the only source is the complex.

Wait, no. No, the Ca²+ in solution comes from the dissociation of the complex. So [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2-] would be incorrect. Wait, no—when the complex dissociates, each molecule gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait, the complex is CaEDTA^2-. So when it dissociates, for every mole that dissociates, you get one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

So, [Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] =x

[CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 -x

And the total EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] =x + (0.02 -x) =0.02 M.

Which makes sense.

So the Kf equation is correct as I set it up earlier: Kf = x²/(0.02 -x) =5e10.

But when I tried solving this, the quadratic equation didn't give a valid solution. So perhaps I should reconsider the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the Kf expression. Because Kf is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, so the complex is mostly intact. So x is very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So using the approximation, Kf ≈x² /0.02 =5e10 → x²=5e10 *0.02=1e9 → x= sqrt(1e9)=3.16e4 M.

But that's impossible because the initial concentration is 0.02 M. So this suggests that the approximation isn't valid. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I should not approximate and instead consider the exact solution.

Wait, let's try solving x²/(0.02 -x) =5e10.

Multiply both sides by (0.02 -x):

x² =5e10*(0.02 -x)

x²=1e9 -5e10 x

Bring all terms to one side:

x² +5e10 x -1e9 =0.

Quadratic equation: a=1, b=5e10, c=-1e9.

Discriminant D = (5e10)^2 -4*1*(-1e9) =25e20 +4e9 =25e20 (since 4e9 is negligible).

So sqrt(D)=5e10.

Solutions:

x = [-5e10 ±5e10 ]/(2*1)

So two solutions:

x = (-5e10 +5e10)/(2) =0 → Not possible, as x must be positive.

x= (-5e10 -5e10)/2= (-1e11)/2 → Negative, which is impossible.

Hmm, that's a problem. So the quadratic equation suggests no positive solution. That can't be right. So perhaps the approximation isn't valid, but in reality, x can't be larger than 0.02.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign when moving terms.

Wait, equation after substitution is x² +5e10 x -1e9 =0. So a=1, b=5e10, c=-1e9.

So discriminant D = (5e10)^2 -4*1*(-1e9) = 25e20 +4e9 = 25e20 + 0.004e20 = 25.004e20.

Which is approximately 25e20.

So sqrt(D)= sqrt(25.004e20)=5e10 * sqrt(1.00016) ≈5e10 *1.00008.

So approximately 5.0004e10.

So,

x = [ -5e10 ±5.0004e10 ] /2.

Taking positive solution:

x = [ (-5e10 +5.0004e10 ) ] /2 = (0.0004e10)/2 = (4e6)/2=2e6.

Wait, 0.0004e10 is 4e6, so x= 2e6 M. That's still way larger than 0.02 M.

Wait, that can't be possible. 2e6 M is way beyond the concentration of the solution. So clearly, this approach isn't working. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is that when the complex dissociates, the concentration of EDTA is not just x, but the solution is in equilibrium with the complex.

Wait, another thought: the concentration of free Ca²+ is given by the expression [Ca²+] = (Kf * [CaEDTA^2-]) / (1 + Kf * [EDTA^4-])

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think about the Kf expression.

Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-].

We can rearrange this to get [Ca²+] = (Kf [CaEDTA^2-])/[EDTA^4-].

But [EDTA^4-] is equal to the concentration of free EDTA which, considering that the total EDTA comes from the complex, is [EDTA^4-] = [CaEDTA^2-] (if all EDTA is in complex, which it isn't, but perhaps in some cases). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's consider that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the total EDTA is 0.02 M, which includes the free EDTA and the EDTA in the complex.

So [EDTA_total] = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 M.

But the [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] =x, because each complex dissociation gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

So, [EDTA^4-] =x, [CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 -x.

So,

x + (0.02 -x) =0.02 → which holds.

So,

Kf = (x)(x)/(0.02 -x) =5e10.

So,

x² =5e10 (0.02 -x)

x² =1e9 -5e10 x.

Bringing all terms to one side:

x² +5e10 x -1e9 =0.

But earlier attempts to solve this led to x being 2e6, which is way too high.

Wait, but 2e6 is 2,000,000 M, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when Kf is so large, the amount of dissociation is negligible, so x is very small compared to 0.02, and the approximation holds: 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

Then, x² ≈5e10 *0.02 → x²=1e9 →x= sqrt(1e9)=3.16e4 M. But that's 31,600 M, which is way beyond 0.02 M.

That's impossible, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, another possibility: The problem might be asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. But the complex is stoichiometric, meaning that all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex. Wait, no, because the complex is in solution. So the solution has free Ca²+ and the complex.

Wait, perhaps the solution is that the free Ca²+ is negligible, so the concentration is the same as the complex concentration times the fraction that dissociates.

But wait, the Kf is 5e10, which is extremely large, meaning the complex is almost completely formed. So [Ca²+] should be very small.

Thus, the free Ca²+ is [Ca²+] = sqrt( Kf * [CaEDTA^2-] * Kf's units? Wait, no.

Wait, the expression for [Ca²+] is [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2-] * (Kf) / (1 + Kf * [EDTA^4-]).

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Another approach: the formation of the complex can be represented as:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-; Kf =5e10.

At equilibrium, the concentrations are:

[Ca²+] = x,

[EDTA^4-] =x,

[CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 -x.

But wait, maybe I should consider the total EDTA concentration.

Total EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 M.

So,

x + (0.02 -x) =0.02 → which holds.

So, Kf = (x^2)/(0.02 -x) =5e10.

But when Kf is very large, 5e10, the denominator must be very small to make the ratio large. So 0.02 -x is approximately zero, making x ≈0.02.

Wait, but if x is about 0.02, then [Ca²+] is 0.02 M, which would mean the complex is almost completely dissociated. But that can't be right because Kf is supposed to be large, keeping the complex intact.

Wait, this is confusing. Perhaps I should think in terms of the reciprocal.

Wait, maybe I should consider the reverse reaction. The dissociation of the complex:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-; K =1/Kf = 2e-11.

So, the dissociation equilibrium has K=2e-11.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So,

At equilibrium,

[CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 -x,

[Ca²+] =x,

[EDTA^4-]=x.

So,

K =x²/(0.02 -x) =2e-11.

So,

x² =2e-11*(0.02 -x)

x² =4e-13 -2e-11 x.

Bringing all terms to one side:

x² +2e-11 x -4e-13 =0.

Now, since K is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So,

x² ≈ (2e-11)(0.02) → x²=4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5 → wait, 4e-13 is 4*10^-13, sqrt is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, which is 1e-6 M. So x would be approximately 2e-6.5 ≈6.3e-7 M.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 10^-13 is (10^-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13)= 2 * 1e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches.

So the concentration of free Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex at 25 °C, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the dissociation constant is \( K = \frac{1}{K_f} = 2 \times 10^{-11} \). The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the equilibrium concentrations are:

- \([CaEDTA^{2-}] = 0.02 - x\),
- \([Ca^{2+}] = x\),
- \([EDTA^{4-}] = x\),

where \(x\) is the concentration of free calcium ions. Substituting these into the dissociation equilibrium expression:

\[
K = \frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[CaEDTA^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}
\]

Since \(K\) is very small (\(2 \times 10^{-11}\)), \(x\) is much smaller than 0.02, so we approximate \(0.02 - x \approx 0.02\). This simplifies the equation to:

\[
K \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Substituting \(K = 2 \times 10^{-11}\):

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Solving for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
