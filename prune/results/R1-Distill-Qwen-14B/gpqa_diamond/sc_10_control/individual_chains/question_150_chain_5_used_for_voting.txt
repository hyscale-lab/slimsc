Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, let's break that down. Carbon is 8, hydrogen is 9, nitrogen is 1, oxygen is 1. Wait, molecular formula might give me some clues about the structure. The NMR data is also provided, so that should help in figuring out the structure before any reactions.

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

So, first, let's try to interpret the NMR. The peak at 9.72 is a triplet, integrating to 1H. That could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons, maybe adjacent to a CH2 group. Or wait, maybe it's an aromatic proton in a specific coupling situation. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but I don't think so because ketones don't have protons. Another possibility is an acidic proton, like an -OH, but that's usually lower, like around 1-5 ppm. Hmm, but wait, maybe it's an aldehyde.

Then there's a peak at 6.98 as a doublet with 2H. Maybe aromatic protons. The 6.51 is another doublet with 2H. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring, since the doublets would suggest coupling between adjacent protons. Wait, if it's para substitution, each pair would be a doublet? Or maybe they're part of a conjugated system, like an alkene. Hmm, but looking at the integration, the aromatic region has multiple peaks. The 6.27 is a broad singlet with 2H. Broad suggests possibly an -OH group, but how many H? Wait, 2H as a broad signal. Maybe a diol, but that's less common. Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling with something else, like adjacent to a double bond or part of a conjugated system.

The 3.66 ppm as a doublet with 2H. That's probably an OCH2 group. Maybe an ether or an ester, but more likely an alcohol's OCH2, or maybe a ketone's adjacent group. Or perhaps an acetal? Not sure. But OCH2 would be around 3.5-4.0 ppm.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure involves an aromatic ring, maybe two of them, connected via some chain. Since the formula is C8H9NO, let's see. Wait, molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, degrees of unsaturation: each degree is a ring or double bond. So, for C8H9NO, the formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, N=1. So:

2*8 +2 =18. 18 -9 (H) -1 (N) = 8. Divide by 2: 4 degrees. So four rings or double bonds.

Looking at the NMR, an aromatic ring (so 4H, so that's one degree), the aldehyde (double bond, another degree), and maybe another ring or double bond, perhaps in the side chain.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe it's a diphenyl compound. Two benzene rings connected via a side chain. Because the NMR shows multiple aromatic signals.

Wait, in the NMR, the two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51, each 2H. So that's four aromatic protons. So maybe two benzene rings, each having two protons. That would imply each ring is para-substituted. So for each ring, two substituents, perhaps.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Looking at the NMR, the triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) could be part of an aldehyde group. So maybe the compound is something like a benzaldehyde derivative. But wait, the molecular formula includes N and O. So maybe it's a nitro group or an amine.

Wait, but the reagents used are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then KOH and heat. That sequence is familiar. It's the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt, I think. So perhaps the starting compound has an aromatic amine group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. The presence of N and O suggests maybe an amino group (NH2) or an amide, nitro, or something else. But considering the reagents, perhaps it's an aromatic amine.

Wait, the reaction steps: first, diazotization with NaNO2 and HCl (which is acidic conditions). Then H2O, maybe hydrolysis. Then aq KOH and heat, which is basic conditions, maybe for elimination.

Wait, but diazotization usually converts an aromatic amine (like aniline) into a diazonium salt. Then, in aqueous conditions (like with H2O), it can undergo hydrolysis. If the diazonium salt is subjected to H2O, perhaps it's a Sandmeyer reaction or something else. Alternatively, in the presence of KOH and heat, maybe it's a decomposition reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the first step is diazotization, then the diazonium group is hydrolyzed to a phenol. Because when you treat a diazonium salt with water, especially under acidic or basic conditions, you can get a phenol. For example, diazonium chloride can hydrolyze to give a phenol and release N2 and Cl-.

But let me think about the structure again. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. If the starting compound is an aromatic amine, then perhaps it's a substituted aniline.

Let me think about the NMR data again. The triplet at 9.72 could be an aldehyde proton. So maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde with an amine substituent.

Wait, but then why the O in the formula? Because the formula includes O. So perhaps it's a nitro group. Wait, but the product after reaction... Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the NMR shows an OCH2 group at 3.66 ppm. So perhaps that's an ether or an alcohol group. But if the starting compound has an -OCH2- group, perhaps it's part of a substituent on the benzene ring.

Putting it all together, perhaps the starting compound is a diphenyl ether or something similar with an aldehyde group and an amine substituent.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let's try another approach. Let's look at the reaction steps.

Step 1: NaNO2 and HCl. That's a typical diazotization reaction, which usually occurs with an aromatic amine. So the starting compound likely has an -NH2 group attached to an aromatic ring.

Step 2: H2O. So after forming the diazonium salt, perhaps it's hydrolyzed. For example, if you have a benzene ring with a NH2 group, upon diazotization and hydrolysis, the NH2 becomes an OH group (phenol).

Step 3: aq KOH, heat. This could be a saponification reaction (if there was an ester), but more likely, in the case of a diazonium salt, perhaps a decomposition reaction. Alternatively, if it's an elimination reaction, maybe forming a double bond.

Wait, but the initial compound's NMR suggests an aldehyde group. So perhaps after the reactions, the aldehyde is modified. Alternatively, the product could be an aldehyde.

Wait, but the starting compound's NMR has an aldehyde proton. So after the reaction steps, perhaps that group is retained or altered.

Oh, wait, another possibility: the starting compound is an aniline derivative with a substituent that includes an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. Then, the diazonium salt is formed, and upon hydrolysis, the amino group becomes a hydroxyl.

Wait, but in the reaction sequence, the first step is diazotization, which requires an aromatic amine. Then hydrolysis would replace the amine with a hydroxyl group.

So, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with an NH2 group and an aldehyde substituent, and another substituent.

Wait, but let me try to think about the NMR again. The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) is likely an OCH2 group. So maybe the structure has a CH2O group attached to something. Like perhaps a -OCH2CH2- group or maybe a -CH2O- group.

Wait, another point: the triplet at 9.72 ppm. If it's an aldehyde proton, it's usually a singlet because it's deshielded and not split. But in this case, it's a triplet. Hmm, maybe it's part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, perhaps it's attached to a CH2 group. Wait, if the aldehyde is part of a chain like R-CHO, and adjacent to a CH2 group that has two protons, then the aldehyde proton would couple with those two, giving a triplet.

So, perhaps the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CHO, but that might not fit the degrees of unsaturation. Alternatively, maybe it's a diphenyl compound with a side chain containing an aldehyde and a CH2 group.

Wait, let's try to imagine the structure. Suppose we have two benzene rings connected via a chain. For example, two benzene rings connected by a four-carbon chain. Let me think, each benzene ring has substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the carbons. Each benzene ring has six carbons, but if it's two rings, that would be 12, but the compound only has 8, so I must have two benzene rings each with substituents. Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps it's a single benzene ring with substituents. But the NMR shows multiple aromatic peaks, which might suggest two separate benzene rings.

Wait, another approach: calculate the molecular weight. C8H9NO. So 12*8=96, 1*9=9, 14*1=14, 16*1=16. Total 96+9=105 +14=119 +16=135 g/mol. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Wait, the NMR has 6.98 and 6.51, each doublet, 2H each. That suggests perhaps two para-substituted benzene rings. So each ring has two substituents? Or perhaps one substituent each, but in a way that the coupling is observed. Alternatively, each ring has substituents leading to the two doublets.

Wait, perhaps it's a biphenyl structure. So two benzene rings connected by a single bond, and each ring has substituents. For example, each ring has a substituent that causes the doublets in the NMR.

But let's get back to the reaction steps. The first step is diazotization, which suggests there's an aromatic amine. Then, hydrolysis of the diazonium salt would give a phenol. Then, treating with KOH and heatâ€”maybe elimination occurs, forming an aldehyde or ketone.

Wait, but the product options all have "enals" or "enals" so aldehydes with double bonds.

Looking at the options:

A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal
B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal
C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal
D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal

So, all are aldehydes with some diphenyl substituents.

Wait, so maybe the starting compound had an aromatic amine group on a benzene ring, and after the reactions, the amine is replaced by a hydroxyl group (phenol), and perhaps an elimination occurs to form an aldehyde.

Wait, but how does that fit with the reaction steps. Let's think:

Step 1: NaNO2 and HCl â†’ forms diazonium chloride.

Step 2: H2O â†’ hydrolysis of diazonium to phenol.

Step 3: KOH and heat â†’ perhaps elimination of water, forming a double bond, and possibly oxidizing a group to an aldehyde.

Hmm, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an aniline derivative with an adjacent group. For example, a benzyl alcohol or something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diphenylamine, but that might not fit the formula. Let's think again about the molecular formula: C8H9NO.

So, 8 carbons. If two benzene rings (each with 6 carbons) would be 12, but the formula is 8, so perhaps one benzene ring and some other substituents.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a benzaldehyde derivative with an amine substituent.

Wait, another approach: the aldehyde proton in the NMR is at 9.72 ppm and is a triplet. A triplet suggests two neighboring protons. So perhaps it's RCH2CHO, where the CH2 is adjacent to the aldehyde.

So, the structure could be something like Ph-CH2-CHO, but that would have molecular formula C8H7O (if Ph is C6H5), but that doesn't account for the N. So, perhaps the starting material has an amine group.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like Ar-NH-CH2-CHO. But that would have a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ar-CH2-CHO with another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting structure is Ph-CH(OH)-CH2-CHO, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting me nowhere. Let me try to look at the reaction sequence again.

Reaction steps:

1. NaNO2 + HCl â†’ Diazotization. So, the starting compound must have an aromatic amine (NH2 attached to benzene ring).

2. H2O â†’ Hydrolysis of diazonium salt. This typically converts the aromatic amine to a hydroxyl group. For example, if the starting material is an aniline (Ar-NH2), after diazotization and hydrolysis, it becomes Ar-OH.

3. aq KOH, heat â†’ Perhaps a dehydration reaction, forming a double bond. Or, if there's an adjacent group, it could lead to elimination, forming an aldehyde.

Wait, but the product options are aldehydes. So, maybe during the reaction, a ketone is formed which then undergoes some oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has an alcohol group adjacent to a diazonium group, which after hydrolysis becomes a hydroxyl, and then under basic conditions, it eliminates to form an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diphenylmethanol derivative with an aromatic amine. Let me think: a benzene ring with an NH2 group and a CH2CH2O group or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting structure is something like diphenylcarbinol, but with an amine substituent.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the possible product structures and see which one makes sense after the reactions.

Looking at option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. That would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with substituents at 2 and 4 positions? Wait, but but-3-enal is CH2=CH-CHO, with substituents on the second and fourth carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with another substituent. Or it's a four-carbon chain with two phenyl groups at positions 2 and 4.

Alternatively, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(OH)-Ph. Wait, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, the NMR of the starting material has an OCH2 group. So perhaps the starting material has a -CH2-O- group, which after reaction becomes something else.

Another angle: the starting material's NMR shows an OCH2 group as a doublet. So perhaps it's a -OCH2- group connected to something else. Maybe a diethyl group? Or perhaps a benzyl-O-CH2- group.

Wait, maybe the starting compound is a methyl ether attached to a benzene ring, which after reaction becomes a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the possible product structures and what reactions would lead to them.

The reaction steps are diazotization, hydrolysis, and then base and heat. So, the first step converts an aromatic amine to a diazonium salt. The second step hydrolyzes it to a phenol. The third step might be elimination.

So, if the starting material is, say, 4-aminophenyl-(something), then after hydrolysis, it becomes 4-hydroxyphenyl.

Now, considering the product options, all have aldehyde groups and substituents, perhaps with hydroxyl groups.

Option B: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. So, the aldehyde is at position 2, and there are two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups at positions 2 and 4 of a four-carbon chain, but with a double bond between C2 and C3.

Alternatively, option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So, the aldehyde is at C1, double bond between C3 and C4, and a phenyl group at C4.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has two amine groups, but that's less likely. Or perhaps the starting material has an amine and an alcohol group.

Wait, but the starting material's NMR shows an OCH2 group. So perhaps it's a diether or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting structure is diphenylmethanol with an amine substituent. For example, Ph-CH(OH)-NH2-Ph? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative with an amine substituent and a hydroxyl group elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-amino-3-methoxybenzaldehyde. But that may not fit the molecular formula.

Another thought: the NMR shows a triplet at 9.72, which is probably the aldehyde proton. So, the starting material has an aldehyde group. Then, the reaction steps may affect the substituents.

Wait, but the first reaction step is diazotization, which requires an amine. So the starting material must have an amine group. That would be in addition to the aldehyde. So perhaps the structure is something like Ph-CHO-CH2-NH2. But that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2 with an aldehyde group elsewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the product structures again. Let's take option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

The structure would be CH2=CH-CH(OH)-Ph. Wait, but with but-3-enal, it's CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO? No, wait, but-3-enal is CH2CH2CH2CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4. No, wait, but but-3-enal would have four carbons, with the double bond between C3 and C4, and the aldehyde on C1. So it's CH2=CHCH2CHO. Wait, no. Wait, but-3-enal is CH2CH2CH2CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

But-3-enal structure: It's CH2=CH-CH2-CHO. Oh, wait, no. Wait, but-3-enal would have the double bond starting at C3, so it's CH2CH2CH2CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4? That can't be because but has four carbons. So but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO. So the aldehyde is on C1, and the double bond is between C2 and C3.

Wait, but let's think about option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So, but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO, and substituting the fourth carbon (but it's only four carbons, so the fourth would be the aldehyde end). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a four-carbon chain with a double bond between C3 and C4, an aldehyde at C1, and a phenyl group at C4. So, structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, maybe the product has a conjugated system. Let me think about the reaction.

The starting material has an amine group on a benzene ring. After diazotization and hydrolysis, that becomes a hydroxyl group. Then, under basic conditions with heat, perhaps an elimination occurs, forming a double bond and oxidizing a group to an aldehyde.

So, perhaps the starting material is something like Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2, with another substituent. Wait, but the NMR data suggests an aldehyde group. So perhaps the starting material is Ph-CH2-CHO with an NH2 group.

Wait, but that would be Ph-CH2-CHO and NH2? But where would the NH2 be attached? Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is Ph-CHO-CH2-NH2.

Hmm, not sure. Let me think about the product again.

Looking at option B: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. So, the aldehyde is at position 2 (but-2-enal), which would be CH2=CH-CHO. Wait, but but-2-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO. No, wait but-2-enal is CH2=CH-CHO, but that's only three carbons. Oh wait, no. But-2-enal would have four carbons. So, the structure is CH3-CH=CH-CHO? No, but that's but-2-enal. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a four-carbon chain with an aldehyde group at one end, a double bond, and two phenyl groups attached at positions 2 and 4.

Wait, perhaps the product is CH2=CH-CH(OH)-Ph, but that doesn't fit.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, so maybe I should try to think about the reaction mechanism.

After diazotization and hydrolysis, the NH2 group becomes an OH group. Then, when treated with KOH and heat, perhaps an elimination occurs. For example, if the starting material has a structure like Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CHO, then under basic conditions, the OH could lose a water molecule, forming a double bond adjacent to the aldehyde.

Wait, let me imagine the starting material: after the first two steps, it's Ph-OH and some other groups. Then, under basic conditions, maybe an elimination occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzylamine derivative with an aldehyde group. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, let me consider the starting material's NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 (1H) suggests an aldehyde. The OCH2 group at 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) suggests a CH2 connected to an oxygen. So maybe it's a CH2-O-C group.

Putting it together, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative with a CH2-O group. But with an NH2 substituent as well.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CHO-CH2-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's Ph-CH(OH)-CH2-CHO, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the OCH2 is part of a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like Ph-O-CH2-CHO.

Wait, but then the triplet at 9.72 would be the aldehyde. The OCH2 would have two protons, as a doublet, which fits the 3.66 ppm peak.

So, the structure would be Ph-O-CH2-CHO. But then where is the NH2 group? Because the starting material must have an aromatic amine to undergo diazotization.

Ah, perhaps the structure is Ph-NH-CH2-O-CHO. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CHO, but again, not sure about the amine.

Wait, maybe the starting material is Ph-CH2-CH2-O-CHO with an NH2 group somewhere. Or perhaps the OCH2 is part of a larger substituent.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the product options again. The product options all have aldehyde groups and diphenyl substituents. So perhaps the starting material had an amino group which became a hydroxyl, and the rest of the structure involved elimination to form the aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: the product is an enal, which means an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde. So, perhaps the reaction steps form a double bond adjacent to the aldehyde.

So, the process might involve elimination of a molecule of water from a diol or similar structure, forming the double bond and generating the aldehyde.

But how does that happen? Maybe after hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, the next step under basic conditions dehydrates a vicinal diol to form an enal.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has an alcohol and an amine group in positions that, upon hydrolysis and elimination, form the aldehyde and double bond.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is Ph-CH(OH)-CH2-NH2. Then, diazotization converts the NH2 to a diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis becomes Ph-CH(OH)-CH2-OH. Then, under basic conditions, elimination occurs, removing two hydroxyl groups and forming a double bond and an aldehyde.

Wait, but Ph-CH(OH)-CH2-OH under KOH and heat would lose two water molecules to form Ph-CH=CH-CHO. But that would require two adjacent OH groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-NH2. Upon diazotization and hydrolysis, it becomes Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-OH. Then, elimination would form Ph-CH2-CHO and release water, but that would need another elimination step.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident, but perhaps the correct product is option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Because the reaction sequence would form a double bond near the aldehyde.

Alternatively, considering the NMR data, perhaps the starting material is 4-(aminophenyl)but-3-enal. Then, after the reactions, the amino becomes a hydroxyl, and the double bond remains.

Wait, but the initial NMR shows an OCH2 group, so maybe the starting material has a CH2O group. Hmm.

I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the correct answer is option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound has the molecular formula **C8H9NO**, indicating four degrees of unsaturation. The provided **1H-NMR data** suggests the presence of an aldehyde proton (triplet at 9.72 ppm, 1H), aromatic protons (doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 ppm, 2H each), a broad signal (6.27 ppm, 2H, likely -OH), and an OCH2 group (3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H). These observations suggest a structure involving aromatic rings, an aldehyde, and an oxygen-containing functional group.

The reaction sequence involves:
1. **NaNO2 + HCl**: This step typically converts an aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt.
2. **H2O**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming a phenol.
3. **aq. KOH, Heat**: This step likely induces elimination, forming a double bond and generating an aldehyde.

The **product options** are aldehydes with aromatic substituents:
- **A)** 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal  
- **B)** 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal  
- **C)** 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal  
- **D)** 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal  

Given the reaction sequence, the starting material must contain an aromatic amine (-NH2) that is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH) during hydrolysis. The elimination step under basic conditions forms an aldehyde and a double bond. Among the options, **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal (D)** fits the expected product structure, as it contains an aldehyde group, a double bond, and a hydroxyl-substituted aromatic ring. The reaction sequence aligns with the formation of this compound.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, let's break that down. Carbon is 8, hydrogen is 9, nitrogen is 1, oxygen is 1. Wait, molecular formula might give me some clues about the structure. The NMR data is also provided, so that should help in figuring out the structure before any reactions.

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

So, first, let's try to interpret the NMR. The peak at 9.72 is a triplet, integrating to 1H. That could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons, maybe adjacent to a CH2 group. Or wait, maybe it's an aromatic proton in a specific coupling situation. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but I don't think so because ketones don't have protons. Another possibility is an acidic proton, like an -OH, but that's usually lower, like around 1-5 ppm. Hmm, but wait, maybe it's an aldehyde.

Then there's a peak at 6.98 as a doublet with 2H. Maybe aromatic protons. The 6.51 is another doublet with 2H. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring, since the doublets would suggest coupling between adjacent protons. Wait, if it's para substitution, each pair would be a doublet? Or maybe they're part of a conjugated system, like an alkene. Hmm, but looking at the integration, the aromatic region has multiple peaks. The 6.27 is a broad singlet with 2H. Broad suggests possibly an -OH group, but how many H? Wait, 2H as a broad signal. Maybe a diol, but that's less common. Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling with something else, like adjacent to a double bond or part of a conjugated system.

The 3.66 ppm as a doublet with 2H. That's probably an OCH2 group. Maybe an ether or an ester, but more likely an alcohol's OCH2, or maybe a ketone's adjacent group. Or perhaps an acetal? Not sure. But OCH2 would be around 3.5-4.0 ppm.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure involves an aromatic ring, maybe two of them, connected via some chain. Since the formula is C8H9NO, let's see. Wait, molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, degrees of unsaturation: each degree is a ring or double bond. So, for C8H9NO, the formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, N=1. So:

2*8 +2 =18. 18 -9 (H) -1 (N) = 8. Divide by 2: 4 degrees. So four rings or double bonds.

Looking at the NMR, an aromatic ring (so 4H, so that's one degree), the aldehyde (double bond, another degree), and maybe another ring or double bond, perhaps in the side chain.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe it's a diphenyl compound. Two benzene rings connected via a side chain. Because the NMR shows multiple aromatic signals.

Wait, in the NMR, the two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51, each 2H. So that's four aromatic protons. So maybe two benzene rings, each having two protons. That would imply each ring is para-substituted. So for each ring, two substituents, perhaps.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Looking at the NMR, the triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) could be part of an aldehyde group. So maybe the compound is something like a benzaldehyde derivative. But wait, the molecular formula includes N and O. So maybe it's a nitro group or an amine.

Wait, but the reagents used are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then KOH and heat. That sequence is familiar. It's the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt, I think. So perhaps the starting compound has an aromatic amine group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. The presence of N and O suggests maybe an amino group (NH2) or an amide, nitro, or something else. But considering the reagents, perhaps it's an aromatic amine.

Wait, the reaction steps: first, diazotization with NaNO2 and HCl (which is acidic conditions). Then H2O, maybe hydrolysis. Then aq KOH and heat, which is basic conditions, maybe for elimination.

Wait, but diazotization usually converts an aromatic amine (like aniline) into a diazonium salt. Then, in aqueous conditions (like with H2O), it can undergo hydrolysis. If the diazonium salt is subjected to H2O, perhaps it's a Sandmeyer reaction or something else. Alternatively, in the presence of KOH and heat, maybe it's a decomposition reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the first step is diazotization, then the diazonium group is hydrolyzed to a phenol. Because when you treat a diazonium salt with water, especially under acidic or basic conditions, you can get a phenol. For example, diazonium chloride can hydrolyze to give a phenol and release N2 and Cl-.

But let me think about the structure again. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. If the starting compound is an aromatic amine, then perhaps it's a substituted aniline.

Let me think about the NMR data again. The triplet at 9.72 could be an aldehyde proton. So maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde with an amine substituent.

Wait, but then why the O in the formula? Because the formula includes O. So perhaps it's a nitro group. Wait, but the product after reaction... Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the NMR shows an OCH2 group at 3.66 ppm. So perhaps that's an ether or an alcohol group. But if the starting compound has an -OCH2- group, perhaps it's part of a substituent on the benzene ring.

Putting it all together, perhaps the starting compound is a diphenyl ether or something similar with an aldehyde group and an amine substituent.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let's try another approach. Let's look at the reaction steps.

Step 1: NaNO2 and HCl. That's a typical diazotization reaction, which usually occurs with an aromatic amine. So the starting compound likely has an -NH2 group attached to an aromatic ring.

Step 2: H2O. So after forming the diazonium salt, perhaps it's hydrolyzed. For example, if you have a benzene ring with a NH2 group, upon diazotization and hydrolysis, the NH2 becomes an OH group (phenol).

Step 3: aq KOH, heat. This could be a saponification reaction (if there was an ester), but more likely, in the case of a diazonium salt, perhaps a decomposition reaction. Alternatively, if it's an elimination reaction, maybe forming a double bond.

Wait, but the initial compound's NMR suggests an aldehyde group. So perhaps after the reactions, the aldehyde is modified. Alternatively, the product could be an aldehyde.

Wait, but the starting compound's NMR has an aldehyde proton. So after the reaction steps, perhaps that group is retained or altered.

Oh, wait, another possibility: the starting compound is an aniline derivative with a substituent that includes an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. Then, the diazonium salt is formed, and upon hydrolysis, the amino group becomes a hydroxyl.

Wait, but in the reaction sequence, the first step is diazotization, which requires an aromatic amine. Then hydrolysis would replace the amine with a hydroxyl group.

So, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with an NH2 group and an aldehyde substituent, and another substituent.

Wait, but let me try to think about the NMR again. The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) is likely an OCH2 group. So maybe the structure has a CH2O group attached to something. Like perhaps a -OCH2CH2- group or maybe a -CH2O- group.

Wait, another point: the triplet at 9.72 ppm. If it's an aldehyde proton, it's usually a singlet because it's deshielded and not split. But in this case, it's a triplet. Hmm, maybe it's part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, perhaps it's attached to a CH2 group. Wait, if the aldehyde is part of a chain like R-CHO, and adjacent to a CH2 group that has two protons, then the aldehyde proton would couple with those two, giving a triplet.

So, perhaps the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CHO, but that might not fit the degrees of unsaturation. Alternatively, maybe it's a diphenyl compound with a side chain containing an aldehyde and a CH2 group.

Wait, let's try to imagine the structure. Suppose we have two benzene rings connected via a chain. For example, two benzene rings connected by a four-carbon chain. Let me think, each benzene ring has substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the carbons. Each benzene ring has six carbons, but if it's two rings, that would be 12, but the compound only has 8, so I must have two benzene rings each with substituents. Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps it's a single benzene ring with substituents. But the NMR shows multiple aromatic peaks, which might suggest two separate benzene rings.

Wait, another approach: calculate the molecular weight. C8H9NO. So 12*8=96, 1*9=9, 14*1=14, 16*1=16. Total 96+9=105 +14=119 +16=135 g/mol. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Wait, the NMR has 6.98 and 6.51, each doublet, 2H each. That suggests perhaps two para-substituted benzene rings. So each ring has two substituents? Or perhaps one substituent each, but in a way that the coupling is observed. Alternatively, each ring has substituents leading to the two doublets.

Wait, perhaps it's a biphenyl structure. So two benzene rings connected by a single bond, and each ring has substituents. For example, each ring has a substituent that causes the doublets in the NMR.

But let's get back to the reaction steps. The first step is diazotization, which suggests there's an aromatic amine. Then, hydrolysis of the diazonium salt would give a phenol. Then, treating with KOH and heatâ€”maybe elimination occurs, forming an aldehyde or ketone.

Wait, but the product options all have "enals" or "enals" so aldehydes with double bonds.

Looking at the options:

A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal
B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal
C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal
D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal

So, all are aldehydes with some diphenyl substituents.

Wait, so maybe the starting compound had an aromatic amine group on a benzene ring, and after the reactions, the amine is replaced by a hydroxyl group (phenol), and perhaps an elimination occurs to form an aldehyde.

Wait, but how does that fit with the reaction steps. Let's think:

Step 1: NaNO2 and HCl â†’ forms diazonium chloride.

Step 2: H2O â†’ hydrolysis of diazonium to phenol.

Step 3: KOH and heat â†’ perhaps elimination of water, forming a double bond, and possibly oxidizing a group to an aldehyde.

Hmm, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an aniline derivative with an adjacent group. For example, a benzyl alcohol or something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diphenylamine, but that might not fit the formula. Let's think again about the molecular formula: C8H9NO.

So, 8 carbons. If two benzene rings (each with 6 carbons) would be 12, but the formula is 8, so perhaps one benzene ring and some other substituents.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a benzaldehyde derivative with an amine substituent.

Wait, another approach: the aldehyde proton in the NMR is at 9.72 ppm and is a triplet. A triplet suggests two neighboring protons. So perhaps it's RCH2CHO, where the CH2 is adjacent to the aldehyde.

So, the structure could be something like Ph-CH2-CHO, but that would have molecular formula C8H7O (if Ph is C6H5), but that doesn't account for the N. So, perhaps the starting material has an amine group.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like Ar-NH-CH2-CHO. But that would have a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ar-CH2-CHO with another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting structure is Ph-CH(OH)-CH2-CHO, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting me nowhere. Let me try to look at the reaction sequence again.

Reaction steps:

1. NaNO2 + HCl â†’ Diazotization. So, the starting compound must have an aromatic amine (NH2 attached to benzene ring).

2. H2O â†’ Hydrolysis of diazonium salt. This typically converts the aromatic amine to a hydroxyl group. For example, if the starting material is an aniline (Ar-NH2), after diazotization and hydrolysis, it becomes Ar-OH.

3. aq KOH, heat â†’ Perhaps a dehydration reaction, forming a double bond. Or, if there's an adjacent group, it could lead to elimination, forming an aldehyde.

Wait, but the product options are aldehydes. So, maybe during the reaction, a ketone is formed which then undergoes some oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has an alcohol group adjacent to a diazonium group, which after hydrolysis becomes a hydroxyl, and then under basic conditions, it eliminates to form an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diphenylmethanol derivative with an aromatic amine. Let me think: a benzene ring with an NH2 group and a CH2CH2O group or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting structure is something like diphenylcarbinol, but with an amine substituent.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the possible product structures and see which one makes sense after the reactions.

Looking at option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. That would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with substituents at 2 and 4 positions? Wait, but but-3-enal is CH2=CH-CHO, with substituents on the second and fourth carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with another substituent. Or it's a four-carbon chain with two phenyl groups at positions 2 and 4.

Alternatively, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(OH)-Ph. Wait, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, the NMR of the starting material has an OCH2 group. So perhaps the starting material has a -CH2-O- group, which after reaction becomes something else.

Another angle: the starting material's NMR shows an OCH2 group as a doublet. So perhaps it's a -OCH2- group connected to something else. Maybe a diethyl group? Or perhaps a benzyl-O-CH2- group.

Wait, maybe the starting compound is a methyl ether attached to a benzene ring, which after reaction becomes a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the possible product structures and what reactions would lead to them.

The reaction steps are diazotization, hydrolysis, and then base and heat. So, the first step converts an aromatic amine to a diazonium salt. The second step hydrolyzes it to a phenol. The third step might be elimination.

So, if the starting material is, say, 4-aminophenyl-(something), then after hydrolysis, it becomes 4-hydroxyphenyl.

Now, considering the product options, all have aldehyde groups and substituents, perhaps with hydroxyl groups.

Option B: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. So, the aldehyde is at position 2, and there are two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups at positions 2 and 4 of a four-carbon chain, but with a double bond between C2 and C3.

Alternatively, option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So, the aldehyde is at C1, double bond between C3 and C4, and a phenyl group at C4.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has two amine groups, but that's less likely. Or perhaps the starting material has an amine and an alcohol group.

Wait, but the starting material's NMR shows an OCH2 group. So perhaps it's a diether or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting structure is diphenylmethanol with an amine substituent. For example, Ph-CH(OH)-NH2-Ph? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative with an amine substituent and a hydroxyl group elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-amino-3-methoxybenzaldehyde. But that may not fit the molecular formula.

Another thought: the NMR shows a triplet at 9.72, which is probably the aldehyde proton. So, the starting material has an aldehyde group. Then, the reaction steps may affect the substituents.

Wait, but the first reaction step is diazotization, which requires an amine. So the starting material must have an amine group. That would be in addition to the aldehyde. So perhaps the structure is something like Ph-CHO-CH2-NH2. But that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2 with an aldehyde group elsewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the product structures again. Let's take option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

The structure would be CH2=CH-CH(OH)-Ph. Wait, but with but-3-enal, it's CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO? No, wait, but-3-enal is CH2CH2CH2CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4. No, wait, but but-3-enal would have four carbons, with the double bond between C3 and C4, and the aldehyde on C1. So it's CH2=CHCH2CHO. Wait, no. Wait, but-3-enal is CH2CH2CH2CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

But-3-enal structure: It's CH2=CH-CH2-CHO. Oh, wait, no. Wait, but-3-enal would have the double bond starting at C3, so it's CH2CH2CH2CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4? That can't be because but has four carbons. So but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO. So the aldehyde is on C1, and the double bond is between C2 and C3.

Wait, but let's think about option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So, but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO, and substituting the fourth carbon (but it's only four carbons, so the fourth would be the aldehyde end). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a four-carbon chain with a double bond between C3 and C4, an aldehyde at C1, and a phenyl group at C4. So, structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, maybe the product has a conjugated system. Let me think about the reaction.

The starting material has an amine group on a benzene ring. After diazotization and hydrolysis, that becomes a hydroxyl group. Then, under basic conditions with heat, perhaps an elimination occurs, forming a double bond and oxidizing a group to an aldehyde.

So, perhaps the starting material is something like Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2, with another substituent. Wait, but the NMR data suggests an aldehyde group. So perhaps the starting material is Ph-CH2-CHO with an NH2 group.

Wait, but that would be Ph-CH2-CHO and NH2? But where would the NH2 be attached? Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is Ph-CHO-CH2-NH2.

Hmm, not sure. Let me think about the product again.

Looking at option B: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. So, the aldehyde is at position 2 (but-2-enal), which would be CH2=CH-CHO. Wait, but but-2-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO. No, wait but-2-enal is CH2=CH-CHO, but that's only three carbons. Oh wait, no. But-2-enal would have four carbons. So, the structure is CH3-CH=CH-CHO? No, but that's but-2-enal. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a four-carbon chain with an aldehyde group at one end, a double bond, and two phenyl groups attached at positions 2 and 4.

Wait, perhaps the product is CH2=CH-CH(OH)-Ph, but that doesn't fit.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, so maybe I should try to think about the reaction mechanism.

After diazotization and hydrolysis, the NH2 group becomes an OH group. Then, when treated with KOH and heat, perhaps an elimination occurs. For example, if the starting material has a structure like Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CHO, then under basic conditions, the OH could lose a water molecule, forming a double bond adjacent to the aldehyde.

Wait, let me imagine the starting material: after the first two steps, it's Ph-OH and some other groups. Then, under basic conditions, maybe an elimination occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzylamine derivative with an aldehyde group. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, let me consider the starting material's NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 (1H) suggests an aldehyde. The OCH2 group at 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) suggests a CH2 connected to an oxygen. So maybe it's a CH2-O-C group.

Putting it together, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative with a CH2-O group. But with an NH2 substituent as well.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CHO-CH2-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's Ph-CH(OH)-CH2-CHO, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the OCH2 is part of a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like Ph-O-CH2-CHO.

Wait, but then the triplet at 9.72 would be the aldehyde. The OCH2 would have two protons, as a doublet, which fits the 3.66 ppm peak.

So, the structure would be Ph-O-CH2-CHO. But then where is the NH2 group? Because the starting material must have an aromatic amine to undergo diazotization.

Ah, perhaps the structure is Ph-NH-CH2-O-CHO. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CHO, but again, not sure about the amine.

Wait, maybe the starting material is Ph-CH2-CH2-O-CHO with an NH2 group somewhere. Or perhaps the OCH2 is part of a larger substituent.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the product options again. The product options all have aldehyde groups and diphenyl substituents. So perhaps the starting material had an amino group which became a hydroxyl, and the rest of the structure involved elimination to form the aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: the product is an enal, which means an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde. So, perhaps the reaction steps form a double bond adjacent to the aldehyde.

So, the process might involve elimination of a molecule of water from a diol or similar structure, forming the double bond and generating the aldehyde.

But how does that happen? Maybe after hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, the next step under basic conditions dehydrates a vicinal diol to form an enal.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has an alcohol and an amine group in positions that, upon hydrolysis and elimination, form the aldehyde and double bond.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is Ph-CH(OH)-CH2-NH2. Then, diazotization converts the NH2 to a diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis becomes Ph-CH(OH)-CH2-OH. Then, under basic conditions, elimination occurs, removing two hydroxyl groups and forming a double bond and an aldehyde.

Wait, but Ph-CH(OH)-CH2-OH under KOH and heat would lose two water molecules to form Ph-CH=CH-CHO. But that would require two adjacent OH groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-NH2. Upon diazotization and hydrolysis, it becomes Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-OH. Then, elimination would form Ph-CH2-CHO and release water, but that would need another elimination step.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident, but perhaps the correct product is option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Because the reaction sequence would form a double bond near the aldehyde.

Alternatively, considering the NMR data, perhaps the starting material is 4-(aminophenyl)but-3-enal. Then, after the reactions, the amino becomes a hydroxyl, and the double bond remains.

Wait, but the initial NMR shows an OCH2 group, so maybe the starting material has a CH2O group. Hmm.

I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the correct answer is option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.


The compound has the molecular formula **C8H9NO**, indicating four degrees of unsaturation. The provided **1H-NMR data** suggests the presence of an aldehyde proton (triplet at 9.72 ppm, 1H), aromatic protons (doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 ppm, 2H each), a broad signal (6.27 ppm, 2H, likely -OH), and an OCH2 group (3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H). These observations suggest a structure involving aromatic rings, an aldehyde, and an oxygen-containing functional group.

The reaction sequence involves:
1. **NaNO2 + HCl**: This step typically converts an aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt.
2. **H2O**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming a phenol.
3. **aq. KOH, Heat**: This step likely induces elimination, forming a double bond and generating an aldehyde.

The **product options** are aldehydes with aromatic substituents:
- **A)** 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal  
- **B)** 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal  
- **C)** 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal  
- **D)** 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal  

Given the reaction sequence, the starting material must contain an aromatic amine (-NH2) that is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH) during hydrolysis. The elimination step under basic conditions forms an aldehyde and a double bond. Among the options, **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal (D)** fits the expected product structure, as it contains an aldehyde group, a double bond, and a hydroxyl-substituted aromatic ring. The reaction sequence aligns with the formation of this compound.

Answer: D
