Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think |up> and |down> form an orthonormal basis for the spin-1/2 system.

The problem has two main parts: first, to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator A, and second, to find the average value of that operator. The operator A has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that sounds like a specific matrix. Let me write that out.

Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2 and the diagonal elements are zero. So the matrix would look like this:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0    ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the operator A is a 2x2 matrix because the state |alpha> is a spin-1/2 state, so the basis is two-dimensional. So A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 for i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So, yeah, the matrix is as I just wrote.

Now, I need to find the eigenstates of this operator A because the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate is what the first part of the question is about. Or wait, the operator A is given, and the question is about the eigenstates of A. So when we measure the operator A, the possible outcomes correspond to its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the projections onto the eigenstates.

But wait, the state |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of S_z, the spin-z operator. So perhaps I need to find the eigenstates of A in terms of |up> and |down>, or maybe find another basis.

Alternatively, maybe I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A to find the possible outcomes and probabilities.

Let me try to find the eigenvalues of A first. The matrix is:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

The eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A - λI) = 0.

So the determinant is (0 - λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)^2 = 0.

Expanding that: λ^2 - (ħ^2/4) = 0 → λ^2 = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Therefore, when we measure A, the possible outcomes are these two values.

Now, the next step is to find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue. Let's start with λ = ħ/2.

For λ = ħ/2, the matrix (A - λI) is:

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  -ħ/2 ]

The equations are:

-ħ/2 * x + ħ/2 * y = 0 → -x + y = 0 → y = x.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (x, x), which can be written as x*(1,1). But since eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar, we can take (1,1) as an eigenvector. But wait, we need to normalize it. The eigenvector for λ=ħ/2 is proportional to |v+> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down>).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2, the eigenvectors satisfy (A + λ I)v = 0.

Which becomes:

[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  ħ/2 ]

The equations are:

(ħ/2)x + (ħ/2)y = 0 → x + y = 0 → y = -x.

So the eigenvector is (1, -1), which when normalized is 1/sqrt(2)(|up> - |down>).

So the eigenstates of A are |v+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |v-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). These are the states in which a measurement of operator A yields +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

Now, the state |alpha> is given, but it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So first, I need to find the normalization factor because the state is given up to a proportionality constant.

The given state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me compute the normalization factor, which is 1/sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2), where a is the coefficient of |up>, and b is that of |down>.

Compute |a|^2: |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |b|^2: |2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2 +5) = 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> all divided by sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates |v+> and |v-> of operator A.

Because, when you express |alpha> in the basis of A's eigenstates, the coefficients will give the probability amplitudes for each eigenstate. The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients.

So, let me write |v+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |v-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

We can express |alpha> as a linear combination of |v+> and |v->.

Let me denote |alpha> = c_+ |v+> + c_- |v->.

We can solve for c_+ and c_-.

But perhaps it's easier to express |up> and |down> in terms of |v+> and |v->.

From the definitions:

|up> = (|v+> + |v->)/sqrt(2)

|down> = (|v+> - |v->)/sqrt(2)

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) (|v+> + |v->)/sqrt(2) ) + (2 -i) (|v+> - |v->)/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(7):

= [ (1+i)(|v+> + |v->) + (2 -i)(|v+> - |v->) ) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i + 2 -i) |v+> + (1+i - (2 -i)) |v-> ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Simplify the coefficients:

For |v+> coefficient: (1+i + 2 -i ) = (3 + 0i) → 3.

For |v-> coefficient: (1 +i -2 +i ) = (-1 + 2i).

So,

|alpha> = [ 3 |v+> + (-1 + 2i) |v-> ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

But wait, the denominator is sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) = sqrt(14). So,

|alpha> = [ 3 |v+> + (-1 + 2i) |v-> ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, no, because [1/sqrt(2)] * [1/sqrt(7)] is 1/sqrt(14). So the coefficients are 3/(sqrt(14)) and (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

So the coefficients are c_+ =3/sqrt(14), c_- = (-1+2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, wait, let me double-check the coefficients:

When expanding (1+i)(|v+> + |v-> ) + (2-i)(|v+> - |v-> ), the |v+> terms are (1+i) + (2 -i) = [1+2] + [i -i] → 3 + 0i.

The |v-> terms are (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) → (-1 + 2i).

So yeah, that's correct.

So, the coefficients c_+ and c_- are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2 = (3/sqrt(14))² = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857 or about 0.643.

Similarly, |c_-|^2 = |(-1 +2i)|^2 /14 = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which rounds to 0.36. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A gives probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and an average of hbar/7.

But let me check the average value of operator A. The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A's eigenstates are |v+> and |v-> with eigenvalues ±ħ/2, and |alpha> is expressed in terms of these, the average value would be |c_+|²*(+ħ/2) + |c_-|²*(-ħ/2).

But wait, because A has eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, and the coefficients are c_+ and c_-, so their probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

So the expectation value is (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9 * ħ/2) - (5 * ħ/2) ] /14 * 14? Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 9/14 times ħ/2 is (9ħ)/(28). 5/14 times (-ħ/2) is (-5ħ)/(28). Adding these gives (9-5)ħ/(28) =4ħ/28 = ħ/7.

Hmm, so the average value is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357, which is approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average ħ/7. So that's the first part.

But wait, let me double-check the average value. Another approach is to compute <A> directly.

Since the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] /sqrt(7).

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So, to compute <A>, we can calculate <alpha| A |alpha> .

But perhaps it's easier to proceed using the expectation formula.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is in the z-basis, and A is a spin-flip operator, perhaps we can compute <A> as the expectation value.

But let's compute it step by step.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, no. Let me write it as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 - i) |down> ] / sqrt(7).

So, <alpha| is [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) , (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ].

Multiply by A:

A |alpha> = (A (1+i)|up> + A (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

But A |up> is the first column of A, which is [0; ħ/2], so A |up> = 0 |up> + (ħ/2) |down>.

Similarly, A |down> is (ħ/2) |up> + 0 |down>.

So,

A |alpha> = [ (1+i) * (0 |up> + ħ/2 |down> ) + (2 -i) ( ħ/2 |up> + 0 |down> ) ] / sqrt(7).

Simplify this:

= [ (1+i) * (ħ/2) |down> + (2 -i) * (ħ/2) |up> ] / sqrt(7).

Factor out ħ/2:

= (ħ/2) [ (2 -i)|up> + (1+i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the inner product <alpha| A |alpha> is:

[ (1 -i)/sqrt(7) , (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * (ħ/2) [ (2 -i)|up> + (1+i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, the inner product is the conjugate transpose of <alpha| multiplied by A |alpha>.

So,

= (1 -i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2) (2 -i) / sqrt(7) + (2+i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2) (1 +i) / sqrt(7).

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) * (ħ/(2*7)).

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 2(1) -1(i) -2i + i^2 = 2 -i -2i -1 = (2-1) + (-3i) = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) * (ħ/(2*7)).

(2+i)(1+i) = 2(1) +2i +i(1) +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So,

= [ (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ) ] * (ħ/14 )

= [2 ] * (ħ/14 )= ħ/7.

So the average value is indeed ħ/7.

So, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7, matching option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7.

Wait, but looking back, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that's the correct option.

But wait, let me check the probabilities again. 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.643, which is approximately 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded. So yes, the first two options in A match.

So the answer should be option A.

The problem involves an electron state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The operator A has a matrix representation where A_ij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A and the average value of A.

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenstates of A
The matrix representation of A is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of A are found by solving \(\det(A - \lambda I) = 0\), which gives \(\lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}\). The corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|v_+⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow⟩ + |\downarrow⟩), \quad |v_-⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow⟩ - |\downarrow⟩).
\]

### Step 2: Normalize the State |α⟩
The given state is:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow⟩ + (2-i)|\downarrow⟩}{\sqrt{7}},
\]

where the normalization factor is \(1/\sqrt{7}\), ensuring \(\langle α|α⟩ = 1\).

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in Terms of |v_+⟩ and |v_-⟩
Using the relations:

\[
|\uparrow⟩ = \frac{|v_+⟩ + |v_-⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |\downarrow⟩ = \frac{|v_+⟩ - |v_-⟩}{\sqrt{2}},
\]

we substitute into |α⟩:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{(1+i)\frac{|v_+⟩ + |v_-⟩}{\sqrt{2}} + (2-i)\frac{|v_+⟩ - |v_-⟩}{\sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Simplify the coefficients:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{3|v_+⟩ + (-1+2i)|v_-⟩}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

Thus, the coefficients of |v_+⟩ and |v_-⟩ are \(c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\) and \(c_- = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\).

### Step 4: Probabilities of Measuring Eigenstates
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
P(v_+) = |c_+|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad P(v_-) = |c_-|^2 = \left(\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

### Step 5: Average Value of A
The average value of A is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P(v_+) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(v_-) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substitute the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{28}(9 - 5) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is \(\hbar/7\). These match the values in **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think |up> and |down> form an orthonormal basis for the spin-1/2 system.

The problem has two main parts: first, to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator A, and second, to find the average value of that operator. The operator A has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that sounds like a specific matrix. Let me write that out.

Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2 and the diagonal elements are zero. So the matrix would look like this:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0    ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the operator A is a 2x2 matrix because the state |alpha> is a spin-1/2 state, so the basis is two-dimensional. So A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 for i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So, yeah, the matrix is as I just wrote.

Now, I need to find the eigenstates of this operator A because the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate is what the first part of the question is about. Or wait, the operator A is given, and the question is about the eigenstates of A. So when we measure the operator A, the possible outcomes correspond to its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the projections onto the eigenstates.

But wait, the state |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of S_z, the spin-z operator. So perhaps I need to find the eigenstates of A in terms of |up> and |down>, or maybe find another basis.

Alternatively, maybe I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A to find the possible outcomes and probabilities.

Let me try to find the eigenvalues of A first. The matrix is:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

The eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A - λI) = 0.

So the determinant is (0 - λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)^2 = 0.

Expanding that: λ^2 - (ħ^2/4) = 0 → λ^2 = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Therefore, when we measure A, the possible outcomes are these two values.

Now, the next step is to find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue. Let's start with λ = ħ/2.

For λ = ħ/2, the matrix (A - λI) is:

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  -ħ/2 ]

The equations are:

-ħ/2 * x + ħ/2 * y = 0 → -x + y = 0 → y = x.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (x, x), which can be written as x*(1,1). But since eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar, we can take (1,1) as an eigenvector. But wait, we need to normalize it. The eigenvector for λ=ħ/2 is proportional to |v+> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down>).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2, the eigenvectors satisfy (A + λ I)v = 0.

Which becomes:

[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  ħ/2 ]

The equations are:

(ħ/2)x + (ħ/2)y = 0 → x + y = 0 → y = -x.

So the eigenvector is (1, -1), which when normalized is 1/sqrt(2)(|up> - |down>).

So the eigenstates of A are |v+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |v-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). These are the states in which a measurement of operator A yields +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

Now, the state |alpha> is given, but it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So first, I need to find the normalization factor because the state is given up to a proportionality constant.

The given state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me compute the normalization factor, which is 1/sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2), where a is the coefficient of |up>, and b is that of |down>.

Compute |a|^2: |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |b|^2: |2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2 +5) = 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> all divided by sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates |v+> and |v-> of operator A.

Because, when you express |alpha> in the basis of A's eigenstates, the coefficients will give the probability amplitudes for each eigenstate. The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients.

So, let me write |v+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |v-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

We can express |alpha> as a linear combination of |v+> and |v->.

Let me denote |alpha> = c_+ |v+> + c_- |v->.

We can solve for c_+ and c_-.

But perhaps it's easier to express |up> and |down> in terms of |v+> and |v->.

From the definitions:

|up> = (|v+> + |v->)/sqrt(2)

|down> = (|v+> - |v->)/sqrt(2)

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) (|v+> + |v->)/sqrt(2) ) + (2 -i) (|v+> - |v->)/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(7):

= [ (1+i)(|v+> + |v->) + (2 -i)(|v+> - |v->) ) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i + 2 -i) |v+> + (1+i - (2 -i)) |v-> ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Simplify the coefficients:

For |v+> coefficient: (1+i + 2 -i ) = (3 + 0i) → 3.

For |v-> coefficient: (1 +i -2 +i ) = (-1 + 2i).

So,

|alpha> = [ 3 |v+> + (-1 + 2i) |v-> ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

But wait, the denominator is sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) = sqrt(14). So,

|alpha> = [ 3 |v+> + (-1 + 2i) |v-> ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, no, because [1/sqrt(2)] * [1/sqrt(7)] is 1/sqrt(14). So the coefficients are 3/(sqrt(14)) and (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

So the coefficients are c_+ =3/sqrt(14), c_- = (-1+2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, wait, let me double-check the coefficients:

When expanding (1+i)(|v+> + |v-> ) + (2-i)(|v+> - |v-> ), the |v+> terms are (1+i) + (2 -i) = [1+2] + [i -i] → 3 + 0i.

The |v-> terms are (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) → (-1 + 2i).

So yeah, that's correct.

So, the coefficients c_+ and c_- are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2 = (3/sqrt(14))² = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857 or about 0.643.

Similarly, |c_-|^2 = |(-1 +2i)|^2 /14 = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which rounds to 0.36. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A gives probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and an average of hbar/7.

But let me check the average value of operator A. The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A's eigenstates are |v+> and |v-> with eigenvalues ±ħ/2, and |alpha> is expressed in terms of these, the average value would be |c_+|²*(+ħ/2) + |c_-|²*(-ħ/2).

But wait, because A has eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, and the coefficients are c_+ and c_-, so their probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

So the expectation value is (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9 * ħ/2) - (5 * ħ/2) ] /14 * 14? Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 9/14 times ħ/2 is (9ħ)/(28). 5/14 times (-ħ/2) is (-5ħ)/(28). Adding these gives (9-5)ħ/(28) =4ħ/28 = ħ/7.

Hmm, so the average value is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357, which is approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average ħ/7. So that's the first part.

But wait, let me double-check the average value. Another approach is to compute <A> directly.

Since the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] /sqrt(7).

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So, to compute <A>, we can calculate <alpha| A |alpha> .

But perhaps it's easier to proceed using the expectation formula.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is in the z-basis, and A is a spin-flip operator, perhaps we can compute <A> as the expectation value.

But let's compute it step by step.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, no. Let me write it as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 - i) |down> ] / sqrt(7).

So, <alpha| is [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) , (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ].

Multiply by A:

A |alpha> = (A (1+i)|up> + A (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

But A |up> is the first column of A, which is [0; ħ/2], so A |up> = 0 |up> + (ħ/2) |down>.

Similarly, A |down> is (ħ/2) |up> + 0 |down>.

So,

A |alpha> = [ (1+i) * (0 |up> + ħ/2 |down> ) + (2 -i) ( ħ/2 |up> + 0 |down> ) ] / sqrt(7).

Simplify this:

= [ (1+i) * (ħ/2) |down> + (2 -i) * (ħ/2) |up> ] / sqrt(7).

Factor out ħ/2:

= (ħ/2) [ (2 -i)|up> + (1+i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the inner product <alpha| A |alpha> is:

[ (1 -i)/sqrt(7) , (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * (ħ/2) [ (2 -i)|up> + (1+i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, the inner product is the conjugate transpose of <alpha| multiplied by A |alpha>.

So,

= (1 -i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2) (2 -i) / sqrt(7) + (2+i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2) (1 +i) / sqrt(7).

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) * (ħ/(2*7)).

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 2(1) -1(i) -2i + i^2 = 2 -i -2i -1 = (2-1) + (-3i) = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) * (ħ/(2*7)).

(2+i)(1+i) = 2(1) +2i +i(1) +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So,

= [ (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ) ] * (ħ/14 )

= [2 ] * (ħ/14 )= ħ/7.

So the average value is indeed ħ/7.

So, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7, matching option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7.

Wait, but looking back, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that's the correct option.

But wait, let me check the probabilities again. 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.643, which is approximately 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded. So yes, the first two options in A match.

So the answer should be option A.


The problem involves an electron state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The operator A has a matrix representation where A_ij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A and the average value of A.

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenstates of A
The matrix representation of A is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of A are found by solving \(\det(A - \lambda I) = 0\), which gives \(\lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}\). The corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|v_+⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow⟩ + |\downarrow⟩), \quad |v_-⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow⟩ - |\downarrow⟩).
\]

### Step 2: Normalize the State |α⟩
The given state is:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow⟩ + (2-i)|\downarrow⟩}{\sqrt{7}},
\]

where the normalization factor is \(1/\sqrt{7}\), ensuring \(\langle α|α⟩ = 1\).

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in Terms of |v_+⟩ and |v_-⟩
Using the relations:

\[
|\uparrow⟩ = \frac{|v_+⟩ + |v_-⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |\downarrow⟩ = \frac{|v_+⟩ - |v_-⟩}{\sqrt{2}},
\]

we substitute into |α⟩:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{(1+i)\frac{|v_+⟩ + |v_-⟩}{\sqrt{2}} + (2-i)\frac{|v_+⟩ - |v_-⟩}{\sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Simplify the coefficients:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{3|v_+⟩ + (-1+2i)|v_-⟩}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

Thus, the coefficients of |v_+⟩ and |v_-⟩ are \(c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\) and \(c_- = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\).

### Step 4: Probabilities of Measuring Eigenstates
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
P(v_+) = |c_+|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad P(v_-) = |c_-|^2 = \left(\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

### Step 5: Average Value of A
The average value of A is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P(v_+) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(v_-) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substitute the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{28}(9 - 5) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is \(\hbar/7\). These match the values in **Option A**.
