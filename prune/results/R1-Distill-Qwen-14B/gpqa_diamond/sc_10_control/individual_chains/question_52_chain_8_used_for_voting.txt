Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

Astronomers are studying a star with certain parameters. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. Without any spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and 2) when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait, wait. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature is lower (5500 K). The ratio n1/n2 (or n2/n1) depends on temperature. Let me think: since the ratio is decreasing, maybe the ratio is (n2/n1), which would decrease when T decreases because the exponential term becomes smaller. Alternatively, maybe the ratio is (n1/n2), which would increase when T decreases. I need to clarify.

Oh, the problem states that the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two levels decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present (lower T), the ratio goes down. Let's say the ratio is (n1/n2). So when T decreases, (n1/n2) decreases because n1 is the lower level, n2 is higher. Wait, no, because the exponential is -(E2-E1)/(kT). If E2 > E1, then at lower T, the term becomes more negative, so exp() decreases. So (n2/n1) = (g2/g1)*exp( -(delta E)/(kT) ). So if T decreases, the exponential term decreases, making n2/n1 smaller. So if the ratio (n2/n1) is observed to decrease, that makes sense because T is lower.

But the problem says the ratio (n1 and level 2; wait, the question says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two levels (level 1 and level 2), when spots are present, the ratio decreases. Let me clarify: when the star has spots, the overall T is lower. So the ratio (n1/n2) would be increasing because n1 is lower, higher occupation at lower T. Wait, no, because the energy levels are such that if the lower level is level 1, higher level is level 2. The Boltzmann factor says that higher energy levels have fewer atoms. So at lower T, the population in higher levels (level 2) decreases more.

So (n2/n1) is proportional to exp(- (E2-E1)/(kT)). So when T is lower, this ratio (n2/n1) is smaller. So when spots are present, the ratio decreases. The problem states that the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio being discussed is (n2/n1).

So when the star is unspotted, T = 6000 K. When spotted, T = 5500 K. The ratio (n2/n1) when unspotted is R1, and when spotted is R2. We need to find the factor R1/R2.

Wait, no, the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 is n1/n2. Because the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So if originally the ratio is R = n1/n2, and when T decreases, R increases or decreases?

Wait, let's think again. The Boltzmann equation: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2-E1)/(kT) )

Let’s say E2 > E1, so (E2-E1) is positive. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the exponential term smaller. So the ratio (n2/n1) decreases. So if the ratio (n2/n1) is R, then R is smaller when T is lower. The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1 and level 2) decreases. Wait, the wording is tricky.

Wait, the question says: when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in level 1 and level 2. So let's clarify: what is the ratio they're looking at? If they are looking at (n1)/(n2), then when T decreases, (n1)/(n2) would increase because n2 is decreasing more than n1. Because higher energy levels are more sensitive to temperature. So if the observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots (lower T), that doesn't align. Wait, perhaps I got the ratio wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed ratio is (n2/n1). Then, when the star has spots, T is lower, so (n2/n1) is smaller. So the ratio decreases. So the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the ratio being discussed is (n2/n1). So the ratio when unspotted is R1 = (n2/n1)_6000K, and when spotted R2 = (n2/n1)_5500K. The factor by which the ratio changes is R1/R2.

But wait, the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. So the factor is R1/R2.

So to find the ratio of R1 to R2, which is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

But using the Boltzmann equation, each (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( - (E2-E1)/(kT) ). So the ratio R1/R2 would be [ exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*5500) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( [ (E2-E1)/(k) ] * (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Compute 1/5500 - 1/6000. Let's compute that. 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000≈1.666e-4. So difference is about 0.152e-4 ≈ 1.52e-5.

So the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * 1.52e-5.

But wait, (E2-E1) can be found using the wavelength of the transition. The problem states that the transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. So the energy difference is E2-E1 = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant (~6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (~3e8 m/s). λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So E = hc/(λ) = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (1448e-10) = let's compute that.

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ approx 1.373e-18 J.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So (E2-E1)/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ approximately 9.95e4 K.

So approximately 1e5 K.

So going back to the exponent: (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 1e5 K * 1.52e-5 (per K) = 1.52.

Wait, let me compute more accurately 1/5500 - 1/6000.

Compute 1/5500 = (1/5500) ≈ 0.000181818.

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667.

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151.

So 1.5151e-5.

So the exponent becomes 99500 K * 1.5151e-5 (1/K) )= 99500 * 1.5151e-5.

Compute 99500 * 1.5151e-5 = 99500 * 1.5151 * 1e-5.

99500 * 1.5151e-5 = (99500 / 1e5) ) * 1.5151 ≈ 0.995 * 1.5151 ≈ approximately 1.506.

So the exponent is about 1.506.

So the ratio R1/R2 = exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506. Let's compute e^1.5 is about 4.4817. e^1.506 is a bit higher. Let me compute ln(4.5)= about 1.504, which is very close. So ln(4.5)=1.5040774.

So e^1.506 ≈4.505. So approximately 4.5.

Wait, but wait: that's the ratio R1/R2, which is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500. So R1 is higher than R2 by a factor of about 4.5. So the ratio (n2/n1) without spots is about 4.5 times the ratio when spots are present.

But the problem says the "ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)" decreases when the star has spots. So (n1/n2) is the ratio being measured. So let me re-express it.

Wait, no. Let's think again. If the observed ratio is (n1/n2), which is the reciprocal of (n2/n1).

So when the star has spots, (n1/n2) increases (since (n2/n1) decreases). But the problem states that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So wait, that would mean that the observed ratio is (n2/n1). Let me think again.

If the observed ratio is (n1/n2), then when T decreases (spots present), (n2) decreases more than (n1), so (n1/n2) increases. If the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that implies that the observed ratio is (n2/n1), which decreases when T decreases.

So the factor by which the ratio changes (R) is R1/R2, where R1 is (n2/n1) at 6000 K, and R2 is (n2/n1) at 5500 K. So R1/R2 is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer would be C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **Energy Difference (\(\Delta E\))**: The transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of \(1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using the relation \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), we calculate:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Dividing by \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we find:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx 99500 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. **Temperature Change**: The star's effective temperature decreases from \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (unspotted) to \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (spotted).

3. **Ratio of Ratios**: The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:
   \[
   \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
   \]
   Substituting \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\), \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\), and \(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx 99500 \, \text{K}\), we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(99500 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5}\right) \approx \exp(1.506).
   \]
   Using \(\exp(1.506) \approx 4.5\), the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \(4.5\).

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots due to the lower temperature. The factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

Wait, but wait, wait. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature is lower (5500 K). The ratio n1/n2 (or n2/n1) depends on temperature. Let me think: since the ratio is decreasing, maybe the ratio is (n2/n1), which would decrease when T decreases because the exponential term becomes smaller. Alternatively, maybe the ratio is (n1/n2), which would increase when T decreases. I need to clarify.

So if the ratio (n2/n1) is observed to decrease, that makes sense because T is lower.

So when the star is unspotted, T = 6000 K. When spotted, T = 5500 K. The ratio (n2/n1) when unspotted is R1, and when spotted is R2. We need to find the factor R1/R2.

Wait, no, the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 is n1/n2. Because the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So if originally the ratio is R = n1/n2, and when T decreases, R increases or decreases?

Wait, let's think again. The Boltzmann equation: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2-E1)/(kT) )

Let’s say E2 > E1, so (E2-E1) is positive. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the exponential term smaller. So the ratio (n2/n1) decreases. So if the ratio (n2/n1) is R, then R is smaller when T is lower. The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1 and level 2) decreases. Wait, the wording is tricky.

So the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the ratio being discussed is (n2/n1). So the ratio when unspotted is R1 = (n2/n1)_6000K, and when spotted R2 = (n2/n1)_5500K. The factor by which the ratio changes is R1/R2.

But wait, the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. So the factor is R1/R2.

So to find the ratio of R1 to R2, which is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

But using the Boltzmann equation, each (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( - (E2-E1)/(kT) ). So the ratio R1/R2 would be [ exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*5500) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( [ (E2-E1)/(k) ] * (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Compute 1/5500 - 1/6000. Let's compute that. 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000≈1.666e-4. So difference is about 0.152e-4 ≈ 1.52e-5.

So the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * 1.52e-5.

But wait, (E2-E1) can be found using the wavelength of the transition. The problem states that the transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. So the energy difference is E2-E1 = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant (~6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (~3e8 m/s). λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So E = hc/(λ) = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (1448e-10) = let's compute that.

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ approx 1.373e-18 J.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So (E2-E1)/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ approximately 9.95e4 K.

So approximately 1e5 K.

So going back to the exponent: (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 1e5 K * 1.52e-5 (per K) = 1.52.

Wait, let me compute more accurately 1/5500 - 1/6000.

Compute 1/5500 = (1/5500) ≈ 0.000181818.

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667.

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151.

So 1.5151e-5.

So the exponent becomes 99500 K * 1.5151e-5 (1/K) )= 99500 * 1.5151e-5.

Compute 99500 * 1.5151e-5 = 99500 * 1.5151 * 1e-5.

99500 * 1.5151e-5 = (99500 / 1e5) ) * 1.5151 ≈ 0.995 * 1.5151 ≈ approximately 1.506.

So the exponent is about 1.506.

So the ratio R1/R2 = exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506. Let's compute e^1.5 is about 4.4817. e^1.506 is a bit higher. Let me compute ln(4.5)= about 1.504, which is very close. So ln(4.5)=1.5040774.

So e^1.506 ≈4.505. So approximately 4.5.

Wait, but wait: that's the ratio R1/R2, which is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500. So R1 is higher than R2 by a factor of about 4.5. So the ratio (n2/n1) without spots is about 4.5 times the ratio when spots are present.

But the problem says the "ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)" decreases when the star has spots. So (n1/n2) is the ratio being measured. So let me re-express it.

Wait, no. Let's think again. If the observed ratio is (n1/n2), which is the reciprocal of (n2/n1).

So when the star has spots, (n1/n2) increases (since (n2/n1) decreases). But the problem states that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So wait, that would mean that the observed ratio is (n2/n1). Let me think again.

If the observed ratio is (n1/n2), then when T decreases (spots present), (n2) decreases more than (n1), so (n1/n2) increases. If the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that implies that the observed ratio is (n2/n1), which decreases when T decreases.

So the factor by which the ratio changes (R) is R1/R2, where R1 is (n2/n1) at 6000 K, and R2 is (n2/n1) at 5500 K. So R1/R2 is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer would be C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **Energy Difference (\(\Delta E\))**: The transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of \(1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using the relation \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), we calculate:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Dividing by \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we find:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx 99500 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. **Temperature Change**: The star's effective temperature decreases from \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (unspotted) to \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (spotted).

3. **Ratio of Ratios**: The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:
   \[
   \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
   \]
   Substituting \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\), \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\), and \(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx 99500 \, \text{K}\), we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(99500 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5}\right) \approx \exp(1.506).
   \]
   Using \(\exp(1.506) \approx 4.5\), the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \(4.5\).

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots due to the lower temperature. The factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.
