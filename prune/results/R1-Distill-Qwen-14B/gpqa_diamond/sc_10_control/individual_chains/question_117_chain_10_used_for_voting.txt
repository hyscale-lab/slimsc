Alright, so I've got this chemistry question here about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism, right. That's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. These are also called enantiomers. But wait, for a compound to show optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center, or some kind of asymmetry that allows for enantiomers.

The question lists four organic moieties, and I need to determine which ones exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations.

Let me go through each one step by step.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, this one's a bit complex. Let me visualize it. It's a biphenyl structure, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and 6 and 6' positions on each ring have nitro groups. Wait, but the key thing is the biphenyl structure. Biphenyls can have what's called a binaphthyl structure, which could lead to cis and trans isomers. Wait, but optical isomerism requires chirality. So, does this structure have a plane of symmetry or not? Hmm, the substituents are at 2 and 2', which are symmetric. Oh wait, but the nitro groups are at 6 and 6'. Wait, let me think. If the substituents are all in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then it might have a chiral center or a chiral axis. Alternatively, the biphenyl could have a configuration where the two phenyl rings are in a way that they can't be superimposed on their mirror image. Wait, maybe it's about the substituents creating a chiral center. Wait, maybe the two nitro groups are in such positions that the molecule is chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe it's better to think of other moieties first and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. The structure is CH3-C(OH)CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-COOH? Wait, no, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate: the acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the structure has a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the ester group. Wait, let me count: the central carbon has the hydroxyl, the ester group (COOCH3), and two CH3 groups? No, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, the chain is three carbons: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, it's CH3CH2COOH. So, the carboxylic acid is on the first carbon. The second carbon is CH2, and the third is CH3. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3-CHOH-COOH. So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. Then, the ester is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the second carbon) has the following groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a hydrogen? Wait, no, wait. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second) is attached to: a CH3, an OH, a COOCH3, and a single bond to the first carbon (which is the COOCH3). Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the positions. Let's see, the formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the carbons are:

Carbon 1: COOCH3
Carbon 2: attached to OH and CH3
Carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct structure is:

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Then the ester would be CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then the ester would have the structure CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the one attached to the OH) is attached to:

- CH3 group (from the methyl in CH3-CH(OH)-),
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a hydrogen? Wait, no, because the CH3 is on the adjacent carbon. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)(CH2COOCH3)- ?

Wait, maybe I should think of the structure as:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) has four different groups attached: a methyl group (from the CH3), a hydroxyl group (OH), an ester group (COOCH3), and the adjacent carbon (from the CH2 part). Wait, no, the adjacent carbon is the third carbon, which is the COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
- and a hydrogen? No, wait: the second carbon is connected to the first (CH3), the third (COOCH3), OH, and another CH3? Or is it connected to a CH2 group? Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the substituents on that central carbon.

If the central carbon is attached to four different groups, then it's a chiral center. So, let's see:

- One substituent is the CH3 from the first carbon (the one before the OH).
Wait, wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

1. CH3 (from the left),
2. OH,
3. COOCH3 (from the right),
4. and another CH2 group? Or perhaps it's a CH2 connected to the COOCH3. Hmm, I might be getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second carbon) would have:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (as another substituent),
- and perhaps a hydrogen? Or another CH group?

Wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally. The molecule is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the structure is: the central carbon (second) is connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (right),
- and the adjacent carbon is the third, which is a carbonyl group.

Wait, no, the third carbon is the one bearing the COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second) is connected to:

1. CH3 (left),
2. OH,
3. COOCH3 (right group),
4. and a CH2 group? Or perhaps a CH2 connected to the COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. If the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH group? Or maybe it's connected to a CH2 group that's part of the COOCH3. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of substituents. If the central carbon is attached to four different groups, it's chiral.

So, if it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the substituents on the central carbon are:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a hydrogen? No, wait, the carbon chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the second carbon is CH(OH), connected to CH3 on one side and COOCH3 on the other. So, the substituents on the second carbon would be:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a single bond (so a hydrogen atom?), or perhaps a CH2 group? Hmm, maybe not. If the second carbon is CH(OH), then it's attached to:

- Left: CH3,
- Right: COOCH3,
- Top: OH,
- and a hydrogen.

So, four different substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Oh wait, no, because the adjacent carbon is the third, which is the COOCH3's carbon. So, the central carbon has CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a single bond (so a hydrogen). Oh, wait, no. Wait, perhaps the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and another CH2 group? Or perhaps, it's connected to a CH2 group that is part of the COOCH3.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe another approach: if the molecule has a carbon with four different groups attached, it's chiral.

So, let's see: the central carbon is the one with the OH. Let's list the four groups attached to it.

Group 1: CH3 (from the left),
Group 2: OH,
Group 3: COOCH3 (from the right),
Group 4: CH2 (from the right?), which is connected to the COOCH3. No, wait, the CH2 would be part of the COOCH3 group. So, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH3,
- OH,
- (CH2)COOCH3,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a CH2 group that's part of the COOCH3.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident, but if the central carbon has four different groups, then it's chiral, leading to optical isomerism. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center and thus exhibit optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. The structure is two benzene rings attached to a ketone group. So, it's Ph-CO-Ph. Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers or a plane of symmetry? Let me think. The central carbon is the one with the ketone (C=O). So, the groups attached are two phenyl groups, one on each side, and the oxygen double-bonded to the carbon. So, the structure is O=C(Ph)2. Wait, actually, benzophenone is (Ph)₂CO, so the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So, the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, and connected to two phenyl groups. So, the substituents are two phenyl groups and the oxygen. Wait, but the central carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's actually a carbonyl group. That means it's trigonal planar. So, the central carbon isn't a chiral center because it's double-bonded. Additionally, the molecule is symmetrical around the central C=O. So, it's not chiral. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the cis or trans diastereomer of maleate. Wait, fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, fumaric acid is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H, with the two carboxylic acid groups on opposite sides of the double bond. When esterified with methanol, it becomes dimethyl fumarate: CH₂(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). Wait, no, fumaric acid's structure is two carboxylic acid groups on opposite sides of a double bond. So, the structure would be:

COOCH3-O
       \
CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-OOCCH3

Wait, perhaps more accurately, it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, fumarate is a di-carboxylic acid with a double bond. So, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

(CH₂COOCH3)₂C=CH₂? No, wait, let me think again. Fumaric acid is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H. So, the ester would have methoxy groups replacing the hydroxyls. So, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3). Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, actually, maleic acid is cis, and fumaric is trans. So, maleic acid is HOOCCH₂CH₂COOH, but that's not right. Wait, no: maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the two COOH groups on the same side of the double bond, while fumaric acid has them on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the structure of fumarate. Oh, wait, I can't look it up, I have to think from memory. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3) on each end of the double bond, but on opposite sides. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, the structure would be:

O
||
COOCH3–C–C–COOCH3
        ||
        with a double bond between the two central carbons.

Wait, no, I think I should think of it as:

O
||
O-C-CH₂-CH₂-C-O
O
||
Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I should think of fumarate as having a central double bond with two ester groups on each end, but on opposite sides. So, the structure would be:

CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂(COOCH3) ? No, that's not a double bond. Oh wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but trans.

So, when esterified, it becomes CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration. Wait, no, perhaps each carbonyl group is attached to a CH2 group. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH₂-CH₂-C-O
O
||

No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-butenedioic acid ester. So, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂(COOCH3), but that's for the cis isomer. Wait, no, maybe it's CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), with the substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, but the key thing is whether it has a chiral center or not. Wait, no, because the central part is a double bond. Wait, but in the case of diastereomers, like cis and trans, the molecule may have symmetry. So, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers?

Wait, no. Because the double bond is between two CH2 groups with ester substituents. Wait, but in the case of fumarate, the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me think: the double bond is in the middle, and each end has the same substituents. So, perhaps it's not chiral because it might have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but wait, dimethyl fumarate has the structure CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, is this molecule chiral?

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Wait, a molecule can have stereoisomerism without a chiral center, like in the case of geometric isomerism. But for optical isomerism, you need a chiral center or a chiral axis. So, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the two substituents (the ester groups) are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule is symmetric. Because if you have a double bond with identical groups on each end, but arranged in a trans configuration, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, no, if the substituents are the same, like two CH₂(COOCH3) groups on either end, but in a trans configuration, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond. So, it won't be chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center and isn't a chiral molecule, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, another thought. Sometimes, even if a molecule isn't itself chiral, it can have stereoisomers if it has stereogenic centers. But in this case, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but another possibility: if the molecule has a double bond that's a site for E/Z isomerism, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical. So, the dimethyl fumarate would have E and Z isomers, but those are not optical isomers.

So, putting this all together.

Let's go back to the four moieties:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Now, this is a biphenyl structure. Biphenyls can sometimes have axial chirality, such as in binaphthyl compounds. For instance, binaphthyl compounds with different substituents on each ring can be chiral. So, the question is whether this particular molecule has axial chirality due to the substituents.

In this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring. The nitro groups are at 6 and 6'. Let me visualize the structure. Each benzene ring has a carboxylic ester group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 6. So, the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro).

Wait, in biphenyl compounds, the substituents on each ring can lead to axial chirality if they are arranged asymmetrically. For example, if substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent the molecule from having a plane of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester group at 2. So, the positions of the substituents: 2 is adjacent to 1 (the bond connecting the two rings), and 6 is opposite to 1. So, on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other. Wait, so each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are opposite positions relative to the connecting bond. So, if both rings have substituents at 2 and 6, and the substituents are the same (both nitro or both ester), perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents on each ring are different. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, the substituents are the same on both rings but in similar positions. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, no. Wait, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, the two rings have the same substituents. So, if one ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2, the other ring also has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So, when you look at the molecule, it might have a plane of symmetry along the axis connecting the two rings (the 1-1' bond). So, perhaps this molecule isn't chiral.

Wait, but maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image. Alternatively, if the substituents are in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule is chiral.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about this one. Maybe I should think of it in terms of whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then there's a plane of symmetry, so no chirality. If not, then chirality.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are opposite each other. So, when the two rings are connected, the substituents on each ring are oriented in a way that creates symmetry. So, perhaps this molecule isn't chiral.

So, perhaps it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but another possibility. Let me think of the biphenyl structure. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent the molecule from having a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. For example, if one ring has a substituent on one side and the other ring has a substituent on another, but their arrangement isn't symmetric.

In this case, each ring has the same substituents (nitro and ester) in the same positions (2 and 6). So, when you rotate the molecule, perhaps it's symmetrical. Therefore, no chirality.

So, perhaps this moiety doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Other biphenyl compounds, like 1,1'-binaphthyl derivatives, can be chiral because their substituents break the symmetry. For example, if one ring has a methyl group and the other has a hydroxyl group, the molecule could be chiral. But in this case, both rings have the same substituents in the same positions, making the molecule symmetric. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

1. No optical isomerism.
2. Yes, it has a chiral center, so yes.
3. No, because it's symmetrical and the central carbon is a carbonyl, not a chiral center.
4. No, because the substituents are symmetrical and there's no chiral center.

Wait, but wait. I thought dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. So, which of the four moieties exhibit optical isomerism?

Only the second one, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but let's recheck that. The first and the fourth: I thought they didn't. The third also doesn't. So, only number 2 has optical isomerism.

But wait, the options are A) 1,2,4; B)3,4; C)2,3; D)1 and 2.

But according to this, only number 2 exhibits optical isomerism. So, none of the options have only 2. Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Let me think again. The structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3) in the trans configuration. Each CH₂ group is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So, each of the CH₂ groups is attached to two identical substituents. So, no chiral centers. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, how about the first moiety, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Alternative approach: If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. If not, then it is chiral.

In this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. The substituent at 2 is the ester group, and at 6 is the nitro. Since 6 is opposite 1 (the connecting bond between the two rings), the substituents are on opposite sides. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Because each ring has the same substituents, the overall molecule could have a plane of symmetry. So, no chirality.

So, that leaves only the second moiety, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which has a chiral center.

But wait, the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. The options are:

A) 1,2 and4 → all three.
B)3 and4 → no.
C)2 and3 → no.
D)1 and2 → no.

Wait, that can't be. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of the moieties.

Wait, perhaps the first one does have a chiral axis or center. Let me think again.

Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has two substituents: a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

Wait, in a biphenyl structure, the orientation of substituents can lead to axial chirality if the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent the molecule from having a plane of symmetry.

In this case, the substituents on each ring are in positions 2 and 6. For the first ring, substituents at 2 and 6 are across from each other. Similarly, on the second ring.

So, when both rings have their substituents in 2 and 6 positions, and the substituents are the same (nitro and ester), the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, no chirality.

So, perhaps I was right in thinking that the first and fourth don't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, what about the fourth, dimethyl fumarate?

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has the structure (CH₂COOCH3)₂, but connected across a double bond. No, wait, it's actually CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH₂(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration.

Wait, that's four carbons: COOCH3 on each end, with a double bond in the middle. So, the structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3?

No, that's a single bond. No, wait, fumarate has a double bond. So, the structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH=CH–CH₂–COOCH3?

No, wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC–CH₂–CH=CH–COOH, I think. So, when esterified, it becomes CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), but with the double bond in the trans configuration.

Wait, so the structure is:

(CH₂COOCH3)–CH=CH–(CH₂COOCH3), in the trans configuration.

So, the four carbons are: COOCH3-CH₂-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, there's a double bond between the second and third carbons.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH=CH–CH₂–COOCH3?

No, that's not correct because fumarate is a four-carbon molecule. So, the correct structure is:

CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), but arranged so that the substituents are on opposite sides.

Wait, but the central two carbons have a double bond. So, each has a CH₂(COOCH3) group.

Wait, so each of the two middle carbons is attached to CH₂(COOCH3) and a hydrogen, and a double bond. So, each carbon in the double bond has two CH₂(COOCH3) groups and a double bond. Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, each end has a CH₂(COOCH3) group attached to a central double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's (CH₂COOCH3)–CH=CH–(CH₂COOCH3) in the trans configuration.

So, each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to two CH₂COOCH3 groups and a double bond.

Wait, but that would mean each central carbon is attached to two identical groups, so no chiral centers. Because each of the double-bonded carbons has two identical substituents, CH₂COOCH3.

So, no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3). In this case, the substituents on either side of the double bond are the same, so the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, that brings me back to only the second moiety (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) exhibiting optical isomerism.

But according to the options provided, there's no option with only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of the other options.

Wait, looking back at the question, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

So, perhaps I missed that one of the other moieties also exhibits optical isomerism.

Let me reevaluate the first moiety.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. The biphenyl is connected at position 1 of each ring. So, in each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in positions that cannot be mirrored, leading to a chiral molecule.

Wait, maybe the way the substituents are arranged on each ring leads to axial chirality. So, think of biphenyls where the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent the molecule from being superimposable on its mirror image.

In biphenyl compounds, axial chirality arises when the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. For example, if one substituent is on the top of one ring and another substituent is on the bottom of the other ring, making the arrangement asymmetric.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, for each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Are these positions leading to a symmetric arrangement?

Let me imagine the rings connected at position 1. For the first ring, substituent at 2 is on the same side as the connecting bond, and substituent at 6 is opposite. Similarly, on the second ring, substituent at 2' is on the same side as the connecting bond, and substituent at 6' is opposite.

Wait, but since the substituents on each ring are the same (nitro and ester) in the same positions (2 and 6), the arrangement is symmetrical. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Hmm. So, perhaps the first moiety doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think of a real example. For example, diphenyl ether is (Ph)₂O, which is symmetric and not chiral. But if the two phenyl rings have different substituents, then perhaps the molecule becomes chiral.

In this case, both rings have the same substituents (nitro and ester), so the molecule should be symmetric. So, no optical isomerism.

So, that brings me back to only the second moiety, which has a chiral center.

But none of the options have only 2. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the first one does have an optical isomer.

Wait, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere. For example, perhaps the ester groups are attached in such a way that a chiral center is formed.

Wait, the ester groups are at 2 and 2', so each ring has a COOCH3 group at position 2. So, for each ring, the substituents at 2 and 6 are the same as the other ring. So, no chiral center.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each moiety's ability to have enantiomers.

So, to recap:

1. No.
2. Yes.
3. No.
4. No.

But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of the others.

Wait, perhaps the fourth one does have a chiral center. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. Its ester would be (E)-butenedioate.

Wait, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), with the substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, each of the CH2 groups is connected to COOCH3.

Wait, but each CH2 group is attached to two COOCH3 groups, so each is a CH2 group, which is symmetric. So, no chiral centers.

Alternatively, perhaps the central carbons (in the double bond) are each connected to two identical groups, so no chiral centers.

So, I think dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

So, going back, which of the four moieties exhibit optical isomerism?

Only the second one.

But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the second one. Let me reevaluate methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, wait. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon is the second carbon. Its substituents are:

1. CH3,
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. and a hydrogen.

Wait, yes! So, four different groups attached to the same carbon: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. That makes it a chiral center. So, the molecule has enantiomers and exhibits optical isomerism.

So, the second moiety does exhibit optical isomerism.

But according to the options, the only option that includes 2 is options A and D.

Option A: 1,2,4 → but I think 1 and 4 don't exhibit.

Option D: 1 and 2 → but I think 1 doesn't.

So, maybe I made a mistake about the first one.

Wait, the first one: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral. Let me think of the biphenyl structure.

If the substituents on each ring are in positions that cause the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, substituents are on opposite sides. So, when you rotate the molecule, the arrangement of substituents might not be symmetric.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has the same substituents in the same positions, so the molecule is symmetric. Therefore, no chirality.

So, only the second one is correct.

Hmm. But the options don't have an option with just 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the fourth option doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, is there any other possibility? Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, perhaps the fumarate ester has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. But what about the structure of dimethyl fumarate? Could it have a chiral center because of the arrangement of substituents around a carbon?

Wait, the structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH=CH–CH₂–COOCH3 ?

No, that's not right. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate, which is a di-carboxylic acid with a double bond between the two carbons adjacent to the carboxylic acid groups. So, the correct structure of fumarate is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH, but that's for maleic acid. No, wait, no. Maleic acid is HOOC–CH=CH–COOH, with the two COOH groups on adjacent carbons connected by a double bond.

Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so the structure is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH? No, that's not right. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC–CH=CH–COOH but in the trans configuration. So, the double bond is between the two middle carbons, and the COOH groups are on opposite sides.

So, when esterified, dimethyl fumarate would have the structure CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), with the substituents (the COOCH3 groups) on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, in this structure, each of the two middle carbons is attached to a CH₂(COOCH3) group and a hydrogen. So, each of these carbons in the double bond has two identical substituents (CH₂(COOCH3) and H), but wait, no. Each is attached to a CH₂(COOCH3) and a hydrogen, and also to the other carbon in the double bond.

Wait, but each of the double-bonded carbons has two substituents: one CH₂(COOCH3) and one hydrogen. So, each of these carbons is attached to two different groups (since the other substituent is the adjacent double-bonded carbon). Wait, but in that case, each of the double-bonded carbons is attached to:

- CH₂(COOCH3),
- H,
- and two bonds to the other double-bonded carbon.

Wait, but in that case, each double-bonded carbon has two identical groups (two CH2(COOCH3)s?), no. No, each is attached to one CH2(COOCH3), one H, and two bonds to the other carbon in the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether there is a chiral center in the molecule. Since the double bond is in the middle, each adjacent carbon is attached to a CH₂(COOCH3) and a hydrogen. So, each of these carbons is bonded to two different groups (CH2(COOCH3) and H), and perhaps the other two bonds are to the other double-bonded carbon.

Wait, but that's not a chiral center because each of these carbons is in a double bond and thus has trigonal geometry. So, they aren't chiral centers.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but perhaps in some cases, even without a chiral center, a molecule can have optical isomerism if it has a center of chirality elsewhere, but I think that's not the case here.

So, to sum up, the only moiety that exhibits optical isomerism is the second one, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But looking back at the options:

A) 1, 2, and 4 → includes 1 and 4, which I don't think exhibit.
B)3 and4 → no.
C)2 and3 → no.
D)1 and2 → no.

Hmm. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the first option.

Wait, perhaps the first option does have a chiral center. Let me think again.

Structure: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So, each ring has two substituents. Are any of the carbons in the rings chiral?

No, because the aromatic carbons are part of the benzene rings and have planar geometry, so no chiral centers there. The connecting carbon (the one at position 1) is a single bond, but it's connected to two benzene rings and two other substituents (maybe), but I don't think so. Wait, the connecting carbon is part of both rings, so it's a shared carbon between the two benzene rings. So, it's not a chiral center.

So, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, I'm back to the conclusion that only the second moiety exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but I must choose from the given options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake regarding the first option.

Another approach: some biphenyl compounds are chiral because of their substituents, even if each benzene ring is not chiral on its own. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the entire molecule asymmetric.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Let's imagine the biphenyl structure: the two benzene rings are connected at position 1. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. If the substituents are such that the arrangement around the central bond is asymmetric, then the molecule may be chiral.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has the same substituents (nitro at 6, ester at 2). So, when you rotate one ring relative to the other, the arrangement would still be symmetric. Therefore, the molecule isn't chiral.

So, perhaps the first option doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the substituents are in such positions that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, no chirality.

So, perhaps only the second one is correct.

But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I'm not confident about that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake regarding the fourth option. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), trans configuration.

Each of the middle carbons is attached to a CH₂(COOCH3), a hydrogen, and a double bond. So, each has two different substituents (CH₂(COOCH3) and H), but since they're in a double bond, they can't be chiral centers.

So, no chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism.

Therefore, the only correct is the second option.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, looking back, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, let me draw its structure.

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon is the second carbon. Its substituents are:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, so four different groups: yes, that makes a chiral center.

So, that one does exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only correct moiety is 2, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that one of the other moieties also has a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps benzophenone (moiety 3) has a chiral center. No, because it's (Ph)₂CO, which has a central carbonyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's not a chiral center.

So, I'm stuck. According to my analysis, only 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but none of the options include only 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the first one. Let me think again.

If the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

But in this case, both rings have the same substituents, so the molecule is symmetric.

So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1,2, and4. But I don't think 1 and4 exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the first option has a chiral center. Let me think: any carbon in the structure that's a chiral center.

The substituents are on the benzene rings. Benzene carbons are planar, so no chiral centers there. The central connecting carbon is connected to two rings, so it's not a chiral center.

So, I'm not seeing any chiral centers in the first option.

Wait, perhaps the ester groups are connected in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere. For example, perhaps the ester groups are attached in a way that a carbon becomes chiral.

But the ester groups are at positions 2 and 2', which are on separate rings. So, their attachment points are on separate rings, meaning there's no single carbon where they're attached that would form a chiral center.

So, I think the first option doesn't have a chiral center.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the fourth option.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center.

Wait, the structure is:

CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), with E configuration.

Each of the middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to:

- CH₂(COOCH3),
- CH₂(COOCH3) from the adjacent carbon,
- and the double bond.

Wait, no, each of the middle carbons is attached to a CH₂(COOCH3) group, a hydrogen, and a double bond to the other carbon.

So, each middle carbon has substituents:

- CH₂(COOCH3),
- H,
- and two bonds in the double bond.

So, each has two different substituents, but because it's a double bond, the geometry is fixed. So, each of these carbons is not a chiral center.

Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm back to my initial conclusion: only the second moiety exhibits optical isomerism, but the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think about the other moieties again.

Moiety 3: benzophenone. No, because it's a planar molecule.

Moiety 4: dimethyl fumarate. No, because no chiral centers.

Moiety 1: no chiral centers.

Moiety 2: yes.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident because I don't think 1 and 4 exhibit optical isomerism.

But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the first and fourth don't exhibit.

Wait, another approach: look for each option.

Option A: 1,2,4.

If 2 is correct, and 4 is not, then 1 must be correct for option A to be correct.

But I don't think 1 is correct.

Option D: 1 and 2.

If 2 is correct, maybe 1 is also correct.

But earlier analysis suggests 1 isn't correct.

Option A has 1,2,4. If 4 isn't correct, then A is incorrect.

Option D has 1 and 2. If 1 isn't correct, then D is incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's not possible. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the first option.

Another angle: perhaps the first option is a case of axial chirality.

In biphenyl compounds, when the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent the molecule from having a plane of symmetry, the molecule can exhibit axial chirality. For example, if the substituents are in the 2 and 3 positions on each ring, making the arrangement asymmetric.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring.

Wait, 6 is the opposite of 1. So, substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring would result in a symmetric arrangement.

So, no axial chirality.

Therefore, the first option doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct answer is only the second option, but since it's not in the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A, including 1, 2, and 4.

But I'm not confident. Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the first option does have a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think.

Wait, the ester groups are at 2 and 2' on each ring. Are those positions on the same carbon as any other substituents?

No, the ester groups are attached to carbons on the benzene rings, which are sp² hybridized, so not chiral centers.

Therefore, no chiral centers in the first option.

Hmm. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis, and the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the fourth option, dimethyl fumarate, has a chiral center. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O
O
||

No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is a four-carbon chain with ester groups on both ends and a double bond in the middle. So, the structure is:

CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), with the substituents on opposite sides (trans configuration).

In this structure, each of the CH₂ groups is attached to two identical substituents (COOCH3), so each CH₂ is not a chiral center.

Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm back to the conclusion that only the second option exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the first option. Let me think again.

If the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it's chiral.

In this case, both rings have the same substituents, making the molecule symmetric. Therefore, no chirality.

So, I'm confident that only the second option is correct.

But since the options don't have an option with only 2, perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the first option. Let me think of the structure as:

Each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester at 2. So, the substituents are arranged in a way that when the rings rotate, the arrangement could be asymmetric.

Wait, but because both rings have the same substituents, the molecule remains symmetric.

Hmm.

Well, given the time I've spent, I think I should conclude that the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4. But I'm not entirely confident because I think only 2 is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong about the first and fourth options.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because it's symmetrical. So, only 2 is correct.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the second option.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon is CH(OH). So, the substituents are:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a hydrogen.

Yes, four different groups, so a chiral center. So, it exhibits optical isomerism.

So, the second option is correct.

But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So, perhaps I'm missing that one of the other options (like 4) also has a chiral center.

Wait, what if I'm wrong about dimethyl fumarate? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, each of the CH₂ groups attached to the double bond is a chiral center.

Wait, in the structure CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), each CH₂ is attached to two COOCH3 groups, making them non-chiral.

Wait, no. If a carbon is attached to two identical groups, it's not a chiral center. So, in this case, each CH₂ is attached to two COOCH3 groups, so they are not chiral.

Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm back to my initial conclusion: only the second option is correct.

But since none of the options have only 2, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4.

But that would mean that 1 and4 are correct, which I don't think they are.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 1 and 2.

But I don't think 1 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about the first option. Let me think differently: perhaps the substituents on the biphenyl are in positions that make the molecule chiral.

For example, if the substituents on each ring are in different positions relative to each other, the molecule could be chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, if you look at the arrangement around the central bond, perhaps the substituents are arranged asymmetrically.

Wait, but since each ring has the same substituents, the molecule would still be symmetric.

Hmm.

Well, I'm stuck. Given that, I'll proceed to choose the option that includes the second option, but according to the options, only option A and D include 2.

Wait, option A includes 1,2,4.

Option D includes 1 and 2.

I think that the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

But I think I need to proceed.

Wait, no. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about the first option: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the two substituents on each ring are not in symmetrical positions, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Are these positions symmetrical around the central bond?

Yes, because 6 is opposite to 1 (the connecting bond), and 2 is adjacent to 1.

So, each ring has substituents in the same positions relative to the connecting bond. So, when you rotate one ring 180 degrees, the substituents would align, making the molecule symmetric.

Therefore, the first option doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only correct moiety is 2. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed. But that can't be, so perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4.

Wait, but I don't think 1 and4 are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake about the first option. Maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in a way that their arrangement isn't mirror-symmetric.

But since each ring has the same substituents in the same positions, the molecule should be symmetric.

Hmm.

Well, given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a decision.

The only moiety that definitely exhibits optical isomerism is 2. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but only 2 is correct. I might have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A because all three exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm.

Wait, I think I've spent enough time. I'll conclude that the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps only 2 is correct, but since that's not an option, I might have to choose option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chirality, which requires a molecule to lack a plane of symmetry and have a chiral center or axial chirality.

### Analysis of Each Moiety:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This molecule consists of two benzene rings connected at position 1, with nitro groups at positions 6 and ester groups at positions 2 on each ring. Since the substituents on both rings are identical and symmetrically arranged, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this molecule is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and a hydrogen. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the molecule to exhibit optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂CO, where two benzene rings are attached to a carbonyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, making it trigonal planar and not a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule is symmetric, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate has the structure CH₂(COOCH₃)-CH=CH-CH₂(COOCH₃) in the trans configuration. The double-bonded carbons are each attached to identical groups (CH₂(COOCH₃) and H), so there are no chiral centers. The molecule is symmetric and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Evaluation of Options:

- **Option A (1, 2, 4):**  
  Moiety 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism, and moiety 4 is also achiral. Only moiety 2 is correct, so this option is incorrect.

- **Option B (3, 4):**  
  Both moieties 3 and 4 are achiral, so this option is incorrect.

- **Option C (2, 3):**  
  Moiety 2 is correct, but moiety 3 is achiral, so this option is incorrect.

- **Option D (1, 2):**  
  Moiety 1 is achiral, so this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Only moiety 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) exhibits optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options include only moiety 2. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is not explicitly listed, but if forced to choose, **Option A (1, 2, 4)** is the closest, despite the inaccuracies.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Alright, so I've got this chemistry question here about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism, right. That's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. These are also called enantiomers. But wait, for a compound to show optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center, or some kind of asymmetry that allows for enantiomers.

The question lists four organic moieties, and I need to determine which ones exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations.

Let me go through each one step by step.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, this one's a bit complex. Let me visualize it. It's a biphenyl structure, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and 6 and 6' positions on each ring have nitro groups. Wait, but the key thing is the biphenyl structure. Biphenyls can have what's called a binaphthyl structure, which could lead to cis and trans isomers. Wait, but optical isomerism requires chirality. So, does this structure have a plane of symmetry or not? Hmm, the substituents are at 2 and 2', which are symmetric. Oh wait, but the nitro groups are at 6 and 6'. Wait, let me think. If the substituents are all in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then it might have a chiral center or a chiral axis. Alternatively, the biphenyl could have a configuration where the two phenyl rings are in a way that they can't be superimposed on their mirror image. Wait, maybe it's about the substituents creating a chiral center. Wait, maybe the two nitro groups are in such positions that the molecule is chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe it's better to think of other moieties first and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. The structure is CH3-C(OH)CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-COOH? Wait, no, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate: the acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the structure has a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the ester group. Wait, let me count: the central carbon has the hydroxyl, the ester group (COOCH3), and two CH3 groups? No, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, the chain is three carbons: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, it's CH3CH2COOH. So, the carboxylic acid is on the first carbon. The second carbon is CH2, and the third is CH3. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3-CHOH-COOH. So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. Then, the ester is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the second carbon) has the following groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a hydrogen? Wait, no, wait. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second) is attached to: a CH3, an OH, a COOCH3, and a single bond to the first carbon (which is the COOCH3). Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the positions. Let's see, the formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the carbons are:

Carbon 1: COOCH3
Carbon 2: attached to OH and CH3
Carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct structure is:

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Then the ester would be CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then the ester would have the structure CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the one attached to the OH) is attached to:

- CH3 group (from the methyl in CH3-CH(OH)-),
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a hydrogen? Wait, no, because the CH3 is on the adjacent carbon. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)(CH2COOCH3)- ?

Wait, maybe I should think of the structure as:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) has four different groups attached: a methyl group (from the CH3), a hydroxyl group (OH), an ester group (COOCH3), and the adjacent carbon (from the CH2 part). Wait, no, the adjacent carbon is the third carbon, which is the COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
- and a hydrogen? No, wait: the second carbon is connected to the first (CH3), the third (COOCH3), OH, and another CH3? Or is it connected to a CH2 group? Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the substituents on that central carbon.

If the central carbon is attached to four different groups, then it's a chiral center. So, let's see:

- One substituent is the CH3 from the first carbon (the one before the OH).
Wait, wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

1. CH3 (from the left),
2. OH,
3. COOCH3 (from the right),
4. and another CH2 group? Or perhaps it's a CH2 connected to the COOCH3. Hmm, I might be getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second carbon) would have:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (as another substituent),
- and perhaps a hydrogen? Or another CH group?

Wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally. The molecule is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the structure is: the central carbon (second) is connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (right),
- and the adjacent carbon is the third, which is a carbonyl group.

Wait, no, the third carbon is the one bearing the COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second) is connected to:

1. CH3 (left),
2. OH,
3. COOCH3 (right group),
4. and a CH2 group? Or perhaps a CH2 connected to the COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. If the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH group? Or maybe it's connected to a CH2 group that's part of the COOCH3. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of substituents. If the central carbon is attached to four different groups, it's chiral.

So, if it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the substituents on the central carbon are:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a hydrogen? No, wait, the carbon chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the second carbon is CH(OH), connected to CH3 on one side and COOCH3 on the other. So, the substituents on the second carbon would be:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a single bond (so a hydrogen atom?), or perhaps a CH2 group? Hmm, maybe not. If the second carbon is CH(OH), then it's attached to:

- Left: CH3,
- Right: COOCH3,
- Top: OH,
- and a hydrogen.

So, four different substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Oh wait, no, because the adjacent carbon is the third, which is the COOCH3's carbon. So, the central carbon has CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a single bond (so a hydrogen). Oh, wait, no. Wait, perhaps the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and another CH2 group? Or perhaps, it's connected to a CH2 group that is part of the COOCH3.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe another approach: if the molecule has a carbon with four different groups attached, it's chiral.

So, let's see: the central carbon is the one with the OH. Let's list the four groups attached to it.

Group 1: CH3 (from the left),
Group 2: OH,
Group 3: COOCH3 (from the right),
Group 4: CH2 (from the right?), which is connected to the COOCH3. No, wait, the CH2 would be part of the COOCH3 group. So, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH3,
- OH,
- (CH2)COOCH3,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a CH2 group that's part of the COOCH3.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident, but if the central carbon has four different groups, then it's chiral, leading to optical isomerism. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center and thus exhibit optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. The structure is two benzene rings attached to a ketone group. So, it's Ph-CO-Ph. Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers or a plane of symmetry? Let me think. The central carbon is the one with the ketone (C=O). So, the groups attached are two phenyl groups, one on each side, and the oxygen double-bonded to the carbon. So, the structure is O=C(Ph)2. Wait, actually, benzophenone is (Ph)₂CO, so the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So, the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, and connected to two phenyl groups. So, the substituents are two phenyl groups and the oxygen. Wait, but the central carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's actually a carbonyl group. That means it's trigonal planar. So, the central carbon isn't a chiral center because it's double-bonded. Additionally, the molecule is symmetrical around the central C=O. So, it's not chiral. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the cis or trans diastereomer of maleate. Wait, fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, fumaric acid is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H, with the two carboxylic acid groups on opposite sides of the double bond. When esterified with methanol, it becomes dimethyl fumarate: CH₂(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). Wait, no, fumaric acid's structure is two carboxylic acid groups on opposite sides of a double bond. So, the structure would be:

COOCH3-O
       \
CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-OOCCH3

Wait, perhaps more accurately, it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, fumarate is a di-carboxylic acid with a double bond. So, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

(CH₂COOCH3)₂C=CH₂? No, wait, let me think again. Fumaric acid is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H. So, the ester would have methoxy groups replacing the hydroxyls. So, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3). Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, actually, maleic acid is cis, and fumaric is trans. So, maleic acid is HOOCCH₂CH₂COOH, but that's not right. Wait, no: maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the two COOH groups on the same side of the double bond, while fumaric acid has them on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the structure of fumarate. Oh, wait, I can't look it up, I have to think from memory. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3) on each end of the double bond, but on opposite sides. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, the structure would be:

O
||
COOCH3–C–C–COOCH3
        ||
        with a double bond between the two central carbons.

Wait, no, I think I should think of it as:

O
||
O-C-CH₂-CH₂-C-O
O
||
Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I should think of fumarate as having a central double bond with two ester groups on each end, but on opposite sides. So, the structure would be:

CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂(COOCH3) ? No, that's not a double bond. Oh wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but trans.

So, when esterified, it becomes CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration. Wait, no, perhaps each carbonyl group is attached to a CH2 group. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH₂-CH₂-C-O
O
||

No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-butenedioic acid ester. So, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂(COOCH3), but that's for the cis isomer. Wait, no, maybe it's CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), with the substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, but the key thing is whether it has a chiral center or not. Wait, no, because the central part is a double bond. Wait, but in the case of diastereomers, like cis and trans, the molecule may have symmetry. So, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers?

Wait, no. Because the double bond is between two CH2 groups with ester substituents. Wait, but in the case of fumarate, the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me think: the double bond is in the middle, and each end has the same substituents. So, perhaps it's not chiral because it might have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but wait, dimethyl fumarate has the structure CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, is this molecule chiral?

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Wait, a molecule can have stereoisomerism without a chiral center, like in the case of geometric isomerism. But for optical isomerism, you need a chiral center or a chiral axis. So, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the two substituents (the ester groups) are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule is symmetric. Because if you have a double bond with identical groups on each end, but arranged in a trans configuration, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, no, if the substituents are the same, like two CH₂(COOCH3) groups on either end, but in a trans configuration, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond. So, it won't be chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center and isn't a chiral molecule, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, another thought. Sometimes, even if a molecule isn't itself chiral, it can have stereoisomers if it has stereogenic centers. But in this case, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but another possibility: if the molecule has a double bond that's a site for E/Z isomerism, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical. So, the dimethyl fumarate would have E and Z isomers, but those are not optical isomers.

So, putting this all together.

Let's go back to the four moieties:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Now, this is a biphenyl structure. Biphenyls can sometimes have axial chirality, such as in binaphthyl compounds. For instance, binaphthyl compounds with different substituents on each ring can be chiral. So, the question is whether this particular molecule has axial chirality due to the substituents.

In this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring. The nitro groups are at 6 and 6'. Let me visualize the structure. Each benzene ring has a carboxylic ester group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 6. So, the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro).

Wait, in biphenyl compounds, the substituents on each ring can lead to axial chirality if they are arranged asymmetrically. For example, if substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent the molecule from having a plane of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester group at 2. So, the positions of the substituents: 2 is adjacent to 1 (the bond connecting the two rings), and 6 is opposite to 1. So, on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other. Wait, so each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are opposite positions relative to the connecting bond. So, if both rings have substituents at 2 and 6, and the substituents are the same (both nitro or both ester), perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents on each ring are different. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, the substituents are the same on both rings but in similar positions. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, no. Wait, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, the two rings have the same substituents. So, if one ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2, the other ring also has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So, when you look at the molecule, it might have a plane of symmetry along the axis connecting the two rings (the 1-1' bond). So, perhaps this molecule isn't chiral.

Wait, but maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image. Alternatively, if the substituents are in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule is chiral.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about this one. Maybe I should think of it in terms of whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then there's a plane of symmetry, so no chirality. If not, then chirality.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are opposite each other. So, when the two rings are connected, the substituents on each ring are oriented in a way that creates symmetry. So, perhaps this molecule isn't chiral.

So, perhaps it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but another possibility. Let me think of the biphenyl structure. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent the molecule from having a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. For example, if one ring has a substituent on one side and the other ring has a substituent on another, but their arrangement isn't symmetric.

In this case, each ring has the same substituents (nitro and ester) in the same positions (2 and 6). So, when you rotate the molecule, perhaps it's symmetrical. Therefore, no chirality.

So, perhaps this moiety doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Other biphenyl compounds, like 1,1'-binaphthyl derivatives, can be chiral because their substituents break the symmetry. For example, if one ring has a methyl group and the other has a hydroxyl group, the molecule could be chiral. But in this case, both rings have the same substituents in the same positions, making the molecule symmetric. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

1. No optical isomerism.
2. Yes, it has a chiral center, so yes.
3. No, because it's symmetrical and the central carbon is a carbonyl, not a chiral center.
4. No, because the substituents are symmetrical and there's no chiral center.

Wait, but wait. I thought dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. So, which of the four moieties exhibit optical isomerism?

Only the second one, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but let's recheck that. The first and the fourth: I thought they didn't. The third also doesn't. So, only number 2 has optical isomerism.

But wait, the options are A) 1,2,4; B)3,4; C)2,3; D)1 and 2.

But according to this, only number 2 exhibits optical isomerism. So, none of the options have only 2. Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Let me think again. The structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3) in the trans configuration. Each CH₂ group is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So, each of the CH₂ groups is attached to two identical substituents. So, no chiral centers. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, how about the first moiety, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Alternative approach: If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. If not, then it is chiral.

In this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. The substituent at 2 is the ester group, and at 6 is the nitro. Since 6 is opposite 1 (the connecting bond between the two rings), the substituents are on opposite sides. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Because each ring has the same substituents, the overall molecule could have a plane of symmetry. So, no chirality.

So, that leaves only the second moiety, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which has a chiral center.

But wait, the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. The options are:

A) 1,2 and4 → all three.
B)3 and4 → no.
C)2 and3 → no.
D)1 and2 → no.

Wait, that can't be. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of the moieties.

Wait, perhaps the first one does have a chiral axis or center. Let me think again.

Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has two substituents: a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

Wait, in a biphenyl structure, the orientation of substituents can lead to axial chirality if the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent the molecule from having a plane of symmetry.

In this case, the substituents on each ring are in positions 2 and 6. For the first ring, substituents at 2 and 6 are across from each other. Similarly, on the second ring.

So, when both rings have their substituents in 2 and 6 positions, and the substituents are the same (nitro and ester), the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, no chirality.

So, perhaps I was right in thinking that the first and fourth don't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, what about the fourth, dimethyl fumarate?

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has the structure (CH₂COOCH3)₂, but connected across a double bond. No, wait, it's actually CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH₂(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration.

Wait, that's four carbons: COOCH3 on each end, with a double bond in the middle. So, the structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3?

No, that's a single bond. No, wait, fumarate has a double bond. So, the structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH=CH–CH₂–COOCH3?

No, wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC–CH₂–CH=CH–COOH, I think. So, when esterified, it becomes CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), but with the double bond in the trans configuration.

Wait, so the structure is:

(CH₂COOCH3)–CH=CH–(CH₂COOCH3), in the trans configuration.

So, the four carbons are: COOCH3-CH₂-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, there's a double bond between the second and third carbons.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH=CH–CH₂–COOCH3?

No, that's not correct because fumarate is a four-carbon molecule. So, the correct structure is:

CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), but arranged so that the substituents are on opposite sides.

Wait, but the central two carbons have a double bond. So, each has a CH₂(COOCH3) group.

Wait, so each of the two middle carbons is attached to CH₂(COOCH3) and a hydrogen, and a double bond. So, each carbon in the double bond has two CH₂(COOCH3) groups and a double bond. Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, each end has a CH₂(COOCH3) group attached to a central double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's (CH₂COOCH3)–CH=CH–(CH₂COOCH3) in the trans configuration.

So, each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to two CH₂COOCH3 groups and a double bond.

Wait, but that would mean each central carbon is attached to two identical groups, so no chiral centers. Because each of the double-bonded carbons has two identical substituents, CH₂COOCH3.

So, no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3). In this case, the substituents on either side of the double bond are the same, so the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, that brings me back to only the second moiety (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) exhibiting optical isomerism.

But according to the options provided, there's no option with only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of the other options.

Wait, looking back at the question, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

So, perhaps I missed that one of the other moieties also exhibits optical isomerism.

Let me reevaluate the first moiety.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. The biphenyl is connected at position 1 of each ring. So, in each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in positions that cannot be mirrored, leading to a chiral molecule.

Wait, maybe the way the substituents are arranged on each ring leads to axial chirality. So, think of biphenyls where the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent the molecule from being superimposable on its mirror image.

In biphenyl compounds, axial chirality arises when the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. For example, if one substituent is on the top of one ring and another substituent is on the bottom of the other ring, making the arrangement asymmetric.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, for each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Are these positions leading to a symmetric arrangement?

Let me imagine the rings connected at position 1. For the first ring, substituent at 2 is on the same side as the connecting bond, and substituent at 6 is opposite. Similarly, on the second ring, substituent at 2' is on the same side as the connecting bond, and substituent at 6' is opposite.

Wait, but since the substituents on each ring are the same (nitro and ester) in the same positions (2 and 6), the arrangement is symmetrical. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Hmm. So, perhaps the first moiety doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think of a real example. For example, diphenyl ether is (Ph)₂O, which is symmetric and not chiral. But if the two phenyl rings have different substituents, then perhaps the molecule becomes chiral.

In this case, both rings have the same substituents (nitro and ester), so the molecule should be symmetric. So, no optical isomerism.

So, that brings me back to only the second moiety, which has a chiral center.

But none of the options have only 2. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the first one does have an optical isomer.

Wait, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere. For example, perhaps the ester groups are attached in such a way that a chiral center is formed.

Wait, the ester groups are at 2 and 2', so each ring has a COOCH3 group at position 2. So, for each ring, the substituents at 2 and 6 are the same as the other ring. So, no chiral center.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each moiety's ability to have enantiomers.

So, to recap:

1. No.
2. Yes.
3. No.
4. No.

But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of the others.

Wait, perhaps the fourth one does have a chiral center. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. Its ester would be (E)-butenedioate.

Wait, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), with the substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, each of the CH2 groups is connected to COOCH3.

Wait, but each CH2 group is attached to two COOCH3 groups, so each is a CH2 group, which is symmetric. So, no chiral centers.

Alternatively, perhaps the central carbons (in the double bond) are each connected to two identical groups, so no chiral centers.

So, I think dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

So, going back, which of the four moieties exhibit optical isomerism?

Only the second one.

But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the second one. Let me reevaluate methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, wait. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon is the second carbon. Its substituents are:

1. CH3,
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. and a hydrogen.

Wait, yes! So, four different groups attached to the same carbon: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. That makes it a chiral center. So, the molecule has enantiomers and exhibits optical isomerism.

So, the second moiety does exhibit optical isomerism.

But according to the options, the only option that includes 2 is options A and D.

Option A: 1,2,4 → but I think 1 and 4 don't exhibit.

Option D: 1 and 2 → but I think 1 doesn't.

So, maybe I made a mistake about the first one.

Wait, the first one: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral. Let me think of the biphenyl structure.

If the substituents on each ring are in positions that cause the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, substituents are on opposite sides. So, when you rotate the molecule, the arrangement of substituents might not be symmetric.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has the same substituents in the same positions, so the molecule is symmetric. Therefore, no chirality.

So, only the second one is correct.

Hmm. But the options don't have an option with just 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the fourth option doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, is there any other possibility? Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, perhaps the fumarate ester has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. But what about the structure of dimethyl fumarate? Could it have a chiral center because of the arrangement of substituents around a carbon?

Wait, the structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH=CH–CH₂–COOCH3 ?

No, that's not right. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate, which is a di-carboxylic acid with a double bond between the two carbons adjacent to the carboxylic acid groups. So, the correct structure of fumarate is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH, but that's for maleic acid. No, wait, no. Maleic acid is HOOC–CH=CH–COOH, with the two COOH groups on adjacent carbons connected by a double bond.

Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so the structure is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH? No, that's not right. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC–CH=CH–COOH but in the trans configuration. So, the double bond is between the two middle carbons, and the COOH groups are on opposite sides.

So, when esterified, dimethyl fumarate would have the structure CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), with the substituents (the COOCH3 groups) on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, in this structure, each of the two middle carbons is attached to a CH₂(COOCH3) group and a hydrogen. So, each of these carbons in the double bond has two identical substituents (CH₂(COOCH3) and H), but wait, no. Each is attached to a CH₂(COOCH3) and a hydrogen, and also to the other carbon in the double bond.

Wait, but each of the double-bonded carbons has two substituents: one CH₂(COOCH3) and one hydrogen. So, each of these carbons is attached to two different groups (since the other substituent is the adjacent double-bonded carbon). Wait, but in that case, each of the double-bonded carbons is attached to:

- CH₂(COOCH3),
- H,
- and two bonds to the other double-bonded carbon.

Wait, but in that case, each double-bonded carbon has two identical groups (two CH2(COOCH3)s?), no. No, each is attached to one CH2(COOCH3), one H, and two bonds to the other carbon in the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether there is a chiral center in the molecule. Since the double bond is in the middle, each adjacent carbon is attached to a CH₂(COOCH3) and a hydrogen. So, each of these carbons is bonded to two different groups (CH2(COOCH3) and H), and perhaps the other two bonds are to the other double-bonded carbon.

Wait, but that's not a chiral center because each of these carbons is in a double bond and thus has trigonal geometry. So, they aren't chiral centers.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but perhaps in some cases, even without a chiral center, a molecule can have optical isomerism if it has a center of chirality elsewhere, but I think that's not the case here.

So, to sum up, the only moiety that exhibits optical isomerism is the second one, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But looking back at the options:

A) 1, 2, and 4 → includes 1 and 4, which I don't think exhibit.
B)3 and4 → no.
C)2 and3 → no.
D)1 and2 → no.

Hmm. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the first option.

Wait, perhaps the first option does have a chiral center. Let me think again.

Structure: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So, each ring has two substituents. Are any of the carbons in the rings chiral?

No, because the aromatic carbons are part of the benzene rings and have planar geometry, so no chiral centers there. The connecting carbon (the one at position 1) is a single bond, but it's connected to two benzene rings and two other substituents (maybe), but I don't think so. Wait, the connecting carbon is part of both rings, so it's a shared carbon between the two benzene rings. So, it's not a chiral center.

So, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, I'm back to the conclusion that only the second moiety exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but I must choose from the given options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake regarding the first option.

Another approach: some biphenyl compounds are chiral because of their substituents, even if each benzene ring is not chiral on its own. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the entire molecule asymmetric.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Let's imagine the biphenyl structure: the two benzene rings are connected at position 1. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. If the substituents are such that the arrangement around the central bond is asymmetric, then the molecule may be chiral.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has the same substituents (nitro at 6, ester at 2). So, when you rotate one ring relative to the other, the arrangement would still be symmetric. Therefore, the molecule isn't chiral.

So, perhaps the first option doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the substituents are in such positions that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, no chirality.

So, perhaps only the second one is correct.

But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I'm not confident about that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake regarding the fourth option. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), trans configuration.

Each of the middle carbons is attached to a CH₂(COOCH3), a hydrogen, and a double bond. So, each has two different substituents (CH₂(COOCH3) and H), but since they're in a double bond, they can't be chiral centers.

So, no chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism.

Therefore, the only correct is the second option.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, looking back, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, let me draw its structure.

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon is the second carbon. Its substituents are:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, so four different groups: yes, that makes a chiral center.

So, that one does exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only correct moiety is 2, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that one of the other moieties also has a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps benzophenone (moiety 3) has a chiral center. No, because it's (Ph)₂CO, which has a central carbonyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's not a chiral center.

So, I'm stuck. According to my analysis, only 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but none of the options include only 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the first one. Let me think again.

If the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

But in this case, both rings have the same substituents, so the molecule is symmetric.

So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1,2, and4. But I don't think 1 and4 exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the first option has a chiral center. Let me think: any carbon in the structure that's a chiral center.

The substituents are on the benzene rings. Benzene carbons are planar, so no chiral centers there. The central connecting carbon is connected to two rings, so it's not a chiral center.

So, I'm not seeing any chiral centers in the first option.

Wait, perhaps the ester groups are connected in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere. For example, perhaps the ester groups are attached in a way that a carbon becomes chiral.

But the ester groups are at positions 2 and 2', which are on separate rings. So, their attachment points are on separate rings, meaning there's no single carbon where they're attached that would form a chiral center.

So, I think the first option doesn't have a chiral center.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the fourth option.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center.

Wait, the structure is:

CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), with E configuration.

Each of the middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to:

- CH₂(COOCH3),
- CH₂(COOCH3) from the adjacent carbon,
- and the double bond.

Wait, no, each of the middle carbons is attached to a CH₂(COOCH3) group, a hydrogen, and a double bond to the other carbon.

So, each middle carbon has substituents:

- CH₂(COOCH3),
- H,
- and two bonds in the double bond.

So, each has two different substituents, but because it's a double bond, the geometry is fixed. So, each of these carbons is not a chiral center.

Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm back to my initial conclusion: only the second moiety exhibits optical isomerism, but the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think about the other moieties again.

Moiety 3: benzophenone. No, because it's a planar molecule.

Moiety 4: dimethyl fumarate. No, because no chiral centers.

Moiety 1: no chiral centers.

Moiety 2: yes.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident because I don't think 1 and 4 exhibit optical isomerism.

But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the first and fourth don't exhibit.

Wait, another approach: look for each option.

Option A: 1,2,4.

If 2 is correct, and 4 is not, then 1 must be correct for option A to be correct.

But I don't think 1 is correct.

Option D: 1 and 2.

If 2 is correct, maybe 1 is also correct.

But earlier analysis suggests 1 isn't correct.

Option A has 1,2,4. If 4 isn't correct, then A is incorrect.

Option D has 1 and 2. If 1 isn't correct, then D is incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's not possible. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the first option.

Another angle: perhaps the first option is a case of axial chirality.

In biphenyl compounds, when the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent the molecule from having a plane of symmetry, the molecule can exhibit axial chirality. For example, if the substituents are in the 2 and 3 positions on each ring, making the arrangement asymmetric.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring.

Wait, 6 is the opposite of 1. So, substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring would result in a symmetric arrangement.

So, no axial chirality.

Therefore, the first option doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct answer is only the second option, but since it's not in the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A, including 1, 2, and 4.

But I'm not confident. Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the first option does have a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think.

Wait, the ester groups are at 2 and 2' on each ring. Are those positions on the same carbon as any other substituents?

No, the ester groups are attached to carbons on the benzene rings, which are sp² hybridized, so not chiral centers.

Therefore, no chiral centers in the first option.

Hmm. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis, and the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the fourth option, dimethyl fumarate, has a chiral center. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O
O
||

No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is a four-carbon chain with ester groups on both ends and a double bond in the middle. So, the structure is:

CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), with the substituents on opposite sides (trans configuration).

In this structure, each of the CH₂ groups is attached to two identical substituents (COOCH3), so each CH₂ is not a chiral center.

Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm back to the conclusion that only the second option exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the first option. Let me think again.

If the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it's chiral.

In this case, both rings have the same substituents, making the molecule symmetric. Therefore, no chirality.

So, I'm confident that only the second option is correct.

But since the options don't have an option with only 2, perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the first option. Let me think of the structure as:

Each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester at 2. So, the substituents are arranged in a way that when the rings rotate, the arrangement could be asymmetric.

Wait, but because both rings have the same substituents, the molecule remains symmetric.

Hmm.

Well, given the time I've spent, I think I should conclude that the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4. But I'm not entirely confident because I think only 2 is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong about the first and fourth options.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because it's symmetrical. So, only 2 is correct.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the second option.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon is CH(OH). So, the substituents are:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a hydrogen.

Yes, four different groups, so a chiral center. So, it exhibits optical isomerism.

So, the second option is correct.

But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So, perhaps I'm missing that one of the other options (like 4) also has a chiral center.

Wait, what if I'm wrong about dimethyl fumarate? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, each of the CH₂ groups attached to the double bond is a chiral center.

Wait, in the structure CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3), each CH₂ is attached to two COOCH3 groups, making them non-chiral.

Wait, no. If a carbon is attached to two identical groups, it's not a chiral center. So, in this case, each CH₂ is attached to two COOCH3 groups, so they are not chiral.

Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm back to my initial conclusion: only the second option is correct.

But since none of the options have only 2, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4.

But that would mean that 1 and4 are correct, which I don't think they are.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 1 and 2.

But I don't think 1 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about the first option. Let me think differently: perhaps the substituents on the biphenyl are in positions that make the molecule chiral.

For example, if the substituents on each ring are in different positions relative to each other, the molecule could be chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, if you look at the arrangement around the central bond, perhaps the substituents are arranged asymmetrically.

Wait, but since each ring has the same substituents, the molecule would still be symmetric.

Hmm.

Well, I'm stuck. Given that, I'll proceed to choose the option that includes the second option, but according to the options, only option A and D include 2.

Wait, option A includes 1,2,4.

Option D includes 1 and 2.

I think that the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

But I think I need to proceed.

Wait, no. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about the first option: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the two substituents on each ring are not in symmetrical positions, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Are these positions symmetrical around the central bond?

Yes, because 6 is opposite to 1 (the connecting bond), and 2 is adjacent to 1.

So, each ring has substituents in the same positions relative to the connecting bond. So, when you rotate one ring 180 degrees, the substituents would align, making the molecule symmetric.

Therefore, the first option doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only correct moiety is 2. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed. But that can't be, so perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4.

Wait, but I don't think 1 and4 are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake about the first option. Maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in a way that their arrangement isn't mirror-symmetric.

But since each ring has the same substituents in the same positions, the molecule should be symmetric.

Hmm.

Well, given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a decision.

The only moiety that definitely exhibits optical isomerism is 2. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but only 2 is correct. I might have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A because all three exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm.

Wait, I think I've spent enough time. I'll conclude that the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps only 2 is correct, but since that's not an option, I might have to choose option A.


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chirality, which requires a molecule to lack a plane of symmetry and have a chiral center or axial chirality.

### Analysis of Each Moiety:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This molecule consists of two benzene rings connected at position 1, with nitro groups at positions 6 and ester groups at positions 2 on each ring. Since the substituents on both rings are identical and symmetrically arranged, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this molecule is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and a hydrogen. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the molecule to exhibit optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂CO, where two benzene rings are attached to a carbonyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, making it trigonal planar and not a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule is symmetric, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate has the structure CH₂(COOCH₃)-CH=CH-CH₂(COOCH₃) in the trans configuration. The double-bonded carbons are each attached to identical groups (CH₂(COOCH₃) and H), so there are no chiral centers. The molecule is symmetric and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Evaluation of Options:

- **Option A (1, 2, 4):**  
  Moiety 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism, and moiety 4 is also achiral. Only moiety 2 is correct, so this option is incorrect.

- **Option B (3, 4):**  
  Both moieties 3 and 4 are achiral, so this option is incorrect.

- **Option C (2, 3):**  
  Moiety 2 is correct, but moiety 3 is achiral, so this option is incorrect.

- **Option D (1, 2):**  
  Moiety 1 is achiral, so this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Only moiety 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) exhibits optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options include only moiety 2. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is not explicitly listed, but if forced to choose, **Option A (1, 2, 4)** is the closest, despite the inaccuracies.
