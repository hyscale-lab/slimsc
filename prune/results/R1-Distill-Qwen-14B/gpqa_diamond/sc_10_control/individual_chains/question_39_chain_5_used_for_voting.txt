Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measured the position, all the particles were between x=1 and x=3, not found outside that range. So we need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, right. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So |ψ(x)|² must be zero outside the region where the particle exists. Because in the measurements, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside this interval.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/√(1+x)) - 0.5i. So this is a complex wave function. To get the modulus squared, I think I should compute ψ*(x) * ψ(x). The complex conjugate of ψ would be (a/√(1+x)) + 0.5i, right? Because the imaginary part's sign flips when taking the conjugate.

So |ψ(x)|² = [(a/√(1+x)) - 0.5i] * [(a/√(1+x)) + 0.5i]. Let me compute that. Using the formula (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b².

So that would be (a²)/(1+x) - (0.5i)^2. Wait, but 0.5i squared is (0.5)^2 * i² = 0.25*(-1) = -0.25. So the second term becomes - (-0.25) = +0.25. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait a minute, that can't be right. Because the modulus squared should be real and positive. So I think I did that correctly.

Now, the wave function must be zero outside of x=1 and x=3. That means ψ(x)=0 when x <1 and x>3. But looking at the wave function given, ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So for it to be zero for x <1 or x>3, the real and imaginary parts must each be zero.

Wait, but a is a constant. Let's think about this. For ψ(x)=0, both real and imaginary parts must be zero. But the given wave function is a combination of a real term and an imaginary term. So the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is (-0.5i). So for ψ(x) to be zero, both terms must be zero. But 0.5i is not zero, so the only way the imaginary part is zero is if 0.5=0, which isn't possible. Hmm, that seems confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. The wave function is given, and in the region where the particle exists, it's this expression. But perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, which aligns with the measurement results. So the wave function should be zero outside x=1 and x=3. But according to the given ψ(x), it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So for ψ(x)=0, both terms must be zero.

So set real part to zero and imaginary part to zero.

Imaginary part: -0.5 =0? That can't be. So that suggests that perhaps the wave function is zero outside this interval, meaning that the given expression applies only between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero elsewhere.

Wait, but I have to think about this again. The wave function given is the one within the region x=1 to x=3. So outside, the wave function is zero. But the modulus squared is only non-zero between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. So perhaps the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero otherwise.

But then, how do we find 'a'? Because to normalize the wave function, the integral of |ψ|^2 from x=1 to x=3 should be 1.

So, let's write the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Earlier, I found that |ψ(x)|² is [ (a²)/(1+x) ) + 0.25 ].

Wait, wait. No, because (a/(sqrt(1+x)) ) squared is a²/(1+x), and (0.5i)^2 is (0.25)(-1). So when you compute (a/(sqrt(1+x)) )^2 + (0.5)^2, because (a/(sqrt(...)) - 0.5i)(a/(sqrt(...)) +0.5i) = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, because (i^2 is -1, so the cross terms cancel out with opposite signs).

So |ψ(x)|² is [a²/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ].

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute that integral.

So the integral is ∫₁³ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx.

We can split this into two integrals:

a² ∫₁³ 1/(1+x) dx + 0.25 ∫₁³ dx.

The first integral is a² * ln(1+x) from 1 to 3.

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

Now, compute the first integral:

At x=3: ln(4)
At x=1: ln(2)
So the integral is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5.

And this must equal 1. So:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1 

Subtract 0.5 from both sides: a² ln(2) = 0.5

So, a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213

Take square root: a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the steps. Because I could have made a mistake in the setup.

The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So when x is outside 1 to 3, the wave function is zero. So between 1 and 3, the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

But wait, is that correct? Because the modulus squared of a complex number A + Bi is A² + B². So here, the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), the imaginary part is -0.5. So modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

Yes, that's correct. So the expression is correct.

So the integral setup is correct. So a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² is 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721. So a is sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85, so option B.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), the wave function must be normalized in this interval. The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \(|\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 1
\]

The first integral evaluates to:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

The second integral evaluates to:

\[
0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.

Wait, wait. No, because (a/(sqrt(1+x)) ) squared is a²/(1+x), and (0.5i)^2 is (0.25)(-1). So when you compute (a/(sqrt(1+x)) )^2 + (0.5)^2, because (a/(sqrt(...)) - 0.5i)(a/(sqrt(...)) +0.5i) = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, because (i^2 is -1, so the cross terms cancel out with opposite signs).

So |ψ(x)|² is [a²/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ].

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute that integral.

So the integral is ∫₁³ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx.

We can split this into two integrals:

a² ∫₁³ 1/(1+x) dx + 0.25 ∫₁³ dx.

The first integral is a² * ln(1+x) from 1 to 3.

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

Now, compute the first integral:

At x=3: ln(4)
At x=1: ln(2)
So the integral is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5.

And this must equal 1. So:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1 

Subtract 0.5 from both sides: a² ln(2) = 0.5

So, a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213

Take square root: a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the steps. Because I could have made a mistake in the setup.

The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So when x is outside 1 to 3, the wave function is zero. So between 1 and 3, the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

But wait, is that correct? Because the modulus squared of a complex number A + Bi is A² + B². So here, the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), the imaginary part is -0.5. So modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

Yes, that's correct. So the expression is correct.

So the integral setup is correct. So a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² is 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721. So a is sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85, so option B.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), the wave function must be normalized in this interval. The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \(|\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 1
\]

The first integral evaluates to:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

The second integral evaluates to:

\[
0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.
