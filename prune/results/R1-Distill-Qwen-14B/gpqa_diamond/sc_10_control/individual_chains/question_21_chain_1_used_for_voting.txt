Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. Hmm, I remember that constitutional isomers have different structures but the same molecular formula, like how propane and cyclopropane both have three carbons but different structures. Stereoisomers, on the other hand, have the same structure but different arrangements in space—so they can be either geometric or optical isomers, I think.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is to determine which compound among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism. And part B is to find out between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, tautomerism... right. Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift between different forms by the movement of a hydrogen and the rearrangement of double bonds. For example, in something like keto-enol tautomerism. So, a compound must have a conjugated system that allows this shifting. Let me think about the structures.

Benzoquinone has a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Its structure is like two ketones on the benzene ring. So, it's O=C6H4=O. Now, can it undergo tautomerism? Well, tautomerism usually requires adjacent atoms that can shift, maybe like in a diketone. Wait, benzoquinone is a quinone, which is a type of diketone. Diketones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So benzoquinone probably does exhibit tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is another compound. It's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, all opposite each other—so at positions 1,3,5. So, the structure would be (O=C)2CH2, but arranged in a ring. Hmm, can this undergo tautomerism? Well, tricyclic systems... Wait, for tautomerism, you need conjugation. In the case of a trione, each ketone is on adjacent carbons? No, wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyls are at every other carbon, right? So, they're all separated by CH2 groups. So, each carbonyl is isolated, not conjugated. So there's no conjugated system to allow for a shift. Therefore, this compound probably doesn't undergo tautomerism. So for part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So A is that.

Moving on to part B. The question is about optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning an atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, it can have other forms of asymmetry like a plane of unsymmetry or a center of inversion. But usually, chiral centers are the main thing to look for.

The two compounds are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me draw its structure. It's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. The formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But when it's the ester, the -OH is on the second carbon, so the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to a CH(OH)CH3 group. Wait, no. Let's clarify. The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOH? Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxy on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, because the first carbon is the COOH. So the structure is: COOH-CH(OH)-CH3. Then the ester would be where the -OH is replaced by OMe (OCH3). Wait, no. Wait, methyl ester is when the -OH of the acid is replaced by OMe. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)CH2COOCH3? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the chain is too short. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So when it's an ester, the -OH becomes OMe. So the structure is CH2(O)CH2COOCH3, but wait, that's not possible because the -OH is in the middle. Wait, I'm getting this a bit wrong. Let me try again.

The correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be: The propanoate part is three carbons. The first is COOCH3, then the second is CH(OH), and the third is CH3. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So that's the structure. So the molecule is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (on one side)
- COOCH3 (another group)
- OH (another)
- And what's the fourth group? The other CH group. Wait, wait, the central carbon is CH(OH). So, it's connected to:

Carbon 1: CH3 (from the left)
Carbon 2: COOCH3 (from the right)
Hydrogen (since it's CH(OH)), wait, no, wait, structure: the central carbon is connected to:

- One CH3 (from the left)
- One COOCH3 (from the right)
- One OH
- One H? No, wait, wait. Let me draw it correctly.

The molecule is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (second carbon) has:

- CH3 (left)
- COOCH3 (right)
- OH
- and another CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

Carbons are 1, 2, 3.

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C(OH)

Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, no. Wait, the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   |
CH(OH)CH3?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is like:

The carboxylic acid is at the end, so the ester would be:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3 is the ester group.

The 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of propane. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOH, but as an ester, replacing the -OH with OMe: CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- OH
- and another H? Wait, no, because the central carbon is connected to three carbons? No, wait, in propane, the middle carbon is connected to two CH3 groups? No, in propane, each middle carbon is connected to two other carbons. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: so, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Let me see the groups attached to the central carbon (the one with the OH). 

The central carbon is attached to:

1. CH3 (from the left side)
2. COOCH3 (from the right)
3. OH
4. Another CH3? Wait, no, because the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon has:

- CH3 (left), 
- COOCH3 (right), 
- OH, 
- and the remaining bond is to the adjacent carbon, which is... Wait, perhaps the structure is more accurately:

The central carbon is attached to:

- a methyl group (from the left, CH3-),
- a hydroxyl group (OH),
- a carbonyl group (from the right, COOCH3),
- and another CH2 group? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- a CH3 group (from the left),
- a COOCH3 group (from the right),
- an OH group,
- and another CH3 group (because it's CH(CH3)OH)? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- COOCH3 (right),
- OH,
- and another CH3? No, that can't be because that would make four different groups. Wait, if the central carbon is attached to CH3 (left), COOCH3 (right), OH, and another CH3, then the groups are CH3, CH3, COOCH3, and OH. So two CH3 groups. So the groups are not all different. That would mean it's not a chiral center.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the central carbon has two CH3 groups, then it's attached to two identical groups (CH3), so the groups wouldn't all be different. Thus, it can't be a chiral center. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. If the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 (from left),
- COOCH3 (from right),
- OH,
- and another CH3 (the same as left). So two CH3 groups. Therefore, the groups are CH3, CH3, COOCH3, and OH. So two groups are the same, so it's not a chiral center. So no optical isomerism here.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, with the structure HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is actually HO2C-CHCH2-COOH, but perhaps it's HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, wait. No, fumaric acid is a substituted maleic acid. Wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's succinic acid. Wait, no, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. Maleic acid is cis-butenedioic acid: HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. No, wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but in the cis configuration. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So, dimethyl fumarate would be the di-ester, so each -OH in the acid becomes OMe. So the structure is MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me? No, wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2CH2-COOH? No, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of fumaric acid as HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but the double bond is between the two middle carbons, and the substituents are trans. So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me? No, wait, no. Because fumaric acid has a double bond, so the structure is CH2=CH group. So dimethyl fumarate would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Dimethyl fumarate's structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3. Wait, but that would be succinic acid dimethyl ester. No, wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So, the structure should have a double bond. So, dimethyl fumarate is MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me with a double bond? No, wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, so when both -OH groups are replaced with OMe, it becomes MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. So the structure has a double bond between the two middle carbons.

Now, can this compound have stereoisomerism? Well, if the molecule has a double bond with two different substituents on each carbon, it can have geometric (cis-trans) isomerism. But optical isomerism comes from chiral centers, not geometric isomerism. Wait, but wait, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with two ester groups on each end. So the structure is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. Each carbon in the double bond has two substituents: on each CH, we have MeO2C and CO2Me groups. Wait, but each CH in the double bond is connected to two identical groups? No, wait, each end has a methyl ester group. Hmm, no, wait: each carbon in the double bond is connected to two different groups. Let me think. Each CH in the double bond has:

For the left CH:

- One MeO2C group (the ester from the left),
- One CH (from the double bond),
- And two substituents: wait, no, the carbon is bonded to two identical groups? No, each carbon is bonded to two different substituents. Because each CH is attached to the ester group (MeO2C) and to the other CH in the double bond. Wait, but that's not correct. Each CH is bonded to a carbonyl O and a CH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 - CH2-CH2 - C(O)OCH3
        ||
        (double bond)

Wait, no. I think I'm getting stuck on the exact structure. Let me think again. The dimethyl ester of fumaric acid is MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so the structure is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, with the substituents (MeO2C and CO2Me) on opposite sides of the double bond.

But in terms of optical isomerism, we're looking for a chiral center. Does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let's think: each end of the double bond is attached to a MeO2C and a CO2Me group. So each carbon in the double bond is connected to two identical groups? Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to:

- MeO2C group,
- CO2Me group,
- and two CH groups (from the double bond). Wait, that can't be right. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to:

- MeO2C (on one side),
- CO2Me (on the other),
- and the two bonds from the double bond (each to CH).

Wait, no. Wait, each carbon in the double bond (CH) is connected to:

- MeO2C,
- CO2Me,
- and two hydrogen atoms? No, no, because in the structure, each CH is connected to two other carbons in the double bond. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is connected to two identical substituents. Let me think. If the structure is MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me, that's succinic acid dimethyl ester, which doesn't have any double bonds. But for fumarate, it's MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, so each CH is connected to MeO2C and CO2Me, plus the double bond. So each CH has:

- MeO2C,
- CO2Me,
- and two CH2 groups. No, wait, no. Each CH is connected to:

- MeO2C,
- CO2Me,
- and two single bonds to the adjacent carbons (with double bond between them). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe each CH is bonded to MeO2C, CO2Me, and two H's? No, because in fumarate, the structure is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. Each CH has:

- MeO2C,
- CO2Me,
- and two H's.

Wait, no. Each CH is connected to MeO2C and CO2Me, but that's only two groups. Wait, each carbon in the double bond (CH) is bonded to three groups: MeO2C, CO2Me, and two other CH groups via the double bond. Wait, no, each CH is bonded to MeO2C, CO2Me, and two other CH groups. Hmm, I'm getting this wrong. Let me try drawing the structure.

The structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that's for the succinate. Fumarate would have a double bond between the two middle carbons. So O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3.

In this case, each CH in the double bond has the following substituents:

Each CH is connected to:

- One O=C(OCH3) group,
- One C(O)OCH3 group,
- And two H's.

Wait, no. Wait, each CH is part of the double bond, so they have two substituents. Each CH is connected to:

- O=C(OCH3) on one side,
- C(O)OCH3 on the other side,
- And two H's.

Wait, but that would mean each CH is bonded to two identical groups (O=C(OCH3) and C(O)OCH3 are different, though). Wait, no, O=C(OCH3) is the same as C(O)OCH3, right? Because they're both ester groups. No, wait, no. O=C(OCH3) is the methyl ester, and the same on the other end. So each CH is bonded to two identical groups (each O=C(OCH3)), which might mean that each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical substituents. But wait, each CH is bonded to two different substituents: one from each end.

Wait, maybe each CH is bonded to:

- One O=C(OCH3),
- One C(O)OCH3,
- And two H's.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is better represented as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But that's for succinic acid dimethyl ester, which doesn't have a double bond. Fumarate has a double bond, so it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's still not right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possibility of chiral centers. Dimethyl fumarate has a structure with a double bond between two CH2 groups, but wait, no. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid, so the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO2Me, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, each CH in the double bond is attached to:

- One O=C(OCH3),
- One C(O)OCH3,
- And two H's.

So each CH has two different groups (the two ester groups) and two H's. So each CH is attached to two identical groups (the ester groups are same on each side), but wait, no. O=C(OCH3) and C(O)OCH3 are the same groups, right? Because they're both methyl esters attached to carbonyls. So each CH is attached to two identical ester groups and two H's. So in that case, each CH is CH2, not CH. Hmm, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH is connected to two different groups. Let me think: each carbon in the double bond (CH) is connected to:

- O=C(OCH3) on one side,
- C(O)OCH3 on the other side,
- and two H's.

Wait, but O=C(OCH3) is the same as C(O)OCH3. So each CH has two identical groups and two H's. So each CH is actually a CH2 group because it has two H's attached. Wait, that can't be because that would make the double bond between two CH2 groups, which would make it a single bond. Hmm, I'm stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH3)–CH2–CH2–C(O)OCH3, which is succinate, but that's a single bond. Fumarate would have a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it O=C(OCH3)–CH2–CH2–C(O)OCH3 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. But then each CH2 would be CH2, which isn't a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about optical isomerism. For a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center. So I need to check which of the two compounds has a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: as I thought earlier, the central carbon is attached to two CH3 groups, so it's not a chiral center. So no optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate: does it have any chiral centers? No, because each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups (each ester group) and two H's. So each of those is a CH2 group, not a chiral center. So wait, neither of the compounds has a chiral center? That can't be right because the question says one of them does.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon has:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH3 (from the left side). So two CH3 groups. So not a chiral center.

Dimethyl fumarate: perhaps its structure is such that one of the carbons is a stereocenter. Wait, no, because the double bond would make it a cis or trans arrangement. But for a chiral center, you need four different groups attached to a carbon.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of dimethyl fumarate. If the structure is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, then each CH is attached to two different groups: MeO2C and CO2Me, plus two H's. So each CH has two different groups (MeO2C and CO2Me are different because one is on the left and the other on the right). Wait, no, because MeO2C and CO2Me are the same groups. They're both ester groups. So each CH has two identical groups and two H's. So each CH is CH2, not a chiral center.

Hmm, this is confusing. So neither of the compounds has a chiral center, meaning neither exhibits optical isomerism. But that's not possible because the question says one does. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me re-examine its structure.

If the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon is:

- Connected to CH3 (left),
- COOCH3 (right),
- OH,
- and another H. Wait, no, because the central carbon is CH(OH), so it's attached to:

- CH3 (left),
- COOCH3 (right),
- OH,
- and H. So the four groups are CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. All four are different. So that's a chiral center. Oh! So I was wrong earlier. So the central carbon is a chiral center because all four substituents are different. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus can show optical isomerism.

Wait, but in that case, the answer would be that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. So in part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the central carbon wasn't a chiral center because I thought it was attached to two CH3 groups, but perhaps I was wrong. Let me re-express the structure.

The structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the one in the middle, attached to:

- CH3 (left),
- COOCH3 (right),
- OH,
- and H. Because the central carbon is CH(OH). So it's connected to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Therefore, it is a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, is the H attached to the central carbon? Because the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, that's CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- COOCH3 (right),
- OH,
- and H. Because the central carbon is CH(OH), which means it has a hydrogen attached.

So yes, four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So that's a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has optical isomerism.

Then, dimethyl fumarate: does it have a chiral center? Let's see. Its structure is as an ester of fumaric acid, which has a double bond. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO2Me. Each CH in the double bond is connected to:

- O=C(OCH3),
- CO2Me,
- and two H's.

Wait, but each CH has two H's attached. So each CH is connected to:

- O=C(OCH3),
- CO2Me,
- H,
- H.

So two H's are attached, so each CH is a CH2 group. Thus, no chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate.

So putting it all together:

Part A: the compound that does not show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Part B: the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option B says A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. But A should be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, so option B is incorrect.

Option A says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That would make sense.

Wait, no, option A says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the correct option is A, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

So part A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (so A is that) and part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (so B is that). So option A matches.

Wait, but earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center, so part B is that, which is option A.

To solve the question, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the given information:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift between different forms by the movement of a hydrogen atom and the rearrangement of double bonds. This typically requires a conjugated system.

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has a benzene ring with two ketone groups. It is a conjugated system, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone **does** show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The ketone groups are isolated, with no conjugation between them. Since there is no conjugated system, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does not** show tautomerism.

Thus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to:
   - CH3 (left),
   - COOCH3 (right),
   - OH,
   - H.
   All four groups are different, making this carbon a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **shows optical isomerism**.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical ester groups (MeO2C and CO2Me) and two hydrogens. Since no carbon is bonded to four different groups, there are no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **does not** show optical isomerism.

Thus, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
From the analysis:
- **A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

The correct option is **A**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. Hmm, I remember that constitutional isomers have different structures but the same molecular formula, like how propane and cyclopropane both have three carbons but different structures. Stereoisomers, on the other hand, have the same structure but different arrangements in space—so they can be either geometric or optical isomers, I think.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is to determine which compound among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism. And part B is to find out between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, tautomerism... right. Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift between different forms by the movement of a hydrogen and the rearrangement of double bonds. For example, in something like keto-enol tautomerism. So, a compound must have a conjugated system that allows this shifting. Let me think about the structures.

Benzoquinone has a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Its structure is like two ketones on the benzene ring. So, it's O=C6H4=O. Now, can it undergo tautomerism? Well, tautomerism usually requires adjacent atoms that can shift, maybe like in a diketone. Wait, benzoquinone is a quinone, which is a type of diketone. Diketones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So benzoquinone probably does exhibit tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is another compound. It's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, all opposite each other—so at positions 1,3,5. So, the structure would be (O=C)2CH2, but arranged in a ring. Hmm, can this undergo tautomerism? Well, tricyclic systems... Wait, for tautomerism, you need conjugation. In the case of a trione, each ketone is on adjacent carbons? No, wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyls are at every other carbon, right? So, they're all separated by CH2 groups. So, each carbonyl is isolated, not conjugated. So there's no conjugated system to allow for a shift. Therefore, this compound probably doesn't undergo tautomerism. So for part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So A is that.

Moving on to part B. The question is about optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning an atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, it can have other forms of asymmetry like a plane of unsymmetry or a center of inversion. But usually, chiral centers are the main thing to look for.

The two compounds are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me draw its structure. It's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. The formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But when it's the ester, the -OH is on the second carbon, so the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to a CH(OH)CH3 group. Wait, no. Let's clarify. The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOH? Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxy on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, because the first carbon is the COOH. So the structure is: COOH-CH(OH)-CH3. Then the ester would be where the -OH is replaced by OMe (OCH3). Wait, no. Wait, methyl ester is when the -OH of the acid is replaced by OMe. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)CH2COOCH3? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the chain is too short. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So when it's an ester, the -OH becomes OMe. So the structure is CH2(O)CH2COOCH3, but wait, that's not possible because the -OH is in the middle. Wait, I'm getting this a bit wrong. Let me try again.

The correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be: The propanoate part is three carbons. The first is COOCH3, then the second is CH(OH), and the third is CH3. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So that's the structure. So the molecule is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (on one side)
- COOCH3 (another group)
- OH (another)
- And what's the fourth group? The other CH group. Wait, wait, the central carbon is CH(OH). So, it's connected to:

Carbon 1: CH3 (from the left)
Carbon 2: COOCH3 (from the right)
Hydrogen (since it's CH(OH)), wait, no, wait, structure: the central carbon is connected to:

- One CH3 (from the left)
- One COOCH3 (from the right)
- One OH
- One H? No, wait, wait. Let me draw it correctly.

The molecule is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (second carbon) has:

- CH3 (left)
- COOCH3 (right)
- OH
- and another CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

Carbons are 1, 2, 3.

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C(OH)

Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, no. Wait, the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   |
CH(OH)CH3?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is like:

The carboxylic acid is at the end, so the ester would be:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3 is the ester group.

The 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of propane. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOH, but as an ester, replacing the -OH with OMe: CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- OH
- and another H? Wait, no, because the central carbon is connected to three carbons? No, wait, in propane, the middle carbon is connected to two CH3 groups? No, in propane, each middle carbon is connected to two other carbons. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: so, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Let me see the groups attached to the central carbon (the one with the OH). 

The central carbon is attached to:

1. CH3 (from the left side)
2. COOCH3 (from the right)
3. OH
4. Another CH3? Wait, no, because the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon has:

- CH3 (left), 
- COOCH3 (right), 
- OH, 
- and the remaining bond is to the adjacent carbon, which is... Wait, perhaps the structure is more accurately:

The central carbon is attached to:

- a methyl group (from the left, CH3-),
- a hydroxyl group (OH),
- a carbonyl group (from the right, COOCH3),
- and another CH2 group? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- a CH3 group (from the left),
- a COOCH3 group (from the right),
- an OH group,
- and another CH3 group (because it's CH(CH3)OH)? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- COOCH3 (right),
- OH,
- and another CH3? No, that can't be because that would make four different groups. Wait, if the central carbon is attached to CH3 (left), COOCH3 (right), OH, and another CH3, then the groups are CH3, CH3, COOCH3, and OH. So two CH3 groups. So the groups are not all different. That would mean it's not a chiral center.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the central carbon has two CH3 groups, then it's attached to two identical groups (CH3), so the groups wouldn't all be different. Thus, it can't be a chiral center. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. If the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 (from left),
- COOCH3 (from right),
- OH,
- and another CH3 (the same as left). So two CH3 groups. Therefore, the groups are CH3, CH3, COOCH3, and OH. So two groups are the same, so it's not a chiral center. So no optical isomerism here.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, with the structure HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is actually HO2C-CHCH2-COOH, but perhaps it's HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, wait. No, fumaric acid is a substituted maleic acid. Wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's succinic acid. Wait, no, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. Maleic acid is cis-butenedioic acid: HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. No, wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but in the cis configuration. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So, dimethyl fumarate would be the di-ester, so each -OH in the acid becomes OMe. So the structure is MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me? No, wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2CH2-COOH? No, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of fumaric acid as HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but the double bond is between the two middle carbons, and the substituents are trans. So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me? No, wait, no. Because fumaric acid has a double bond, so the structure is CH2=CH group. So dimethyl fumarate would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Dimethyl fumarate's structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3. Wait, but that would be succinic acid dimethyl ester. No, wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So, the structure should have a double bond. So, dimethyl fumarate is MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me with a double bond? No, wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, so when both -OH groups are replaced with OMe, it becomes MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. So the structure has a double bond between the two middle carbons.

Now, can this compound have stereoisomerism? Well, if the molecule has a double bond with two different substituents on each carbon, it can have geometric (cis-trans) isomerism. But optical isomerism comes from chiral centers, not geometric isomerism. Wait, but wait, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with two ester groups on each end. So the structure is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. Each carbon in the double bond has two substituents: on each CH, we have MeO2C and CO2Me groups. Wait, but each CH in the double bond is connected to two identical groups? No, wait, each end has a methyl ester group. Hmm, no, wait: each carbon in the double bond is connected to two different groups. Let me think. Each CH in the double bond has:

For the left CH:

- One MeO2C group (the ester from the left),
- One CH (from the double bond),
- And two substituents: wait, no, the carbon is bonded to two identical groups? No, each carbon is bonded to two different substituents. Because each CH is attached to the ester group (MeO2C) and to the other CH in the double bond. Wait, but that's not correct. Each CH is bonded to a carbonyl O and a CH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 - CH2-CH2 - C(O)OCH3
        ||
        (double bond)

Wait, no. I think I'm getting stuck on the exact structure. Let me think again. The dimethyl ester of fumaric acid is MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so the structure is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, with the substituents (MeO2C and CO2Me) on opposite sides of the double bond.

But in terms of optical isomerism, we're looking for a chiral center. Does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let's think: each end of the double bond is attached to a MeO2C and a CO2Me group. So each carbon in the double bond is connected to two identical groups? Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to:

- MeO2C group,
- CO2Me group,
- and two CH groups (from the double bond). Wait, that can't be right. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to:

- MeO2C (on one side),
- CO2Me (on the other),
- and the two bonds from the double bond (each to CH).

Wait, no. Wait, each carbon in the double bond (CH) is connected to:

- MeO2C,
- CO2Me,
- and two hydrogen atoms? No, no, because in the structure, each CH is connected to two other carbons in the double bond. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is connected to two identical substituents. Let me think. If the structure is MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me, that's succinic acid dimethyl ester, which doesn't have any double bonds. But for fumarate, it's MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, so each CH is connected to MeO2C and CO2Me, plus the double bond. So each CH has:

- MeO2C,
- CO2Me,
- and two CH2 groups. No, wait, no. Each CH is connected to:

- MeO2C,
- CO2Me,
- and two single bonds to the adjacent carbons (with double bond between them). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe each CH is bonded to MeO2C, CO2Me, and two H's? No, because in fumarate, the structure is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. Each CH has:

- MeO2C,
- CO2Me,
- and two H's.

Wait, no. Each CH is connected to MeO2C and CO2Me, but that's only two groups. Wait, each carbon in the double bond (CH) is bonded to three groups: MeO2C, CO2Me, and two other CH groups via the double bond. Wait, no, each CH is bonded to MeO2C, CO2Me, and two other CH groups. Hmm, I'm getting this wrong. Let me try drawing the structure.

The structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that's for the succinate. Fumarate would have a double bond between the two middle carbons. So O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3.

In this case, each CH in the double bond has the following substituents:

Each CH is connected to:

- One O=C(OCH3) group,
- One C(O)OCH3 group,
- And two H's.

Wait, no. Wait, each CH is part of the double bond, so they have two substituents. Each CH is connected to:

- O=C(OCH3) on one side,
- C(O)OCH3 on the other side,
- And two H's.

Wait, but that would mean each CH is bonded to two identical groups (O=C(OCH3) and C(O)OCH3 are different, though). Wait, no, O=C(OCH3) is the same as C(O)OCH3, right? Because they're both ester groups. No, wait, no. O=C(OCH3) is the methyl ester, and the same on the other end. So each CH is bonded to two identical groups (each O=C(OCH3)), which might mean that each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical substituents. But wait, each CH is bonded to two different substituents: one from each end.

Wait, maybe each CH is bonded to:

- One O=C(OCH3),
- One C(O)OCH3,
- And two H's.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is better represented as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But that's for succinic acid dimethyl ester, which doesn't have a double bond. Fumarate has a double bond, so it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's still not right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possibility of chiral centers. Dimethyl fumarate has a structure with a double bond between two CH2 groups, but wait, no. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid, so the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO2Me, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, each CH in the double bond is attached to:

- One O=C(OCH3),
- One C(O)OCH3,
- And two H's.

So each CH has two different groups (the two ester groups) and two H's. So each CH is attached to two identical groups (the ester groups are same on each side), but wait, no. O=C(OCH3) and C(O)OCH3 are the same groups, right? Because they're both methyl esters attached to carbonyls. So each CH is attached to two identical ester groups and two H's. So in that case, each CH is CH2, not CH. Hmm, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH is connected to two different groups. Let me think: each carbon in the double bond (CH) is connected to:

- O=C(OCH3) on one side,
- C(O)OCH3 on the other side,
- and two H's.

Wait, but O=C(OCH3) is the same as C(O)OCH3. So each CH has two identical groups and two H's. So each CH is actually a CH2 group because it has two H's attached. Wait, that can't be because that would make the double bond between two CH2 groups, which would make it a single bond. Hmm, I'm stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH3)–CH2–CH2–C(O)OCH3, which is succinate, but that's a single bond. Fumarate would have a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it O=C(OCH3)–CH2–CH2–C(O)OCH3 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. But then each CH2 would be CH2, which isn't a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about optical isomerism. For a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center. So I need to check which of the two compounds has a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: as I thought earlier, the central carbon is attached to two CH3 groups, so it's not a chiral center. So no optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate: does it have any chiral centers? No, because each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups (each ester group) and two H's. So each of those is a CH2 group, not a chiral center. So wait, neither of the compounds has a chiral center? That can't be right because the question says one of them does.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon has:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH3 (from the left side). So two CH3 groups. So not a chiral center.

Dimethyl fumarate: perhaps its structure is such that one of the carbons is a stereocenter. Wait, no, because the double bond would make it a cis or trans arrangement. But for a chiral center, you need four different groups attached to a carbon.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of dimethyl fumarate. If the structure is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, then each CH is attached to two different groups: MeO2C and CO2Me, plus two H's. So each CH has two different groups (MeO2C and CO2Me are different because one is on the left and the other on the right). Wait, no, because MeO2C and CO2Me are the same groups. They're both ester groups. So each CH has two identical groups and two H's. So each CH is CH2, not a chiral center.

Hmm, this is confusing. So neither of the compounds has a chiral center, meaning neither exhibits optical isomerism. But that's not possible because the question says one does. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me re-examine its structure.

If the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon is:

- Connected to CH3 (left),
- COOCH3 (right),
- OH,
- and another H. Wait, no, because the central carbon is CH(OH), so it's attached to:

- CH3 (left),
- COOCH3 (right),
- OH,
- and H. So the four groups are CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. All four are different. So that's a chiral center. Oh! So I was wrong earlier. So the central carbon is a chiral center because all four substituents are different. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus can show optical isomerism.

Wait, but in that case, the answer would be that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. So in part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the central carbon wasn't a chiral center because I thought it was attached to two CH3 groups, but perhaps I was wrong. Let me re-express the structure.

The structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the one in the middle, attached to:

- CH3 (left),
- COOCH3 (right),
- OH,
- and H. Because the central carbon is CH(OH). So it's connected to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Therefore, it is a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, is the H attached to the central carbon? Because the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, that's CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- COOCH3 (right),
- OH,
- and H. Because the central carbon is CH(OH), which means it has a hydrogen attached.

So yes, four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So that's a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has optical isomerism.

Then, dimethyl fumarate: does it have a chiral center? Let's see. Its structure is as an ester of fumaric acid, which has a double bond. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO2Me. Each CH in the double bond is connected to:

- O=C(OCH3),
- CO2Me,
- and two H's.

Wait, but each CH has two H's attached. So each CH is connected to:

- O=C(OCH3),
- CO2Me,
- H,
- H.

So two H's are attached, so each CH is a CH2 group. Thus, no chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate.

So putting it all together:

Part A: the compound that does not show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Part B: the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option B says A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. But A should be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, so option B is incorrect.

Option A says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That would make sense.

Wait, no, option A says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the correct option is A, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

So part A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (so A is that) and part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (so B is that). So option A matches.

Wait, but earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center, so part B is that, which is option A.


To solve the question, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the given information:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift between different forms by the movement of a hydrogen atom and the rearrangement of double bonds. This typically requires a conjugated system.

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has a benzene ring with two ketone groups. It is a conjugated system, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone **does** show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The ketone groups are isolated, with no conjugation between them. Since there is no conjugated system, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does not** show tautomerism.

Thus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to:
   - CH3 (left),
   - COOCH3 (right),
   - OH,
   - H.
   All four groups are different, making this carbon a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **shows optical isomerism**.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical ester groups (MeO2C and CO2Me) and two hydrogens. Since no carbon is bonded to four different groups, there are no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate **does not** show optical isomerism.

Thus, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
From the analysis:
- **A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

The correct option is **A**.

ANSWER: A
