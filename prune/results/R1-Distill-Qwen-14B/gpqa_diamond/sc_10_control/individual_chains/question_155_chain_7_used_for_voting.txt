Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I remember that to find the uncertainty of an operator, I need to compute the expectation values of the operator and its square. The uncertainty is the square root of the expectation of the square minus the square of the expectation.

The problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Wait, but wait, since these are eigenvectors of P_z, that must mean the basis is aligned with P_z's eigenstates. So the state is expressed in the P_z basis.

The question is asking for the uncertainty ΔP_z. So I need to calculate <P_z> and <P_z²>, then take the square root of <P_z²> - <P_z>².

Let me write down the matrix for P_z. It's a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ on the diagonal. So, P_z = [[ħ, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -ħ]]. 

The state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Wait, wait, no, wait. Oh no, wait, wait. Wait, the vector they gave is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me check that. But wait, wait—wait a second, wait. Because if the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z, then each basis vector is an eigenstate of P_z. So our state is already expressed in that basis.

So to compute <P_z>, I can just take the expectation value. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is the sum of each component multiplied by their respective eigenvalues and the square of their amplitudes.

Wait, because for a diagonal matrix, the expectation value is the sum of |c_i|^2 * λ_i, where c_i are the components of the state vector and λ_i are the eigenvalues on the diagonal.

So looking at ψ: the components are a = -1/2, b=1/√2, c = -1/2.

So |a|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly, |c|² is also 1/4. The middle component is |b|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

So <P_z> = |a|² * (ħ) + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * (-ħ) 

Which is (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 ħ) - (1/4 ħ) = 0. Oh, that's convenient.

Now for <P_z²>, since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just the square of each diagonal element. So the diagonal elements of P_z² are (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2, which are ħ², 0, ħ². 

So <P_z²> is |a|² * (ħ)^2 + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * (ħ)^2.

Which is (1/4)(ħ²) + 0 + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). Since <P_z> is 0, this simplifies to sqrt( <P_z²> ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2). 

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B. 

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the state vector components. The state is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me compute the sum of the squares to check if it's normalized.

So (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2? Wait, no, 1/4 + 1/2 is 3/4, plus another 1/4 makes 1. Oh, right, because 1/4 + 1/2 is 3/4, plus 1/4 is 1. So yes, the state is normalized. 

So everything looks correct. Therefore, the uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The matrix of $P_z$ is diagonal in the given basis, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ on the diagonal. The state of the system is given as the column vector $\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $a = -1/2$, $b = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c = -1/2$. The probabilities are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$ on the diagonal. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I remember that to find the uncertainty of an operator, I need to compute the expectation values of the operator and its square. The uncertainty is the square root of the expectation of the square minus the square of the expectation.

So looking at ψ: the components are a = -1/2, b=1/√2, c = -1/2.

So |a|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly, |c|² is also 1/4. The middle component is |b|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

So <P_z> = |a|² * (ħ) + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * (-ħ) 

Which is (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 ħ) - (1/4 ħ) = 0. Oh, that's convenient.

Now for <P_z²>, since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just the square of each diagonal element. So the diagonal elements of P_z² are (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2, which are ħ², 0, ħ². 

So <P_z²> is |a|² * (ħ)^2 + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * (ħ)^2.

Which is (1/4)(ħ²) + 0 + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). Since <P_z> is 0, this simplifies to sqrt( <P_z²> ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2). 

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B. 

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the state vector components. The state is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me compute the sum of the squares to check if it's normalized.

So (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2? Wait, no, 1/4 + 1/2 is 3/4, plus another 1/4 makes 1. Oh, right, because 1/4 + 1/2 is 3/4, plus 1/4 is 1. So yes, the state is normalized. 

So everything looks correct. Therefore, the uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The matrix of $P_z$ is diagonal in the given basis, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ on the diagonal. The state of the system is given as the column vector $\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $a = -1/2$, $b = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c = -1/2$. The probabilities are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$ on the diagonal. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
