Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or perhaps, since each state has its own uncertainty, the difference must be bigger than each individual uncertainty? Not sure.

Wait, let me think. When you have two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the uncertainty in their energies is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ/τ2. To resolve them, the energy difference |E2 - E1| should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the peaks might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So ΔE_diff = |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach is that the energy resolution required is ΔE_res ≈ ħ/(Δt), where Δt is the time over which the measurement is made. But since the states have different lifetimes, perhaps the measurement time is related to the shorter lifetime? Or maybe it's the longer one? Hmm, not sure.

Let me think about the given data. The lifetimes are τ1 = 1e-9 sec, τ2 = 1e-8 sec. So τ2 is longer than τ1. So the energy uncertainty for E1 is ħ/τ1, which is larger than ħ/τ2 because τ1 is smaller.

Wait, but let's compute the uncertainties. Let's calculate ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Compute ΔE1 = ħ / τ1.

But what's the value of ħ in eV·s? I remember that 1 eV is 1.6e-19 joules, and ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So let's convert ħ to eV·s.

1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 1 J = 1/(1.6e-19) eV. So ħ in eV·s is (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * (1 eV / 1.6e-19 J) ) = 1.0545718e-34 / 1.6e-19 = approx 6.59e-16 eV·s.

So ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = 6.59e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.59e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = 6.59e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.59e-8 eV.

Wait, that's 6.59e-7 eV for ΔE1 and 6.59e-8 eV for ΔE2.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the difference between E1 and E2. So to distinguish them, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is less than the sum, then their uncertainties might overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

So ΔE_diff must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Adding the two uncertainties:

ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 6.59e-7 + 6.59e-8 ≈ 7.25e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than ~7.25e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is way smaller than 7e-7. So not enough.

B) 1e-11 eV → Even smaller, worse.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 which is 1e4 times larger than 7e-7. So yes, this would be much larger than the required sum. So this would suffice.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is about 14 times smaller than 7e-7 eV. So not enough.

Wait, wait, but wait. Another thought: When you have two states, each with their own energy uncertainty, the minimal detectable difference in energy is on the order of the sum of the uncertainties. So, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties.

So the options are:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than 7e-7 eV. So that would work.

Other options are too small.

Wait, but the problem says "could be their energy difference" so that they can be clearly resolved. So the correct answer is option C.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty of each state individually. Because if the energy difference is larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then it would be distinguishable. So in that case, the energy difference must be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. Because if it's larger than the larger uncertainty, it's automatically larger than the smaller.

Wait, the larger uncertainty is ΔE1 = 6.59e-7 eV. So any energy difference larger than that would work.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times larger than 6.59e-7 eV. So it's way bigger. So it will be distinguishable.

But another point: sometimes the criteria is just that the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty of the measurement. For example, the energy resolution. If you have a measurement of ΔE, then the energy difference between two levels must be larger than ΔE to resolve them.

In this case, perhaps the measurement has an uncertainty that's determined by the lifetime of the states. So which lifetime determines the measurement's uncertainty?

Wait, maybe the measurement is done on each state, and the energy resolution is determined by the shorter lifetime because the shorter the lifetime, the larger the uncertainty (since ΔE = ħ/τ). So if one state has a shorter lifetime, its uncertainty is larger. So the measurement's energy resolution is determined by the state with the larger uncertainty.

Wait, but when you have two states, each with their own lifetimes, perhaps the combined effect is that the minimal detectable difference is the sum of the two uncertainties. Or perhaps it's the maximum of the two.

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The energy resolution required is the minimal energy difference that can be distinguished. To resolve two energy levels, the separation must exceed the combined uncertainties. Because if the separation is less than the sum, the two states' energy ranges might overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

So, the required minimal energy difference is ΔE_diff > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

As calculated earlier, ΔE1 is about 6.59e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.59e-8 eV. Sum is approximately 7.25e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than this sum. So looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 7.25e-7 eV is 0.000000725 eV. So 1e-4 is much larger, so it's acceptable.

Other options are all smaller than that sum, so they won't suffice.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar
\]

Here, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \Delta E \) is the corresponding energy uncertainty. For the two states, the lifetimes are \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The energy uncertainties are calculated as:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), we compute:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.59 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.59 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{6.59 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{diff}} = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

Adding the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.59 \times 10^{-7} + 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, \( \Delta E_{\text{diff}} \) must be larger than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is much smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it is also insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the requirement is **C**.

So ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = 6.59e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.59e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = 6.59e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.59e-8 eV.

Wait, that's 6.59e-7 eV for ΔE1 and 6.59e-8 eV for ΔE2.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the difference between E1 and E2. So to distinguish them, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is less than the sum, then their uncertainties might overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

So ΔE_diff must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Adding the two uncertainties:

ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 6.59e-7 + 6.59e-8 ≈ 7.25e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than ~7.25e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is way smaller than 7e-7. So not enough.

\[

\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), we compute:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.59 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.59 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{6.59 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{diff}} = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2

Adding the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.59 \times 10^{-7} + 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}

- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the requirement is **C**.
