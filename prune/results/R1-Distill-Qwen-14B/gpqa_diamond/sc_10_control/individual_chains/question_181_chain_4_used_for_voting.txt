Okay, I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio question. So, the setup is that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, and I need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A through D, with various ratios.

First, I need to remember what the pp-III branch is. I think the proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. The pp-I, II, and III branches are different steps in this process. PP-III involves reactions that produce beryllium-7, which then captures protons to form lithium-7 and then helium-4.

Wait, so if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the other branches? Well, the pp-I and pp-II branches might continue because they don't depend on pp-III. But without pp-III, maybe the production of certain neutrinos is affected.

Solar neutrinos are mainly from two processes: the proton-proton (pp) chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. The pp chain contributes more to the lower energy neutrinos, and the CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos. But wait, I think the main neutrinos from the pp chain come from the decay of beryllium-7, which is part of the pp-III branch.

So if pp-III stops, the production of those neutrinos would stop. The pp-I and pp-II would continue, but maybe their neutrino production is different. Let me think about the neutrino types. The pp chain produces electron neutrinos (ν_e), whereas the CNO cycle also produces ν_e, but possibly at different energies.

The neutrino energies from the pp chain are lower, around a few hundred keV, while the CNO neutrinos are higher, maybe a couple MeV. So if pp-III stops, the contribution from the pp chain would decrease, but the CNO neutrinos would still be there.

Wait, the question is about the flux in two specific bands: 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. So these are higher energy bands, perhaps in the range where the CNO neutrinos are more significant.

But if the pp-III branch stopped, the neutrino production from that part would suddenly drop. So, for the neutrinos from pp-III, their flux would decrease. But what about the overall neutrino flux in these bands?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-I and II branches still produce some neutrinos in these energy ranges. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the pp-III branch leads to the most significant neutrino emission from the Sun. Because the main process in pp-III is the reaction where Be-7 captures a proton to form Li-7, which then decays into He-4 and emits a neutrino. So the pp-III process produces a lot of neutrinos.

If pp-III stops, then the flux of ν_e from that process would drop. But since the question is about the ratio of two bands, I need to find how this affects each band.

If the pp-III is responsible for a significant fraction of the neutrinos in higher energy bands (like 700-800 and 800-900 keV), then stopping it would reduce the flux in those bands.

Wait, but neutrinos from the CNO cycle are higher energy than the pp chain, so maybe the 700-800 keV band is still getting some neutrinos from the pp chain, while the 800-900 keV is more CNO.

Alternatively, maybe the pp neutrinos are lower energy, so the 700-800 keV band is the higher end of the pp neutrinos, and the 800-900 is lower end of CNO.

Wait, the typical neutrino energies from the pp chain are around 250-600 keV, I think. So bands above that are more CNO. So if pp-III stops, the flux in the 700-800 keV band would decrease because that's where the pp neutrinos are peaking, but the 800-900 keV would be more from CNO, which isn't affected by stopping pp-III.

Wait, but if the main pp neutrinos are up to about 600 keV, then the 700-800 range would have contributions from both pp and CNO, but perhaps less from pp. So if pp-III stops, the 700-800 keV band would lose a lot of flux, but the 800-900 would lose less because it's more CNO.

So without the pp-III, the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) would drop more than band 2 (800-900 keV), leading to a lower ratio of (flux 1)/(flux 2).

Wait, but how much? Since the pp-III is a major source of neutrinos, the 700-800 band might have been mostly pp. If pp stops, that band's flux drops a lot, while the 800-900 remains roughly the same.

So the ratio F1/F2 would be (something small)/(something similar to before), which would be small. The options are A)10, B)0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

If F1 is reduced and F2 is less affected, then F1/F2 would be less than 1. For example, if F1 drops to 10% of its original, and F2 remains roughly the same, the ratio would be 0.1, which is D.

Wait, but wait: I thought that the pp chain's neutrinos are mostly below ~600 keV, but in reality, maybe there's some overlap. Are the pp neutrinos in the 700 keV range? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is the main source for the 700-800 keV neutrinos, and the CNO is the main source for 800-900. So if pp-III stops, band 1's flux would drop more than band 2.

So, let's say before the stoppage, F1 was dominated by pp-III, say F1 was 100, and F2 had some pp and a lot of CNO, maybe 30 (e.g., 10 from pp and 20 from CNO). After pp-III stops, F1 drops to 0 (if all pp-III contribution is gone), and F2 drops to 20 (because the pp contribution was 10, but the CNO remains the same? Or does CNO continue?)

Wait, no. The CNO cycle is a separate process. So if pp-III stops, the CNO neutrinos are still produced as before. So the F2 (800-900 keV) is mainly from CNO, which isn't affected. Whereas F1 (700-800 keV) is mainly from pp-III, which is now stopped.

So before the stoppage, F1 was dominated by pp-III. Let's say F1 was 100 and F2 was 30. After the stoppage, F1 becomes 0 (assuming pp-III was the only contributor to F1), and F2 remains 30. So the ratio F1/F2 would be 0. But that's not an option. So maybe it's not zero.

Wait, perhaps the pp chain has some contribution to F2 as well. Suppose pp contributes a bit to higher energies, and CNO contributes to even higher.

Wait, another approach: the pp chain neutrinos have an energy spectrum peaking around 250-600 keV, but there's a tail that extends to higher energies. The CNO neutrinos have a higher average energy, around a few MeV.

So the 700-800 keV band is mostly from pp, and 800-900 is from CNO.

If pp-III stops, then the flux in 700-800 (band1) falls by a lot, because that's where the pp neutrinos are. But the 800-900 (band2) is mostly CNO, which is unaffected.

So the ratio F1/F2 would be (much smaller)/(same as before), so the ratio would be much less than 1.

So, perhaps before the stoppage, F1 was, say, 100, F2=20 (hypothetical numbers). After, F1 drops to, say, 10 (if some pp neutrinos are still in this band, but that's if pp-I and II contribute a little), while F2 remains 20. Then the ratio would be 0.5, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, maybe the pp chain's neutrinos only contribute to F1, so F2 is mostly CNO. So F1 would drop by a lot, F2 remains similar.

In that case, the ratio would be (F1_new)/(F2) = (something small)/ (F2).

So the options are 0.01 (B), 0.1 (D), or 1(C).

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the energy ranges. Let me think about the pp neutrino energies. The main pp neutrinos are from the decay of 7Be, which produces a ν_e with energy about 0.385 MeV (385 keV). So the pp chain neutrinos have energies around that. But wait, wait: the neutrino energy from 7Be decay is about 0.385 MeV, but in the ppI and ppII branches, is there any other source of neutrinos?

Wait, in the pp chain, the main process for neutrino production is the decay of 7Be into 7Li + ν_e.

So the neutrinos from the pp chain are about 0.385 MeV (385 keV). So 700-800 keV is higher than this. So the neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band are not from the pp chain's main process. That's confusing because then why would stopping pp-III affect that band?

Wait, maybe I was mistaken. The main neutrino from pp is 385 keV, but could there be other neutrinos in higher energies? Or perhaps this is a trick question.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch produces some high-energy neutrinos. Or maybe other processes contribute.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about neutrino flavor oscillations, but note 2 says that flavor changes don't play a role here.

Hmm, perhaps I got the energy ranges wrong. If the pp neutrinos are about 385 keV, then the 700-800 keV band is higher. So if the pp-III stops, the neutrinos from that process drop, but since they are at lower energies, the higher bands (700-800, 800-900) are unaffected. So the flux in band1 and band2 would remain the same, making the ratio 1. So the answer would be C)1.

But that seems conflicting with what I thought earlier.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch doesn't directly produce the neutrinos but affects the production of other isotopes that do. For example, if pp-III stops, it might affect the production of 3He, which is used in the CNO cycle. But the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So the CNO cycle continues normally.

Wait, the question says "the pp-III branch suddenly stopped... while all other reactions remained as they were." So the CNO cycle is unaffected.

So, the neutrinos from the CNO cycle are still produced as before. But the pp chain's neutrinos are only from pp-I and pp-II.

Wait, but if the pp-III stops, the pp chain can't proceed beyond that point, so the production of 7Be would stop. Because the pp-III is part of the pp chain. So without pp-III, the 7Be can't form, which means the main neutrino source from the pp chain is gone.

So the neutrinos from the pp chain (like the 385 keV ones) would stop. But the CNO neutrinos are still present.

So the 700-800 keV band is higher than the main pp neutrino energy. So perhaps in that band, neutrinos are from the CNO cycle. So the flux in band2 (800-900) is CNO, which is unaffected. The flux in band1 (700-800) is maybe a mix of some pp and CNO.

Wait, but if the main pp neutrinos are at 385 keV, then in the 700-800 keV band, perhaps they are from higher-energy processes or from the CNO cycle.

So if pp-III stops, the neutrinos from the pp chain (like the 385 keV ones) are gone, but the higher-energy neutrinos (like from the CNO cycle) are still there.

So the 700-800 keV band would have less pp contribution but more CNO. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the CNO neutrinos are higher energy than the pp ones. So 700-800 keV is within the range of CNO neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, the 700-800 band's flux wouldn't be affected much because it's dominated by CNO, and the same for the 800-900 band.

But the question is about the flux ratio between these two bands. So if both bands are dominated by CNO, their ratio would remain about the same.

But wait, the CNO neutrinos have a broader spectrum. Their flux distribution might have a certain shape. If the pp-III stopped, but the CNO is the same, the flux in these bands may not change much in their ratio.

Wait, but actually, the CNO neutrinos would contribute to both bands, so perhaps the ratio would remain the same. So the ratio F1/F2 would be similar to before, which was maybe 1. So the answer would be C)1.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach it differently. The pp chain produces neutrinos around 0.385 MeV. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, maybe around a few MeV. So the 700-800 keV band is about 0.7-0.8 MeV, which is in the range of the CNO neutrinos as well as the higher end of the possible pp neutrinos. Wait, but the pp neutrinos are mostly around 0.385 MeV, so their contribution to the 700-800 keV is negligible.

So, the 700-800 keV band is mostly from CNO, and the 800-900 is also from CNO. So the flux in both bands is from CNO, which hasn't been affected by the pp-III stoppage. Therefore, the ratio F1/F2 would be the same as before. What was the original ratio? Well, in the solar neutrino spectrum, the number of neutrinos decreases with increasing energy, but I'm not sure about the exact shape.

Wait, the solar neutrino flux peaks around 0.3-0.6 MeV, then decreases at higher energies. So the CNO neutrinos are at higher energies, so the flux in 700-800 (0.7-0.8 MeV) would be lower than 800-900 (0.8-0.9 MeV), but wait, no, because as energy increases, the flux usually decreases. So higher energy bands (like 0.8-0.9 MeV) would have lower flux than lower (0.7-0.8). Wait, no, the flux of neutrinos usually decreases with increasing energy. So higher energy neutrinos are less abundant.

Wait, so the flux in 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) would be higher than in 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV), because lower energies have higher flux.

So, F1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) would have higher flux than F2 (0.8-0.9 MeV), so F1/F2 would be greater than 1.

But if the CNO neutrinos are the main source for both bands, stopping pp-III doesn't affect the CNO, so the F1/F2 remains the same as before the stoppage.

But without the pp-III, the main neutrino source (pp) is gone, but the CNO contributes. So the neutrino flux after the stoppage is all from CNO.

But the question is about the ratio between two bands, so the ratio would be the same as it was before, because both bands are dominated by CNO.

But wait, before the stoppage, the F1 would have had some contribution from pp and some from CNO, and F2 would have more from CNO. So without the pp contribution, F1 would now be entirely CNO. So the ratio of F1 (now CNO) to F2 (CNO) would be the same as the ratio of CNO in F1 to CNO in F2.

But in the original, F1 would have been a mix. Let's model it.

Suppose the total neutrino flux in band1 (700-800) is F1_total = F_pp1 + F_cno1.

Similarly, F2_total = F_pp2 + F_cno2.

But if pp-III stops, F_pp1 and F_pp2 drop to zero (assuming pp only contributes to F1 and F2 via pp-III, which I'm not sure about).

Wait, but earlier I thought the pp neutrinos are around 385 keV, so F_pp1 is maybe a little. Let me think of F_pp1 as (say) 10, F_cno1 as 90, making F1_total 100.

F_pp2 is negligible (like 2), F_cno2 is 98, making F2_total 100.

So the original ratio F1/F2 would be 100/100=1.

After pp-III stops, F1 becomes 90, F2 becomes 98. So F1/F2 becomes 90/98 ≈ 0.92, which is close to 1. So the ratio doesn't change much, so the answer would be C)1.

But wait, in reality, the CNO neutrinos might have a distribution that F_cno1 is higher than F_cno2. So F_cno1 > F_cno2.

Wait, if the CNO neutrinos have a spectrum where the flux decreases with energy, then F_cno1 (700-800) is higher than F_cno2 (800-900). So F_cno2 is less than F_cno1.

So if F1 was (say) F_pp1 + F_cno1 = 10 + 90 = 100, and F2 was F_pp2 + F_cno2 = 2 + 98 = 100. But if pp-III stops, F1 becomes 90, F2 becomes 98. So F1/F2 is 90/98≈0.92, which is close to 1.

But wait, I'm not sure if the CNO neutrinos' flux increases or decreases with energy. If the flux decreases with energy, then higher bands have lower flux.

So, the CNO neutrino flux is highest in lower energies (like 700-800), then decreases at higher energies (800-900). So F_cno1 > F_cno2.

So, before stopping, F1 could be F_pp1 (10) + F_cno1 (90) =100.

F2 is F_pp2 (2) + F_cno2 (88)=90.

Wait, but that would make F1=100, F2=90. Then F1/F2=1.11.

After pp stops, F1=90, F2=88. So ratio=90/88≈1.02. Still about 1.

So the answer would be C)1.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO flux contributes more to the higher energy bands.

Wait, but no, the flux usually decreases with energy because higher energy particles are less numerous.

So, the CNO neutrinos would contribute more to the 700-800 keV than the 800-900. So after the stoppage, F1 is dominated by CNO, F2 is also CNO, but F_cno2 < F_cno1.

So, the ratio F1/F2 would be (F_cno1)/(F_cno2). If the CNO neutrinos have a flux that decreases with energy, then F_cno1 > F_cno2, so F1/F2 >1.

But the original ratio, when pp was contributing, F1 was higher than F2. Wait, before stopping, F1_total is F_pp1 + F_cno1, and F2_total is F_pp2 + F_cno2.

If F_pp1 is non-zero, and the pp neutrinos are lower energy, then F_pp1 is maybe a small fraction of F1.

But if the pp-III stops, which affects F_pp1 and F_pp2, which are now zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the main point: the pp-III branch produces neutrinos, but only in the lower energy range. So if it stops, higher energy neutrinos (like in 700-800 and 800-900) are unaffected because they come from CNO.

So the fluxes in both bands remain the same as before, except for any possible contribution from pp in those bands. If the pp neutrinos in those bands are negligible, the ratio remains about the same.

Wait, but without the pp neutrinos, the flux in the lower bands (like 300-600 keV) would drop, but the higher bands (700-800, 800-900) wouldn't be affected. So the ratio between 700-800 and 800-900 would be the same as before.

But what was the ratio before? If the neutrino flux in 700-800 is about the same as in 800-900, the ratio would be 1. So the answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio was higher before, but with the pp-III stopped, the ratio changes.

But I'm getting stuck. Let's think of it another way. The pp-III produces neutrinos in the ~385 keV range. So the flux in the 700-800 keV band is from CNO, which isn't affected by the stoppage.

So the flux in band1 and band2 remains the same as before. So the ratio is 1.

Thus, the answer should be C)1.

The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands, 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), after the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos through the decay of $^{7}\text{Be}$, which emits electron neutrinos ($\nu_e$) with an energy of approximately 385 keV. These neutrinos are part of the lower-energy solar neutrino spectrum.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Ranges of Neutrinos**:
   - The pp chain neutrinos are primarily around 385 keV, which lies below the 700-800 keV band.
   - The 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands are dominated by neutrinos from the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle, which produces higher-energy neutrinos.

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - The pp-III branch is the main source of neutrinos in the lower-energy range (~385 keV). Stopping it does not affect the CNO neutrinos, which are still produced as usual.
   - Since the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands are dominated by CNO neutrinos, their fluxes remain unaffected by the stoppage of the pp-III branch.

3. **Flux Ratio Before and After the Stoppage**:
   - Before the stoppage, the flux in both bands was a combination of contributions from the pp chain (primarily at lower energies) and the CNO cycle (at higher energies). However, the pp chain contribution to the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands is negligible because its neutrinos are at much lower energies (~385 keV).
   - After the stoppage, the flux in both bands remains dominated by the CNO cycle, and the ratio of fluxes between the two bands is determined solely by the CNO neutrino spectrum. Since the CNO neutrino flux decreases with increasing energy, the flux in the 700-800 keV band is slightly higher than in the 800-900 keV band, but the ratio remains approximately 1.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The flux ratio between the two bands is unaffected by the stoppage of the pp-III branch because both bands are dominated by CNO neutrinos, which are unaffected by the stoppage. The ratio remains close to 1.

### Final Answer:
The approximate ratio of the flux between the two bands is **1**.

**Answer: C**

Okay, I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio question. So, the setup is that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, and I need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A through D, with various ratios.

First, I need to remember what the pp-III branch is. I think the proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. The pp-I, II, and III branches are different steps in this process. PP-III involves reactions that produce beryllium-7, which then captures protons to form lithium-7 and then helium-4.

Solar neutrinos are mainly from two processes: the proton-proton (pp) chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. The pp chain contributes more to the lower energy neutrinos, and the CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos. But wait, I think the main neutrinos from the pp chain come from the decay of beryllium-7, which is part of the pp-III branch.

So if pp-III stops, the production of those neutrinos would stop. The pp-I and pp-II would continue, but maybe their neutrino production is different. Let me think about the neutrino types.

But if the pp-III branch stopped, the neutrino production from that part would suddenly drop. So, for the neutrinos from pp-III, their flux would decrease. But what about the overall neutrino flux in these bands?

If the pp-III is responsible for a significant fraction of the neutrinos in higher energy bands (like 700-800 and 800-900 keV), then stopping it would reduce the flux in those bands.

Wait, but neutrinos from the CNO cycle are higher energy than the pp chain, so maybe the 700-800 keV band is still getting some neutrinos from the pp chain, while the 800-900 keV is more CNO.

Alternatively, maybe the pp neutrinos are lower energy, so the 700-800 keV band is the higher end of the pp neutrinos, and the 800-900 is lower end of CNO.

Wait, the typical neutrino energies from the pp chain are around 250-600 keV, I think. So bands above that are more CNO. So if pp-III stops, the flux in the 700-800 keV band would decrease because that's where the pp neutrinos are peaking, but the 800-900 keV would be more from CNO, which isn't affected by stopping pp-III.

Wait, but if the main pp neutrinos are up to about 600 keV, then the 700-800 range would have contributions from both pp and CNO, but perhaps less from pp. So if pp-III stops, the 700-800 keV band would lose a lot of flux, but the 800-900 would lose less because it's more CNO.

So without the pp-III, the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) would drop more than band 2 (800-900 keV), leading to a lower ratio of (flux 1)/(flux 2).

Wait, but how much? Since the pp-III is a major source of neutrinos, the 700-800 band might have been mostly pp. If pp stops, that band's flux drops a lot, while the 800-900 remains roughly the same.

So the ratio F1/F2 would be (something small)/(something similar to before), which would be small. The options are A)10, B)0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

If F1 is reduced and F2 is less affected, then F1/F2 would be less than 1. For example, if F1 drops to 10% of its original, and F2 remains roughly the same, the ratio would be 0.1, which is D.

Wait, but wait: I thought that the pp chain's neutrinos are mostly below ~600 keV, but in reality, maybe there's some overlap. Are the pp neutrinos in the 700 keV range? I'm a bit confused.

So, let's say before the stoppage, F1 was dominated by pp-III, say F1 was 100, and F2 had some pp and a lot of CNO, maybe 30 (e.g., 10 from pp and 20 from CNO). After pp-III stops, F1 drops to 0 (if all pp-III contribution is gone), and F2 drops to 20 (because the pp contribution was 10, but the CNO remains the same? Or does CNO continue?)

Wait, no. The CNO cycle is a separate process. So if pp-III stops, the CNO neutrinos are still produced as before. So the F2 (800-900 keV) is mainly from CNO, which isn't affected. Whereas F1 (700-800 keV) is mainly from pp-III, which is now stopped.

So before the stoppage, F1 was dominated by pp-III. Let's say F1 was 100 and F2 was 30. After the stoppage, F1 becomes 0 (assuming pp-III was the only contributor to F1), and F2 remains 30. So the ratio F1/F2 would be 0. But that's not an option. So maybe it's not zero.

Wait, perhaps the pp chain has some contribution to F2 as well. Suppose pp contributes a bit to higher energies, and CNO contributes to even higher.

Wait, another approach: the pp chain neutrinos have an energy spectrum peaking around 250-600 keV, but there's a tail that extends to higher energies. The CNO neutrinos have a higher average energy, around a few MeV.

So the 700-800 keV band is mostly from pp, and 800-900 is from CNO.

If pp-III stops, then the flux in 700-800 (band1) falls by a lot, because that's where the pp neutrinos are. But the 800-900 (band2) is mostly CNO, which is unaffected.

So the ratio F1/F2 would be (much smaller)/(same as before), so the ratio would be much less than 1.

So, perhaps before the stoppage, F1 was, say, 100, F2=20 (hypothetical numbers). After, F1 drops to, say, 10 (if some pp neutrinos are still in this band, but that's if pp-I and II contribute a little), while F2 remains 20. Then the ratio would be 0.5, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, maybe the pp chain's neutrinos only contribute to F1, so F2 is mostly CNO. So F1 would drop by a lot, F2 remains similar.

In that case, the ratio would be (F1_new)/(F2) = (something small)/ (F2).

So the options are 0.01 (B), 0.1 (D), or 1(C).

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the energy ranges. Let me think about the pp neutrino energies. The main pp neutrinos are from the decay of 7Be, which produces a ν_e with energy about 0.385 MeV (385 keV). So the pp chain neutrinos have energies around that. But wait, wait: the neutrino energy from 7Be decay is about 0.385 MeV, but in the ppI and ppII branches, is there any other source of neutrinos?

Wait, in the pp chain, the main process for neutrino production is the decay of 7Be into 7Li + ν_e.

So the neutrinos from the pp chain are about 0.385 MeV (385 keV). So 700-800 keV is higher than this. So the neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band are not from the pp chain's main process. That's confusing because then why would stopping pp-III affect that band?

Wait, maybe I was mistaken. The main neutrino from pp is 385 keV, but could there be other neutrinos in higher energies? Or perhaps this is a trick question.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch produces some high-energy neutrinos. Or maybe other processes contribute.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about neutrino flavor oscillations, but note 2 says that flavor changes don't play a role here.

Hmm, perhaps I got the energy ranges wrong. If the pp neutrinos are about 385 keV, then the 700-800 keV band is higher. So if the pp-III stops, the neutrinos from that process drop, but since they are at lower energies, the higher bands (700-800, 800-900) are unaffected. So the flux in band1 and band2 would remain the same, making the ratio 1. So the answer would be C)1.

But that seems conflicting with what I thought earlier.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch doesn't directly produce the neutrinos but affects the production of other isotopes that do. For example, if pp-III stops, it might affect the production of 3He, which is used in the CNO cycle. But the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So the CNO cycle continues normally.

Wait, the question says "the pp-III branch suddenly stopped... while all other reactions remained as they were." So the CNO cycle is unaffected.

So, the neutrinos from the CNO cycle are still produced as before. But the pp chain's neutrinos are only from pp-I and pp-II.

Wait, but if the pp-III stops, the pp chain can't proceed beyond that point, so the production of 7Be would stop. Because the pp-III is part of the pp chain. So without pp-III, the 7Be can't form, which means the main neutrino source from the pp chain is gone.

So the neutrinos from the pp chain (like the 385 keV ones) would stop. But the CNO neutrinos are still present.

So the 700-800 keV band is higher than the main pp neutrino energy. So perhaps in that band, neutrinos are from the CNO cycle. So the flux in band2 (800-900) is CNO, which is unaffected. The flux in band1 (700-800) is maybe a mix of some pp and CNO.

Wait, but if the main pp neutrinos are at 385 keV, then in the 700-800 keV band, perhaps they are from higher-energy processes or from the CNO cycle.

So if pp-III stops, the neutrinos from the pp chain (like the 385 keV ones) are gone, but the higher-energy neutrinos (like from the CNO cycle) are still there.

So the 700-800 keV band would have less pp contribution but more CNO. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the CNO neutrinos are higher energy than the pp ones. So 700-800 keV is within the range of CNO neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, the 700-800 band's flux wouldn't be affected much because it's dominated by CNO, and the same for the 800-900 band.

But the question is about the flux ratio between these two bands. So if both bands are dominated by CNO, their ratio would remain about the same.

But wait, the CNO neutrinos have a broader spectrum. Their flux distribution might have a certain shape. If the pp-III stopped, but the CNO is the same, the flux in these bands may not change much in their ratio.

Wait, but actually, the CNO neutrinos would contribute to both bands, so perhaps the ratio would remain the same. So the ratio F1/F2 would be similar to before, which was maybe 1. So the answer would be C)1.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach it differently. The pp chain produces neutrinos around 0.385 MeV. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, maybe around a few MeV. So the 700-800 keV band is about 0.7-0.8 MeV, which is in the range of the CNO neutrinos as well as the higher end of the possible pp neutrinos. Wait, but the pp neutrinos are mostly around 0.385 MeV, so their contribution to the 700-800 keV is negligible.

So, the 700-800 keV band is mostly from CNO, and the 800-900 is also from CNO. So the flux in both bands is from CNO, which hasn't been affected by the pp-III stoppage. Therefore, the ratio F1/F2 would be the same as before. What was the original ratio? Well, in the solar neutrino spectrum, the number of neutrinos decreases with increasing energy, but I'm not sure about the exact shape.

Wait, the solar neutrino flux peaks around 0.3-0.6 MeV, then decreases at higher energies. So the CNO neutrinos are at higher energies, so the flux in 700-800 (0.7-0.8 MeV) would be lower than 800-900 (0.8-0.9 MeV), but wait, no, because as energy increases, the flux usually decreases. So higher energy bands (like 0.8-0.9 MeV) would have lower flux than lower (0.7-0.8). Wait, no, the flux of neutrinos usually decreases with increasing energy. So higher energy neutrinos are less abundant.

Wait, so the flux in 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) would be higher than in 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV), because lower energies have higher flux.

So, F1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) would have higher flux than F2 (0.8-0.9 MeV), so F1/F2 would be greater than 1.

But if the CNO neutrinos are the main source for both bands, stopping pp-III doesn't affect the CNO, so the F1/F2 remains the same as before the stoppage.

But without the pp-III, the main neutrino source (pp) is gone, but the CNO contributes. So the neutrino flux after the stoppage is all from CNO.

But the question is about the ratio between two bands, so the ratio would be the same as it was before, because both bands are dominated by CNO.

But wait, before the stoppage, the F1 would have had some contribution from pp and some from CNO, and F2 would have more from CNO. So without the pp contribution, F1 would now be entirely CNO. So the ratio of F1 (now CNO) to F2 (CNO) would be the same as the ratio of CNO in F1 to CNO in F2.

But in the original, F1 would have been a mix. Let's model it.

Suppose the total neutrino flux in band1 (700-800) is F1_total = F_pp1 + F_cno1.

Similarly, F2_total = F_pp2 + F_cno2.

But if pp-III stops, F_pp1 and F_pp2 drop to zero (assuming pp only contributes to F1 and F2 via pp-III, which I'm not sure about).

Wait, but earlier I thought the pp neutrinos are around 385 keV, so F_pp1 is maybe a little. Let me think of F_pp1 as (say) 10, F_cno1 as 90, making F1_total 100.

F_pp2 is negligible (like 2), F_cno2 is 98, making F2_total 100.

So the original ratio F1/F2 would be 100/100=1.

After pp-III stops, F1 becomes 90, F2 becomes 98. So F1/F2 becomes 90/98 ≈ 0.92, which is close to 1. So the ratio doesn't change much, so the answer would be C)1.

But wait, in reality, the CNO neutrinos might have a distribution that F_cno1 is higher than F_cno2. So F_cno1 > F_cno2.

Wait, if the CNO neutrinos have a spectrum where the flux decreases with energy, then F_cno1 (700-800) is higher than F_cno2 (800-900). So F_cno2 is less than F_cno1.

So if F1 was (say) F_pp1 + F_cno1 = 10 + 90 = 100, and F2 was F_pp2 + F_cno2 = 2 + 98 = 100. But if pp-III stops, F1 becomes 90, F2 becomes 98. So F1/F2 is 90/98≈0.92, which is close to 1.

But wait, I'm not sure if the CNO neutrinos' flux increases or decreases with energy. If the flux decreases with energy, then higher bands have lower flux.

So, the CNO neutrino flux is highest in lower energies (like 700-800), then decreases at higher energies (800-900). So F_cno1 > F_cno2.

So, before stopping, F1 could be F_pp1 (10) + F_cno1 (90) =100.

F2 is F_pp2 (2) + F_cno2 (88)=90.

Wait, but that would make F1=100, F2=90. Then F1/F2=1.11.

After pp stops, F1=90, F2=88. So ratio=90/88≈1.02. Still about 1.

So the answer would be C)1.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO flux contributes more to the higher energy bands.

Wait, but no, the flux usually decreases with energy because higher energy particles are less numerous.

So, the CNO neutrinos would contribute more to the 700-800 keV than the 800-900. So after the stoppage, F1 is dominated by CNO, F2 is also CNO, but F_cno2 < F_cno1.

So, the ratio F1/F2 would be (F_cno1)/(F_cno2). If the CNO neutrinos have a flux that decreases with energy, then F_cno1 > F_cno2, so F1/F2 >1.

But the original ratio, when pp was contributing, F1 was higher than F2. Wait, before stopping, F1_total is F_pp1 + F_cno1, and F2_total is F_pp2 + F_cno2.

If F_pp1 is non-zero, and the pp neutrinos are lower energy, then F_pp1 is maybe a small fraction of F1.

But if the pp-III stops, which affects F_pp1 and F_pp2, which are now zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the main point: the pp-III branch produces neutrinos, but only in the lower energy range. So if it stops, higher energy neutrinos (like in 700-800 and 800-900) are unaffected because they come from CNO.

So the fluxes in both bands remain the same as before, except for any possible contribution from pp in those bands. If the pp neutrinos in those bands are negligible, the ratio remains about the same.

Wait, but without the pp neutrinos, the flux in the lower bands (like 300-600 keV) would drop, but the higher bands (700-800, 800-900) wouldn't be affected. So the ratio between 700-800 and 800-900 would be the same as before.

But what was the ratio before? If the neutrino flux in 700-800 is about the same as in 800-900, the ratio would be 1. So the answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio was higher before, but with the pp-III stopped, the ratio changes.

But I'm getting stuck. Let's think of it another way. The pp-III produces neutrinos in the ~385 keV range. So the flux in the 700-800 keV band is from CNO, which isn't affected by the stoppage.

So the flux in band1 and band2 remains the same as before. So the ratio is 1.

Thus, the answer should be C)1.


The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands, 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), after the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos through the decay of $^{7}\text{Be}$, which emits electron neutrinos ($\nu_e$) with an energy of approximately 385 keV. These neutrinos are part of the lower-energy solar neutrino spectrum.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Ranges of Neutrinos**:
   - The pp chain neutrinos are primarily around 385 keV, which lies below the 700-800 keV band.
   - The 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands are dominated by neutrinos from the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle, which produces higher-energy neutrinos.

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - The pp-III branch is the main source of neutrinos in the lower-energy range (~385 keV). Stopping it does not affect the CNO neutrinos, which are still produced as usual.
   - Since the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands are dominated by CNO neutrinos, their fluxes remain unaffected by the stoppage of the pp-III branch.

3. **Flux Ratio Before and After the Stoppage**:
   - Before the stoppage, the flux in both bands was a combination of contributions from the pp chain (primarily at lower energies) and the CNO cycle (at higher energies). However, the pp chain contribution to the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands is negligible because its neutrinos are at much lower energies (~385 keV).
   - After the stoppage, the flux in both bands remains dominated by the CNO cycle, and the ratio of fluxes between the two bands is determined solely by the CNO neutrino spectrum. Since the CNO neutrino flux decreases with increasing energy, the flux in the 700-800 keV band is slightly higher than in the 800-900 keV band, but the ratio remains approximately 1.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The flux ratio between the two bands is unaffected by the stoppage of the pp-III branch because both bands are dominated by CNO neutrinos, which are unaffected by the stoppage. The ratio remains close to 1.

### Final Answer:
The approximate ratio of the flux between the two bands is **1**.

**Answer: C**
