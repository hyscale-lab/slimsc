Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how it would compare to an exoplanet in terms of the brightness variation caused.

Alright, let me read the problem again. So, the star has a radius equal to the Sun, right? And one hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the surface is covered by these spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler or hotter? Well, the temperature difference is 1000K, but the spots are dark, so probably cooler. So, maybe 5000K? Or maybe 6000K minus 1000K? Wait, the problem says a temperature difference, so if the star's Teff is 6000K, the spots are either 5000K or 7000K. But since they are dark spots, they should be cooler, so 5000K.

Photometric time-series observations show brightness variations because the star is rotating, modulating the spots into our view. So as the star spins, the spots come in and out of view, causing dips in brightness. But wait, the problem says that this situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So when the star's brightness varies because of the spots, it can mimic the transit of a planet.

The question is asking: To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star? So, if instead of spots, there was a planet transiting, what size planet would cause the same dip in brightness.

Hmm. So the amplitude of the brightness variation depends on the area blocked. For a planet, it's the planet's area over the star's area. But here, the spots are causing a variation. So the variation from the spots is due to the change in the observed flux when the spots rotate into and out of view.

Wait, the star has some spots that are cooler. So when a spot is facing us, it's darker, so the total flux drops a little. But how much? The brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference compared to the rest of the star.

Wait, the star's effective temperature is 6000K. The spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. So if the star is 6000K, the spots could be 5000K or 7000K. But since they're dark spots, I think it's 5000K.

So the flux from the star without spots would be based on its entire surface. When a spot is visible, the flux decreases because that area is emitting less. The flux from a blackbody is proportional to T^4, right? So each part of the star's surface contributes flux based on its temperature.

The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the star's surface is covered by spots. So the total flux when the spots are on our side would be (1 - 0.2) * (flux from normal surface) + 0.2 * (flux from spots). Without spots, the flux would be 100% of the normal surface.

Wait, but when the star has spots, its average flux is a bit less. But when the star is rotating, the spots come into view and go out of view. So the brightness variation is due to the changing amount of spotted area that we see.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the brightness variations are due to rotational modulation. So the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible. Since the star is rotating with the spots on one side, as it spins, the spots come into view and then go away. So the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, so when it's viewed face-on, the entire surface is visible. If the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates, the spots come into view from the edge. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the area blocked.

Wait, but when the star rotates, the amount of spotted area that is visible varies. Since the spots are on a single hemisphere, perhaps when the star is edge-on (as viewed from Earth), we can see the entire spotted area. When it's face-on, perhaps the spots are on the far side, so we don't see any spots. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the spots are on a single hemisphere, so when the star rotates 180 degrees, the opposite hemisphere comes into view, which is unspotted.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. But perhaps I should model the scenario. The star has a radius R equal to the Sun's radius. The filling factor is 0.2, meaning 20% of the surface has spots. The spots are at 5000K, star is 6000K.

The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between when the spots are fully visible and when they are not. So the maximum brightness is when the unspotted side is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted side is facing us.

Wait, no. If the star is rotating, half of it is spotted, the other half not. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots; when the other hemisphere is facing, the spots are on the back. But wait, the spots are on a hemisphere, so when the star is viewed edge-on, maybe we see half the spots? Or perhaps the entire spotted area is on one side, so when the star rotates, the spotted side comes into view and then goes away.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to model the brightness variation. The total flux from the star when the spotted hemisphere is visible would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part.

The total flux from the star is usually F = sigma * T^4 * 4πR² (sigma is Stefan-Boltzmann constant). But when part of the surface is cooler, the flux drops.

The star's normal flux is F0 = sigma * T_star^4 * 4π R^2.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F1 = (1 - f) * F0/(2) * (T_star^4) + f * F0/(2) * (T_spot^4).

Wait, because the hemisphere has 20% spots, so f=0.2. So of the hemisphere, 80% is normal, 20% is spots.

Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So if the spots cover 0.2 of the entire surface, then each hemisphere (assuming the spots are on a single hemisphere) would have 0.2 of the total surface area. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see 0.2 of the surface as spots, and 0.8 as normal.

Wait, no. Wait, the entire star's surface is 4π R². If the spots cover 20% of that, 0.2 * 4π R². So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area we see is 2π R². So the spots cover 0.2 of the total surface, so the spots area is 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8 π R². So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, we see 0.8 π R² of spots, and the rest of the hemisphere (2π R² - 0.8 π R²) = 1.2 π R² as normal.

Wait, no. Because the total surface is 4π R². So the spotted area is 0.2 *4π R² = 0.8 π R². So the unspotted area is 3.2 π R². When the star shows the spotted hemisphere, how much of the spots are visible? It depends on the viewing angle.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the maximum and minimum flux. The maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum flux is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, no. Because when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots that are on that side. Since the spots are on a single hemisphere, when the other hemisphere is facing, the spots are on the back and thus not visible.

So the maximum flux (F_max) is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. The flux in that case is F_max = sigma * T_star^4 * (2π R²) [since we see the full unspotted hemisphere, which is 2π R² area].

The minimum flux (F_min) is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. Then, the flux is F_min = sigma * T_star^4 * (2π R² - 0.2 * 4π R²) + sigma * T_spot^4 * (0.2 * 4π R²) / 2? Wait, no, maybe I should break it down.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The star's entire surface, without spots, has a flux of F0 = sigma T^4 * 4 pi R^2.

When there are spots covering 20% of the surface, the average flux changes. But when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view.

Wait, no. The problem is about photometric variations due to rotation. So when the star is viewed face-on, perhaps you see the entire surface, but the spots are on one hemisphere. So as the star rotates, the spots come into view, increasing the area we see from that hemisphere. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to model the brightness variation as the star rotates.

Wait, perhaps the star is rotating, and the spots are on the surface. As the star spins, the spots come into view and then go out of view, leading to periodic dips in brightness. But since the spots are on a single hemisphere, the variation would depend on how much of the spot area is visible as the star rotates.

But I'm not quite getting how to model the variation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. The amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is the same as that caused by a planet transit. So, we can compute the relative change in flux for both cases and set them equal, then solve for the planet radius.

So, for the star with spots, the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into view. For the planet transit, the variation is the planet's area over the star's area, times the difference in brightness between star and planet.

Wait, no, because during transit, the planet blocks part of the star's light, so the flux drops by (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (L_star / (4 pi R_star^2)).

Wait, but actually, the star emits a certain amount of flux. When the planet transits, it blocks a portion of that flux. The change in flux is delta F = F * (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is (pi R_p^2) / (4 pi R_s^2) ) = (R_p^2)/(4 R_s^2) ), but since the star emits isotropically, the flux blocked is (R_p/R_s)^2 times the total flux.

Wait, the flux from the star is F = sigma T^4 * (4 pi R_s^2) / (4 pi d^2) ) = sigma T^4 R_s^2 / d^2. So the total flux is F0 = sigma T^4 R_s^2 / d^2. When a planet with radius R_p transits, it blocks an area of pi R_p^2. So the blocked flux is F_block = (pi R_p^2 / (4 pi R_s^2)) * F0 ) = (R_p^2 / (4 R_s^2)) * F0.

So the change in flux is delta F = F0 - F0 * (1 - (R_p^2)/(4 R_s^2)) ) ? Wait, no, actually, it's F0 * (R_p^2)/(4 R_s^2) ), because that's the fraction blocked.

Wait, I think the correct way is that the change in flux is (R_p^2) / (4 R_s^2) ) * F0.

But for the star with spots, when the spots rotate into view, the flux changes. So the maximum flux is F_max, and the minimum is F_min. The amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_max or something like that.

Wait, but when the star's spots are on the far side, we see the full unspotted star. So F_max is F0. When the spots rotate into view, the flux drops to F_min.

Wait, no. Wait, the entire star is being viewed, but part of it is cooler. So the total flux when the spots are visible is F = F0 - (flux lost due to spots).

The flux lost is the area of the spots times the difference between the star's flux and the spots' flux per unit area.

So the flux without spots is F0 = sigma T_star^4 * 4 pi R_s^2.

When spots are present, the flux is F1 = sigma [ (1 - f) * T_star^4 + f * T_spot^4 ] * 4 pi R_s^2 (since f is the filling factor).

But wait, f is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So the total flux is F1 = sigma T_star^4 * (1 - f) * 4 pi R_s^2 + sigma T_spot^4 * f * 4 pi R_s^2.

Which simplifies to F1 = sigma 4 pi R_s^2 [ (1 - f) T_star^4 + f T_spot^4 ].

So the change in flux when the spots are visible is delta F = F0 - F1 = sigma 4 pi R_s^2 [ T_star^4 - ( (1 - f) T_star^4 + f T_spot^4 ) ].

Simplify that:

delta F = sigma 4 pi R_s^2 [ T_star^4 (1 - (1-f)) - f T_spot^4 ].

Which is:

delta F = sigma 4 pi R_s^2 [ f T_star^4 - f T_spot^4 ].

Factor out f:

delta F = sigma 4 pi R_s^2 f [ T_star^4 - T_spot^4 ].

So the relative change in flux is delta F / F0 = [ f (T_star^4 - T_spot^4) ] / T_star^4.

Because F0 = sigma 4 pi R_s^2 T_star^4.

So the relative change is:

delta F / F0 = f * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4 ].

So that's the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots.

Wait, but in reality, the spots might rotate in and out of view, causing the flux to vary between F0 (no spots visible) and F1 (spots visible). No, wait, in the problem statement, the entire hemisphere is covered in spots. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are visible, and when it's not, none are. Or maybe, since the star is rotating, the spots come into view only partially?

Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me think: the star has a filling factor of f=0.2, meaning 20% of the surface is spots. So when the star is viewed such that the entire spotted area is visible, the flux is F1 as above. The maximum flux is when the star's unspotted hemisphere is facing us, so F0. The minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is facing, F1.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, and when you look at it, you can only see a hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is on the near side, you see all the spots. When it's on the far side, you don't see any. So the maximum flux is F0, the minimum is F1.

So the flux variation amplitude is (F0 - F1) / F0 = [F0 - F1]/F0.

Which, from earlier, delta F is F0 - F1 = F0 * f [1 - (T_spot/T_star)^4 ].

So the relative change is (F0 - F1)/F0 = f [1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4 ].

So that's the amplitude of the brightness variation (as a fraction of F0) caused by the spots.

Now, for the planet transit scenario, the amplitude is (R_planet^2) / (R_star^2) ), because the planet blocks (R_p/R_s)^2 of the star's flux.

Wait, but wait. The planet is a disk that blocks part of the star's light. So the change in flux is (R_p / R_s)^2 times the star's flux. So the amplitude is (R_p^2)/(R_s^2).

But in reality, the planet's albedo is not considered here. Since the planet is not emitting light, the only effect is the blocking of the star's light. So during transit, the flux drops by (R_p^2)/(R_s^2) times the star's flux.

Thus, the amplitude for the planet is (R_p/R_s)^2.

But wait, the problem states that the star is not covered by spots in the hypothetical exoplanet case. So we need to compute the planet radius R_p such that the amplitude caused by the planet is equal to the amplitude caused by the spots.

So set the two amplitudes equal:

Amplitude_spot = Amplitude_planet.

So,

f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4 ] = (R_p / R_s)^2.

We can solve for R_p / R_s.

Given the values:

f = 0.2,

T_spot = T_star - 1000 K = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K,

T_star = 6000 K.

So,

0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ] = (R_p/R_s)^2.

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (0.8333)^4.

Let me calculate that:

0.8333^2 = ~0.6944,

then square that: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So,

1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.5177 = 0.1035.

So,

(R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.1035,

so R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Wait, but wait, the options are given as A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

So 0.3217 is approximately 0.32, which is option D.

But wait, hold on. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, let's recheck the steps.

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4:

0.8333^2 = 0.6944,

0.6944^2 = 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.5177 = 0.1035.

Square root is sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, which is approximately 0.32.

Which is option D.

So the correct answer would be D) ~0.32.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spotted regions, we compare the amplitude of the brightness changes caused by the spots and the planet.

### Key Parameters:
- **Star's effective temperature**: \( T_{\text{star}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)
- **Spot temperature**: \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{star}} - 1000 = 5000 \, \text{K} \)
- **Filling factor of spots**: \( f = 0.2 \)
- **Star's radius**: \( R_{\text{star}} \) (equal to the Sun's radius)

### Brightness Variation Due to Spots:
The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is given by:

\[
\text{Amplitude}_{\text{spot}} = f \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}} \right)^4 \right]
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Amplitude}_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right]
\]

First, calculate \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):
\[
\frac{5000}{6000} = 0.8333, \quad \left( 0.8333 \right)^2 = 0.6944, \quad \left( 0.6944 \right)^2 = 0.4823
\]

Thus:
\[
\text{Amplitude}_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \left[ 1 - 0.4823 \right] = 0.2 \times 0.5177 = 0.1035
\]

### Brightness Variation Due to a Planet:
The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:

\[
\text{Amplitude}_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]

To match the amplitude of the spots, set \( \text{Amplitude}_{\text{spot}} = \text{Amplitude}_{\text{planet}} \):
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217
\]

### Final Answer:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how it would compare to an exoplanet in terms of the brightness variation caused.

The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the surface is covered by these spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler or hotter?

Wait, the problem says a temperature difference, so if the star's Teff is 6000K, the spots are either 5000K or 7000K. But since they are dark spots, they should be cooler, so 5000K.

Hmm. So the amplitude of the brightness variation depends on the area blocked. For a planet, it's the planet's area over the star's area. But here, the spots are causing a variation. So the variation from the spots is due to the change in the observed flux when the spots rotate into and out of view.

Wait, the star has some spots that are cooler. So when a spot is facing us, it's darker, so the total flux drops a little. But how much? The brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference compared to the rest of the star.

Wait, the star's effective temperature is 6000K. The spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. So if the star is 6000K, the spots could be 5000K or 7000K. But since they're dark spots, I think it's 5000K.

So the flux from the star without spots would be based on its entire surface. When a spot is visible, the flux decreases because that area is emitting less. The flux from a blackbody is proportional to T^4, right? So each part of the star's surface contributes flux based on its temperature.

The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the star's surface is covered by spots. So the total flux when the spots are on our side would be (1 - 0.2) * (flux from normal surface) + 0.2 * (flux from spots). Without spots, the flux would be 100% of the normal surface.

Wait, but when the star has spots, its average flux is a bit less. But when the star is rotating, the spots come into view and go out of view. So the brightness variation is due to the changing amount of spotted area that we see.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the brightness variations are due to rotational modulation. So the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible. Since the star is rotating with the spots on one side, as it spins, the spots come into view and then go away. So the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Alternatively, perhaps the spots are on a single hemisphere, so when the star rotates 180 degrees, the opposite hemisphere comes into view, which is unspotted.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. But perhaps I should model the scenario. The star has a radius R equal to the Sun's radius. The filling factor is 0.2, meaning 20% of the surface has spots. The spots are at 5000K, star is 6000K.

The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between when the spots are fully visible and when they are not. So the maximum brightness is when the unspotted side is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted side is facing us.

But wait, the spots are on a hemisphere, so when the star is viewed edge-on, maybe we see half the spots? Or perhaps the entire spotted area is on one side, so when the star rotates, the spotted side comes into view and then goes away.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to model the brightness variation. The total flux from the star when the spotted hemisphere is visible would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part.

The total flux from the star is usually F = sigma * T^4 * 4πR² (sigma is Stefan-Boltzmann constant). But when part of the surface is cooler, the flux drops.

The star's normal flux is F0 = sigma * T_star^4 * 4π R^2.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F1 = (1 - f) * F0/(2) * (T_star^4) + f * F0/(2) * (T_spot^4).

Wait, because the hemisphere has 20% spots, so f=0.2. So of the hemisphere, 80% is normal, 20% is spots.

Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So if the spots cover 0.2 of the entire surface, then each hemisphere (assuming the spots are on a single hemisphere) would have 0.2 of the total surface area. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see 0.2 of the surface as spots, and 0.8 as normal.

Wait, no. Wait, the entire star's surface is 4π R². If the spots cover 20% of that, 0.2 * 4π R². So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area we see is 2π R². So the spots cover 0.2 of the total surface, so the spots area is 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8 π R². So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, we see 0.8 π R² of spots, and the rest of the hemisphere (2π R² - 0.8 π R²) = 1.2 π R² as normal.

Wait, no. Because the total surface is 4π R². So the spotted area is 0.2 *4π R² = 0.8 π R². So the unspotted area is 3.2 π R². When the star shows the spotted hemisphere, how much of the spots are visible? It depends on the viewing angle.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the maximum and minimum flux. The maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum flux is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, no. Because when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots that are on that side. Since the spots are on a single hemisphere, when the other hemisphere is facing, the spots are on the back and thus not visible.

So the maximum flux (F_max) is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. The flux in that case is F_max = sigma * T_star^4 * (2π R²) [since we see the full unspotted hemisphere, which is 2π R² area].

The minimum flux (F_min) is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. Then, the flux is F_min = sigma * T_star^4 * (2π R² - 0.2 * 4π R²) + sigma * T_spot^4 * (0.2 * 4π R²) / 2? Wait, no, maybe I should break it down.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The star's entire surface, without spots, has a flux of F0 = sigma T^4 * 4 pi R^2.

When there are spots covering 20% of the surface, the average flux changes. But when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view.

Wait, no. The problem is about photometric variations due to rotation. So when the star is viewed face-on, perhaps you see the entire surface, but the spots are on one hemisphere. So as the star rotates, the spots come into view, increasing the area we see from that hemisphere. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to model the brightness variation as the star rotates.

Wait, perhaps the star is rotating, and the spots are on the surface. As the star spins, the spots come into view and then go out of view, leading to periodic dips in brightness. But since the spots are on a single hemisphere, the variation would depend on how much of the spot area is visible as the star rotates.

But I'm not quite getting how to model the variation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. The amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is the same as that caused by a planet transit. So, we can compute the relative change in flux for both cases and set them equal, then solve for the planet radius.

So, for the star with spots, the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into view. For the planet transit, the variation is the planet's area over the star's area, times the difference in brightness between star and planet.

Wait, no, because during transit, the planet blocks part of the star's light, so the flux drops by (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (L_star / (4 pi R_star^2)).

Wait, but actually, the star emits a certain amount of flux. When the planet transits, it blocks a portion of that flux. The change in flux is delta F = F * (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is (pi R_p^2) / (4 pi R_s^2) ) = (R_p^2)/(4 R_s^2) ), but since the star emits isotropically, the flux blocked is (R_p/R_s)^2 times the total flux.

Wait, the flux from the star is F = sigma T^4 * (4 pi R_s^2) / (4 pi d^2) ) = sigma T^4 R_s^2 / d^2. So the total flux is F0 = sigma T^4 R_s^2 / d^2. When a planet with radius R_p transits, it blocks an area of pi R_p^2. So the blocked flux is F_block = (pi R_p^2 / (4 pi R_s^2)) * F0 ) = (R_p^2 / (4 R_s^2)) * F0.

So the change in flux is delta F = F0 - F0 * (1 - (R_p^2)/(4 R_s^2)) ) ? Wait, no, actually, it's F0 * (R_p^2)/(4 R_s^2) ), because that's the fraction blocked.

Wait, I think the correct way is that the change in flux is (R_p^2) / (4 R_s^2) ) * F0.

But for the star with spots, when the spots rotate into view, the flux changes. So the maximum flux is F_max, and the minimum is F_min. The amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_max or something like that.

Wait, but when the star's spots are on the far side, we see the full unspotted star. So F_max is F0. When the spots rotate into view, the flux drops to F_min.

Wait, no. Wait, the entire star is being viewed, but part of it is cooler. So the total flux when the spots are visible is F = F0 - (flux lost due to spots).

The flux lost is the area of the spots times the difference between the star's flux and the spots' flux per unit area.

So the flux without spots is F0 = sigma T_star^4 * 4 pi R_s^2.

When spots are present, the flux is F1 = sigma [ (1 - f) * T_star^4 + f * T_spot^4 ] * 4 pi R_s^2 (since f is the filling factor).

But wait, f is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So the total flux is F1 = sigma T_star^4 * (1 - f) * 4 pi R_s^2 + sigma T_spot^4 * f * 4 pi R_s^2.

Which simplifies to F1 = sigma 4 pi R_s^2 [ (1 - f) T_star^4 + f T_spot^4 ].

So the change in flux when the spots are visible is delta F = F0 - F1 = sigma 4 pi R_s^2 [ T_star^4 - ( (1 - f) T_star^4 + f T_spot^4 ) ].

Simplify that:

delta F = sigma 4 pi R_s^2 [ T_star^4 (1 - (1-f)) - f T_spot^4 ].

Which is:

delta F = sigma 4 pi R_s^2 [ f T_star^4 - f T_spot^4 ].

Factor out f:

delta F = sigma 4 pi R_s^2 f [ T_star^4 - T_spot^4 ].

So the relative change in flux is delta F / F0 = [ f (T_star^4 - T_spot^4) ] / T_star^4.

Because F0 = sigma 4 pi R_s^2 T_star^4.

So the relative change is:

delta F / F0 = f * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4 ].

So that's the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots.

Wait, but in reality, the spots might rotate in and out of view, causing the flux to vary between F0 (no spots visible) and F1 (spots visible). No, wait, in the problem statement, the entire hemisphere is covered in spots. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are visible, and when it's not, none are. Or maybe, since the star is rotating, the spots come into view only partially?

Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me think: the star has a filling factor of f=0.2, meaning 20% of the surface is spots. So when the star is viewed such that the entire spotted area is visible, the flux is F1 as above. The maximum flux is when the star's unspotted hemisphere is facing us, so F0. The minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is facing, F1.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, and when you look at it, you can only see a hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is on the near side, you see all the spots. When it's on the far side, you don't see any. So the maximum flux is F0, the minimum is F1.

So the flux variation amplitude is (F0 - F1) / F0 = [F0 - F1]/F0.

Which, from earlier, delta F is F0 - F1 = F0 * f [1 - (T_spot/T_star)^4 ].

So the relative change is (F0 - F1)/F0 = f [1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4 ].

So that's the amplitude of the brightness variation (as a fraction of F0) caused by the spots.

Now, for the planet transit scenario, the amplitude is (R_planet^2) / (R_star^2) ), because the planet blocks (R_p/R_s)^2 of the star's flux.

Wait, but wait. The planet is a disk that blocks part of the star's light. So the change in flux is (R_p / R_s)^2 times the star's flux. So the amplitude is (R_p^2)/(R_s^2).

But in reality, the planet's albedo is not considered here. Since the planet is not emitting light, the only effect is the blocking of the star's light. So during transit, the flux drops by (R_p^2)/(R_s^2) times the star's flux.

Thus, the amplitude for the planet is (R_p/R_s)^2.

But wait, the problem states that the star is not covered by spots in the hypothetical exoplanet case. So we need to compute the planet radius R_p such that the amplitude caused by the planet is equal to the amplitude caused by the spots.

So set the two amplitudes equal:

Amplitude_spot = Amplitude_planet.

So,

f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4 ] = (R_p / R_s)^2.

We can solve for R_p / R_s.

Given the values:

f = 0.2,

T_spot = T_star - 1000 K = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K,

T_star = 6000 K.

So,

0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ] = (R_p/R_s)^2.

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (0.8333)^4.

Let me calculate that:

0.8333^2 = ~0.6944,

then square that: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So,

1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.5177 = 0.1035.

So,

(R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.1035,

so R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Wait, but wait, the options are given as A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

So 0.3217 is approximately 0.32, which is option D.

But wait, hold on. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, let's recheck the steps.

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4:

0.8333^2 = 0.6944,

0.6944^2 = 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.5177 = 0.1035.

Square root is sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, which is approximately 0.32.

Which is option D.

So the correct answer would be D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spotted regions, we compare the amplitude of the brightness changes caused by the spots and the planet.

### Key Parameters:
- **Star's effective temperature**: \( T_{\text{star}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)
- **Spot temperature**: \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{star}} - 1000 = 5000 \, \text{K} \)
- **Filling factor of spots**: \( f = 0.2 \)
- **Star's radius**: \( R_{\text{star}} \) (equal to the Sun's radius)

### Brightness Variation Due to Spots:
The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is given by:

\[
\text{Amplitude}_{\text{spot}} = f \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}} \right)^4 \right]
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Amplitude}_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right]
\]

First, calculate \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):
\[
\frac{5000}{6000} = 0.8333, \quad \left( 0.8333 \right)^2 = 0.6944, \quad \left( 0.6944 \right)^2 = 0.4823
\]

Thus:
\[
\text{Amplitude}_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \left[ 1 - 0.4823 \right] = 0.2 \times 0.5177 = 0.1035
\]

### Brightness Variation Due to a Planet:
The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:

\[
\text{Amplitude}_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]

To match the amplitude of the spots, set \( \text{Amplitude}_{\text{spot}} = \text{Amplitude}_{\text{planet}} \):
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217
\]

### Final Answer:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to **Option D**.
