Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with stars, the concept of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is important. LTE implies that the gas in the photosphere behaves like a blackbody at a certain temperature, right?

The problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think this relates to the Boltzmann distribution, which deals with the distribution of particles in energy states in a system at thermal equilibrium.

So, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The equation is something like the ratio of populations in two energy states being proportional to the exponential of the negative of the energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, the exact formula is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Since the energy difference is given, and we're comparing the same transition in two different stars, I can set up the ratios for each star.

For star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Let me denote the excitation as the number of atoms in the higher energy level. So for star_1, the ratio is n1_high / n1_low = 2. For star_2, it's n2_high / n2_low = 1, because it's half as excited? Wait, no, wait, wait. The problem says "twice as excited"—so star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2. So if star_2 has a certain level of excitation, star_1 has double that. Oh, but in terms of the ratio, maybe it's (n_high/n_low) is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, no, actually, the ratio would be (n_high / n_low) = 2 for star_1, and (n_high / n_low) = 1 for star_2. Because star_1 has twice the excitation, meaning more atoms are in the higher energy level relative to the lower one.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the transition rates or the populations. The excitation is about the population in the excited state. So if star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited, that means the ratio (n_high / n_low) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, another approach. Let me write the Boltzmann equation for both stars.

For star 1:
n1_high / n1_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2:
n2_high / n2_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem states that the excitation is twice as much for star_1. So perhaps the ratio for star 1 is twice that of star 2. So:

n1_high / n1_low = 2 * (n2_high / n2_low )

So substituting the equations we have:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, that seems right. Now, taking natural logs on both sides would help. Let's do that.

ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) = ln( 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

So, rearranging terms:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = ln(2 )

Hmm, but I can factor this as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, let me compute 1/T2 - 1/T1:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 )

So substitution gives:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the question gives me the energy difference ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. I know that Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, wait, that's the same number. So k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE = k * T_0, where T_0 would be 1 K, but wait no, because ΔE = k * something.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So ΔE/(k) is 1 K.

So substituting back into the equation:

(1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) ) * K?

Wait, wait, because (1 K) * [ (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2). So dividing both sides by 1 K:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) * (1 K) ) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let me see:

We have:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J)/(1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So substituting:

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Dividing both sides by 1 K:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) * K? Wait, no, because the left side is dimensionless. Wait, wait, T is in Kelvin, so T1-T2 has units of K, and T1 T2 has units K². So (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) has units K/(K²) ) = 1/K.

Wait, but the right side is ln(2), which is unitless. So I must have made a mistake in the units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should retrace. Let me re-derive the equation.

We have:

n1_high / n1_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

n2_high / n2_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Given that n1_high / n1_low = 2 * (n2_high / n2_low )

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

ΔE/(k) * ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Now, since ΔE is 1.38e-23 J and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So substituting:

1 K * ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Multiply both sides by 1 K:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 ) / (1 K) * K? Wait, no, because the left side is in K/(K^2) ) → 1/K.

Wait, perhaps the equation is:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / ( ΔE/(k) )

But since ΔE/(k)=1 K, then:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / 1 K → which would have units 1/K.

Hmm, but this doesn't make sense because ln(2) is unitless. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equation correctly. Let me write it again:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But ΔE/(k) = 1 K, so:

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But K is the unit, so 1 K * [ (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] equals ln(2), which is unitless. That can't be right because the left side has units K * [1/(K^2)] ) → 1/K.

Wait, perhaps I should have all quantities unitless. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should write the equation in terms of T1 and T2 without units for the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should rearrange the equation differently.

So, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / (ΔE/(k) )

Since ΔE/(k) is 1 K, the denominator is 1 K.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) → (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (1/K)

Wait, that can't be right because T1 and T2 are in K. So the left side has units (K) / (K^2) ) → 1/K.

So both sides have units 1/K. So that's okay.

But the equation is:

(T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / (ΔE/(k) )

Which is:

(T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / (1 K )

But since K is unit, 1 K is a unit. So perhaps the equation is correct.

But, looking at the options, none of them have a 1/K factor. So perhaps I should consider that.

Wait, perhaps the equation is:

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / (ΔE/(k) )

But since ΔE/(k) is 1 K, this becomes:

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / (1 K )

But the units on the left are 1/K, and the right side is (ln(2))/(K), which is 1/K.

So that's okay. But how does this tie into the answer options?

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But that's not matching our equation.

Wait, our equation is:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / (1 K )

But without the K, how can that be?

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the setup. Let me go back.

Alternative approach:

Wait, maybe the excitation is twice as much, so the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, (n_high/n_low)_1 = 2 * (n_high/n_low)_2.

So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking ln on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Bring the ΔE/(k T2) to the left:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2 )

Which is:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2 )

Again, as before, since ΔE/(k) is 1 K:

[ (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2) / (1 K )

Hmm, but none of the options show a division by K. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the ratio.

Wait, another thought: maybe the ratio is (n_high/n_low) for star_1 is 2/(n_high/n_low of star_2). That is, n1_high/n1_low = 2 / (n2_high/n2_low )

Wait, but the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So if star_2 has a ratio R, then star_1 has ratio 2R.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of occupation numbers.

Or perhaps, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But I think that's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the Boltzmann factor for star_1 is higher than for star_2. Because higher temperature would lead to a higher population in the excited states.

Wait, let's think about what the equation says. If star_1 has higher temperature than star_2, then star_1 would have a higher ratio of n_high to n_low.

So, the ratio for star_1 is higher. So, if star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2, then:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Which is the same as before.

So, going back, we have the equation:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / (1 K )

But none of the options have a 1/K. So perhaps the problem didn't require solving for K, but just the relation between T1 and T2. Let me see.

Wait, the problem asks for the equation that relates T1 and T2. So in the options, they probably have the equation without considering the K, or perhaps K is incorporated in the ΔE.

Wait, wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly the same as k (1.38e-23 J/K). So, ΔE = k. So, ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So, the equation simplifies to:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K )

But that would imply that the left side is in 1/K units, but the right side is (ln2) * (1/K). Hmm, I'm stuck because the options don't have any K in them.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me think again about the problem statement.

Wait, it says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Wait, that might imply that the excitation energy is twice as much. But excitation energy per atom or the number of excited atoms?

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is in terms of the ionization, but I think it's about the population in the energy levels.

Wait, perhaps the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, n_high_1 = 2 * n_high_2.

But in that case, the ratio (n_high/(n_low)) would not necessarily be twice. Because n_high depends on both the excitation and the total population.

Hmm, perhaps that's complicating it more. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the excitation potential being twice as high, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Boltzmann factor. The ratio of populations is given by:

n_high/n_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, for star_1, this ratio is twice that of star_2.

So,

n_high_1/n_low_1 = 2 * (n_high_2/n_low_2 )

Which gives:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking natural log:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2 )

Which is same as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

So, since ΔE = k, ΔE/(k ) is 1 K. So:

( (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 ) / (1 K )

But again, we're stuck because the equation has 1/K on the left but ln(2) on the right. This suggests that perhaps the conclusion is that T1 > T2, as a higher temperature would lead to more excitation.

But looking at the options, none of them have a division by K. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is set in a way that the K units cancel out.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the units. Let me think: the equation is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)/(k) * ΔE.

Wait, no, because ΔE = k, so:

(T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k)/(k) ) → ln(2) * 1.

So, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Ah, that makes sense! Because ΔE = k, so ΔE/(k) is 1. So the equation simplifies to:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

So, the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Wait, no, no. Let's do it again:

We have:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But ΔE/(k) is 1, so:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

So, ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which is the same as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So that's the correct equation.

To solve the problem, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the ratio of populations in two energy states in a system at thermal equilibrium. The ratio of populations is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
\]

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation levels are related by the problem statement. Specifically, the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. This implies:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}}_{\text{star}_1} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}}_{\text{star}_2}
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2)
\]

Factoring out \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), and Boltzmann's constant \(k\) is also \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}
\]

Substituting this into the equation:

\[
1 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Answer: D

Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with stars, the concept of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is important.

For star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Let me denote the excitation as the number of atoms in the higher energy level. So for star_1, the ratio is n1_high / n1_low = 2. For star_2, it's n2_high / n2_low = 1, because it's half as excited? Wait, no, wait, wait. The problem says "twice as excited"—so star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2. So if star_2 has a certain level of excitation, star_1 has double that. Oh, but in terms of the ratio, maybe it's (n_high/n_low) is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

For star 1:
n1_high / n1_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2:
n2_high / n2_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem states that the excitation is twice as much for star_1. So perhaps the ratio for star 1 is twice that of star 2. So:

n1_high / n1_low = 2 * (n2_high / n2_low )

So substituting the equations we have:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, that seems right. Now, taking natural logs on both sides would help. Let's do that.

ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) = ln( 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

So, rearranging terms:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = ln(2 )

Hmm, but I can factor this as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, let me compute 1/T2 - 1/T1:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 )

So substitution gives:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the question gives me the energy difference ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. I know that Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, wait, that's the same number. So k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE = k * T_0, where T_0 would be 1 K, but wait no, because ΔE = k * something.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So ΔE/(k) is 1 K.

So substituting back into the equation:

(1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) ) * K?

Wait, wait, because (1 K) * [ (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2). So dividing both sides by 1 K:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) * (1 K) ) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let me see:

We have:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J)/(1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So substituting:

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Dividing both sides by 1 K:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) * K? Wait, no, because the left side is dimensionless. Wait, wait, T is in Kelvin, so T1-T2 has units of K, and T1 T2 has units K². So (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) has units K/(K²) ) = 1/K.

Wait, but the right side is ln(2), which is unitless. So I must have made a mistake in the units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should retrace. Let me re-derive the equation.

We have:

n1_high / n1_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

n2_high / n2_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Given that n1_high / n1_low = 2 * (n2_high / n2_low )

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

ΔE/(k) * ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Now, since ΔE is 1.38e-23 J and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So substituting:

1 K * ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Multiply both sides by 1 K:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 ) / (1 K) * K? Wait, no, because the left side is in K/(K^2) ) → 1/K.

Wait, perhaps the equation is:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / ( ΔE/(k) )

But since ΔE/(k)=1 K, then:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / 1 K → which would have units 1/K.

Hmm, but this doesn't make sense because ln(2) is unitless. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equation correctly. Let me write it again:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But ΔE/(k) = 1 K, so:

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But K is the unit, so 1 K * [ (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] equals ln(2), which is unitless. That can't be right because the left side has units K * [1/(K^2)] ) → 1/K.

Wait, perhaps I should have all quantities unitless. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should write the equation in terms of T1 and T2 without units for the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should rearrange the equation differently.

So, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / (ΔE/(k) )

Since ΔE/(k) is 1 K, the denominator is 1 K.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) → (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (1/K)

Wait, that can't be right because T1 and T2 are in K. So the left side has units (K) / (K^2) ) → 1/K.

So both sides have units 1/K. So that's okay.

But the equation is:

(T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / (ΔE/(k) )

Which is:

(T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / (1 K )

But since K is unit, 1 K is a unit. So perhaps the equation is correct.

But, looking at the options, none of them have a 1/K factor. So perhaps I should consider that.

Wait, perhaps the equation is:

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / (ΔE/(k) )

But since ΔE/(k) is 1 K, this becomes:

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / (1 K )

But the units on the left are 1/K, and the right side is (ln(2))/(K), which is 1/K.

So that's okay. But how does this tie into the answer options?

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But that's not matching our equation.

Wait, our equation is:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / (1 K )

But without the K, how can that be?

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the setup. Let me go back.

Alternative approach:

Wait, maybe the excitation is twice as much, so the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, (n_high/n_low)_1 = 2 * (n_high/n_low)_2.

So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking ln on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Bring the ΔE/(k T2) to the left:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2 )

Which is:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2 )

Again, as before, since ΔE/(k) is 1 K:

[ (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2) / (1 K )

Hmm, but none of the options show a division by K. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the ratio.

Wait, another thought: maybe the ratio is (n_high/n_low) for star_1 is 2/(n_high/n_low of star_2). That is, n1_high/n1_low = 2 / (n2_high/n2_low )

Wait, but the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So if star_2 has a ratio R, then star_1 has ratio 2R.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of occupation numbers.

Or perhaps, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But I think that's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the Boltzmann factor for star_1 is higher than for star_2. Because higher temperature would lead to a higher population in the excited states.

Wait, let's think about what the equation says. If star_1 has higher temperature than star_2, then star_1 would have a higher ratio of n_high to n_low.

So, the ratio for star_1 is higher. So, if star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2, then:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Which is the same as before.

So, going back, we have the equation:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / (1 K )

But none of the options have a 1/K. So perhaps the problem didn't require solving for K, but just the relation between T1 and T2. Let me see.

Wait, the problem asks for the equation that relates T1 and T2. So in the options, they probably have the equation without considering the K, or perhaps K is incorporated in the ΔE.

Wait, wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly the same as k (1.38e-23 J/K). So, ΔE = k. So, ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So, the equation simplifies to:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K )

But that would imply that the left side is in 1/K units, but the right side is (ln2) * (1/K). Hmm, I'm stuck because the options don't have any K in them.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me think again about the problem statement.

Wait, it says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Wait, that might imply that the excitation energy is twice as much. But excitation energy per atom or the number of excited atoms?

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is in terms of the ionization, but I think it's about the population in the energy levels.

Wait, perhaps the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, n_high_1 = 2 * n_high_2.

But in that case, the ratio (n_high/(n_low)) would not necessarily be twice. Because n_high depends on both the excitation and the total population.

Hmm, perhaps that's complicating it more. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the excitation potential being twice as high, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Boltzmann factor. The ratio of populations is given by:

n_high/n_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, for star_1, this ratio is twice that of star_2.

So,

n_high_1/n_low_1 = 2 * (n_high_2/n_low_2 )

Which gives:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking natural log:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2 )

Which is same as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

So, since ΔE = k, ΔE/(k ) is 1 K. So:

( (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 ) / (1 K )

But again, we're stuck because the equation has 1/K on the left but ln(2) on the right. This suggests that perhaps the conclusion is that T1 > T2, as a higher temperature would lead to more excitation.

But looking at the options, none of them have a division by K. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is set in a way that the K units cancel out.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the units. Let me think: the equation is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)/(k) * ΔE.

Wait, no, because ΔE = k, so:

(T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k)/(k) ) → ln(2) * 1.

So, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Ah, that makes sense! Because ΔE = k, so ΔE/(k) is 1. So the equation simplifies to:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

So, the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Wait, no, no. Let's do it again:

We have:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But ΔE/(k) is 1, so:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

So, ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which is the same as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So that's the correct equation.


To solve the problem, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the ratio of populations in two energy states in a system at thermal equilibrium. The ratio of populations is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
\]

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation levels are related by the problem statement. Specifically, the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. This implies:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}}_{\text{star}_1} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}}_{\text{star}_2}
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2)
\]

Factoring out \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), and Boltzmann's constant \(k\) is also \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}
\]

Substituting this into the equation:

\[
1 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Answer: D
