Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about two reactions performed by a chemist using different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, looking again, the products are the same but with different configurations. Or wait, no, in the question, for each reaction, the product is either R or S form. 

Let me parse this again. The first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+ on compound A to give (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The second reaction uses BH3 and H+ on compound B to give (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So both reduce different starting materials to the same ketone but with opposite configurations. Hmm.

Wait, wait, but wait: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for reducing carbonyl groups. BH3 is also a reducing agent, but maybe in a different context. Oh, wait, BH3 is usually used in the hydroboration reaction. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, LiBH4 is a borohydride reducing agent, which reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. But in this case, the product is a tetrahydro pyranone. Wait, so perhaps the starting material is an epoxide or something else.

Wait, no. Tetrahydro pyran-2-one is a cyclic hemiacetal, I think. Maybe it's a cyclic ether. Wait, no, tetrahydro pyran-2-one would be a six-membered ring with one oxygen (like a cyclic ether but with a ketone group). So the product is a cyclic ketone.

Wait, but how do we get that from a reaction with LiBH4 and H+? Hmm. Oh wait, maybe the starting material is an ester or a ketone that upon reduction forms the cyclic product. Wait, or perhaps the starting material is an epoxide. No, wait, the product is a pyranone, which is a lactone. Oh, right, so maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester or something that can cyclize upon reduction.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about what each reagent does. LiBH4 is used for reducing carbonyl groups. BH3 is commonly used in hydroboration reactions, which are used to reduce alkenes to alcohols with anti-Markovnikov addition. But wait, in the presence of H+, maybe they're doing something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters. For example, if you have an ester group, and you reduce it with a hydride agent, you might form an alcohol. But how does that form a cyclic ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are epoxides. Wait, but LiBH4 wouldn't typically open epoxides. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are gamma-lactones or something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides that upon ring-opening form alcohols which then cyclize. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketones.

Wait, no, maybe the starting materials are aldehydes or ketones that form cyclic hemiacetals upon reduction. Hmm. Or perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reducing agents are opening them.

Wait, but let's think about the product: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The structure would be a six-membered ring (since pyran is a six-membered ring), with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, so imagine a six-membered ring: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Position 2 is a carbonyl group (the ketone), and position 4 has an ethyl substituent.

How would that form from a reduction? Maybe from an epoxide. Oh, wait, if you have an epoxide, and you open it with a hydride, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening via a different mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals or acetals. Alternatively, maybe they are esters that form the cyclic product upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. For example, if you have an ester where the carbonyl is at the gamma position, maybe upon reduction, it forms a diol which cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha,beta-epoxy ketone. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry. The products are (R) and (S) configurations. So the starting materials must determine the configuration of the product.

Wait, the reactions are:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-product

B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-product

So what's the effect of the reagents on the configuration?

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, which are stereospecific and form alcohols with specific configurations.

Wait, but wait, in this problem, perhaps the reactions are not reducing alkenes but are doing something else. Let me think: LiBH4 is typically used for reducing esters, amides, ketones, etc., to alcohols. So if the starting material is a ketone, LiBH4 would reduce it to a secondary alcohol.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. So maybe the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol which then cyclizes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide that, upon ring-opening, leads to the formation of the cyclic ketone.

Wait, another angle: the product is a six-membered ring with a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a gamma-hydroxy ester, which upon elimination forms a cyclic ketone.

Wait, but the reagents are LiBH4 and H+. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal which upon reduction forms the ring-opened product.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible structures of A and B.

The options given for A and B are (S) or (R) configurations of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, so the structure is a pentanoic acid with substituents at positions 3 and 5.

So, the structure would be: 

COOH-CH2-C(OCH(CH2)2)–CH2–CH2–?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Position 1: COOH

Then at position 3: ethyl group (CH2CH2CH3? No, ethyl is CH2CH3. So maybe at position 3, it's CH2CH2CH3? Wait, the formula says 3-ethyl, which is an ethyl group on carbon 3.

At position 5: isobutoxy and oxo groups. Isobutoxy is OCH(CH2)2. So the substituent is OCH(CH2)2. So position 5 has an OCH(CH2)2 group and an oxo group (which is a ketone group, C=O). Wait, but the same carbon can't have both OCH(CH2)2 and C=O. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a diastereomer. So the compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So on carbon 5, there's a ketone and an isobutoxy group. That would mean that the carbon 5 has two substituents: OCH(CH2)2 and a carbonyl group (C=O). But that's only possible if the structure is:

At carbon 5: C(O) and OCH(CH2)2. So it's (CH2)2C(O)OCH(CH2)2? Hmm, but wait, the formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents. Let me number the pentanoic acid as follows: positions 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5.

Wait, wait. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the substituents are on carbons 3 and 5.

Carbon 3: ethyl group (CH2CH3). So on carbon 3, which is the third carbon from the COOH end, there's an ethyl group. Carbon 5 is the fifth carbon, but wait, pentanoic acid is only five carbons. Wait, perhaps I should number from the other end. Alternatively, maybe the structure is as follows: the acid is at position 1, and the substituents are at positions 3 and 5.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH(OCH(CH2)2)-something. Wait, but the substituents at position 5 are oxo and isobutoxy.

Wait, perhaps the structure is better drawn as:

The compound is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the molecule is a pentanoic acid where:

- Carbon 3 has an ethyl group (CH2CH3).
- Carbon 5 has both an isobutoxy group and an oxo group (so, a carbonyl group).

Wait, but wait, carbon 5 in a pentanoic acid is the second carbon from the COOH group. Wait, no. Let me think: pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the carbons are 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5.

Wait, no: actually, in pentanoic acid, it's CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, so the first carbon is COOH, second is CH2, third CH2, fourth CH2, fifth CH3.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are on carbon 3 and 5.

So, for 3-ethyl substitution, carbon 3 would have an ethyl group, but wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So carbon 3 is the third carbon from COOH, which is the third CH2.

So 3-ethyl would mean replacing one of the H's on that CH2 with an ethyl group. So the structure would be COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-O-something? Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(OCH(CH2)2)-C(=O)OH? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about the reaction leading to the product.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the product is a cyclic ketone. So, perhaps the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but what's the role of the reducing agents here? LiBH4 is a strong hydride donor. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration, but perhaps in this case, it's being used as a hydride donor as well.

Wait, another approach: when a cyclic hemiacetal is reduced with LiBH4, perhaps it opens up to form a diol, which can then cyclize again, but that might not directly lead to the product.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an epoxide. LiBH4 could open the epoxide to form an alcohol, but then how would that form the cyclic ketone?

Wait, let me think about the product again. The product is a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4.

So, the ring is O-C-C-C-C-C-O, but that's a cyclic ether. No, wait, the product is tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, but the -2-one means the ketone is at position 2.

So the structure is a six-membered ring with O at position 1, ketone at position 2, and ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, so positions 1 (O), 2 (C=O), 4 (CH2CH2CH3?), and the ring is saturated (tetrahydro).

So, the ring is:

O-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, but that's six atoms in the ring. So positions 1: O, 2: C=O, 3: CH2, 4: CH2, 5: CH(CH2CH3), 6: CH2.

Wait, but the ethyl is at position 4, so maybe position 4 is CH2CH2CH3? Or perhaps it's CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C1-O-C2(=O)-C3H2-C4H2-C5H(CH2CH3)-C6H2 ?

Hmm, regardless, the product is a cyclic ketone.

Now, going back to the starting material, which is a pentanoic acid derivative. The options are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid with different configurations (S or R).

So, the structure would be a pentanoic acid where:

- Carbon 3 has an ethyl group (CH2CH3)
- Carbon 5 has an isobutoxy group (OCH(CH2)2) and a ketone (C=O)

Wait, but that's two substituents on the same carbon. Wait, no, carbon 5 is in a pentanoic acid, so it's the fifth carbon. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, so the chain is five carbons. So the substituents are on carbons 3 and 5.

So, 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid would mean that on carbon 5, which is the CH2 group before COOH, you have both an isobutoxy group and a carbonyl group.

Wait, but that would make the structure something like:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-OCH(CH2)2 ?

No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(OCH(CH2)2)-C=O ?

Wait, but that would require the fifth carbon to have a carbonyl, which would be the same as the COOH group. Hmm, maybe the structure is more like:

The acid is at position 1.

Positions:

1: COOH

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH2CH3)-

4: C(OCH(CH2)2)-

5: C(=O) ?

Wait, but that leaves the fifth carbon as a carbonyl group, making it a six-carbon acid, which contradicts. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure. But I'm not getting it right, perhaps I should think about the reaction.

The product is formed by the reduction of the starting material. So the starting material must have a carbonyl group that gets reduced. But the product is a cyclic ketone, meaning that the starting material's reduction must form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester. For example, if the starting material is an ester with a structure that, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (a lactone) which opens upon reduction.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester which, upon reduction, forms a diol that cyclizes.

Wait, let's think: a gamma-keto ester has the structure RCOCH2COOR', where the gamma position is the one next to the carbonyl. Upon reduction, the gamma-keto ester would form a secondary alcohol. But how would that form a cyclic ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that, upon reduction, forms the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with some substituents which upon reaction with LiBH4 or BH3 form the product.

I'm a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry. The problem is about the configuration of the starting materials leading to R or S configuration in the product.

Wait, the products are (R) and (S) configurations. So the configuration at the stereogenic center in the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent's approach.

Wait, in the case of LiBH4 reducing a ketone, it's a hydride attack on the carbonyl carbon. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, which is a planar sp² hybridized, leading to the formation of an alcohol with inversion of configuration if there's a chiral center.

Wait, but in the product, the configuration is determined by the starting material's configuration and the reduction's stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. For example, a cyclic hemiacetal with a chiral center. When you reduce the carbonyl group, the hydride would attack from a specific face, determining the configuration of the product.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, which is formed perhaps via a ring-opening reaction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide. Let's say that in one reaction, the epoxide opens with LiBH4, and in the other with BH3, leading to different configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or ketal, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes.

Wait, another thought: the product is a tetrahydro pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ether with a ketone. So the product could have formed from an acetal or ketal.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha,beta-epoxy ketone. So, for example, the structure would be an epoxide adjacent to a ketone. When you reduce the epoxide with LiBH4 or BH3, you may form a diol, which then cyclizes into the pyranone.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about the stereochemistry again.

In the reaction with LiBH4, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon. Since the starting material is a ketone, the hydride would attack from the less hindered side, leading to a specific configuration.

Wait, but in the product, the configuration is (R) or (S). So the starting material's configuration must influence whether the product is R or S.

Wait, but in the problem, the starting materials are A and B, which are different enantiomers perhaps. The same starting material in different configurations would lead to different product configurations based on the reducing agent.

Wait, perhaps the reducing agents cause different configurations because they approach differently.

Wait, LiBH4 and BH3 are different. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and typically provides hydride ions. BH3, on the other hand, might not be as strong, but in this case, perhaps the reaction conditions are such that they both act as hydride donors.

Wait, another thought: when BH3 is used, perhaps it's in a different solvent or under different conditions, leading to different stereochemistry in the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reducing agents open them with different stereochemistry.

Wait, but LiBH4 is not typically used to open epoxides. Alternatively, perhaps the reactions are not opening epoxides, but reducing esters to alcohols, which then form the cyclic product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals. When reduced, they form diols, which then cyclize.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should think about the options given and see which configurations of A and B would lead to the desired R and S products.

The options are:

A) A and B are both (S) configuration.

B) Both are (R).

C) A is (S), B is (R).

D) A is (R), B is (S).

So the question is, when A is treated with LiBH4 and H+, you get R configuration. When B is treated with BH3 and H+, you get S.

So the configuration of the starting material must influence the product's configuration based on the reagent used.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are gamma-keto esters. When reduced, the ester group is converted into an alcohol, which could form a cyclic structure.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Alternatively, perhaps the key is that LiBH4 is a bulkier reagent, leading to different attack than BH3. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the configuration of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the approach of the reducing agent.

If the starting material is R, then LiBH4 would reduce it in a certain way, perhaps leading to R product. Similarly, if starting material is S, then with BH3, it leads to S product.

Alternatively, the reagents might cause inversion or retention of configuration.

Wait, when a chiral ketone is reduced by LiBH4, the hydride attacks from the less hindered face, leading to a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a chiral ketone. For example, if the starting material is (R)-configured, then LiBH4 would reduce it to (R) product, while BH3 would reduce it to (S) product, depending on which face the hydride attacks.

But in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that the reduction forms the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon reduction forms the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the options.

Looking at the options, for each starting material, the configuration is either R or S. When A is treated with LiBH4, it gives R. When B is treated with BH3, it gives S.

So, perhaps the configuration of A is R, and when reduced with LiBH4, it gives R product. Similarly, if B is S, when reduced with BH3, it gives S product.

So if A is R, and B is S, then option D is A=R, B=S.

Option D says A is (R) and B is (S).

Wait, but why would A and B have different configurations? Because the reagents are different.

Wait, perhaps the reagents cause the product to have opposite configurations based on the same starting material. But in this case, the starting materials are different.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers. So A is R, B is S.

So when A is reduced with LiBH4, you get R product. When B is reduced with BH3, you get S product.

So looking at the options, option D is A=R, B=S.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions (reagent) influence the face of attack, leading to different configurations.

Wait, but another thought: LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and may cause more inversion or different stereochemistry than BH3.

But I'm not exactly sure. Maybe the key is that the reaction with LiBH4 leads to one configuration, and with BH3 leads to another, depending on the starting material's configuration.

If the starting material is R, and the reagent leads to the same configuration, then A is R and gives R product. If B is S, and the reagent leads to S product, then option D (A=R, B=S) would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents cause inversion. So if the starting material is R, LiBH4 would give S, but the product is R, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the mechanism of reduction.

When a ketone is reduced to an alcohol, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered side. So if the starting material is a chiral ketone with a certain configuration, the hydride will attack from the less hindered face, leading to a specific configuration in the product.

Suppose the starting material has a configuration that makes the less hindered face for the hydride attack from a certain direction, leading to R or S.

In this problem, the product's configuration depends on the starting material's configuration and the reagent's approach.

If the starting material is R, and the hydride attacks from a certain face, the product would be R. If the starting material is S, and the hydride attacks from the opposite face, the product would be S.

Wait, but in our problem, the product from A is R, and from B is S. So perhaps A is S and B is R, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, A is R and B is S.

Wait, perhaps the reagents cause different facial attacks. For example, LiBH4 approaches from the top face, while BH3 approaches from the bottom, leading to opposite configurations.

If the starting material is R, then LiBH4 (top attack) gives R product, and BH3 (bottom attack) gives S product.

So in this scenario, the same starting material when reduced with different reagents would give different configurations.

Wait, but in the question, A and B are different starting materials, not the same. So perhaps A and B are enantiomers. So when A (R) is reduced with LiBH4, gives R product. When B (S) is reduced with BH3, gives S product.

So the options would be that A is R and B is S.

Looking at the options, option D is A=R, B=S.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is opposite. Let me think: if A is S and B is R, then when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives R, and when B is treated with BH3, it gives S. But that would require that the same starting material gives opposite products, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: the product is formed by the reduction of the starting material. The configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product based on the reagents.

Assuming that LiBH4 and BH3 are used under conditions that lead to opposite configurations when the starting materials are enantiomers.

So, if A is R and B is S (enantiomers), then when A is reduced with LiBH4, the product is R. When B is reduced with BH3, the product is S.

So the correct option would be option D: A is R, B is S.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions where different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, are used to reduce two unknown starting materials, A and B, to produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The key is to determine the configurations of A and B that lead to these products.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reagents and Reaction Mechanism**:
   - LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that donates hydride ions, typically reducing carbonyl groups to alcohols. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the face of the carbonyl group attacked by the hydride.
   - BH3 is less commonly used as a hydride donor but can also reduce carbonyl groups. The stereochemical outcome may differ due to differences in reaction conditions or steric effects.

2. **Product Stereochemistry**:
   - The product (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed when A is treated with LiBH4.
   - The product (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed when B is treated with BH3.

3. **Starting Material Configurations**:
   - The starting materials A and B are enantiomers of the compound (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid). This means they have opposite configurations (one is R, and the other is S).
   - The configuration of the starting material determines the stereochemistry of the product because the hydride attack occurs from the less hindered face of the carbonyl group.

4. **Determining A and B**:
   - If A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, treatment with LiBH4 would result in the (R)-product due to the specific stereochemical outcome of the reduction.
   - If B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, treatment with BH3 would result in the (S)-product for the same reason.

5. **Correct Option**:
   - Based on the above reasoning, A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **D**, where A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about two reactions performed by a chemist using different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, looking again, the products are the same but with different configurations. Or wait, no, in the question, for each reaction, the product is either R or S form. 

Let me parse this again. The first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+ on compound A to give (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The second reaction uses BH3 and H+ on compound B to give (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So both reduce different starting materials to the same ketone but with opposite configurations. Hmm.

Wait, wait, but wait: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for reducing carbonyl groups. BH3 is also a reducing agent, but maybe in a different context. Oh, wait, BH3 is usually used in the hydroboration reaction. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, LiBH4 is a borohydride reducing agent, which reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. But in this case, the product is a tetrahydro pyranone. Wait, so perhaps the starting material is an epoxide or something else.

Wait, no. Tetrahydro pyran-2-one is a cyclic hemiacetal, I think. Maybe it's a cyclic ether. Wait, no, tetrahydro pyran-2-one would be a six-membered ring with one oxygen (like a cyclic ether but with a ketone group). So the product is a cyclic ketone.

Wait, but how do we get that from a reaction with LiBH4 and H+? Hmm. Oh wait, maybe the starting material is an ester or a ketone that upon reduction forms the cyclic product. Wait, or perhaps the starting material is an epoxide. No, wait, the product is a pyranone, which is a lactone. Oh, right, so maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester or something that can cyclize upon reduction.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about what each reagent does. LiBH4 is used for reducing carbonyl groups. BH3 is commonly used in hydroboration reactions, which are used to reduce alkenes to alcohols with anti-Markovnikov addition. But wait, in the presence of H+, maybe they're doing something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters. For example, if you have an ester group, and you reduce it with a hydride agent, you might form an alcohol. But how does that form a cyclic ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are epoxides. Wait, but LiBH4 wouldn't typically open epoxides. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are gamma-lactones or something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides that upon ring-opening form alcohols which then cyclize. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketones.

Wait, no, maybe the starting materials are aldehydes or ketones that form cyclic hemiacetals upon reduction. Hmm. Or perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reducing agents are opening them.

Wait, but let's think about the product: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The structure would be a six-membered ring (since pyran is a six-membered ring), with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, so imagine a six-membered ring: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Position 2 is a carbonyl group (the ketone), and position 4 has an ethyl substituent.

How would that form from a reduction? Maybe from an epoxide. Oh, wait, if you have an epoxide, and you open it with a hydride, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening via a different mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals or acetals. Alternatively, maybe they are esters that form the cyclic product upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. For example, if you have an ester where the carbonyl is at the gamma position, maybe upon reduction, it forms a diol which cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha,beta-epoxy ketone. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry. The products are (R) and (S) configurations. So the starting materials must determine the configuration of the product.

Wait, the reactions are:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-product

B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-product

So what's the effect of the reagents on the configuration?

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, which are stereospecific and form alcohols with specific configurations.

Wait, but wait, in this problem, perhaps the reactions are not reducing alkenes but are doing something else. Let me think: LiBH4 is typically used for reducing esters, amides, ketones, etc., to alcohols. So if the starting material is a ketone, LiBH4 would reduce it to a secondary alcohol.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. So maybe the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol which then cyclizes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide that, upon ring-opening, leads to the formation of the cyclic ketone.

Wait, another angle: the product is a six-membered ring with a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a gamma-hydroxy ester, which upon elimination forms a cyclic ketone.

Wait, but the reagents are LiBH4 and H+. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal which upon reduction forms the ring-opened product.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible structures of A and B.

The options given for A and B are (S) or (R) configurations of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, so the structure is a pentanoic acid with substituents at positions 3 and 5.

So, the structure would be: 

COOH-CH2-C(OCH(CH2)2)–CH2–CH2–?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Position 1: COOH

Then at position 3: ethyl group (CH2CH2CH3? No, ethyl is CH2CH3. So maybe at position 3, it's CH2CH2CH3? Wait, the formula says 3-ethyl, which is an ethyl group on carbon 3.

At position 5: isobutoxy and oxo groups. Isobutoxy is OCH(CH2)2. So the substituent is OCH(CH2)2. So position 5 has an OCH(CH2)2 group and an oxo group (which is a ketone group, C=O). Wait, but the same carbon can't have both OCH(CH2)2 and C=O. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a diastereomer. So the compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So on carbon 5, there's a ketone and an isobutoxy group. That would mean that the carbon 5 has two substituents: OCH(CH2)2 and a carbonyl group (C=O). But that's only possible if the structure is:

At carbon 5: C(O) and OCH(CH2)2. So it's (CH2)2C(O)OCH(CH2)2? Hmm, but wait, the formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents. Let me number the pentanoic acid as follows: positions 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5.

Wait, wait. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the substituents are on carbons 3 and 5.

Carbon 3: ethyl group (CH2CH3). So on carbon 3, which is the third carbon from the COOH end, there's an ethyl group. Carbon 5 is the fifth carbon, but wait, pentanoic acid is only five carbons. Wait, perhaps I should number from the other end. Alternatively, maybe the structure is as follows: the acid is at position 1, and the substituents are at positions 3 and 5.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH(OCH(CH2)2)-something. Wait, but the substituents at position 5 are oxo and isobutoxy.

Wait, perhaps the structure is better drawn as:

The compound is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the molecule is a pentanoic acid where:

- Carbon 3 has an ethyl group (CH2CH3).
- Carbon 5 has both an isobutoxy group and an oxo group (so, a carbonyl group).

Wait, but wait, carbon 5 in a pentanoic acid is the second carbon from the COOH group. Wait, no. Let me think: pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the carbons are 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5.

Wait, no: actually, in pentanoic acid, it's CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, so the first carbon is COOH, second is CH2, third CH2, fourth CH2, fifth CH3.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are on carbon 3 and 5.

So, for 3-ethyl substitution, carbon 3 would have an ethyl group, but wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So carbon 3 is the third carbon from COOH, which is the third CH2.

So 3-ethyl would mean replacing one of the H's on that CH2 with an ethyl group. So the structure would be COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-O-something? Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(OCH(CH2)2)-C(=O)OH? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about the reaction leading to the product.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the product is a cyclic ketone. So, perhaps the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but what's the role of the reducing agents here? LiBH4 is a strong hydride donor. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration, but perhaps in this case, it's being used as a hydride donor as well.

Wait, another approach: when a cyclic hemiacetal is reduced with LiBH4, perhaps it opens up to form a diol, which can then cyclize again, but that might not directly lead to the product.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an epoxide. LiBH4 could open the epoxide to form an alcohol, but then how would that form the cyclic ketone?

Wait, let me think about the product again. The product is a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4.

So, the ring is O-C-C-C-C-C-O, but that's a cyclic ether. No, wait, the product is tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, but the -2-one means the ketone is at position 2.

So the structure is a six-membered ring with O at position 1, ketone at position 2, and ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, so positions 1 (O), 2 (C=O), 4 (CH2CH2CH3?), and the ring is saturated (tetrahydro).

So, the ring is:

O-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, but that's six atoms in the ring. So positions 1: O, 2: C=O, 3: CH2, 4: CH2, 5: CH(CH2CH3), 6: CH2.

Wait, but the ethyl is at position 4, so maybe position 4 is CH2CH2CH3? Or perhaps it's CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C1-O-C2(=O)-C3H2-C4H2-C5H(CH2CH3)-C6H2 ?

Hmm, regardless, the product is a cyclic ketone.

Now, going back to the starting material, which is a pentanoic acid derivative. The options are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid with different configurations (S or R).

So, the structure would be a pentanoic acid where:

- Carbon 3 has an ethyl group (CH2CH3)
- Carbon 5 has an isobutoxy group (OCH(CH2)2) and a ketone (C=O)

Wait, but that's two substituents on the same carbon. Wait, no, carbon 5 is in a pentanoic acid, so it's the fifth carbon. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, so the chain is five carbons. So the substituents are on carbons 3 and 5.

So, 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid would mean that on carbon 5, which is the CH2 group before COOH, you have both an isobutoxy group and a carbonyl group.

Wait, but that would make the structure something like:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-OCH(CH2)2 ?

No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(OCH(CH2)2)-C=O ?

Wait, but that would require the fifth carbon to have a carbonyl, which would be the same as the COOH group. Hmm, maybe the structure is more like:

The acid is at position 1.

Positions:

1: COOH

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH2CH3)-

4: C(OCH(CH2)2)-

5: C(=O) ?

Wait, but that leaves the fifth carbon as a carbonyl group, making it a six-carbon acid, which contradicts. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure. But I'm not getting it right, perhaps I should think about the reaction.

The product is formed by the reduction of the starting material. So the starting material must have a carbonyl group that gets reduced. But the product is a cyclic ketone, meaning that the starting material's reduction must form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester. For example, if the starting material is an ester with a structure that, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (a lactone) which opens upon reduction.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester which, upon reduction, forms a diol that cyclizes.

Wait, let's think: a gamma-keto ester has the structure RCOCH2COOR', where the gamma position is the one next to the carbonyl. Upon reduction, the gamma-keto ester would form a secondary alcohol. But how would that form a cyclic ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that, upon reduction, forms the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with some substituents which upon reaction with LiBH4 or BH3 form the product.

I'm a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry. The problem is about the configuration of the starting materials leading to R or S configuration in the product.

Wait, the products are (R) and (S) configurations. So the configuration at the stereogenic center in the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent's approach.

Wait, in the case of LiBH4 reducing a ketone, it's a hydride attack on the carbonyl carbon. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, which is a planar sp² hybridized, leading to the formation of an alcohol with inversion of configuration if there's a chiral center.

Wait, but in the product, the configuration is determined by the starting material's configuration and the reduction's stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. For example, a cyclic hemiacetal with a chiral center. When you reduce the carbonyl group, the hydride would attack from a specific face, determining the configuration of the product.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, which is formed perhaps via a ring-opening reaction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide. Let's say that in one reaction, the epoxide opens with LiBH4, and in the other with BH3, leading to different configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or ketal, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes.

Wait, another thought: the product is a tetrahydro pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ether with a ketone. So the product could have formed from an acetal or ketal.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha,beta-epoxy ketone. So, for example, the structure would be an epoxide adjacent to a ketone. When you reduce the epoxide with LiBH4 or BH3, you may form a diol, which then cyclizes into the pyranone.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about the stereochemistry again.

In the reaction with LiBH4, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon. Since the starting material is a ketone, the hydride would attack from the less hindered side, leading to a specific configuration.

Wait, but in the product, the configuration is (R) or (S). So the starting material's configuration must influence whether the product is R or S.

Wait, but in the problem, the starting materials are A and B, which are different enantiomers perhaps. The same starting material in different configurations would lead to different product configurations based on the reducing agent.

Wait, perhaps the reducing agents cause different configurations because they approach differently.

Wait, LiBH4 and BH3 are different. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and typically provides hydride ions. BH3, on the other hand, might not be as strong, but in this case, perhaps the reaction conditions are such that they both act as hydride donors.

Wait, another thought: when BH3 is used, perhaps it's in a different solvent or under different conditions, leading to different stereochemistry in the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reducing agents open them with different stereochemistry.

Wait, but LiBH4 is not typically used to open epoxides. Alternatively, perhaps the reactions are not opening epoxides, but reducing esters to alcohols, which then form the cyclic product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals. When reduced, they form diols, which then cyclize.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should think about the options given and see which configurations of A and B would lead to the desired R and S products.

The options are:

A) A and B are both (S) configuration.

B) Both are (R).

C) A is (S), B is (R).

D) A is (R), B is (S).

So the question is, when A is treated with LiBH4 and H+, you get R configuration. When B is treated with BH3 and H+, you get S.

So the configuration of the starting material must influence the product's configuration based on the reagent used.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are gamma-keto esters. When reduced, the ester group is converted into an alcohol, which could form a cyclic structure.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Alternatively, perhaps the key is that LiBH4 is a bulkier reagent, leading to different attack than BH3. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the configuration of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the approach of the reducing agent.

If the starting material is R, then LiBH4 would reduce it in a certain way, perhaps leading to R product. Similarly, if starting material is S, then with BH3, it leads to S product.

Alternatively, the reagents might cause inversion or retention of configuration.

Wait, when a chiral ketone is reduced by LiBH4, the hydride attacks from the less hindered face, leading to a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a chiral ketone. For example, if the starting material is (R)-configured, then LiBH4 would reduce it to (R) product, while BH3 would reduce it to (S) product, depending on which face the hydride attacks.

But in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that the reduction forms the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon reduction forms the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the options.

Looking at the options, for each starting material, the configuration is either R or S. When A is treated with LiBH4, it gives R. When B is treated with BH3, it gives S.

So, perhaps the configuration of A is R, and when reduced with LiBH4, it gives R product. Similarly, if B is S, when reduced with BH3, it gives S product.

So if A is R, and B is S, then option D is A=R, B=S.

Option D says A is (R) and B is (S).

Wait, but why would A and B have different configurations? Because the reagents are different.

Wait, perhaps the reagents cause the product to have opposite configurations based on the same starting material. But in this case, the starting materials are different.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers. So A is R, B is S.

So when A is reduced with LiBH4, you get R product. When B is reduced with BH3, you get S product.

So looking at the options, option D is A=R, B=S.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions (reagent) influence the face of attack, leading to different configurations.

Wait, but another thought: LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and may cause more inversion or different stereochemistry than BH3.

But I'm not exactly sure. Maybe the key is that the reaction with LiBH4 leads to one configuration, and with BH3 leads to another, depending on the starting material's configuration.

If the starting material is R, and the reagent leads to the same configuration, then A is R and gives R product. If B is S, and the reagent leads to S product, then option D (A=R, B=S) would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents cause inversion. So if the starting material is R, LiBH4 would give S, but the product is R, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the mechanism of reduction.

When a ketone is reduced to an alcohol, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered side. So if the starting material is a chiral ketone with a certain configuration, the hydride will attack from the less hindered face, leading to a specific configuration in the product.

Suppose the starting material has a configuration that makes the less hindered face for the hydride attack from a certain direction, leading to R or S.

In this problem, the product's configuration depends on the starting material's configuration and the reagent's approach.

If the starting material is R, and the hydride attacks from a certain face, the product would be R. If the starting material is S, and the hydride attacks from the opposite face, the product would be S.

Wait, but in our problem, the product from A is R, and from B is S. So perhaps A is S and B is R, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, A is R and B is S.

Wait, perhaps the reagents cause different facial attacks. For example, LiBH4 approaches from the top face, while BH3 approaches from the bottom, leading to opposite configurations.

If the starting material is R, then LiBH4 (top attack) gives R product, and BH3 (bottom attack) gives S product.

So in this scenario, the same starting material when reduced with different reagents would give different configurations.

Wait, but in the question, A and B are different starting materials, not the same. So perhaps A and B are enantiomers. So when A (R) is reduced with LiBH4, gives R product. When B (S) is reduced with BH3, gives S product.

So the options would be that A is R and B is S.

Looking at the options, option D is A=R, B=S.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is opposite. Let me think: if A is S and B is R, then when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives R, and when B is treated with BH3, it gives S. But that would require that the same starting material gives opposite products, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: the product is formed by the reduction of the starting material. The configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product based on the reagents.

Assuming that LiBH4 and BH3 are used under conditions that lead to opposite configurations when the starting materials are enantiomers.

So, if A is R and B is S (enantiomers), then when A is reduced with LiBH4, the product is R. When B is reduced with BH3, the product is S.

So the correct option would be option D: A is R, B is S.


The problem involves two reactions where different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, are used to reduce two unknown starting materials, A and B, to produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The key is to determine the configurations of A and B that lead to these products.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reagents and Reaction Mechanism**:
   - LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that donates hydride ions, typically reducing carbonyl groups to alcohols. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the face of the carbonyl group attacked by the hydride.
   - BH3 is less commonly used as a hydride donor but can also reduce carbonyl groups. The stereochemical outcome may differ due to differences in reaction conditions or steric effects.

2. **Product Stereochemistry**:
   - The product (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed when A is treated with LiBH4.
   - The product (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed when B is treated with BH3.

3. **Starting Material Configurations**:
   - The starting materials A and B are enantiomers of the compound (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid). This means they have opposite configurations (one is R, and the other is S).
   - The configuration of the starting material determines the stereochemistry of the product because the hydride attack occurs from the less hindered face of the carbonyl group.

4. **Determining A and B**:
   - If A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, treatment with LiBH4 would result in the (R)-product due to the specific stereochemical outcome of the reduction.
   - If B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, treatment with BH3 would result in the (S)-product for the same reason.

5. **Correct Option**:
   - Based on the above reasoning, A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **D**, where A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Answer: D
