Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubits space. The options are A, B, C, D with different position vectors.

First, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, right? But here, the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh wait, that's the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Because it's a completely mixed state, it's like a classical mixture of the two basis states.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position. I think I remember something about the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, which lies on the surface of the Bloch sphere. But for mixed states, they are inside the sphere, and the maximally mixed state is at the center.

Wait, the maximally mixed state for a qubit is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. So that should be at the origin of the Bloch sphere, right? Because the Bloch vector's coordinates would be (0,0,0) in that case. 

Let me think again. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r. The formula is (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. If the density matrix is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, that simplifies to I/2 because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is the identity matrix when you're in a two-level system. So, I/2 would correspond to the case where r is zero because (I + 0)/2 is I/2. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the center of the sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). That must be the correct answer. So the geometrical position is at the origin.

The given density matrix 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right)
\]

represents the maximally mixed state of a qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states lie on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside. For the maximally mixed state, the density matrix corresponds to the identity matrix divided by 2, which simplifies to \(\rho = I/2\). This state is represented by the Bloch vector \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), placing it at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).
