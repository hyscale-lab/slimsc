Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun, but one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the brightness changes due to these spots coming into and out of view. This is causing periodic brightness variations that look similar to those caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

The question is asking: to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve (if there were no spots), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star's radius? The options are A to D.

Hmm. So, I think I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet transit. The amplitude of the variation depends on the area blocked relative to the star's area. But wait, the spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, they make the star appear dimmer. Similarly, when a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. So the problem is essentially asking what planet size would cause the same dip as the spots do.

Wait, but wait—the spots only cover one hemisphere. So, when the star rotates, the spots come and go from view. So the maximum effect would be when the entire spot area is facing us. Wait no, because the spot covers a hemisphere, but wait, the filling factor is 20%. Oh, right, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So the total area of spots on the hemisphere is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, but the star's surface is a sphere, so the total area is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR². So the area of the spotted regions is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But wait, when the star rotates, the spots that were on the back side (the other hemisphere) come into view. But since only one hemisphere is spotty, the other hemisphere is spotless. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, which has 20% spots. So the maximum area that is covered by spots when facing us is 0.2 * 2πR²? Or is it the area of the spots themselves?

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the photometric variation. The star's brightness is affected when the spotted area is visible from Earth. The variation in brightness (the amplitude) would be proportional to the area of the spots as a fraction of the star's total area.

Wait, but the star's brightness isn't uniform because part of it is cooler. So the spots cause a dip in brightness when they're on the visible side. But the problem states that the brightness variations are due to rotational modulation, so they would vary as the spots rotate into and out of view. The amplitude depends on how much the spots dim the star.

Wait, but the question is about comparing this to a planet transit. When a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light. The dip is proportional to the area of the planet's disk over the star's disk. So the key is to find the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area that would give the same dip as the spots.

Wait, but the spots are not just a flat black—they have a lower temperature. So the change in brightness when the spots rotate into view is due to the difference in flux from the spotted area versus the normal area.

So let's model this.

First, the star's total flux without spots is F = 4πR² * sigma * Teff^4. But wait, that's the luminosity. Wait, the star emits in all directions, but when viewed from Earth, the flux is F = sigma * Teff^4 (assuming it's a black body and uniform temperature).

But when parts of the star have lower temperature, the total flux decreases. So when a spot comes into view, the flux decreases by the amount that the spot contributes.

The spot's area is A = fraction * area of hemisphere. Wait, the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4π R².

Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that is covered by spots. So for a hemisphere of 2πR², the area covered is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

Each spot has a temperature of Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

The flux without spots: F0 = sigma * (6000)^4.

The flux with a spot area A: F = F0 * (A / (4π R²)) * (5000^4 / 6000^4) + F0 * (1 - A/(4π R²)) ).

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The star's total flux is the sum of flux from the spotted regions and the unspotted regions.

Flux from spotted regions: A * sigma * T_spot^4.

Flux from unspotted regions: (4π R² - A) * sigma * T_star^4.

So the total flux is F = A * sigma * T_spot^4 + (4π R² - A) * sigma * T_star^4.

Dividing by 4π R², the flux received per unit area is (F / (4π R²)) = [A/(4π R²)] * (T_spot^4) + [1 - A/(4π R²)] * (T_star^4).

Wait, but in the case of the planet transit, the flux is reduced by the area of the planet blocking the star's light. So the dip in flux is when a planet of radius Rp blocks a part of the star's disk. The blocked area is π Rp². So the dip in flux is (π Rp² / 4π Rstar²) ) * (F0), but wait, F0 is the total flux when unobstructed.

Wait, no. The dip is the fraction of the star's area blocked, because the planet blocks the light. So the dip amplitude is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But in the case of the spots, the dip amplitude is the difference in flux when the spots are visible versus when they're not. Wait, no, because the spots are cooler, the flux is lower when they're on the visible side. So the variation in flux is the difference between flux when the spots are visible and when they're not, divided by the total flux.

So when the star's unspotted side is facing us, the flux is F0. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted.

So the dip is (F0 - F_spotted) / F0.

Hmm, let's compute that dip. Let's find (F0 - F_spotted)/F0.

F0 is the flux when the entire star is at Teff: F0 = 4π R² * sigma * (6000)^4. Wait, but when considering the flux received per unit area, the star emits as a blackbody. So perhaps I should compute the flux as F = sigma * T^4 for the entire star, but when part of it is cooler, the average flux is the average of the two areas.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the fractional change in flux when the spots are on the side we see.

The star's surface is a combination of spots and non-spots. The area of the spots is A = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². Because each hemisphere is 2π R².

Wait, no. Wait, the star is a sphere. One hemisphere is spotted, with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of spots is 0.2 multiplied by the area of the hemisphere. The hemisphere area is 2π R². So A = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

So the area of the spots is 0.4π R², and the area of the non-spots is 4π R² - 0.4π R² = 3.6π R². Wait, no, because the other hemisphere is not spotted. So the other hemisphere is 2π R², which contributes normally.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is:

F_spotted = (Area of spots * sigma * T_spot^4) + (Area of non-spots in hemisphere * sigma * T_star^4) 

Wait, but the hemisphere facing us has spots covering 20% of its area, and non-spots covering 80% of its area. So the area of the non-spots in the visible hemisphere is 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R².

So F_spotted = [0.4 π R² * sigma * (5000)^4] + [1.6 π R² * sigma * (6000)^4] 

And the total area is 4π R², so when not spotted (i.e., when we're looking at the spotless hemisphere), F0 = [2π R² * sigma (6000)^4 ] * 2. Because the other hemisphere is also spotless. Wait, no. Wait, when the star rotates, the other side (non-spotted) is showing. So F0 for the spotless view is [2π R² * sigma (6000)^4 ] * 2? No, because the star is a sphere. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Wait, let's think of F0 as the flux when the entire star is emitting at T_eff, which is 6000 K. So F0 = 4 π R² sigma (6000)^4. But when the star is showing the spotted hemisphere, the flux is F_spotted = (0.4 π R²) sigma (5000)^4 + (1.6 π R²) sigma (6000)^4.

So the dip in flux is F0 - F_spotted. The amplitude (Amp) is (F0 - F_spotted) / F0.

So let's compute Amp.

F0 = 4 π R² sigma (6000)^4.

F_spotted = [0.4 pi R² sigma (5000)^4 ] + [1.6 pi R² sigma (6000)^4 ]

We can factor pi R² sigma:

F_spotted = pi R² sigma [0.4 (5000)^4 + 1.6 (6000)^4 ]

So Amp = (F0 - F_spotted) / F0 

= [4 pi R² sigma (6000)^4 - pi R² sigma (0.4 (5000)^4 + 1.6 (6000)^4 ) ] / [4 pi R² sigma (6000)^4 ]

Simplify numerator:

= pi R² sigma [4 (6000)^4 - (0.4 (5000)^4 + 1.6 (6000)^4 ) ]

= pi R² sigma [ (4 - 1.6) (6000)^4 - 0.4 (5000)^4 ]

= pi R² sigma [ 2.4 (6000)^4 - 0.4 (5000)^4 ]

So Amp = [ 2.4 (6000)^4 - 0.4 (5000)^4 ] / (4 (6000)^4 )

Let's compute this.

First, compute each term:

(6000)^4 = (6e3)^4 = 1.296e16
(5000)^4 = (5e3)^4 = 6.25e15

So 2.4 * 1.296e16 = 3.1104e16
0.4 * 6.25e15 = 2.5e15

So numerator is 3.1104e16 - 2.5e15 = 3.1104e16 - 0.25e16 = 2.8604e16.

Denominator: 4 * 1.296e16 = 5.184e16.

So Amp = (2.8604e16) / (5.184e16) ≈ 0.552.

Wait, wait, wait—that can't be right because that's over 50% dip, which is way too high. I must have made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, 6000^4 is (6e3)^4 = (6^4) * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15? No, wait. Wait, 1e3^4 is (1e3)^4 = 1e12. So 6e3^4 is 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

Similarly, 5e3^4 is 5^4 * 1e12 = 625 *1e12 = 6.25e14.

So 2.4 * (6e3)^4 = 2.4 * 1.296e15 = 3.1104e15.

0.4 * (5e3)^4 = 0.4 * 6.25e14 = 2.5e14.

So numerator is 3.1104e15 - 2.5e14 = 3.1104e15 - 0.25e15 = 2.8604e15.

Denominator is 4 * (6e3)^4 = 4 * 1.296e15 = 5.184e15.

So Amp = 2.8604e15 / 5.184e15 ≈ 0.552, which is about 55%—this seems way too high. That would imply a 55% dip, which is much larger than any planet's transit effect. But the options are much lower. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the calculation wrong. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps the way I computed the flux is incorrect. Because the star's total flux when the spots are visible is the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted regions on that hemisphere. So the amplitude is the difference between the normal full flux and the flux when the spots are visible as a fraction of the normal full flux.

Wait, but wait. When the star is rotating, only one hemisphere is visible at a time. So F0 is when the spotless hemisphere is visible. When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted.

So F0 is the flux when the spotless hemisphere is visible. So F0 = [2 pi R²] * sigma * (6000)^4.

F_spotted is when the spotted hemisphere is visible. So F_spotted = [0.4 pi R² * sigma (5000)^4 ] + [1.6 pi R² * sigma (6000)^4 ].

So Amp = (F0 - F_spotted) / F0.

So let's compute F0 and F_spotted:

F0 = 2 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4.

F_spotted = 0.4 pi R² sigma (5e3)^4 + 1.6 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4.

So the numerator: F0 - F_spotted = 2 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 - [0.4 pi R² sigma (5e3)^4 + 1.6 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 ]

= [2 - 1.6] pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 - 0.4 pi R² sigma (5e3)^4 

= 0.4 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 - 0.4 pi R² sigma (5e3)^4 

= 0.4 pi R² sigma [ (6e3)^4 - (5e3)^4 ]

Then Amp is (0.4 pi R² sigma [ (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) ]) / (2 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 )

The pi R² sigma cancels.

Amp = 0.4 [ (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) ] / (2 (6e3)^4 )

Compute the numerator inside:

6e3^4 = (6000)^4 = 6^4 *1e12 = 1296e12.

5e3^4=5^4 *1e12=625e12.

So 6e3^4 -5e3^4= 1296e12 - 625e12 = 671e12.

So Amp = 0.4 * 671e12 / (2 * 1296e12 )

Simplify:

e12 cancels.

0.4 * 671 = 268.4.

Denominator: 2 *1296=2592.

So Amp= 268.4 / 2592 ≈ 0.1035, or about 10.35%.

Okay, that's better. So the amplitude is about 10.35%.

Wait, but the question is comparing this to a planet transit. For a planet, the transit amplitude is (Rp/Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is pi Rp^2, and the star's area is pi Rstar^2. So the dip is (pi Rp^2)/(pi Rstar^2) ) = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So we need to set this equal to the amplitude we just found (about 10.35% = 0.1035), and solve for Rp/Rstar.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the planet transit amplitude is (Rp/Rstar)^2. But the spot-induced dip is 10.35% (0.1035), so we set:

(Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3218, which is about 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations because the options also include 0.39, 0.07, etc.

Wait, the spot's effect gives an amplitude of 10.35%, and the planet's transit amplitude is (Rp/Rs)^2. So 0.1035 = (Rp/Rs)^2 → Rp/Rs = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.322. So the correct answer would be ~0.32, which is option D.

But wait, the options say:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

So D is the correct option.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me re-examine the approach. Did I correctly account for the area when computing the spot's effect?

Because when the star is viewed from Earth, the area of the spots that are visible depends on the rotational phase. When the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view, but their effect on the flux is not just the blocked area but the difference in flux between the spot and the surrounding.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's stated that the situation (spots) can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is what we're comparing to the planet's transit amplitude.

So the approach seems correct. The dip caused by the spots is about 10.35%, and the planet's transit dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So solving for Rp/Rstar gives approximately 0.32.

So the answer should be option D, ~0.32.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we compare the amplitude of the brightness dip caused by the spots to that of a planet transit.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Star Properties and Spots**:
   - The star has an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The temperature of the spots is \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).
   - The area of the spotted regions is \( A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 2\pi R^2 = 0.4\pi R^2 \), where \( R \) is the star's radius.

2. **Flux Calculation**:
   - The total flux from the star when the spotless hemisphere is visible is:
     \[
     F_0 = 2\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
     \]
   - The flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = (0.4\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4) + (1.6\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4)
     \]
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is the fractional change in flux:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{F_0 - F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_0}
     \]
     Substituting the flux expressions:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{2\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 - \left(0.4\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 + 1.6\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4\right)}{2\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4\pi R^2 \sigma \left(T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4\right)}{2\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4 \left(T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4\right)}{2 T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]

3. **Numerical Substitution**:
   - \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K}, \, T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)
   - \( T_{\text{eff}}^4 = (6000)^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{16}, \, T_{\text{spot}}^4 = (5000)^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{15} \)
   - Substituting:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4 \left(1.296 \times 10^{16} - 6.25 \times 10^{15}\right)}{2 \times 1.296 \times 10^{16}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4 \times 6.71 \times 10^{15}}{2.592 \times 10^{16}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} \approx 0.1035 \, \text{(or 10.35\%)}.
     \]

4. **Comparison to Exoplanet Transit**:
   - The brightness dip caused by a planet transit is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \left(\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
     \]
   - Setting the transit amplitude equal to the spot-induced amplitude:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.1035
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.322
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun, but one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the brightness changes due to these spots coming into and out of view. This is causing periodic brightness variations that look similar to those caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

The question is asking: to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve (if there were no spots), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star's radius? The options are A to D.

Hmm. So, I think I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet transit. The amplitude of the variation depends on the area blocked relative to the star's area. But wait, the spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, they make the star appear dimmer. Similarly, when a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. So the problem is essentially asking what planet size would cause the same dip as the spots do.

Wait, but wait—the spots only cover one hemisphere. So, when the star rotates, the spots come and go from view. So the maximum effect would be when the entire spot area is facing us. Wait no, because the spot covers a hemisphere, but wait, the filling factor is 20%. Oh, right, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So the total area of spots on the hemisphere is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, but the star's surface is a sphere, so the total area is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR². So the area of the spotted regions is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But wait, when the star rotates, the spots that were on the back side (the other hemisphere) come into view. But since only one hemisphere is spotty, the other hemisphere is spotless. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, which has 20% spots. So the maximum area that is covered by spots when facing us is 0.2 * 2πR²? Or is it the area of the spots themselves?

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the photometric variation. The star's brightness is affected when the spotted area is visible from Earth. The variation in brightness (the amplitude) would be proportional to the area of the spots as a fraction of the star's total area.

Wait, but the star's brightness isn't uniform because part of it is cooler. So the spots cause a dip in brightness when they're on the visible side. But the problem states that the brightness variations are due to rotational modulation, so they would vary as the spots rotate into and out of view. The amplitude depends on how much the spots dim the star.

Wait, but the question is about comparing this to a planet transit. When a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light. The dip is proportional to the area of the planet's disk over the star's disk. So the key is to find the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area that would give the same dip as the spots.

Wait, but the spots are not just a flat black—they have a lower temperature. So the change in brightness when the spots rotate into view is due to the difference in flux from the spotted area versus the normal area.

So let's model this.

First, the star's total flux without spots is F = 4πR² * sigma * Teff^4. But wait, that's the luminosity. Wait, the star emits in all directions, but when viewed from Earth, the flux is F = sigma * Teff^4 (assuming it's a black body and uniform temperature).

But when parts of the star have lower temperature, the total flux decreases. So when a spot comes into view, the flux decreases by the amount that the spot contributes.

The spot's area is A = fraction * area of hemisphere. Wait, the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4π R².

Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that is covered by spots. So for a hemisphere of 2πR², the area covered is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

Each spot has a temperature of Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

The flux without spots: F0 = sigma * (6000)^4.

The flux with a spot area A: F = F0 * (A / (4π R²)) * (5000^4 / 6000^4) + F0 * (1 - A/(4π R²)) ).

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The star's total flux is the sum of flux from the spotted regions and the unspotted regions.

Flux from spotted regions: A * sigma * T_spot^4.

Flux from unspotted regions: (4π R² - A) * sigma * T_star^4.

So the total flux is F = A * sigma * T_spot^4 + (4π R² - A) * sigma * T_star^4.

Dividing by 4π R², the flux received per unit area is (F / (4π R²)) = [A/(4π R²)] * (T_spot^4) + [1 - A/(4π R²)] * (T_star^4).

Wait, but in the case of the planet transit, the flux is reduced by the area of the planet blocking the star's light. So the dip in flux is when a planet of radius Rp blocks a part of the star's disk. The blocked area is π Rp². So the dip in flux is (π Rp² / 4π Rstar²) ) * (F0), but wait, F0 is the total flux when unobstructed.

Wait, no. The dip is the fraction of the star's area blocked, because the planet blocks the light. So the dip amplitude is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But in the case of the spots, the dip amplitude is the difference in flux when the spots are visible versus when they're not. Wait, no, because the spots are cooler, the flux is lower when they're on the visible side. So the variation in flux is the difference between flux when the spots are visible and when they're not, divided by the total flux.

So when the star's unspotted side is facing us, the flux is F0. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted.

So the dip is (F0 - F_spotted) / F0.

Hmm, let's compute that dip. Let's find (F0 - F_spotted)/F0.

F0 is the flux when the entire star is at Teff: F0 = 4π R² * sigma * (6000)^4. Wait, but when considering the flux received per unit area, the star emits as a blackbody. So perhaps I should compute the flux as F = sigma * T^4 for the entire star, but when part of it is cooler, the average flux is the average of the two areas.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the fractional change in flux when the spots are on the side we see.

The star's surface is a combination of spots and non-spots. The area of the spots is A = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². Because each hemisphere is 2π R².

Wait, no. Wait, the star is a sphere. One hemisphere is spotted, with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of spots is 0.2 multiplied by the area of the hemisphere. The hemisphere area is 2π R². So A = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

So the area of the spots is 0.4π R², and the area of the non-spots is 4π R² - 0.4π R² = 3.6π R². Wait, no, because the other hemisphere is not spotted. So the other hemisphere is 2π R², which contributes normally.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is:

F_spotted = (Area of spots * sigma * T_spot^4) + (Area of non-spots in hemisphere * sigma * T_star^4) 

Wait, but the hemisphere facing us has spots covering 20% of its area, and non-spots covering 80% of its area. So the area of the non-spots in the visible hemisphere is 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R².

So F_spotted = [0.4 π R² * sigma * (5000)^4] + [1.6 π R² * sigma * (6000)^4] 

And the total area is 4π R², so when not spotted (i.e., when we're looking at the spotless hemisphere), F0 = [2π R² * sigma (6000)^4 ] * 2. Because the other hemisphere is also spotless. Wait, no. Wait, when the star rotates, the other side (non-spotted) is showing. So F0 for the spotless view is [2π R² * sigma (6000)^4 ] * 2? No, because the star is a sphere. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Wait, let's think of F0 as the flux when the entire star is emitting at T_eff, which is 6000 K. So F0 = 4 π R² sigma (6000)^4. But when the star is showing the spotted hemisphere, the flux is F_spotted = (0.4 π R²) sigma (5000)^4 + (1.6 π R²) sigma (6000)^4.

So the dip in flux is F0 - F_spotted. The amplitude (Amp) is (F0 - F_spotted) / F0.

So let's compute Amp.

F0 = 4 π R² sigma (6000)^4.

F_spotted = [0.4 pi R² sigma (5000)^4 ] + [1.6 pi R² sigma (6000)^4 ]

We can factor pi R² sigma:

F_spotted = pi R² sigma [0.4 (5000)^4 + 1.6 (6000)^4 ]

So Amp = (F0 - F_spotted) / F0 

= [4 pi R² sigma (6000)^4 - pi R² sigma (0.4 (5000)^4 + 1.6 (6000)^4 ) ] / [4 pi R² sigma (6000)^4 ]

Simplify numerator:

= pi R² sigma [4 (6000)^4 - (0.4 (5000)^4 + 1.6 (6000)^4 ) ]

= pi R² sigma [ (4 - 1.6) (6000)^4 - 0.4 (5000)^4 ]

= pi R² sigma [ 2.4 (6000)^4 - 0.4 (5000)^4 ]

So Amp = [ 2.4 (6000)^4 - 0.4 (5000)^4 ] / (4 (6000)^4 )

Let's compute this.

First, compute each term:

(6000)^4 = (6e3)^4 = 1.296e16
(5000)^4 = (5e3)^4 = 6.25e15

So 2.4 * 1.296e16 = 3.1104e16
0.4 * 6.25e15 = 2.5e15

So numerator is 3.1104e16 - 2.5e15 = 3.1104e16 - 0.25e16 = 2.8604e16.

Denominator: 4 * 1.296e16 = 5.184e16.

So Amp = (2.8604e16) / (5.184e16) ≈ 0.552.

Wait, wait, wait—that can't be right because that's over 50% dip, which is way too high. I must have made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, 6000^4 is (6e3)^4 = (6^4) * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15? No, wait. Wait, 1e3^4 is (1e3)^4 = 1e12. So 6e3^4 is 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

Similarly, 5e3^4 is 5^4 * 1e12 = 625 *1e12 = 6.25e14.

So 2.4 * (6e3)^4 = 2.4 * 1.296e15 = 3.1104e15.

0.4 * (5e3)^4 = 0.4 * 6.25e14 = 2.5e14.

So numerator is 3.1104e15 - 2.5e14 = 3.1104e15 - 0.25e15 = 2.8604e15.

Denominator is 4 * (6e3)^4 = 4 * 1.296e15 = 5.184e15.

So Amp = 2.8604e15 / 5.184e15 ≈ 0.552, which is about 55%—this seems way too high. That would imply a 55% dip, which is much larger than any planet's transit effect. But the options are much lower. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the calculation wrong. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps the way I computed the flux is incorrect. Because the star's total flux when the spots are visible is the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted regions on that hemisphere. So the amplitude is the difference between the normal full flux and the flux when the spots are visible as a fraction of the normal full flux.

Wait, but wait. When the star is rotating, only one hemisphere is visible at a time. So F0 is when the spotless hemisphere is visible. When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted.

So F0 is the flux when the spotless hemisphere is visible. So F0 = [2 pi R²] * sigma * (6000)^4.

F_spotted is when the spotted hemisphere is visible. So F_spotted = [0.4 pi R² * sigma (5000)^4 ] + [1.6 pi R² * sigma (6000)^4 ].

So Amp = (F0 - F_spotted) / F0.

So let's compute F0 and F_spotted:

F0 = 2 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4.

F_spotted = 0.4 pi R² sigma (5e3)^4 + 1.6 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4.

So the numerator: F0 - F_spotted = 2 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 - [0.4 pi R² sigma (5e3)^4 + 1.6 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 ]

= [2 - 1.6] pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 - 0.4 pi R² sigma (5e3)^4 

= 0.4 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 - 0.4 pi R² sigma (5e3)^4 

= 0.4 pi R² sigma [ (6e3)^4 - (5e3)^4 ]

Then Amp is (0.4 pi R² sigma [ (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) ]) / (2 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 )

The pi R² sigma cancels.

Amp = 0.4 [ (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) ] / (2 (6e3)^4 )

Compute the numerator inside:

6e3^4 = (6000)^4 = 6^4 *1e12 = 1296e12.

5e3^4=5^4 *1e12=625e12.

So 6e3^4 -5e3^4= 1296e12 - 625e12 = 671e12.

So Amp = 0.4 * 671e12 / (2 * 1296e12 )

Simplify:

e12 cancels.

0.4 * 671 = 268.4.

Denominator: 2 *1296=2592.

So Amp= 268.4 / 2592 ≈ 0.1035, or about 10.35%.

Okay, that's better. So the amplitude is about 10.35%.

Wait, but the question is comparing this to a planet transit. For a planet, the transit amplitude is (Rp/Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is pi Rp^2, and the star's area is pi Rstar^2. So the dip is (pi Rp^2)/(pi Rstar^2) ) = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So we need to set this equal to the amplitude we just found (about 10.35% = 0.1035), and solve for Rp/Rstar.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the planet transit amplitude is (Rp/Rstar)^2. But the spot-induced dip is 10.35% (0.1035), so we set:

(Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3218, which is about 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations because the options also include 0.39, 0.07, etc.

Wait, the spot's effect gives an amplitude of 10.35%, and the planet's transit amplitude is (Rp/Rs)^2. So 0.1035 = (Rp/Rs)^2 → Rp/Rs = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.322. So the correct answer would be ~0.32, which is option D.

But wait, the options say:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

So D is the correct option.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me re-examine the approach. Did I correctly account for the area when computing the spot's effect?

Because when the star is viewed from Earth, the area of the spots that are visible depends on the rotational phase. When the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view, but their effect on the flux is not just the blocked area but the difference in flux between the spot and the surrounding.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's stated that the situation (spots) can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is what we're comparing to the planet's transit amplitude.

So the approach seems correct. The dip caused by the spots is about 10.35%, and the planet's transit dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So solving for Rp/Rstar gives approximately 0.32.

So the answer should be option D, ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we compare the amplitude of the brightness dip caused by the spots to that of a planet transit.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Star Properties and Spots**:
   - The star has an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The temperature of the spots is \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).
   - The area of the spotted regions is \( A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 2\pi R^2 = 0.4\pi R^2 \), where \( R \) is the star's radius.

2. **Flux Calculation**:
   - The total flux from the star when the spotless hemisphere is visible is:
     \[
     F_0 = 2\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
     \]
   - The flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = (0.4\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4) + (1.6\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4)
     \]
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is the fractional change in flux:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{F_0 - F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_0}
     \]
     Substituting the flux expressions:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{2\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 - \left(0.4\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 + 1.6\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4\right)}{2\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4\pi R^2 \sigma \left(T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4\right)}{2\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4 \left(T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4\right)}{2 T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]

3. **Numerical Substitution**:
   - \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K}, \, T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)
   - \( T_{\text{eff}}^4 = (6000)^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{16}, \, T_{\text{spot}}^4 = (5000)^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{15} \)
   - Substituting:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4 \left(1.296 \times 10^{16} - 6.25 \times 10^{15}\right)}{2 \times 1.296 \times 10^{16}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4 \times 6.71 \times 10^{15}}{2.592 \times 10^{16}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} \approx 0.1035 \, \text{(or 10.35\%)}.
     \]

4. **Comparison to Exoplanet Transit**:
   - The brightness dip caused by a planet transit is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \left(\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
     \]
   - Setting the transit amplitude equal to the spot-induced amplitude:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.1035
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.322
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to **Option D**.
