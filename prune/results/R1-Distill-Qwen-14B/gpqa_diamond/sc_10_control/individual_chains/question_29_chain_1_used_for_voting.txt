Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the situation is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The compound is causing issues because it makes the barley unsuitable for food. They found the gene responsible for this compound, which has five exons and four introns. They treated mutants with EMS, which I remember is ethyl methanesulfonate, a mutagen that typically causes point mutations, often leading to base substitutions.

After sequencing, they found changes in the beginning of the gene's sequence, specifically in the first exon area. The question is asking which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, the goal is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or altering the protein so it can't function.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change. Let me compare the wild-type sequence with each mutant.

The wild-type is:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let me look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Hmm, comparing to wild-type. Let's see each position. The wild-type starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let me line them up.

Wild-type: positions 1-20 maybe? Let's count letters.

Wait, perhaps looking for the exact spot where the change occurs. Let me look at the first part.

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...
Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Wait, perhaps I should write the changes in the first few codons.

Wait, maybe it's easier to see the exact differences.

Looking at the sequences, the changes are in the first exon. Let's see:

Wild-type: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...
Mutant1: ...TCTTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

Wait, maybe I should look for where the changes start. Oh, the beginning part is the same until a certain point. Let me compare each nucleotide.

Looking in the first few nucleotides:

Wild-type: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant1: 5’-ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So, in the wild-type, the second codon is TTT (which is Phe), then CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), etc. In Mutant1, the second codon is TCT (Ser), next is TAC (Tyr), then GCT (Ala). So in the mutant, the first few codons are changed.

Wait, but the third codon in wild-type is CTC (Leu), in Mutant1 it's TAC. No, wait no. Let me see:

Wait, the wild-type is: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant1 is: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So, the first codon (ATG) is same. Second codon: TTT (Phe) in wild, TCT (Ser) in mutant. Third codon: CTC (Leu) in wild, TAC (Tyr) in mutant.

Wait, so that's two changes in the first few codons. Hmm. So, the amino acids change from Phe to Ser, and then Leu to Tyr.

Would that cause a problem? Well, it changes the amino acids, potentially altering the protein structure. But whether that disrupts the compound's synthesis would depend on the importance of those residues. Alternatively, perhaps there's a frameshift, but looking at the sequences, they all seem to have the same length, so no frameshifts here.

Wait, but the question says the changes are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon. So perhaps the disruption is early enough that the protein is nonfunctional.

But wait, let me check all the mutants.

Mutant2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to wild-type:

Wild-type starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT...

Mutant2: ATG TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So, the second codon is TCT (Ser), third is TAA (stop codon). Oh wait, TAA is a stop codon. So in Mutant2, the third codon is TAA, which would cause translation to stop early. That's a nonsense mutation. So the protein would be truncated, potentially leading to a nonfunctional enzyme. That might eliminate the compound.

Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing:

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

Wait, let's see. The second codon in wild-type is TTT (Phe), same in mutant. Third codon: wild is CTC (Leu), mutant is TAC (Tyr). Then, fourth codon wild is GCT (Ala), mutant is GCT (same), but the fifth codon in wild is GGT (Gly), mutant is GTC (Val). So, changes in positions 3 and 5. So, amino acids altered, but not a stop codon.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So, let's see:

Second codon: same TTT (Phe).

Third codon: CTC (Leu) in wild, TAC (Tyr) in mutant.

Fourth codon: GCT (Ala) in wild, ACT (Thr) in mutant.

So, changes in codons 3 and 4. So, again, amino acids change, but no stop codon.

So, looking at the options, the only mutant that introduces a stop codon is Mutant2. Because in Mutant2, the third codon is TAA, which is a stop.

So, if the gene product is an enzyme that synthesizes the anti-nutritional compound, a stop codon early in the protein would likely result in a nonfunctional enzyme. Thus, the compound wouldn't be synthesized, which is what we want.

Let me double-check the options:

Options are A to D, each corresponding to the mutants. So option A is Mutant2.

So the answer should be A.

To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This can occur if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon, altering the protein structure and rendering it nonfunctional.

### Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Wild-type Sequence**:  
   `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ... TGA-3’`  
   The sequence starts with the start codon `ATG`, followed by `TTT` (Phe), `CTC` (Leu), `GCT` (Ala), etc.

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   `5’-ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ... TGA-3’`  
   Changes:  
   - Second codon: `TCT` (Ser) instead of `TTT` (Phe).  
   - Third codon: `TAC` (Tyr) instead of `CTC` (Leu).  
   No premature stop codon is introduced. The protein may be altered but likely remains functional.

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   `5’-ATG TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ... TGA-3’`  
   Changes:  
   - Second codon: `TCT` (Ser) instead of `TTT` (Phe).  
   - Third codon: `TAA` (stop codon) instead of `CTC` (Leu).  
   The introduction of `TAA` as a stop codon causes premature termination of translation, resulting in a truncated and likely nonfunctional protein. This would disrupt the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG ... TGA-3’`  
   Changes:  
   - Third codon: `TAC` (Tyr) instead of `CTC` (Leu).  
   - Fifth codon: `GTC` (Val) instead of `GGT` (Gly).  
   No stop codon is introduced. The protein structure is altered, but it may still retain partial function.

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG ... TGA-3’`  
   Changes:  
   - Third codon: `TAC` (Tyr) instead of `CTC` (Leu).  
   - Fourth codon: `ACT` (Thr) instead of `GCT` (Ala).  
   No stop codon is introduced. The protein structure is altered, but it may still retain partial function.

### Conclusion:
The only mutation that introduces a premature stop codon (`TAA`) is **Mutant 2**. This would disrupt the gene's function and likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.
