Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured their radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. So I need to find the ratio of their luminosities, which would be (L1/L2) = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

Given that R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 is 1.5. So R1²/R2² would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that's part of the equation. But what about the temperatures?

The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ1_max = λ2_max, then T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. Are they moving towards or away from us? Because velocity can affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Oh right, the radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So the observed wavelength from Star_2 might be shifted.

Wait, so the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. But that's the observed wavelength from Earth, right? So we need to adjust for the Doppler shift when calculating the actual temperature of each star.

Hmm, I think so. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted (λ observed is shorter than the rest frame λ). If moving away, it's redshifted (longer λ). So for Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, I need to check if that's towards or away. The problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. Oh, wait, the problem says radial velocities of Star_1 and Star_2 are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_2 is moving away from us at 700 km/s, I think. Because if Star_1's velocity is zero, it's our rest frame, and Star_2 is moving away.

Wait, the radial velocity is relative to us. So if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). So for Star_2, the observed λ_max is longer than its actual emitted λ_max. Because of the Doppler shift.

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So observed λ1_max = observed λ2_max.

Hmm, but for Star_1, since its radial velocity is zero, its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength. So λ1_obs = λ1_emit.

For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c), because when moving away, the wavelength is stretched. Let me think about the Doppler shift formula. The relativistic Doppler effect is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but for non-relativistic speeds (like 700 km/s, which is much less than the speed of light), we can approximate it as λ_obs ≈ λ_emit * (1 + v/c). Because v is positive when moving away, so for Star_2, v is 700,000 m/s (since 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s), but the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 700e3 /3e8 is 0.002333... so small. So the approximation should be okay.

But wait, let's get back. Since the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, we have λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But since Star_1 is not moving, λ1_emit = λ1_obs.

For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c).

So setting λ1_obs = λ2_obs:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c)

But from Wien's law, λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So λ1_emit = b / T1, and λ2_emit = b / T2.

So substitute:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b from both sides:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

So rearrange:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) / 1

Wait, no, let's solve for T2 in terms of T1.

Wait, 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c), so

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Wait, because let's see:

1/T1 = [1/(T2)] (1 + v/c)

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

Wait, let me do the algebra again.

Let me write:

(1/T1) = (1/T2) * (1 + v/c)

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2/(T1) = (1 + v/c)

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

Wait, I think that's correct.

Wait, because if a star is moving away, its observed λ is longer. So λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c). And since λ_emit is inversely proportional to temperature, a higher λ_emit would mean lower temperature.

But wait, according to the problem, the observed λ_max is same for both. So Star_2's λ_emit must be shorter than Star_1's λ_emit, because when it's moving away, the observed λ_obs is longer. So to have the same observed λ, Star_2 must emit a shorter λ, which implies a higher temperature. Hmm, maybe I did the algebra wrong.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let’s define:

λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1 * (1 + v1/c) 

But v1 is zero, so λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1

Similarly, λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + v2/c)

But given that λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we have:

λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + v2/c)

But from Wien's law:

λ_emit,1 = b / T1

λ_emit,2 = b / T2

So substituting:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Take reciprocal:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Wait, that makes sense. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is larger. But since the observed λ is same as Star_1, Star_2 must have a shorter emitted λ, which implies higher temperature. So T2 is higher, which makes sense.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

But v2 is 700,000 m/s. Let's compute the factor (1 + v2/c). v2 is positive, so moving away.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

v2/c = 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.02333...

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.02333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.02333.

Wait, so the temperature of Star_2 is about 2.33% higher than Star_1.

Now, back to the luminosity ratio. L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4)

We have R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Squared is 2.25.

T1 is T1, T2 is T1 * 1.02333. So T2 = T1 * (1 + 0.02333).

So T2^4 = T1^4 * (1.02333)^4.

Putting it into the luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( (1)^2 * (T1 * 1.02333)^4 )

Simplify:

= (2.25 ) * ( T1^4 ) / ( T1^4 * (1.02333)^4 )

The T1^4 terms cancel, so:

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1.02333)^4

Wait, that's 2.25 divided by (1.02333)^4.

Let me compute (1.02333)^4. Let's compute step by step.

First, 1.02333^2: 1.02333 * 1.02333.

Let me calculate:

1.02333 * 1.02333 = approx 1.0475.

Wait, because 0.02333^2 is about 0.000544, and cross terms are 2 * 0.02333 *1 = 0.04666. So 1 + 0.04666 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.0472.

So 1.02333^2 ≈ 1.0472.

Now, square that again for the 4th power: 1.0472^2 = ?

Compute 1.0472 * 1.0472.

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.0472 = 0.0472.

0.0472 * 1 = 0.0472.

0.0472 * 0.0472 ≈ 0.00222784.

Adding up: 1 + 0.0472 + 0.0472 + 0.00222784 = around 1.10262784.

Wait, wait, let me do it more accurately.

Alternatively, we can compute (1.0472)^2 using the formula (a + b)^2, where a=1, b=0.0472.

So, (1 + 0.0472)^2 = 1^2 + 2*1*0.0472 + (0.0472)^2.

Which is 1 + 0.0944 + 0.00222784 = 1.09662784.

Ah, so (1.02333)^4 ≈ 1.0966.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.25 divided by approximately 1.0966.

What's 2.25 / 1.0966?

Let me compute this division.

1.0966 * 2 = 2.1932; that's less than 2.25.

Difference: 2.25 - 2.1932 = 0.0568.

So 0.0568 / 1.0966 ≈ 0.0518.

So total is approx 2.0518.

Wait, wait. 1.0966 * 2.05 = ?

2 * 1.0966 = 2.1932.

0.05 * 1.0966 = 0.05483.

Total 2.1932 + 0.05483 = 2.24803.

Which is very close to 2.25. So 2.05 * 1.0966 = ~2.248, which is just under 2.25. So 2.05 times 1.0966 is 2.248, so 2.25 is 2.05 times (since 2.05 * 1.0966 ≈ 2.248, which is 2.25 minus 0.002, so about 2.05 * 1.0966 ≈ 2.25). So 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.05.

Wait, but wait: 2.05 * 1.0966 = 2.248, which is 2.25 minus 0.002. So perhaps 2.05 is the approximate value. So L1/L2 ≈ 2.05.

But wait, this doesn't match any of the options. The options are 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35.

Hmm, maybe my approximation for (1.02333)^4 is off. Let me try a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.02333)^4 more accurately.

Let me compute 1.02333^4 step by step.

First, 1.02333^2: (1.02333)^2 = ?

1.02333 * 1.02333.

Let me compute:

1.02333
x 1.02333
------------
Multiply step by step:

1.02333 * 1 = 1.02333

1.02333 * 0.02 = 0.0204666

1.02333 * 0.003 = 0.00306999

1.02333 * 0.0003 = 0.000306999

1.02333 * 0.00003 = 0.0000306999

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute as (1 + 0.02333)^2.

Which is 1 + 2*0.02333 + (0.02333)^2.

= 1 + 0.04666 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.047204.

So 1.02333^2 ≈ 1.047204.

Now, 1.047204^2 is (1.047204)^2.

Again, using the same approach: (1 + 0.047204)^2.

Which is 1 + 2*(0.047204) + (0.047204)^2.

= 1 + 0.094408 + 0.0022284.

Total: 1.0966364.

So (1.02333)^4 ≈ 1.0966364.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966364.

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.0966364.

Hmm, 1.0966364 is approximately 1.09664.

Compute 2.25 / 1.09664.

Let me compute this division.

We can write this as 2.25 / 1.09664 ≈ ?

Alternatively, we can compute it as 225000 / 109664 ≈ ?

Wait, let me compute it numerically.

Alternatively, since 1.09664 * 2.05 = approx 2.248, which is just under 2.25. So 2.05 is slightly less. Let me compute 2.05 * 1.09664.

2.05 * 1.09664 = (2 * 1.09664) + (0.05 * 1.09664) = 2.19328 + 0.054832 = 2.248112.

Which is 2.248112, which is 2.25 minus 0.001888.

So 2.05 gives us 2.248112, which is 0.001888 less than 2.25.

So perhaps 2.05 + (0.001888 / 1.09664) ) would give us the exact value.

0.001888 / 1.09664 ≈ 0.00172.

So total would be 2.05 + 0.00172 ≈ 2.05172.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.05172.

Wait, but that's about 2.05. That's not matching any of the options given. The options are ~2.23, ~2.25, ~2.32, ~2.35.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem. Oh, wait a second. The problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. But which star is which? Oh, Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700. So Star_2's observed λ is longer than its emitted λ. So to have the same observed λ as Star_1, Star_2 must have a higher temperature, as we thought earlier.

Wait, but maybe I got the Doppler shift formula wrong. Let me double-check.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c)

Where v is positive when moving away. So for Star_2, which is moving away at 700 km/s, the observed wavelength is longer. Since the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, that implies:

λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + v2/c)

Because λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1.

So λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + v2/c)

But from Wien's law, λ_emit = b / T.

So, substituting:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2 / T1 = 1 + v2/c

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Which makes T2 higher than T1.

So that part was correct.

Now, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

We know R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1² = 2.25 R2².

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25 R2²) * T1⁴ / (R2² * T2⁴) )

Simplify:

= 2.25 * (T1^4) / (T2^4)

But T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) → T2 = T1 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e8 )

Compute (700,000 / 300,000,000) = 700/(3e5) )= 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.023333.

So,

T2^4 = (T1 * 1.023333)^4 = T1^4 * (1.023333)^4.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1.023333)^4.

Earlier, I found (1.023333)^4 ≈ 1.09664.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.09664 ≈ approximately 2.05.

But the options don't include 2.05; the closest is option A) ~2.25, which is the R factor alone. But that can't be right, because the temperature affects it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.023333)^4. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 1.02333^4 step by step.

First, 1.02333 squared:

1.02333 * 1.02333.

Let me compute it more accurately.

1.02333 × 1.02333:

= (1 + 0.02333) × (1 + 0.02333)

= 1 + 2*(0.02333) + (0.02333)^2

= 1 + 0.04666 + 0.000544

= 1.047204.

So squared is 1.047204.

Now, square that again to get the fourth power.

1.047204 × 1.047204.

Again, using (1 + 0.047204)^2.

= 1 + 2*(0.047204) + (0.047204)^2

= 1 + 0.094408 + 0.0022284

= 1.0966364.

So (1.02333)^4 = 1.0966364.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966364 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0966364.

Let me compute this division precisely.

Using a calculator approach:

1.0966364 × 2.05 = ?

1.0966364 × 2 = 2.1932728.

1.0966364 × 0.05 = 0.05483182.

Adding them gives 2.1932728 + 0.05483182 = 2.24810462.

Which is 2.2481, which is just 0.001895 less than 2.25.

So 2.05 * 1.0966364 = 2.24810462.

So 2.05 gives 2.2481, which is 0.001895 less than 2.25. How much more do I need?

The difference is 0.001895.

So, how much more than 2.05 is needed to get to 2.25.

The remaining amount is 0.001895.

So, 0.001895 / 1.0966364 ≈ 0.001727.

So, 2.05 + 0.001727 ≈ 2.051727.

So, 2.051727 × 1.0966364 ≈ 2.25.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.0517.

Which is approximately 2.05. But none of the options are this low.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let's think again.

Wait, the problem states that both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. But wait, that's the observed wavelength, right? Because that's what the astronomers measure. So for Star_1, λ_obs1 = λ_emit1, because it's not moving. For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c). So if λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then λ_emit2 = λ_obs1/(1 + v2/c) = λ_emit1/(1 + v2/c).

Wait, no. Wait, the observed wavelength is the same for both stars. So:

λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1.

λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 × (1 + v2/c).

And λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

So,

λ_emit,2 = λ_obs,2 / (1 + v2/c) = λ_obs,1 / (1 + v2/c).

But λ_obs,1 is λ_emit,1.

So λ_emit,2 = λ_emit,1 / (1 + v2/c).

Which would imply that λ_emit,2 is shorter than λ_emit,1.

Which, per Wien's law, means T2 is higher than T1.

Because λ ∝ 1/T. So if λ_emit,2 is shorter, T2 is higher.

So, substituting into Wien's law.

λ_emit,1 = b / T1.

λ_emit,2 = b / T2.

So, from λ_emit,2 = λ_emit,1 / (1 + v2/c),

We have:

b/T2 = (b/T1) / (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b:

1/T2 = 1/(T1 (1 + v2/c)) )

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c).

Wait, that's the same as before. So T2 = T1 × 1.023333.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, so back to luminosity ratio: L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) = (2.25) × [T1^4 / (T2^4)].

But T2 = T1 × 1.023333, so T2^4 = T1^4 × (1.023333)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1.023333)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 1.096636 ≈ 2.05.

But the options don't have 2.05. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate (1.023333)^4 more accurately.

Wait, 1.023333 is 1 + 0.023333.

Let me compute (1.023333)^4 using the binomial expansion up to more terms.

The binomial expansion for (1 + x)^n, where x is small, is approximately 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2) x² + (n(n-1)(n-2)/6) x³ + ... .

Here, n=4, x=0.023333.

So,

(1.023333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.023333) + (4*3/2)* (0.023333)^2 + (4*3*2/6)*(0.023333)^3 + (4*3*2*1/24)*(0.023333)^4.

Let me compute each term:

Term 1: 1.

Term 2: 4 * 0.023333 = 0.093332.

Term 3: (12/2) * (0.023333)^2.

(0.023333)^2 ≈ 0.0005444.

So term3: 6 * 0.0005444 ≈ 0.003266.

Term4: (24/6) * (0.023333)^3.

(0.023333)^3 ≈ 0.00001266.

So term4: 4 * 0.00001266 ≈ 0.00005064.

Term5: (24/24) * (0.023333)^4.

(0.023333)^4 ≈ (0.00001266) * 0.023333 ≈ 0.000000295.

So term5: 1 * 0.000000295 ≈ 0.000000295.

Now, add all terms:

1 + 0.093332 = 1.093332.

+ 0.003266 → 1.096598.

+ 0.00005064 → 1.09664864.

+ 0.000000295 → 1.096648935.

So the approximation gives (1.023333)^4 ≈ 1.096648935.

Which is very close to our earlier calculation of 1.0966364. So our initial calculation was correct.

So, 2.25 / 1.096648935 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.096648935.

Using a calculator,

2.25 ÷ 1.096648935 ≈ approximately 2.0517.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.05.

But the options don’t have this value. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again about the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic Doppler shift formula instead of the approximation. Because even though 700 km/s is small compared to the speed of light, maybe the approximation isn't good enough for the problem.

The relativistic formula is:

λ_obs / λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, but v is the radial velocity. So for a source moving away, v is positive. So,

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

In this case, v is 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

v/c = 700000 / 3e8 = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So,

sqrt( (1+0.023333)/(1-0.023333) ) = sqrt(1.023333 / 0.9766667 )

Compute numerator and denominator:

1.023333 / 0.9766667 ≈ 1.047999.

So sqrt(1.047999) ≈ 1.0237.

Hmm, that's a bit higher than our previous approximation of 1.02333.

So, λ_obs = λ_emit * 1.0237.

So, if the observed λ is the same for both stars,

λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * 1.0237.

So,

λ_emit,1 / λ_emit,2 = 1.0237.

But from Wien's law, λ ∝ 1/T.

So,

(λ_emit,1) / (λ_emit,2) ) = T2 / T1 = 1.0237.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.0237.

So, T2 = T1 × 1.0237.

Now, compute (T2 / T1 )^4 = (1.0237)^4.

Compute 1.0237^4.

Again, perhaps using the binomial expansion.

x = 0.0237.

(1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 +4x + 6x^2 +4x^3 +x^4.

Compute each term:

1 = 1.

4x =4 * 0.0237 = 0.0948.

6x² =6*(0.0237)^2=6*(0.00056169)=0.00337014.

4x^3=4*(0.0237)^3=4*(0.00001333)=0.00005332.

x^4= (0.0237)^4 ≈ (0.00001333)*(0.0237)= ~3.16e-7.

Adding up:

1 +0.0948 =1.0948.

+0.00337014=1.09817.

+0.00005332=1.09822332.

+3.16e-7=1.09822648.

So, (1.0237)^4 ≈ 1.098226.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) / 1.098226 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 / 1.098226.

Hmm, let's compute:

1.098226 × 2.05 = 2.2481117.

Which is 2.2481, which is 2.25 - 2.2481 = 0.0019 less than 2.25.

So, we need a little more than 2.05.

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.098226.

Using division:

1.098226 × 2.045 = ?

= 1.098226 × 2 = 2.196452.

+ 1.098226 × 0.045 = 0.04942017.

Total ≈ 2.196452 + 0.04942017 ≈ 2.245872.

Still less than 2.25.

So, 2.045 × 1.098226 ≈ 2.245872.

Difference: 2.25 - 2.245872 = 0.004128.

So, how much more? 0.004128 / 1.098226 ≈ 0.00376.

So, 2.045 + 0.00376 ≈ 2.04876.

So, 2.04876 × 1.098226 ≈ 2.25.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.04876.

Approximately 2.05.

Again, not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem states that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So the factor is L1/L2.

So, according to our calculations, it's around 2.05. But the options are higher. Am I missing something?

Wait, perhaps the luminosity ratio is (L1/L2), but I may have inverted the ratio somewhere.

Wait, no. Because L1 is Star_1, and L2 is Star_2. So, according to our calculations, L1 is about 2.05 times L2.

But the options don't include 2.05. The options are A) 2.25, B)2.32, C)2.35, D)2.23.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in including the Doppler shift. Let me think again.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer than its emitted wavelength. But since the observed wavelength is the same as Star_1's, the emitted wavelength of Star_2 must be shorter. Which means higher temperature.

So T2 is higher than T1.

In that case, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So, in the luminosity formula, T2 is larger, which would reduce the luminosity ratio, because T is raised to the fourth power in the denominator.

Wait, so I think the calculations are correct, but the answer isn't among the options. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I used the approximation for Doppler shift as 1 + v/c, but actually, the relativistic formula is different.

Wait, using the exact Doppler formula:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So, for Star_2, moving away, v = +700 km/s.

So,

λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

And since λ_obs,2 = λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1,

So,

λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which implies,

λ_emit,2 = λ_emit,1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

= λ_emit,1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Thus,

λ_emit,2 = λ_emit,1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Using v=700 km/s,

v/c = 700,000 / 3e8 = 0.00233333...

So,

(1 - v/c) = 0.997666667.

(1 + v/c) = 1.002333333.

So,

( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) ) = (0.997666667)/(1.002333333) ≈ (0.997666667)/(1.002333333) ≈ 0.99537.

So,

sqrt(0.99537) ≈ 0.99768.

So,

λ_emit,2 = λ_emit,1 × 0.99768.

Which means,

λ_emit,2 ≈ 0.99768 × λ_emit,1.

So, since λ_emit ∝ 1/T,

T2 = T1 × (λ_emit,1 / λ_emit,2 )

= T1 × (1 / 0.99768 )

≈ T1 × 1.00233.

Wait, because if λ2 = 0.99768 * λ1,

then λ2 = λ1 * 0.99768 → λ2 < λ1 → T2 > T1.

So, T2 = T1 × 1.00233.

Hmm, that's a much smaller increase in temperature. So, the previous approach using the approximation (1 + v/c) is leading to a higher T2, but the relativistic approach gives a smaller T2.

Wait, this changes everything. So earlier calculations were incorrect because I used the linear approximation for Doppler shift when I should have used the exact formula.

So, let's redo the Doppler shift correctly.

Using the exact Doppler shift formula for wavelength:

λ_obs = λ_emit × sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

For Star_2, v is positive (moving away), so:

λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 × sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But λ_obs,2 = λ_obs,1 → λ_emit,1 = λ_obs,1.

So,

λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 × sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Thus,

λ_emit,2 = λ_emit,1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

= λ_emit,1 × sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

λ_emit,2 = λ_emit,1 × sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

As we found earlier.

Which gives λ_emit,2 = λ_emit,1 × sqrt( (1 - 0.0023333)/(1 + 0.0023333) )

= λ_emit,1 × sqrt( 0.9976667 / 1.0023333 )

Compute 0.9976667 / 1.0023333 ≈ 0.99537.

sqrt(0.99537) ≈ 0.99768.

So,

λ_emit,2 ≈ 0.99768 × λ_emit,1.

Which implies that λ_emit,2 is shorter than λ_emit,1. So, T2 = T1 × (λ_emit,1 / λ_emit,2 ) = T1 × (1 / 0.99768 ) ≈ T1 × 1.00233.

So,

T2 = T1 × 1.00233.

So, T2 is only about 0.233% higher than T1.

Hmm, that's a much smaller temperature difference than I thought earlier. So, this changes the calculation.

Now, compute T2^4.

T2 = T1 × 1.00233.

So,

T2^4 = T1^4 × (1.00233)^4.

Compute (1.00233)^4.

Using the binomial expansion up to more terms.

x = 0.00233.

So,

(1 + x)^4 = 1 +4x +6x² +4x³ +x^4.

Compute each term:

1 = 1.

4x =4 *0.00233=0.00932.

6x²=6*(0.00233)^2=6*(0.0000054289)=0.0000325734.

4x³=4*(0.00233)^3=4*(0.0000000125)=0.00000005.

x^4=(0.00233)^4≈0.00000000029.

Adding all terms:

1 + 0.00932 =1.00932.

+0.0000325734 =1.0093525734.

+0.00000005=1.0093526234.

+0.00000000029≈1.0093526237.

So, (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.0093526.

Thus,

L1/L2 = (2.25) / (1.0093526) ≈ 2.25 / 1.0093526 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So, the correct answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \implies \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:
\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \implies \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, meaning their observed peak wavelengths, \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}}\) and \(\lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), are equal. Using Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}\), the temperature of a star is inversely proportional to its peak wavelength.

For Star_1, since its radial velocity is 0, its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength:
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}}
\]

For Star_2, its radial velocity is \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} = 700,000 \, \text{m/s}\), and its observed wavelength is redshifted due to its motion away from us. The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate:
\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Rearranging for \(\lambda_{\text{emit,2}}\):
\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
\]

Using \(v_2/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 0.002333\), we compute:
\[
\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c} = \frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333} = \frac{0.997667}{1.002333} \approx 0.99537
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.99537} \approx 0.99768
\]

Thus:
\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} \times 0.99768
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto 1/T\), the temperature ratio is:
\[
T_2 = T_1 \times \frac{\lambda_{\text{emit,1}}}{\lambda_{\text{emit,2}}} = T_1 \times \frac{1}{0.99768} \approx T_1 \times 1.00233
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \frac{2.25}{(T_2 / T_1)^4}
\]

Using \(T_2 / T_1 = 1.00233\), we compute:
\[
(T_2 / T_1)^4 = (1.00233)^4
\]

Expanding \((1.00233)^4\) using the binomial approximation:
\[
(1 + x)^4 \approx 1 + 4x + 6x^2 + 4x^3 + x^4, \quad x = 0.00233
\]
\[
(1.00233)^4 \approx 1 + 4(0.00233) + 6(0.00233)^2 + 4(0.00233)^3 + (0.00233)^4
\]
\[
= 1 + 0.00932 + 0.00003257 + 0.00000005 + 0.00000000029 \approx 1.0093526
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.0093526} \approx 2.229
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured their radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. So I need to find the ratio of their luminosities, which would be (L1/L2) = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

Given that R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 is 1.5. So R1²/R2² would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that's part of the equation. But what about the temperatures?

The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ1_max = λ2_max, then T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. Are they moving towards or away from us? Because velocity can affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Oh right, the radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So the observed wavelength from Star_2 might be shifted.

Wait, so the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. But that's the observed wavelength from Earth, right? So we need to adjust for the Doppler shift when calculating the actual temperature of each star.

Hmm, I think so. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted (λ observed is shorter than the rest frame λ). If moving away, it's redshifted (longer λ). So for Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, I need to check if that's towards or away. The problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. Oh, wait, the problem says radial velocities of Star_1 and Star_2 are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_2 is moving away from us at 700 km/s, I think. Because if Star_1's velocity is zero, it's our rest frame, and Star_2 is moving away.

Wait, the radial velocity is relative to us. So if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). So for Star_2, the observed λ_max is longer than its actual emitted λ_max. Because of the Doppler shift.

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So observed λ1_max = observed λ2_max.

Hmm, but for Star_1, since its radial velocity is zero, its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength. So λ1_obs = λ1_emit.

For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c), because when moving away, the wavelength is stretched. Let me think about the Doppler shift formula. The relativistic Doppler effect is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but for non-relativistic speeds (like 700 km/s, which is much less than the speed of light), we can approximate it as λ_obs ≈ λ_emit * (1 + v/c). Because v is positive when moving away, so for Star_2, v is 700,000 m/s (since 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s), but the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 700e3 /3e8 is 0.002333... so small. So the approximation should be okay.

But wait, let's get back. Since the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, we have λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But since Star_1 is not moving, λ1_emit = λ1_obs.

For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c).

So setting λ1_obs = λ2_obs:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c)

But from Wien's law, λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So λ1_emit = b / T1, and λ2_emit = b / T2.

So substitute:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b from both sides:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

So rearrange:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) / 1

Wait, no, let's solve for T2 in terms of T1.

Wait, 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c), so

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Wait, because let's see:

1/T1 = [1/(T2)] (1 + v/c)

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

Wait, let me do the algebra again.

Let me write:

(1/T1) = (1/T2) * (1 + v/c)

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2/(T1) = (1 + v/c)

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

Wait, I think that's correct.

Wait, because if a star is moving away, its observed λ is longer. So λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c). And since λ_emit is inversely proportional to temperature, a higher λ_emit would mean lower temperature.

But wait, according to the problem, the observed λ_max is same for both. So Star_2's λ_emit must be shorter than Star_1's λ_emit, because when it's moving away, the observed λ_obs is longer. So to have the same observed λ, Star_2 must emit a shorter λ, which implies a higher temperature. Hmm, maybe I did the algebra wrong.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let’s define:

λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1 * (1 + v1/c) 

But v1 is zero, so λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1

Similarly, λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + v2/c)

But given that λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we have:

λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + v2/c)

But from Wien's law:

λ_emit,1 = b / T1

λ_emit,2 = b / T2

So substituting:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Take reciprocal:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Wait, that makes sense. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is larger. But since the observed λ is same as Star_1, Star_2 must have a shorter emitted λ, which implies higher temperature. So T2 is higher, which makes sense.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

But v2 is 700,000 m/s. Let's compute the factor (1 + v2/c). v2 is positive, so moving away.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

v2/c = 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.02333...

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.02333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.02333.

Wait, so the temperature of Star_2 is about 2.33% higher than Star_1.

Now, back to the luminosity ratio. L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4)

We have R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Squared is 2.25.

T1 is T1, T2 is T1 * 1.02333. So T2 = T1 * (1 + 0.02333).

So T2^4 = T1^4 * (1.02333)^4.

Putting it into the luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( (1)^2 * (T1 * 1.02333)^4 )

Simplify:

= (2.25 ) * ( T1^4 ) / ( T1^4 * (1.02333)^4 )

The T1^4 terms cancel, so:

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1.02333)^4

Wait, that's 2.25 divided by (1.02333)^4.

Let me compute (1.02333)^4. Let's compute step by step.

First, 1.02333^2: 1.02333 * 1.02333.

Let me calculate:

1.02333 * 1.02333 = approx 1.0475.

Wait, because 0.02333^2 is about 0.000544, and cross terms are 2 * 0.02333 *1 = 0.04666. So 1 + 0.04666 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.0472.

So 1.02333^2 ≈ 1.0472.

Now, square that again for the 4th power: 1.0472^2 = ?

Compute 1.0472 * 1.0472.

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.0472 = 0.0472.

0.0472 * 1 = 0.0472.

0.0472 * 0.0472 ≈ 0.00222784.

Adding up: 1 + 0.0472 + 0.0472 + 0.00222784 = around 1.10262784.

Wait, wait, let me do it more accurately.

Alternatively, we can compute (1.0472)^2 using the formula (a + b)^2, where a=1, b=0.0472.

So, (1 + 0.0472)^2 = 1^2 + 2*1*0.0472 + (0.0472)^2.

Which is 1 + 0.0944 + 0.00222784 = 1.09662784.

Ah, so (1.02333)^4 ≈ 1.0966.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.25 divided by approximately 1.0966.

What's 2.25 / 1.0966?

Let me compute this division.

1.0966 * 2 = 2.1932; that's less than 2.25.

Difference: 2.25 - 2.1932 = 0.0568.

So 0.0568 / 1.0966 ≈ 0.0518.

So total is approx 2.0518.

Wait, wait. 1.0966 * 2.05 = ?

2 * 1.0966 = 2.1932.

0.05 * 1.0966 = 0.05483.

Total 2.1932 + 0.05483 = 2.24803.

Which is very close to 2.25. So 2.05 * 1.0966 = ~2.248, which is just under 2.25. So 2.05 times 1.0966 is 2.248, so 2.25 is 2.05 times (since 2.05 * 1.0966 ≈ 2.248, which is 2.25 minus 0.002, so about 2.05 * 1.0966 ≈ 2.25). So 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.05.

Wait, but wait: 2.05 * 1.0966 = 2.248, which is 2.25 minus 0.002. So perhaps 2.05 is the approximate value. So L1/L2 ≈ 2.05.

But wait, this doesn't match any of the options. The options are 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35.

Hmm, maybe my approximation for (1.02333)^4 is off. Let me try a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.02333)^4 more accurately.

Let me compute 1.02333^4 step by step.

First, 1.02333^2: (1.02333)^2 = ?

1.02333 * 1.02333.

Let me compute:

1.02333
x 1.02333
------------
Multiply step by step:

1.02333 * 1 = 1.02333

1.02333 * 0.02 = 0.0204666

1.02333 * 0.003 = 0.00306999

1.02333 * 0.0003 = 0.000306999

1.02333 * 0.00003 = 0.0000306999

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute as (1 + 0.02333)^2.

Which is 1 + 2*0.02333 + (0.02333)^2.

= 1 + 0.04666 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.047204.

So 1.02333^2 ≈ 1.047204.

Now, 1.047204^2 is (1.047204)^2.

Again, using the same approach: (1 + 0.047204)^2.

Which is 1 + 2*(0.047204) + (0.047204)^2.

= 1 + 0.094408 + 0.0022284.

Total: 1.0966364.

So (1.02333)^4 ≈ 1.0966364.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966364.

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.0966364.

Hmm, 1.0966364 is approximately 1.09664.

Compute 2.25 / 1.09664.

Let me compute this division.

We can write this as 2.25 / 1.09664 ≈ ?

Alternatively, we can compute it as 225000 / 109664 ≈ ?

Wait, let me compute it numerically.

Alternatively, since 1.09664 * 2.05 = approx 2.248, which is just under 2.25. So 2.05 is slightly less. Let me compute 2.05 * 1.09664.

2.05 * 1.09664 = (2 * 1.09664) + (0.05 * 1.09664) = 2.19328 + 0.054832 = 2.248112.

Which is 2.248112, which is 2.25 minus 0.001888.

So 2.05 gives us 2.248112, which is 0.001888 less than 2.25.

So perhaps 2.05 + (0.001888 / 1.09664) ) would give us the exact value.

0.001888 / 1.09664 ≈ 0.00172.

So total would be 2.05 + 0.00172 ≈ 2.05172.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.05172.

Wait, but that's about 2.05. That's not matching any of the options given. The options are ~2.23, ~2.25, ~2.32, ~2.35.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem. Oh, wait a second. The problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. But which star is which? Oh, Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700. So Star_2's observed λ is longer than its emitted λ. So to have the same observed λ as Star_1, Star_2 must have a higher temperature, as we thought earlier.

Wait, but maybe I got the Doppler shift formula wrong. Let me double-check.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c)

Where v is positive when moving away. So for Star_2, which is moving away at 700 km/s, the observed wavelength is longer. Since the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, that implies:

λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + v2/c)

Because λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1.

So λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + v2/c)

But from Wien's law, λ_emit = b / T.

So, substituting:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2 / T1 = 1 + v2/c

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Which makes T2 higher than T1.

So that part was correct.

Now, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

We know R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1² = 2.25 R2².

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25 R2²) * T1⁴ / (R2² * T2⁴) )

Simplify:

= 2.25 * (T1^4) / (T2^4)

But T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) → T2 = T1 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e8 )

Compute (700,000 / 300,000,000) = 700/(3e5) )= 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.023333.

So,

T2^4 = (T1 * 1.023333)^4 = T1^4 * (1.023333)^4.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1.023333)^4.

Earlier, I found (1.023333)^4 ≈ 1.09664.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.09664 ≈ approximately 2.05.

But the options don't include 2.05; the closest is option A) ~2.25, which is the R factor alone. But that can't be right, because the temperature affects it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.023333)^4. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 1.02333^4 step by step.

First, 1.02333 squared:

1.02333 * 1.02333.

Let me compute it more accurately.

1.02333 × 1.02333:

= (1 + 0.02333) × (1 + 0.02333)

= 1 + 2*(0.02333) + (0.02333)^2

= 1 + 0.04666 + 0.000544

= 1.047204.

So squared is 1.047204.

Now, square that again to get the fourth power.

1.047204 × 1.047204.

Again, using (1 + 0.047204)^2.

= 1 + 2*(0.047204) + (0.047204)^2

= 1 + 0.094408 + 0.0022284

= 1.0966364.

So (1.02333)^4 = 1.0966364.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966364 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0966364.

Let me compute this division precisely.

Using a calculator approach:

1.0966364 × 2.05 = ?

1.0966364 × 2 = 2.1932728.

1.0966364 × 0.05 = 0.05483182.

Adding them gives 2.1932728 + 0.05483182 = 2.24810462.

Which is 2.2481, which is just 0.001895 less than 2.25.

So 2.05 * 1.0966364 = 2.24810462.

So 2.05 gives 2.2481, which is 0.001895 less than 2.25. How much more do I need?

The difference is 0.001895.

So, how much more than 2.05 is needed to get to 2.25.

The remaining amount is 0.001895.

So, 0.001895 / 1.0966364 ≈ 0.001727.

So, 2.05 + 0.001727 ≈ 2.051727.

So, 2.051727 × 1.0966364 ≈ 2.25.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.0517.

Which is approximately 2.05. But none of the options are this low.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let's think again.

Wait, the problem states that both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. But wait, that's the observed wavelength, right? Because that's what the astronomers measure. So for Star_1, λ_obs1 = λ_emit1, because it's not moving. For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c). So if λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then λ_emit2 = λ_obs1/(1 + v2/c) = λ_emit1/(1 + v2/c).

Wait, no. Wait, the observed wavelength is the same for both stars. So:

λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1.

λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 × (1 + v2/c).

And λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

So,

λ_emit,2 = λ_obs,2 / (1 + v2/c) = λ_obs,1 / (1 + v2/c).

But λ_obs,1 is λ_emit,1.

So λ_emit,2 = λ_emit,1 / (1 + v2/c).

Which would imply that λ_emit,2 is shorter than λ_emit,1.

Which, per Wien's law, means T2 is higher than T1.

Because λ ∝ 1/T. So if λ_emit,2 is shorter, T2 is higher.

So, substituting into Wien's law.

λ_emit,1 = b / T1.

λ_emit,2 = b / T2.

So, from λ_emit,2 = λ_emit,1 / (1 + v2/c),

We have:

b/T2 = (b/T1) / (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b:

1/T2 = 1/(T1 (1 + v2/c)) )

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c).

Wait, that's the same as before. So T2 = T1 × 1.023333.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, so back to luminosity ratio: L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) = (2.25) × [T1^4 / (T2^4)].

But T2 = T1 × 1.023333, so T2^4 = T1^4 × (1.023333)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1.023333)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 1.096636 ≈ 2.05.

But the options don't have 2.05. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate (1.023333)^4 more accurately.

Wait, 1.023333 is 1 + 0.023333.

Let me compute (1.023333)^4 using the binomial expansion up to more terms.

The binomial expansion for (1 + x)^n, where x is small, is approximately 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2) x² + (n(n-1)(n-2)/6) x³ + ... .

Here, n=4, x=0.023333.

So,

(1.023333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.023333) + (4*3/2)* (0.023333)^2 + (4*3*2/6)*(0.023333)^3 + (4*3*2*1/24)*(0.023333)^4.

Let me compute each term:

Term 1: 1.

Term 2: 4 * 0.023333 = 0.093332.

Term 3: (12/2) * (0.023333)^2.

(0.023333)^2 ≈ 0.0005444.

So term3: 6 * 0.0005444 ≈ 0.003266.

Term4: (24/6) * (0.023333)^3.

(0.023333)^3 ≈ 0.00001266.

So term4: 4 * 0.00001266 ≈ 0.00005064.

Term5: (24/24) * (0.023333)^4.

(0.023333)^4 ≈ (0.00001266) * 0.023333 ≈ 0.000000295.

So term5: 1 * 0.000000295 ≈ 0.000000295.

Now, add all terms:

1 + 0.093332 = 1.093332.

+ 0.003266 → 1.096598.

+ 0.00005064 → 1.09664864.

+ 0.000000295 → 1.096648935.

So the approximation gives (1.023333)^4 ≈ 1.096648935.

Which is very close to our earlier calculation of 1.0966364. So our initial calculation was correct.

So, 2.25 / 1.096648935 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.096648935.

Using a calculator,

2.25 ÷ 1.096648935 ≈ approximately 2.0517.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.05.

But the options don’t have this value. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again about the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic Doppler shift formula instead of the approximation. Because even though 700 km/s is small compared to the speed of light, maybe the approximation isn't good enough for the problem.

The relativistic formula is:

λ_obs / λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, but v is the radial velocity. So for a source moving away, v is positive. So,

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

In this case, v is 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

v/c = 700000 / 3e8 = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So,

sqrt( (1+0.023333)/(1-0.023333) ) = sqrt(1.023333 / 0.9766667 )

Compute numerator and denominator:

1.023333 / 0.9766667 ≈ 1.047999.

So sqrt(1.047999) ≈ 1.0237.

Hmm, that's a bit higher than our previous approximation of 1.02333.

So, λ_obs = λ_emit * 1.0237.

So, if the observed λ is the same for both stars,

λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * 1.0237.

So,

λ_emit,1 / λ_emit,2 = 1.0237.

But from Wien's law, λ ∝ 1/T.

So,

(λ_emit,1) / (λ_emit,2) ) = T2 / T1 = 1.0237.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.0237.

So, T2 = T1 × 1.0237.

Now, compute (T2 / T1 )^4 = (1.0237)^4.

Compute 1.0237^4.

Again, perhaps using the binomial expansion.

x = 0.0237.

(1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 +4x + 6x^2 +4x^3 +x^4.

Compute each term:

1 = 1.

4x =4 * 0.0237 = 0.0948.

6x² =6*(0.0237)^2=6*(0.00056169)=0.00337014.

4x^3=4*(0.0237)^3=4*(0.00001333)=0.00005332.

x^4= (0.0237)^4 ≈ (0.00001333)*(0.0237)= ~3.16e-7.

Adding up:

1 +0.0948 =1.0948.

+0.00337014=1.09817.

+0.00005332=1.09822332.

+3.16e-7=1.09822648.

So, (1.0237)^4 ≈ 1.098226.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) / 1.098226 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 / 1.098226.

Hmm, let's compute:

1.098226 × 2.05 = 2.2481117.

Which is 2.2481, which is 2.25 - 2.2481 = 0.0019 less than 2.25.

So, we need a little more than 2.05.

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.098226.

Using division:

1.098226 × 2.045 = ?

= 1.098226 × 2 = 2.196452.

+ 1.098226 × 0.045 = 0.04942017.

Total ≈ 2.196452 + 0.04942017 ≈ 2.245872.

Still less than 2.25.

So, 2.045 × 1.098226 ≈ 2.245872.

Difference: 2.25 - 2.245872 = 0.004128.

So, how much more? 0.004128 / 1.098226 ≈ 0.00376.

So, 2.045 + 0.00376 ≈ 2.04876.

So, 2.04876 × 1.098226 ≈ 2.25.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.04876.

Approximately 2.05.

Again, not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem states that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So the factor is L1/L2.

So, according to our calculations, it's around 2.05. But the options are higher. Am I missing something?

Wait, perhaps the luminosity ratio is (L1/L2), but I may have inverted the ratio somewhere.

Wait, no. Because L1 is Star_1, and L2 is Star_2. So, according to our calculations, L1 is about 2.05 times L2.

But the options don't include 2.05. The options are A) 2.25, B)2.32, C)2.35, D)2.23.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in including the Doppler shift. Let me think again.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer than its emitted wavelength. But since the observed wavelength is the same as Star_1's, the emitted wavelength of Star_2 must be shorter. Which means higher temperature.

So T2 is higher than T1.

In that case, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So, in the luminosity formula, T2 is larger, which would reduce the luminosity ratio, because T is raised to the fourth power in the denominator.

Wait, so I think the calculations are correct, but the answer isn't among the options. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I used the approximation for Doppler shift as 1 + v/c, but actually, the relativistic formula is different.

Wait, using the exact Doppler formula:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So, for Star_2, moving away, v = +700 km/s.

So,

λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

And since λ_obs,2 = λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1,

So,

λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which implies,

λ_emit,2 = λ_emit,1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

= λ_emit,1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Thus,

λ_emit,2 = λ_emit,1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Using v=700 km/s,

v/c = 700,000 / 3e8 = 0.00233333...

So,

(1 - v/c) = 0.997666667.

(1 + v/c) = 1.002333333.

So,

( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) ) = (0.997666667)/(1.002333333) ≈ (0.997666667)/(1.002333333) ≈ 0.99537.

So,

sqrt(0.99537) ≈ 0.99768.

So,

λ_emit,2 = λ_emit,1 × 0.99768.

Which means,

λ_emit,2 ≈ 0.99768 × λ_emit,1.

So, since λ_emit ∝ 1/T,

T2 = T1 × (λ_emit,1 / λ_emit,2 )

= T1 × (1 / 0.99768 )

≈ T1 × 1.00233.

Wait, because if λ2 = 0.99768 * λ1,

then λ2 = λ1 * 0.99768 → λ2 < λ1 → T2 > T1.

So, T2 = T1 × 1.00233.

Hmm, that's a much smaller increase in temperature. So, the previous approach using the approximation (1 + v/c) is leading to a higher T2, but the relativistic approach gives a smaller T2.

Wait, this changes everything. So earlier calculations were incorrect because I used the linear approximation for Doppler shift when I should have used the exact formula.

So, let's redo the Doppler shift correctly.

Using the exact Doppler shift formula for wavelength:

λ_obs = λ_emit × sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

For Star_2, v is positive (moving away), so:

λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 × sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But λ_obs,2 = λ_obs,1 → λ_emit,1 = λ_obs,1.

So,

λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 × sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Thus,

λ_emit,2 = λ_emit,1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

= λ_emit,1 × sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

λ_emit,2 = λ_emit,1 × sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

As we found earlier.

Which gives λ_emit,2 = λ_emit,1 × sqrt( (1 - 0.0023333)/(1 + 0.0023333) )

= λ_emit,1 × sqrt( 0.9976667 / 1.0023333 )

Compute 0.9976667 / 1.0023333 ≈ 0.99537.

sqrt(0.99537) ≈ 0.99768.

So,

λ_emit,2 ≈ 0.99768 × λ_emit,1.

Which implies that λ_emit,2 is shorter than λ_emit,1. So, T2 = T1 × (λ_emit,1 / λ_emit,2 ) = T1 × (1 / 0.99768 ) ≈ T1 × 1.00233.

So,

T2 = T1 × 1.00233.

So, T2 is only about 0.233% higher than T1.

Hmm, that's a much smaller temperature difference than I thought earlier. So, this changes the calculation.

Now, compute T2^4.

T2 = T1 × 1.00233.

So,

T2^4 = T1^4 × (1.00233)^4.

Compute (1.00233)^4.

Using the binomial expansion up to more terms.

x = 0.00233.

So,

(1 + x)^4 = 1 +4x +6x² +4x³ +x^4.

Compute each term:

1 = 1.

4x =4 *0.00233=0.00932.

6x²=6*(0.00233)^2=6*(0.0000054289)=0.0000325734.

4x³=4*(0.00233)^3=4*(0.0000000125)=0.00000005.

x^4=(0.00233)^4≈0.00000000029.

Adding all terms:

1 + 0.00932 =1.00932.

+0.0000325734 =1.0093525734.

+0.00000005=1.0093526234.

+0.00000000029≈1.0093526237.

So, (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.0093526.

Thus,

L1/L2 = (2.25) / (1.0093526) ≈ 2.25 / 1.0093526 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So, the correct answer should be option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \implies \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:
\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \implies \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, meaning their observed peak wavelengths, \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}}\) and \(\lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), are equal. Using Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}\), the temperature of a star is inversely proportional to its peak wavelength.

For Star_1, since its radial velocity is 0, its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength:
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}}
\]

For Star_2, its radial velocity is \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} = 700,000 \, \text{m/s}\), and its observed wavelength is redshifted due to its motion away from us. The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate:
\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Rearranging for \(\lambda_{\text{emit,2}}\):
\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
\]

Using \(v_2/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 0.002333\), we compute:
\[
\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c} = \frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333} = \frac{0.997667}{1.002333} \approx 0.99537
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.99537} \approx 0.99768
\]

Thus:
\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} \times 0.99768
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto 1/T\), the temperature ratio is:
\[
T_2 = T_1 \times \frac{\lambda_{\text{emit,1}}}{\lambda_{\text{emit,2}}} = T_1 \times \frac{1}{0.99768} \approx T_1 \times 1.00233
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \frac{2.25}{(T_2 / T_1)^4}
\]

Using \(T_2 / T_1 = 1.00233\), we compute:
\[
(T_2 / T_1)^4 = (1.00233)^4
\]

Expanding \((1.00233)^4\) using the binomial approximation:
\[
(1 + x)^4 \approx 1 + 4x + 6x^2 + 4x^3 + x^4, \quad x = 0.00233
\]
\[
(1.00233)^4 \approx 1 + 4(0.00233) + 6(0.00233)^2 + 4(0.00233)^3 + (0.00233)^4
\]
\[
= 1 + 0.00932 + 0.00003257 + 0.00000005 + 0.00000000029 \approx 1.0093526
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.0093526} \approx 2.229
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.
