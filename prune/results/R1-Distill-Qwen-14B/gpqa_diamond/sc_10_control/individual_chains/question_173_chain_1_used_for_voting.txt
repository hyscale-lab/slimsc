Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is involved when dealing with uncertainties in measurements like position and momentum. The question is asking about the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE, given the uncertainty in position, Δx.

The problem states that an electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed v of 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. Wait, 0.1 nm is 0.1 x 10^-9 meters, which is 1e-10 meters. Right, because 1 nm is 1e-9 meters.

So, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum must be at least on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. But since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I can take the equality Δx * Δp = ħ/2.

But wait, the question is about energy uncertainty, ΔE. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty in energy is related to the uncertainty in momentum because energy and momentum are related through other principles. But wait, I think the direct relation is that the uncertainty in energy relates to the derivative of the Hamiltonian, but perhaps for this problem, we can use the momentum-energy relation.

Wait, another approach: the uncertainty in energy can be linked to the uncertainty in momentum through the kinetic energy formula. Because for a non-relativistic particle, the kinetic energy K is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So if there's an uncertainty in p, that would lead to an uncertainty in K, which is the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the time-energy uncertainty relation. Oh wait, but in this case, the particle is moving, so maybe the uncertainty in energy is related to the uncertainty in momentum. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the relation ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, but the problem gives us the speed v. So maybe it's better to first compute the uncertainty in momentum Δp, then find the uncertainty in energy ΔE.

So let's start with calculating Δp. Using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, Δx * Δp = ħ/2. I'll need to compute Δp. Then, since the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be (Δp²)/(2m). Wait, but that's the approach when dealing with the uncertainty in p leading to the uncertainty in K.

Alternatively, perhaps using relativistic equations, but given the speed v is 2e8 m/s, which is 20% the speed of light (since c is ~3e8 m/s). So relativistic effects could be significant, but maybe the problem expects a non-relativistic approach.

Wait, but let me check: 2e8 m/s is 2e8 / (3e8) = 0.666... times the speed of light. So that's about 67% the speed of light, which is substantial. So a relativistic approach might be needed. But perhaps the problem is intended to use the non-relativistic formula for simplicity.

Wait, let's see what the options are. The options are in the order of 1e-18 to 1e-16 J. Let me think about the calculation steps.

First, compute Δp from Δx. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So Δp = ħ/(2Δx). Let's plug in the numbers.

Δx is 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m. So Δp = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) ) = approx (1.05e-34) / (2e-10) ) = 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 1e-34 divided by 2e-10 is (1/2) * 1e-24, which is 5e-25. So Δp ≈ 5.27e-25 kg m/s.

Now, the momentum p is related to kinetic energy K via K = p²/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So the uncertainty in K, which is ΔK, would be approximately ( (Δp)^2 ) / (2m) ), assuming that p is large compared to Δp, so that we can approximate the derivative. Alternatively, maybe we can take the uncertainty in K as the variance, but perhaps a linear approximation is sufficient here.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the momentum-energy uncertainty principle. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact relation. Alternatively, perhaps the uncertainty in energy is linked to the uncertainty in momentum through the energy expression. So, for an electron, the total energy E is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², but again, maybe the problem expects a non-relativistic approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy only, so E = p²/(2m). So then, ΔE would be approximately the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by Δp. The derivative dE/dp is p/m, so ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, that would be the case if E is a linear function of p, which it is in the non-relativistic case. So let's proceed with this approach.

But wait, if we use E = p²/(2m), then the uncertainty in E would be approximately (2p/(2m)) * Δp = (p/(m)) * Δp. Wait, no, because dE/dp is (2p)/(2m) ) = p/m. So ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, we don't know p yet. We can find p from the given speed v. Since v = p/(m), so p = m*v. So, substituting back, ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp = (v) * Δp.

Wait, that seems convenient. So ΔE ≈ v * Δp.

So with v = 2e8 m/s and Δp = 5.27e-25 kg·m/s, let's compute this.

ΔE ≈ (2e8 m/s) * (5.27e-25 kg·m/s) = 2e8 * 5.27e-25 = (2 *5.27) e(8-25) )= 10.54e-17 = 1.054e-16 J.

Wait, but that's about 1e-16 J, which is option D. But wait, let me double-check the approach, because I might have missed something.

Alternatively, perhaps using the non-relativistic relation, and considering the uncertainty in energy as (Δp)^2/(2m), since E = p²/(2m), so ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m).

Let me compute that. (Δp)^2 is (5.27e-25)^2 = approx 2.77e-49. Divide by (2m), where m is the mass of the electron, which is 9.11e-31 kg. So 2m is 1.822e-30.

So (2.77e-49) / (1.822e-30) ) = 1.52e-19 J. Hmm, that's about 1e-19 J, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm getting two different answers depending on the approach. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should think about this more carefully. When using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the energy uncertainty arises from the momentum uncertainty. The kinetic energy is (p^2)/(2m), so its uncertainty would be the derivative of that with respect to p times the uncertainty in p.

The derivative of K with respect to p is p/m, so the uncertainty in K is approximately (p/m) * Δp. But that's when p is much larger than Δp, which might not be the case here.

Wait, but if p is much larger than Δp, then (p/m) * Δp would be (v) * Δp, as before. So that approach would give a larger ΔE.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the variance formula. The variance in K is (Δp)^2 * (dK/dp)^2 + ... but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum uncertainty in energy arises from the uncertainty in momentum, so using the formula ΔE ≈ Δp^2/(2m).

Wait, but let's compute both ways.

First approach: ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

We have p = m*v. So (p/m) is v. So ΔE = v * Δp.

v=2e8 m/s.

Δp=5.27e-25 kg m/s.

So (2e8) * (5.27e-25) = 1.054e-16 J. So about 1e-16 J, option D.

Second approach: ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m).

(5.27e-25)^2 = 2.77e-49.

2m = 2*(9.11e-31) = 1.822e-30.

So 2.77e-49 / 1.822e-30 ≈ 1.52e-19 J, which is option C.

Hmm, so which approach is correct?

I think the correct approach is the second one, using ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m), because that's the standard way to calculate the uncertainty in kinetic energy when you have an uncertainty in momentum. Alternatively, perhaps the first approach is an approximation when p is much larger than Δp, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the first approach gives a much larger ΔE, which is option D. Let me think about the actual values.

The given speed v is 2e8 m/s, which is about 20% the speed of light. So, relativistically, the momentum is not negligible compared to the rest mass energy, but perhaps the problem expects the non-relativistic approach.

Wait, let's compute p using v=2e8 m/s.

p = m*v = 9.11e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 1.822e-22 kg m/s.

Δp is 5.27e-25 kg m/s.

So the ratio Δp/p is (5.27e-25) / (1.822e-22) ) ≈ 0.029 or about 2.9%. So Δp is about 3% of p. So, the non-relativistic approach might not be the best, but perhaps it's acceptable for an estimate.

So, using the first approach: ΔE = v * Δp.

v =2e8 m/s.

Δp =5.27e-25 kg m/s.

So ΔE = 2e8 * 5.27e-25 = 1.054e-16 J, which is option D.

Wait, but the second approach gives about 1e-19 J, option C.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the kinetic energy but the total energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the time-energy uncertainty principle. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the energy uncertainty is related to the rate of change of energy, but that's getting more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more straightforward. Let's think about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle again. The minimum uncertainty in momentum is ħ/(2Δx), which is 1e-34 / (2 * 1e-10) ) ≈ 5e-25 kg m/s.

Then, using the kinetic energy formula E = p²/(2m), the uncertainty in E would be approximately ( (Δp)^2 )/(2m) ), assuming that p is much larger than Δp, which isn't the case here, but perhaps it's the approach.

But let me compute that: (5.27e-25)^2 = 2.77e-49. Divided by (2 * 9.11e-31) ) → 2.77e-49 / 1.822e-30 ≈ 1.52e-19 J. So that's option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the relativistic energy. The total energy is E = gamma m c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But for v=2e8 m/s, let's compute gamma:

v = 2e8 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s.

v²/c² = (4e16) / (9e16) ) = 4/9 ≈ 0.444.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.5555, sqrt(0.5555) ≈ 0.745, so gamma ≈ 1.342.

So the total energy is E = gamma m c².

The momentum p is gamma m v.

So, the energy is E = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 )^0.5.

But perhaps in this problem, the energy uncertainty is linked to the momentum uncertainty via the derivative of E with respect to p. So dE/dp is (p c²) / E.

So, perhaps the uncertainty in E is (dE/dp) * Δp.

Which would be (p c²) / E * Δp.

But since E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), and p is gamma m v, which is higher than the non-relativistic case.

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Let me try to compute it.

We have p = gamma m v.

gamma is 1.342, m is 9.11e-31 kg, v=2e8 m/s.

So p = 1.342 * 9.11e-31 * 2e8 ≈ 1.342 * 1.822e-22 ≈ 2.44e-22 kg m/s.

E, the total energy, would be sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ).

p c = 2.44e-22 * 3e8 ≈ 7.32e-14 J.

m c^2 = 9.11e-31 * (3e8)^2 = 9.11e-31 *9e16= 8.199e-14 J.

So E = sqrt( (7.32e-14)^2 + (8.199e-14)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (5.36e-27 + 6.72e-27) ) = sqrt(1.208e-26) ≈ 1.1e-13 J.

Wait, wait, that's way too high. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, p c is 2.44e-22 kg·m/s * 3e8 m/s → 2.44e-22 *3e8 = 7.32e-14 J? Oh wait, no. Wait, energy is in joules. So yes, that's correct.

m c² is 9.11e-31 kg * (3e8)^2 m²/s². (3e8)^2 is 9e16, so 9.11e-31 *9e16 = 8.199e-14 J.

So E is sqrt( (7.32e-14)^2 + (8.199e-14)^2 ) = sqrt( 5.36e-27 + 6.72e-27 ) = sqrt(1.208e-26) ≈ 1.1e-13 J.

So dE/dp = (p c²)/E.

p c² = 2.44e-22 kg m/s * (9e16 m²/s²) = 2.44e-22 *9e16 = 2.196e-5 J·m.

Wait, no: p is in kg m/s, c² is m²/s². So p * c² = (kg m/s) * (m²/s²) ) = kg m^3/s^3 → which is J·m, because J is kg m²/s². So, kg m^3/s^3 is J·m.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me compute dE/dp.

dE/dp = (p c^2) / E.

So, (2.44e-22 kg m/s) * (9e16 m²/s²) ) → 2.44e-22 *9e16 = 2.196e-5 kg m^3/s^3 → which is J·m.

Wait, but E is 1.1e-13 J.

So, dE/dp = (2.196e-5 J·m) / (1.1e-13 J) ) ≈ 1.996e8 m/s.

So, the uncertainty in E is dE/dp * Δp = 1.996e8 * 5.27e-25 ≈ 1.057e-16 J.

So that's about 1e-16 J, which is option D.

Wait, that's the same as the first approach I took earlier, using the non-relativistic formula. But why is the relativistic approach giving the same answer as the non-relativistic approach?

Hmm, perhaps because in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), and the derivative is p/m, which would be v. So v * Δp is the same as (p/m) * Δp, which is the same as the first approach.

But in the relativistic case, dE/dp is (p c²)/E. So when we compute dE/dp * Δp, we get a larger value than the non-relativistic case.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, the relativistic approach gave me about 1e-16 J, which is option D, while the non-relativistic approach with the (Δp)^2/(2m) gave me 1e-19 J, which is option C. So which approach is correct?

I think I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The problem is about the minimum uncertainty in energy, which is linked to the uncertainty in momentum via the kinetic energy formula. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the non-relativistic formula, since the speed is 2e8 m/s, which is about 0.67c, so relativistic effects might be significant, but perhaps the problem expects a non-relativistic approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate ΔE as (Δp)^2/(2m), which gives 1e-19 J, option C.

Wait, but why would the relativistic approach give a different answer? Because the energy expression is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the minimum uncertainty in energy arises from the uncertainty in momentum through the relation E = p²/(2m), treating it as the only contribution. So the uncertainty in E would be (Δp)^2/(2m).

In that case, let's compute that again.

Δp is 5.27e-25 kg m/s.

(5.27e-25)^2 = 2.77e-49.

Divided by (2 *9.11e-31) ) → 2.77e-49 / 1.822e-30 ≈ 1.52e-19 J. So that's option C.

But earlier, when I used the relativistic approach, I got about 1e-16 J, which is option D.

Hmm, now I'm really confused. Let me try to think about which approach is correct.

In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty in energy is linked to the derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to momentum. So for the kinetic energy, which is a function of p, the uncertainty in energy would be the derivative of K with respect to p multiplied by the uncertainty in p.

In the non-relativistic case, K = p²/(2m), so dK/dp = p/m. So ΔK ≈ (p/m) * Δp = v * Δp.

In the relativistic case, K = (gamma -1) m c², and gamma is a function of p. So perhaps the uncertainty in K would be more involved.

But the problem gives a speed, so perhaps we should compute the momentum from that speed, considering relativity.

But earlier, when I used the relativistic approach, the energy uncertainty came out to about 1e-16 J, which is option D.

But another way to approach this: perhaps the problem is simply expecting me to compute ΔE using the non-relativistic approach, given that the options are in the 1e-16 to 1e-18 range.

So, using the non-relativistic approach, ΔE= v*Δp.

v=2e8 m/s, Δp=5.27e-25 kg m/s.

2e8 *5.27e-25 = 1.05e-16 J. So that's option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy as the kinetic energy, so the first approach is correct, and the answer is D.

But wait, why would the second approach, using (Δp)^2/(2m), give a different answer? Because for small Δp compared to p, the two approaches would give different results.

Wait, the ratio of Δp to p is about 5e-25 / 1.8e-22 ≈ 0.028, which is about 2.8% as I computed earlier. So it's not negligible, but perhaps in the non-relativistic case, the second approach is more accurate.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as the standard formula for the uncertainty in kinetic energy when you have an uncertainty in momentum.

In statistical terms, the variance in K would be (dK/dp)^2 * (Δp)^2.

So for K = p²/(2m), dK/dp = p/m, so (dK/dp)^2 = p²/m².

So variance in K is (p²/m²) * (Δp)^2.

So ΔK ≈ (p/m) * Δp = v * Δp.

Which brings us back to the first approach, giving 1e-16 J.

So perhaps that's the correct approach, and the answer is option D.

I think I'm getting myself into a loop here, but perhaps I should proceed with the approach that uses the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle directly, leading to option D, 1e-16 J.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy \( \Delta E \) of an electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between momentum and energy. The problem provides the uncertainty in the electron's position \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \) and its speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

### Step 1: Uncertainty in Momentum
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states:
\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]
where \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). For the minimum uncertainty, we take the equality:
\[
\Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta p = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 1 \times 10^{-10}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Relating Momentum Uncertainty to Energy Uncertainty
The kinetic energy of a particle is given by:
\[
K = \frac{p^2}{2m},
\]
where \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of the electron. The uncertainty in kinetic energy \( \Delta K \) can be approximated as:
\[
\Delta K \approx \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m}.
\]
Substituting \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \) and \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \):
\[
\Delta K = \frac{(5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]
First, calculate \( (\Delta p)^2 \):
\[
(\Delta p)^2 = (5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2 = 2.77 \times 10^{-49}.
\]
Then, divide by \( 2m \):
\[
\Delta K = \frac{2.77 \times 10^{-49}}{1.822 \times 10^{-30}} = 1.52 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Alternative Approach Using \( \Delta E \approx v \cdot \Delta p \)
Another approach relates the energy uncertainty directly to the speed and momentum uncertainty:
\[
\Delta E \approx v \cdot \Delta p.
\]
Substituting \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \):
\[
\Delta E = (2 \times 10^8) \cdot (5.27 \times 10^{-25}) = 1.054 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 4: Comparing Results
The two approaches yield different results:
- Using \( \Delta E \approx \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m} \), we get \( \Delta E \approx 1.52 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \) (Option C).
- Using \( \Delta E \approx v \cdot \Delta p \), we get \( \Delta E \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J} \) (Option D).

The problem does not explicitly specify whether to use the relativistic or non-relativistic energy relation. However, the second approach, \( \Delta E \approx v \cdot \Delta p \), is more consistent with the given speed and the direct relationship between momentum and energy. Thus, the answer is:

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is involved when dealing with uncertainties in measurements like position and momentum. The question is asking about the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE, given the uncertainty in position, Δx.

The problem states that an electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed v of 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. Wait, 0.1 nm is 0.1 x 10^-9 meters, which is 1e-10 meters. Right, because 1 nm is 1e-9 meters.

So, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum must be at least on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. But since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I can take the equality Δx * Δp = ħ/2.

But wait, the question is about energy uncertainty, ΔE. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty in energy is related to the uncertainty in momentum because energy and momentum are related through other principles. But wait, I think the direct relation is that the uncertainty in energy relates to the derivative of the Hamiltonian, but perhaps for this problem, we can use the momentum-energy relation.

Wait, another approach: the uncertainty in energy can be linked to the uncertainty in momentum through the kinetic energy formula. Because for a non-relativistic particle, the kinetic energy K is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So if there's an uncertainty in p, that would lead to an uncertainty in K, which is the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the time-energy uncertainty relation. Oh wait, but in this case, the particle is moving, so maybe the uncertainty in energy is related to the uncertainty in momentum. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the relation ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, but the problem gives us the speed v. So maybe it's better to first compute the uncertainty in momentum Δp, then find the uncertainty in energy ΔE.

So let's start with calculating Δp. Using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, Δx * Δp = ħ/2. I'll need to compute Δp. Then, since the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be (Δp²)/(2m). Wait, but that's the approach when dealing with the uncertainty in p leading to the uncertainty in K.

Alternatively, perhaps using relativistic equations, but given the speed v is 2e8 m/s, which is 20% the speed of light (since c is ~3e8 m/s). So relativistic effects could be significant, but maybe the problem expects a non-relativistic approach.

Wait, but let me check: 2e8 m/s is 2e8 / (3e8) = 0.666... times the speed of light. So that's about 67% the speed of light, which is substantial. So a relativistic approach might be needed. But perhaps the problem is intended to use the non-relativistic formula for simplicity.

Wait, let's see what the options are. The options are in the order of 1e-18 to 1e-16 J. Let me think about the calculation steps.

First, compute Δp from Δx. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So Δp = ħ/(2Δx). Let's plug in the numbers.

Δx is 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m. So Δp = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) ) = approx (1.05e-34) / (2e-10) ) = 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 1e-34 divided by 2e-10 is (1/2) * 1e-24, which is 5e-25. So Δp ≈ 5.27e-25 kg m/s.

Now, the momentum p is related to kinetic energy K via K = p²/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So the uncertainty in K, which is ΔK, would be approximately ( (Δp)^2 ) / (2m) ), assuming that p is large compared to Δp, so that we can approximate the derivative. Alternatively, maybe we can take the uncertainty in K as the variance, but perhaps a linear approximation is sufficient here.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the momentum-energy uncertainty principle. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact relation. Alternatively, perhaps the uncertainty in energy is linked to the uncertainty in momentum through the energy expression. So, for an electron, the total energy E is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², but again, maybe the problem expects a non-relativistic approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy only, so E = p²/(2m). So then, ΔE would be approximately the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by Δp. The derivative dE/dp is p/m, so ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, that would be the case if E is a linear function of p, which it is in the non-relativistic case. So let's proceed with this approach.

But wait, if we use E = p²/(2m), then the uncertainty in E would be approximately (2p/(2m)) * Δp = (p/(m)) * Δp. Wait, no, because dE/dp is (2p)/(2m) ) = p/m. So ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, we don't know p yet. We can find p from the given speed v. Since v = p/(m), so p = m*v. So, substituting back, ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp = (v) * Δp.

Wait, that seems convenient. So ΔE ≈ v * Δp.

So with v = 2e8 m/s and Δp = 5.27e-25 kg·m/s, let's compute this.

ΔE ≈ (2e8 m/s) * (5.27e-25 kg·m/s) = 2e8 * 5.27e-25 = (2 *5.27) e(8-25) )= 10.54e-17 = 1.054e-16 J.

Wait, but that's about 1e-16 J, which is option D. But wait, let me double-check the approach, because I might have missed something.

Alternatively, perhaps using the non-relativistic relation, and considering the uncertainty in energy as (Δp)^2/(2m), since E = p²/(2m), so ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m).

Let me compute that. (Δp)^2 is (5.27e-25)^2 = approx 2.77e-49. Divide by (2m), where m is the mass of the electron, which is 9.11e-31 kg. So 2m is 1.822e-30.

So (2.77e-49) / (1.822e-30) ) = 1.52e-19 J. Hmm, that's about 1e-19 J, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm getting two different answers depending on the approach. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should think about this more carefully. When using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the energy uncertainty arises from the momentum uncertainty. The kinetic energy is (p^2)/(2m), so its uncertainty would be the derivative of that with respect to p times the uncertainty in p.

The derivative of K with respect to p is p/m, so the uncertainty in K is approximately (p/m) * Δp. But that's when p is much larger than Δp, which might not be the case here.

Wait, but if p is much larger than Δp, then (p/m) * Δp would be (v) * Δp, as before. So that approach would give a larger ΔE.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the variance formula. The variance in K is (Δp)^2 * (dK/dp)^2 + ... but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum uncertainty in energy arises from the uncertainty in momentum, so using the formula ΔE ≈ Δp^2/(2m).

Wait, but let's compute both ways.

First approach: ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

We have p = m*v. So (p/m) is v. So ΔE = v * Δp.

v=2e8 m/s.

Δp=5.27e-25 kg m/s.

So (2e8) * (5.27e-25) = 1.054e-16 J. So about 1e-16 J, option D.

Second approach: ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m).

(5.27e-25)^2 = 2.77e-49.

2m = 2*(9.11e-31) = 1.822e-30.

So 2.77e-49 / 1.822e-30 ≈ 1.52e-19 J, which is option C.

Hmm, so which approach is correct?

I think the correct approach is the second one, using ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m), because that's the standard way to calculate the uncertainty in kinetic energy when you have an uncertainty in momentum. Alternatively, perhaps the first approach is an approximation when p is much larger than Δp, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the first approach gives a much larger ΔE, which is option D. Let me think about the actual values.

The given speed v is 2e8 m/s, which is about 20% the speed of light. So, relativistically, the momentum is not negligible compared to the rest mass energy, but perhaps the problem expects the non-relativistic approach.

Wait, let's compute p using v=2e8 m/s.

p = m*v = 9.11e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 1.822e-22 kg m/s.

Δp is 5.27e-25 kg m/s.

So the ratio Δp/p is (5.27e-25) / (1.822e-22) ) ≈ 0.029 or about 2.9%. So Δp is about 3% of p. So, the non-relativistic approach might not be the best, but perhaps it's acceptable for an estimate.

So, using the first approach: ΔE = v * Δp.

v =2e8 m/s.

Δp =5.27e-25 kg m/s.

So ΔE = 2e8 * 5.27e-25 = 1.054e-16 J, which is option D.

Wait, but the second approach gives about 1e-19 J, option C.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the kinetic energy but the total energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the time-energy uncertainty principle. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the energy uncertainty is related to the rate of change of energy, but that's getting more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more straightforward. Let's think about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle again. The minimum uncertainty in momentum is ħ/(2Δx), which is 1e-34 / (2 * 1e-10) ) ≈ 5e-25 kg m/s.

Then, using the kinetic energy formula E = p²/(2m), the uncertainty in E would be approximately ( (Δp)^2 )/(2m) ), assuming that p is much larger than Δp, which isn't the case here, but perhaps it's the approach.

But let me compute that: (5.27e-25)^2 = 2.77e-49. Divided by (2 * 9.11e-31) ) → 2.77e-49 / 1.822e-30 ≈ 1.52e-19 J. So that's option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the relativistic energy. The total energy is E = gamma m c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But for v=2e8 m/s, let's compute gamma:

v = 2e8 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s.

v²/c² = (4e16) / (9e16) ) = 4/9 ≈ 0.444.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.5555, sqrt(0.5555) ≈ 0.745, so gamma ≈ 1.342.

So the total energy is E = gamma m c².

The momentum p is gamma m v.

So, the energy is E = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 )^0.5.

But perhaps in this problem, the energy uncertainty is linked to the momentum uncertainty via the derivative of E with respect to p. So dE/dp is (p c²) / E.

So, perhaps the uncertainty in E is (dE/dp) * Δp.

Which would be (p c²) / E * Δp.

But since E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), and p is gamma m v, which is higher than the non-relativistic case.

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Let me try to compute it.

We have p = gamma m v.

gamma is 1.342, m is 9.11e-31 kg, v=2e8 m/s.

So p = 1.342 * 9.11e-31 * 2e8 ≈ 1.342 * 1.822e-22 ≈ 2.44e-22 kg m/s.

E, the total energy, would be sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ).

p c = 2.44e-22 * 3e8 ≈ 7.32e-14 J.

m c^2 = 9.11e-31 * (3e8)^2 = 9.11e-31 *9e16= 8.199e-14 J.

So E = sqrt( (7.32e-14)^2 + (8.199e-14)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (5.36e-27 + 6.72e-27) ) = sqrt(1.208e-26) ≈ 1.1e-13 J.

Wait, wait, that's way too high. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, p c is 2.44e-22 kg·m/s * 3e8 m/s → 2.44e-22 *3e8 = 7.32e-14 J? Oh wait, no. Wait, energy is in joules. So yes, that's correct.

m c² is 9.11e-31 kg * (3e8)^2 m²/s². (3e8)^2 is 9e16, so 9.11e-31 *9e16 = 8.199e-14 J.

So E is sqrt( (7.32e-14)^2 + (8.199e-14)^2 ) = sqrt( 5.36e-27 + 6.72e-27 ) = sqrt(1.208e-26) ≈ 1.1e-13 J.

So dE/dp = (p c²)/E.

p c² = 2.44e-22 kg m/s * (9e16 m²/s²) = 2.44e-22 *9e16 = 2.196e-5 J·m.

Wait, no: p is in kg m/s, c² is m²/s². So p * c² = (kg m/s) * (m²/s²) ) = kg m^3/s^3 → which is J·m, because J is kg m²/s². So, kg m^3/s^3 is J·m.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me compute dE/dp.

dE/dp = (p c^2) / E.

So, (2.44e-22 kg m/s) * (9e16 m²/s²) ) → 2.44e-22 *9e16 = 2.196e-5 kg m^3/s^3 → which is J·m.

Wait, but E is 1.1e-13 J.

So, dE/dp = (2.196e-5 J·m) / (1.1e-13 J) ) ≈ 1.996e8 m/s.

So, the uncertainty in E is dE/dp * Δp = 1.996e8 * 5.27e-25 ≈ 1.057e-16 J.

So that's about 1e-16 J, which is option D.

Wait, that's the same as the first approach I took earlier, using the non-relativistic formula. But why is the relativistic approach giving the same answer as the non-relativistic approach?

Hmm, perhaps because in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), and the derivative is p/m, which would be v. So v * Δp is the same as (p/m) * Δp, which is the same as the first approach.

But in the relativistic case, dE/dp is (p c²)/E. So when we compute dE/dp * Δp, we get a larger value than the non-relativistic case.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, the relativistic approach gave me about 1e-16 J, which is option D, while the non-relativistic approach with the (Δp)^2/(2m) gave me 1e-19 J, which is option C. So which approach is correct?

I think I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The problem is about the minimum uncertainty in energy, which is linked to the uncertainty in momentum via the kinetic energy formula. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the non-relativistic formula, since the speed is 2e8 m/s, which is about 0.67c, so relativistic effects might be significant, but perhaps the problem expects a non-relativistic approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate ΔE as (Δp)^2/(2m), which gives 1e-19 J, option C.

Wait, but why would the relativistic approach give a different answer? Because the energy expression is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the minimum uncertainty in energy arises from the uncertainty in momentum through the relation E = p²/(2m), treating it as the only contribution. So the uncertainty in E would be (Δp)^2/(2m).

In that case, let's compute that again.

Δp is 5.27e-25 kg m/s.

(5.27e-25)^2 = 2.77e-49.

Divided by (2 *9.11e-31) ) → 2.77e-49 / 1.822e-30 ≈ 1.52e-19 J. So that's option C.

But earlier, when I used the relativistic approach, I got about 1e-16 J, which is option D.

Hmm, now I'm really confused. Let me try to think about which approach is correct.

In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty in energy is linked to the derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to momentum. So for the kinetic energy, which is a function of p, the uncertainty in energy would be the derivative of K with respect to p multiplied by the uncertainty in p.

In the non-relativistic case, K = p²/(2m), so dK/dp = p/m. So ΔK ≈ (p/m) * Δp = v * Δp.

In the relativistic case, K = (gamma -1) m c², and gamma is a function of p. So perhaps the uncertainty in K would be more involved.

But the problem gives a speed, so perhaps we should compute the momentum from that speed, considering relativity.

But earlier, when I used the relativistic approach, the energy uncertainty came out to about 1e-16 J, which is option D.

But another way to approach this: perhaps the problem is simply expecting me to compute ΔE using the non-relativistic approach, given that the options are in the 1e-16 to 1e-18 range.

So, using the non-relativistic approach, ΔE= v*Δp.

v=2e8 m/s, Δp=5.27e-25 kg m/s.

2e8 *5.27e-25 = 1.05e-16 J. So that's option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy as the kinetic energy, so the first approach is correct, and the answer is D.

But wait, why would the second approach, using (Δp)^2/(2m), give a different answer? Because for small Δp compared to p, the two approaches would give different results.

Wait, the ratio of Δp to p is about 5e-25 / 1.8e-22 ≈ 0.028, which is about 2.8% as I computed earlier. So it's not negligible, but perhaps in the non-relativistic case, the second approach is more accurate.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as the standard formula for the uncertainty in kinetic energy when you have an uncertainty in momentum.

In statistical terms, the variance in K would be (dK/dp)^2 * (Δp)^2.

So for K = p²/(2m), dK/dp = p/m, so (dK/dp)^2 = p²/m².

So variance in K is (p²/m²) * (Δp)^2.

So ΔK ≈ (p/m) * Δp = v * Δp.

Which brings us back to the first approach, giving 1e-16 J.

So perhaps that's the correct approach, and the answer is option D.

I think I'm getting myself into a loop here, but perhaps I should proceed with the approach that uses the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle directly, leading to option D, 1e-16 J.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy \( \Delta E \) of an electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between momentum and energy. The problem provides the uncertainty in the electron's position \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \) and its speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

### Step 1: Uncertainty in Momentum
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states:
\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]
where \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). For the minimum uncertainty, we take the equality:
\[
\Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta p = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 1 \times 10^{-10}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Relating Momentum Uncertainty to Energy Uncertainty
The kinetic energy of a particle is given by:
\[
K = \frac{p^2}{2m},
\]
where \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of the electron. The uncertainty in kinetic energy \( \Delta K \) can be approximated as:
\[
\Delta K \approx \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m}.
\]
Substituting \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \) and \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \):
\[
\Delta K = \frac{(5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]
First, calculate \( (\Delta p)^2 \):
\[
(\Delta p)^2 = (5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2 = 2.77 \times 10^{-49}.
\]
Then, divide by \( 2m \):
\[
\Delta K = \frac{2.77 \times 10^{-49}}{1.822 \times 10^{-30}} = 1.52 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Alternative Approach Using \( \Delta E \approx v \cdot \Delta p \)
Another approach relates the energy uncertainty directly to the speed and momentum uncertainty:
\[
\Delta E \approx v \cdot \Delta p.
\]
Substituting \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \):
\[
\Delta E = (2 \times 10^8) \cdot (5.27 \times 10^{-25}) = 1.054 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 4: Comparing Results
The two approaches yield different results:
- Using \( \Delta E \approx \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m} \), we get \( \Delta E \approx 1.52 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \) (Option C).
- Using \( \Delta E \approx v \cdot \Delta p \), we get \( \Delta E \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J} \) (Option D).

The problem does not explicitly specify whether to use the relativistic or non-relativistic energy relation. However, the second approach, \( \Delta E \approx v \cdot \Delta p \), is more consistent with the given speed and the direct relationship between momentum and energy. Thus, the answer is:

**Answer: D**
