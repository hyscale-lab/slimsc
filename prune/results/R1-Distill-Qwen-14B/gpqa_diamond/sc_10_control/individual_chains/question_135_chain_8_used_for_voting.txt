Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about that notation, but I think it's describing an interaction between the boson X and some fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. I need to find out which of the options A to D correctly lists all the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

So, kinematically allowed decays depend on the mass of the boson and the masses of the particles it decays into. For a decay to be allowed, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the boson. But wait, particles like quarks have masses, but when they're produced, they are usually considered in pairs because of charge conservation. So X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

Looking at the options, they're all different combinations of quarks and leptons. Let's think about the masses involved.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. Let's list the masses of the particles we're considering:

Quarks:
- Up (u): about 2.2 MeV (so negligible compared to 6 GeV)
- Down (d): around 4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks because 2*m_t is way bigger than 6 GeV.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are negligible, but the problem isn't considering them here.

So for each possible fermion pair, the sum of their masses must be less than 6 GeV.

Let's go through each possible decay channel.

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, the tau has a mass of about 1.78 GeV. So two taus would be about 3.56 GeV. 3.56 <6, so that's allowed.

Bottom quarks are about 4.7 GeV each, so two would be 9.4 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b b-bar. So option A would have a problem because it includes b and s decays.

Wait, wait. Because their mass is 4.7 GeV each, so 2*4.7 =9.4 >6. So decay into b b-bar is not allowed.

So options that include b b-bar are incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b, which would be impossible. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

c has a mass of ~1.5 GeV. So 2*1.5=3 GeV <6, so allowed.

s is about 100 MeV, so 2*100=200 MeV <<6 GeV.

u and d are negligible, so their decays are allowed.

Taus: 2*1.78 =3.56 <6, allowed.

Muons: ~105.7 MeV each, 2*105.7=211.4 MeV <<6 GeV. So their decay is allowed.

Electrons are even lighter, so allowed.

So option B includes c, which is allowed.

Wait, but the mass of the bottom quark is 4.7 GeV. So two b's would be 9.4 GeV, which is too much. So any option that includes b is wrong.

So option D includes b, so it's incorrect.

Wait, option C: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But t is 173 GeV, so 2*173=346 GeV >>6 GeV. So decay into t t-bar is impossible. So option C is wrong because it includes top quarks.

So that leaves option B and option D.

Wait, option D includes tau pair and others, but what about the bottom quark?

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But wait, as I thought earlier, the bottom quark mass is about 4.7 GeV each. So 4.7 *2=9.4 GeV. X's mass is 6 GeV, so 6 <9.4. Therefore, decay into b b-bar is not allowed. So any option including b is wrong.

So option A and D can be eliminated.

Now between B and C.

Wait, option B is X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option C includes t t-bar, which is impossible. So option C is wrong.

So the correct option is B or another. Wait, but let me check the original problem again.

Wait, the given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the notation. Is ψ_f a fermion field? Maybe the interaction is with fermions of a certain type.

Wait, perhaps the interaction is between X and a fermion ψ_f. So the Lagrangian could be something like L = - λ f (y) ψ_f^dagger (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling. So the fermion ψ_f interacts with X.

In the case of standard model particles, for example, the Higgs interacts with fermions. So in the SM, the Higgs (a boson) can decay into fermion pairs if their combined mass is less than the Higgs mass.

But in this problem, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so which fermion pairs can it decay into?

In the standard model, the Higgs can decay into pairs of fermions whose combined mass is less than the Higgs mass. For example, the 125 GeV Higgs can decay into b quarks (since 2*5 =10 GeV <125), but in our case, X is 6 GeV.

So, which fermions have a mass such that 2m_f <6 GeV.

So, let's list all possible quarks and leptons:

Electron: m=0.5 MeV → 2m=1 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.
Muon: m=105.7 MeV → 2m=211 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.
Tau: m=1.78 GeV → 2m=3.56 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.
Neutrinos: negligible.

Quarks:

u: ~2.2 MeV → 2m ~4.4 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.
d: ~4.7 MeV → 2m ~9.4 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.
s: ~100 MeV → 2m ~200 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.
c: ~1.5 GeV → 2m ~3 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.
b: ~4.7 GeV → 2m ~9.4 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed.
t: 173 GeV → way too big.

So X can decay into any fermion pair except for b, t, and maybe others with higher mass.

So the possible decay channels are:

e+ e-,
mu+ mu-,
tau+ tau-,
u u-bar,
d d-bar,
s s-bar,
c c-bar.

So looking at the options:

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the allowed ones except for the bottom quark and top quark.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B lists c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Yes, which matches the allowed fermions.

So the correct option is B.

     - \( \tau \): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

3. **Allowed Decays**: Based on the above, the allowed decays are:

- Neutrinos are negligible, but the problem isn't considering them here.

So for each possible fermion pair, the sum of their masses must be less than 6 GeV.

Let's go through each possible decay channel.

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, the tau has a mass of about 1.78 GeV. So two taus would be about 3.56 GeV. 3.56 <6, so that's allowed.

Bottom quarks are about 4.7 GeV each, so two would be 9.4 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b b-bar. So option A would have a problem because it includes b and s decays.

Wait, wait. Because their mass is 4.7 GeV each, so 2*4.7 =9.4 >6. So decay into b b-bar is not allowed.

So options that include b b-bar are incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b, which would be impossible. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

c has a mass of ~1.5 GeV. So 2*1.5=3 GeV <6, so allowed.

s is about 100 MeV, so 2*100=200 MeV <<6 GeV.

u and d are negligible, so their decays are allowed.

Taus: 2*1.78 =3.56 <6, allowed.

Muons: ~105.7 MeV each, 2*105.7=211.4 MeV <<6 GeV. So their decay is allowed.

Electrons are even lighter, so allowed.

So option B includes c, which is allowed.

Wait, but the mass of the bottom quark is 4.7 GeV. So two b's would be 9.4 GeV, which is too much. So any option that includes b is wrong.

So option D includes b, so it's incorrect.

Wait, option C: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But t is 173 GeV, so 2*173=346 GeV >>6 GeV. So decay into t t-bar is impossible. So option C is wrong because it includes top quarks.

So that leaves option B and option D.

Wait, option D includes tau pair and others, but what about the bottom quark?

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But wait, as I thought earlier, the bottom quark mass is about 4.7 GeV each. So 4.7 *2=9.4 GeV. X's mass is 6 GeV, so 6 <9.4. Therefore, decay into b b-bar is not allowed. So any option including b is wrong.

So option A and D can be eliminated.

Now between B and C.

Wait, option B is X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option C includes t t-bar, which is impossible. So option C is wrong.

So the correct option is B or another. Wait, but let me check the original problem again.

Wait, the given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the notation. Is ψ_f a fermion field? Maybe the interaction is with fermions of a certain type.

In the case of standard model particles, for example, the Higgs interacts with fermions. So in the SM, the Higgs (a boson) can decay into fermion pairs if their combined mass is less than the Higgs mass.

But in this problem, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so which fermion pairs can it decay into?

In the standard model, the Higgs can decay into pairs of fermions whose combined mass is less than the Higgs mass. For example, the 125 GeV Higgs can decay into b quarks (since 2*5 =10 GeV <125), but in our case, X is 6 GeV.

So, which fermions have a mass such that 2m_f <6 GeV.

So, let's list all possible quarks and leptons:

Electron: m=0.5 MeV → 2m=1 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.
Muon: m=105.7 MeV → 2m=211 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.
Tau: m=1.78 GeV → 2m=3.56 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.

d: ~4.7 MeV → 2m ~9.4 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.
s: ~100 MeV → 2m ~200 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.
c: ~1.5 GeV → 2m ~3 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.
b: ~4.7 GeV → 2m ~9.4 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed.
t: 173 GeV → way too big.

So X can decay into any fermion pair except for b, t, and maybe others with higher mass.

So the possible decay channels are:

e+ e-,
mu+ mu-,
tau+ tau-,
u u-bar,
d d-bar,
s s-bar,
c c-bar.

So looking at the options:

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the allowed ones except for the bottom quark and top quark.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B lists c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Yes, which matches the allowed fermions.

So the correct option is B.
