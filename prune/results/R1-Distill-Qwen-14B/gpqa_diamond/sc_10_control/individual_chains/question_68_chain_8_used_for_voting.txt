Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the particle has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. Oh wait, Sz is the spin in the z-direction. Right, because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin components are quantized. So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. That makes sense because when the magnetic field is along z, the particle's spin will be in an eigenstate of Sz, so its magnetic moment is along z.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, with the same magnitude B. So the magnetic field direction changes from Z to Y. The problem is asking about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, but how does the magnetic moment behave when the field changes direction? I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian governing the system changes. The magnetic dipole moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the Hamiltonian is probably something like H = -mu · B. Oh right, mu is the magnetic moment, so the energy is the dot product of mu and B.

Originally, B was along Z. So the Hamiltonian was H_initial = -mu_z * B. Since mu = gamma * Sz, that makes H_initial = -gamma B Sz. The eigenstates of Sz are |+> and |-> with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. But wait, spin-1/2 systems use ħ/2 as the unit. So eigenvalues are ±gamma B (ħ/2) multiplied by the spin projection.

But when the field is turned off and turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_new = -mu · B, but B is now in Y direction. So mu is gamma S, so mu · B along Y would be gamma (Sx * 0 + Sy * B + Sz * 0) since Y is the direction. Wait, no: the magnetic field is along Y, which is the y-direction. So the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B Sy. Because Sy is the spin component in y.

Wait, let me double-check. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. So when B is along Y, mu · B is gamma S_y B. So the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y.

Now, the initial state of the system is that the particle's spin is aligned along +Z. Which means it's in the state |+z>, the eigenstate of Sz. But when the Hamiltonian suddenly changes to H = -gamma B Sy, the system's state doesn't change instantaneously. So the initial state is still |+z>, but now the Hamiltonian is in terms of Sy.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z = gamma <Sz>. So we need to find how <Sz> oscillates over time.

Wait, but if the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy, which is proportional to Sy, which is the spin in y-direction. So the time evolution will be governed by this Hamiltonian. Let's think about the energy levels and time evolution.

The eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2. So the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = (-gamma B) * (ħ/2) * (1/ħ/2?) Wait wait, no. Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H = -gamma B Sy, so E = -gamma B (± ħ/2), but wait, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H acting on |+y> (eigenstate of Sy with +ħ/2) gives H|+y> = (-gamma B)(ħ/2) |+y>.

Similarly for |-y>, it's H|-y> = (gamma B)(ħ/2) |-y>.

Wait, no, let's compute:

H = -gamma B Sy.

So for |+y>, Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, so H|+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y>.

Similarly for |-y>, H gives +gamma B (ħ/2) |-y>.

So the energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, no, wait: because H is proportional to Sy, which has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H's eigenvalues are E = -gamma B * (± ħ/2). So E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2). So the energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = gamma B (ħ).

But the initial state is |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of Sy. So the state will evolve over time, and we can express |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of H, which are |+y> and |-y>.

Let me recall that the eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, which can be written in terms of |+z> and |-z>.

The |+y> state is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and the |-y> state is (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). Because in the x-y basis, the states are superpositions of the z-basis.

So the initial state |+z> can be expressed as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

Because:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)
Similarly, |-z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2).

So the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

Now, each of these states will evolve under the Hamiltonian H. The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ).

So each eigenstate |+y> and |-y> will pick up a phase factor.

The state at time t is:

|ψ(t)> = [ |+y> exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) + |-y> exp(-i E_- t / ħ) ] / sqrt(2).

E_+ is -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- is gamma B (ħ/2).

So plugging in, the phases become:

For |+y>: exp(-i (-gamma B (ħ/2)) t / ħ ) = exp( i gamma B t/2 )

For |-y>: exp( -i (gamma B (ħ/2)) t / ħ ) = exp( -i gamma B t/2 )

So |ψ(t)> = [ |+y> exp( i gamma B t/2 ) + |-y> exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ] / sqrt(2).

Now, to find <Sz>, which is the expectation value of Sz.

We can compute <Sz> = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express <Sz> in terms of the time-dependent state.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the time dependence of the expectation value.

Another approach: The system is under a Hamiltonian H = w Sy, where w = -gamma B. Let me define w = gamma B for simplicity, so H = -w Sy.

Wait, no, H is -gamma B Sy, so it's proportional to Sy. So the Hamiltonian is H = ω Sy, where ω = -gamma B? Hmm, perhaps better to think in terms of the energy difference.

Wait, the energy levels are E_+ and E_-, with a difference of E_- - E_+ = gamma B (ħ).

Wait, earlier calculation: E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). So the difference is gamma B (ħ). So the energy difference is ΔE = gamma B ħ.

The time evolution will cause transitions between these states, leading to oscillations in observable quantities.

The average value of an observable O is given by <O> = Re [ <ψ(t)| O |ψ(t)> ].

So for <Sz>, let's compute it.

Let me express |ψ(t)> in terms of |+z> and |-z> again. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <Sz> directly.

Sz is (ħ/2) ( |+z><+z| - |-z><-z| )

So, to compute <Sz>, we can compute the expectation value in the state |ψ(t)>.

Let me write |ψ(t)> as:

|ψ(t)> = [ (|+y> e^{i ω t} ) + (|-y> e^{-i ω t} ) ] / sqrt(2),

where ω = gamma B / 2, since omega is the frequency related to the energy difference.

Wait, let's compute E_+ and E_- in terms of frequency. The energy levels are E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 ). The energy difference ΔE = E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ.

The angular frequency ω associated with this energy difference is ω = ΔE / ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, because frequency is E/(Planck's constant), which is E/ħ. So the energy difference gives a frequency of gamma B.

So the time evolution factors involve exponents with this frequency.

So the state |ψ(t)> can be written as:

|ψ(t)> = (|+y> e^{i (E_+ t)/ħ} + |-y> e^{i (E_- t)/ħ} ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, no: when you have H|n> = E_n |n>, the time evolution is exp(-i E_n t / ħ ). So for |+y>, E_+ is -gamma B (ħ/2), so:

exp(-i E_+ t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B t/2) )

Similarly, for |-y>, E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 ), so exp(-i E_- t / ħ ) = exp( -i (gamma B t/2) )

So the state is:

|ψ(t)> = [ |+y> exp( i (gamma B t/2 )) + |-y> exp( -i (gamma B t/2 )) ] / sqrt(2 )

Now, to find <Sz>, which is the expectation value of Sz in the state |ψ(t)>.

Sz is given by (|+z><+z| - |-z><-z| ) (ħ/2 )

So, <Sz> = (ħ/2) [ <ψ(t)| +z><+z|ψ(t)> - <ψ(t)| -z><-z|ψ(t)> ]

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute this by expanding |ψ(t)> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.

We know that |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2 ), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2 )

So substituting back into |ψ(t)>:

|ψ(t)> = [ (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) * exp( i (gamma B t/2 )) + (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) * exp( -i (gamma B t/2 )) ] / sqrt(2 )

Simplify:

Multiply numerator terms:

= [ (|+z> + |-z> ) exp( i w t ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) exp( -i w t ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) )

Because 1/sqrt(2) (from |+y> and |-y>) multiplied by another 1/sqrt(2) from the outer division.

So denominator is 2.

Expanding numerator:

= |+z> [ exp(i w t) + exp( -i w t ) ] / 2 + |-z> [ exp(i w t) - exp( -i w t ) ] / 2

Because:

(|+z> exp(i w t) + |-z> exp(i w t) ) + (|+z> exp(-i w t) - |-z> exp(-i w t) )

= |+z> [exp(i w t) + exp(-i w t)] + |-z> [ exp(i w t) - exp(-i w t) ]

Now, using Euler's formula:

exp(i x) + exp(-i x) = 2 cos x

exp(i x) - exp(-i x) = 2i sin x

So substituting:

= |+z> (2 cos(w t)) / 2 + |-z> ( 2i sin (w t) ) / 2

Simplify:

= |+z> cos(w t) + i |-z> sin( w t )

So the state |ψ(t)> is |+z> cos(w t) + i |-z> sin(w t )

Now, let's compute <Sz>:

<Sz> = (ħ/2) [ <ψ(t)| +z > < +z | ψ(t) > - <ψ(t)| -z> < -z | ψ(t) > ]

Wait, no, more accurately, the expectation value is:

<Sz> = (ħ/2) [ |< +z | ψ(t) > |² - |< -z | ψ(t) > |² ]

Because Sz is (|+z><+z| - |-z><-z| ) (ħ/2 )

So, <Sz> = (ħ/2) [ |a|² - |b|² ] where a = < +z | ψ(t) > and b = < -z | ψ(t) >.

From the expression of |ψ(t)>, we have:

a = < +z | [ |+z> cos(w t) + i |-z> sin(w t) ) ] = cos(w t) * < +z | +z > + i sin(w t) < +z | -z > 

Which is cos(w t) * 1 + i sin(w t) * 0 = cos(w t )

Similarly, b = < -z | ψ(t) > = cos(w t) * 0 + i sin(w t) < -z | -z > = i sin(w t )

So |a|² = cos²(w t )

|b|² = (i sin(w t )) (i* sin(w t )) )? Wait, no. Because |b|² is |i sin(w t)|² = (i sin(w t )) ( (-i) sin(w t) ) ) = (sin(w t))²

Wait, because |b|² is the magnitude squared, which is (b)(b^*). So b is i sin(w t), so b^* is -i sin(w t).

Thus, |b|² = (i sin(w t )) (-i sin(w t )) ) = ( (-i^2) sin²(w t) ) = sin²(w t ), since i^2 = -1.

So <Sz> = (ħ/2) [ cos²(w t ) - sin²(w t ) ] 

Which simplifies to (ħ/2) cos(2 w t ), because cos² x - sin² x = cos(2x).

So the expectation value of Sz oscillates as cos(2 w t ), where w is gamma B / 2.

Wait, because earlier I defined w as gamma B / 2 ?

Wait, wait. Let's go back. The angular frequency ω in the exponential was gamma B / 2. Because the exponents were exp( i gamma B t / 2 ), which comes from E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2 ), so -E_+ / ħ = (gamma B (ħ/2 )) / ħ = gamma B / 2.

So the frequency in the exponential is gamma B / 2, which is our ω. So in the expression for <Sz>, we have cos(2 ω t ), which is cos( gamma B t ).

Wait, because 2 * (gamma B / 2 ) t = gamma B t.

So <Sz> oscillates as cos( gamma B t ), multiplied by (ħ/2).

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. The average <mu_z> is gamma <Sz>, because mu = gamma S.

So mu_z = gamma <Sz> = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So the oscillation is in cos(gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the math again.

Wait, I think I have a miscalculation. Let's go through the steps again.

Earlier, E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 )

The energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B (ħ )

The frequency is omega = (E_- - E_+) / ħ = gamma B

So the time evolution for each state is:

exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B t/2 ) )

Similarly, exp( -i E_- t/ ħ )= exp( -i (gamma B t/2 ) )

So the time evolution leads to factors with exponents i gamma B t /2 and -i gamma B t /2.

When we express |psi(t)> in terms of |+z> and |-z>, we get:

|psi(t)> = |+z> cos( (gamma B t ) /2 ) + i | -z> sin( (gamma B t ) /2 )

Wait, no. Wait, let me re-express:

Wait, in the earlier steps, the expansion led to |+z> cos(w t) + i |-z> sin(w t ), where w is gamma B / 2.

Because in the expression, the state is |+z> cos(w t) + i |-z> sin(w t ), with w = gamma B / 2.

So when we compute <Sz> , we get (ħ/2) [ cos²(w t) - sin²(w t) ] = (ħ/2) cos( 2 w t )

Which is (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B, because the argument of the cosine is gamma B t.

But wait, no. Because in the expression for <Sz>, the oscillation is in cos(2w t ), which is cos(gamma B t ), as 2w = gamma B.

So the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but the options are:

A) gamma B/2

B) gamma B

C) sqrt(2) gamma B

D) gamma B / sqrt(2)

So if the oscillation frequency is gamma B, then option B.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought the frequency would be half of that. Let me think again.

Wait, the energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ. So the angular frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

So the energy oscillates with frequency gamma B, which should correspond to the Rabi frequency in such transitions.

But when we compute <Sz>, it's oscillating with frequency gamma B. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me compute the time dependence of <mu_z> directly.

mu_z = gamma <Sz> = gamma ( ħ/2 cos( gamma B t ) )

So the oscillation is with frequency gamma B.

So the average z-component of the moment oscillates with frequency gamma B. So the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched off and turned on along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the state $|+z\rangle$, the eigenstate of $S_z$. When the magnetic field switches to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. The energy eigenvalues are $E_+ = -\gamma B (\hbar/2)$ and $E_- = \gamma B (\hbar/2)$.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The initial state $|+z\rangle$ is expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of $H$:  
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |-y\rangle \right).
   \]  
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:  
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle e^{i\gamma B t/2} + |-y\rangle e^{-i\gamma B t/2} \right).
   \]

3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The $z$-component of the spin operator is $S_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( |+z\rangle \langle +z| - |-z\rangle \langle -z| \right)$. The expectation value $\langle S_z \rangle$ is computed as:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( |\langle +z|\psi(t)\rangle|^2 - |\langle -z|\psi(t)\rangle|^2 \right).
   \]  
   Substituting $|\psi(t)\rangle$, it simplifies to:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The expectation value $\langle S_z \rangle$ oscillates as $\cos(\gamma B t)$, indicating that the oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$.

5. **Magnetic Moment**:  
   The magnetic moment $\mu_z = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle$ inherits the same oscillation frequency, $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:  
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the particle has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. Oh wait, Sz is the spin in the z-direction. Right, because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin components are quantized. So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. That makes sense because when the magnetic field is along z, the particle's spin will be in an eigenstate of Sz, so its magnetic moment is along z.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, with the same magnitude B. So the magnetic field direction changes from Z to Y. The problem is asking about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, but how does the magnetic moment behave when the field changes direction? I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian governing the system changes. The magnetic dipole moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the Hamiltonian is probably something like H = -mu · B. Oh right, mu is the magnetic moment, so the energy is the dot product of mu and B.

Originally, B was along Z. So the Hamiltonian was H_initial = -mu_z * B. Since mu = gamma * Sz, that makes H_initial = -gamma B Sz. The eigenstates of Sz are |+> and |-> with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. But wait, spin-1/2 systems use ħ/2 as the unit. So eigenvalues are ±gamma B (ħ/2) multiplied by the spin projection.

But when the field is turned off and turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_new = -mu · B, but B is now in Y direction. So mu is gamma S, so mu · B along Y would be gamma (Sx * 0 + Sy * B + Sz * 0) since Y is the direction. Wait, no: the magnetic field is along Y, which is the y-direction. So the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B Sy. Because Sy is the spin component in y.

Wait, let me double-check. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. So when B is along Y, mu · B is gamma S_y B. So the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y.

Now, the initial state of the system is that the particle's spin is aligned along +Z. Which means it's in the state |+z>, the eigenstate of Sz. But when the Hamiltonian suddenly changes to H = -gamma B Sy, the system's state doesn't change instantaneously. So the initial state is still |+z>, but now the Hamiltonian is in terms of Sy.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z = gamma <Sz>. So we need to find how <Sz> oscillates over time.

Wait, but if the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy, which is proportional to Sy, which is the spin in y-direction. So the time evolution will be governed by this Hamiltonian. Let's think about the energy levels and time evolution.

The eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2. So the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = (-gamma B) * (ħ/2) * (1/ħ/2?) Wait wait, no. Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H = -gamma B Sy, so E = -gamma B (± ħ/2), but wait, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H acting on |+y> (eigenstate of Sy with +ħ/2) gives H|+y> = (-gamma B)(ħ/2) |+y>.

Similarly for |-y>, it's H|-y> = (gamma B)(ħ/2) |-y>.

Wait, no, let's compute:

H = -gamma B Sy.

So for |+y>, Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, so H|+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y>.

Similarly for |-y>, H gives +gamma B (ħ/2) |-y>.

So the energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, no, wait: because H is proportional to Sy, which has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H's eigenvalues are E = -gamma B * (± ħ/2). So E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2). So the energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = gamma B (ħ).

But the initial state is |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of Sy. So the state will evolve over time, and we can express |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of H, which are |+y> and |-y>.

Let me recall that the eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, which can be written in terms of |+z> and |-z>.

The |+y> state is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and the |-y> state is (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). Because in the x-y basis, the states are superpositions of the z-basis.

So the initial state |+z> can be expressed as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

Because:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)
Similarly, |-z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2).

So the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

Now, each of these states will evolve under the Hamiltonian H. The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ).

So each eigenstate |+y> and |-y> will pick up a phase factor.

The state at time t is:

|ψ(t)> = [ |+y> exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) + |-y> exp(-i E_- t / ħ) ] / sqrt(2).

E_+ is -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- is gamma B (ħ/2).

So plugging in, the phases become:

For |+y>: exp(-i (-gamma B (ħ/2)) t / ħ ) = exp( i gamma B t/2 )

For |-y>: exp( -i (gamma B (ħ/2)) t / ħ ) = exp( -i gamma B t/2 )

So |ψ(t)> = [ |+y> exp( i gamma B t/2 ) + |-y> exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ] / sqrt(2).

Now, to find <Sz>, which is the expectation value of Sz.

We can compute <Sz> = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express <Sz> in terms of the time-dependent state.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the time dependence of the expectation value.

Another approach: The system is under a Hamiltonian H = w Sy, where w = -gamma B. Let me define w = gamma B for simplicity, so H = -w Sy.

Wait, no, H is -gamma B Sy, so it's proportional to Sy. So the Hamiltonian is H = ω Sy, where ω = -gamma B? Hmm, perhaps better to think in terms of the energy difference.

Wait, the energy levels are E_+ and E_-, with a difference of E_- - E_+ = gamma B (ħ).

Wait, earlier calculation: E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). So the difference is gamma B (ħ). So the energy difference is ΔE = gamma B ħ.

The time evolution will cause transitions between these states, leading to oscillations in observable quantities.

The average value of an observable O is given by <O> = Re [ <ψ(t)| O |ψ(t)> ].

So for <Sz>, let's compute it.

Let me express |ψ(t)> in terms of |+z> and |-z> again. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <Sz> directly.

Sz is (ħ/2) ( |+z><+z| - |-z><-z| )

So, to compute <Sz>, we can compute the expectation value in the state |ψ(t)>.

Let me write |ψ(t)> as:

|ψ(t)> = [ (|+y> e^{i ω t} ) + (|-y> e^{-i ω t} ) ] / sqrt(2),

where ω = gamma B / 2, since omega is the frequency related to the energy difference.

Wait, let's compute E_+ and E_- in terms of frequency. The energy levels are E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 ). The energy difference ΔE = E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ.

The angular frequency ω associated with this energy difference is ω = ΔE / ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, because frequency is E/(Planck's constant), which is E/ħ. So the energy difference gives a frequency of gamma B.

So the time evolution factors involve exponents with this frequency.

So the state |ψ(t)> can be written as:

|ψ(t)> = (|+y> e^{i (E_+ t)/ħ} + |-y> e^{i (E_- t)/ħ} ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, no: when you have H|n> = E_n |n>, the time evolution is exp(-i E_n t / ħ ). So for |+y>, E_+ is -gamma B (ħ/2), so:

exp(-i E_+ t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B t/2) )

Similarly, for |-y>, E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 ), so exp(-i E_- t / ħ ) = exp( -i (gamma B t/2) )

So the state is:

|ψ(t)> = [ |+y> exp( i (gamma B t/2 )) + |-y> exp( -i (gamma B t/2 )) ] / sqrt(2 )

Now, to find <Sz>, which is the expectation value of Sz in the state |ψ(t)>.

Sz is given by (|+z><+z| - |-z><-z| ) (ħ/2 )

So, <Sz> = (ħ/2) [ <ψ(t)| +z><+z|ψ(t)> - <ψ(t)| -z><-z|ψ(t)> ]

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute this by expanding |ψ(t)> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.

We know that |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2 ), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2 )

So substituting back into |ψ(t)>:

|ψ(t)> = [ (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) * exp( i (gamma B t/2 )) + (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) * exp( -i (gamma B t/2 )) ] / sqrt(2 )

Simplify:

Multiply numerator terms:

= [ (|+z> + |-z> ) exp( i w t ) + (|+z> - |-z> ) exp( -i w t ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) )

Because 1/sqrt(2) (from |+y> and |-y>) multiplied by another 1/sqrt(2) from the outer division.

So denominator is 2.

Expanding numerator:

= |+z> [ exp(i w t) + exp( -i w t ) ] / 2 + |-z> [ exp(i w t) - exp( -i w t ) ] / 2

Because:

(|+z> exp(i w t) + |-z> exp(i w t) ) + (|+z> exp(-i w t) - |-z> exp(-i w t) )

= |+z> [exp(i w t) + exp(-i w t)] + |-z> [ exp(i w t) - exp(-i w t) ]

Now, using Euler's formula:

exp(i x) + exp(-i x) = 2 cos x

exp(i x) - exp(-i x) = 2i sin x

So substituting:

= |+z> (2 cos(w t)) / 2 + |-z> ( 2i sin (w t) ) / 2

Simplify:

= |+z> cos(w t) + i |-z> sin( w t )

So the state |ψ(t)> is |+z> cos(w t) + i |-z> sin(w t )

Now, let's compute <Sz>:

<Sz> = (ħ/2) [ <ψ(t)| +z > < +z | ψ(t) > - <ψ(t)| -z> < -z | ψ(t) > ]

Wait, no, more accurately, the expectation value is:

<Sz> = (ħ/2) [ |< +z | ψ(t) > |² - |< -z | ψ(t) > |² ]

Because Sz is (|+z><+z| - |-z><-z| ) (ħ/2 )

So, <Sz> = (ħ/2) [ |a|² - |b|² ] where a = < +z | ψ(t) > and b = < -z | ψ(t) >.

From the expression of |ψ(t)>, we have:

a = < +z | [ |+z> cos(w t) + i |-z> sin(w t) ) ] = cos(w t) * < +z | +z > + i sin(w t) < +z | -z > 

Which is cos(w t) * 1 + i sin(w t) * 0 = cos(w t )

Similarly, b = < -z | ψ(t) > = cos(w t) * 0 + i sin(w t) < -z | -z > = i sin(w t )

So |a|² = cos²(w t )

|b|² = (i sin(w t )) (i* sin(w t )) )? Wait, no. Because |b|² is |i sin(w t)|² = (i sin(w t )) ( (-i) sin(w t) ) ) = (sin(w t))²

Wait, because |b|² is the magnitude squared, which is (b)(b^*). So b is i sin(w t), so b^* is -i sin(w t).

Thus, |b|² = (i sin(w t )) (-i sin(w t )) ) = ( (-i^2) sin²(w t) ) = sin²(w t ), since i^2 = -1.

So <Sz> = (ħ/2) [ cos²(w t ) - sin²(w t ) ] 

Which simplifies to (ħ/2) cos(2 w t ), because cos² x - sin² x = cos(2x).

So the expectation value of Sz oscillates as cos(2 w t ), where w is gamma B / 2.

Wait, because earlier I defined w as gamma B / 2 ?

Wait, wait. Let's go back. The angular frequency ω in the exponential was gamma B / 2. Because the exponents were exp( i gamma B t / 2 ), which comes from E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2 ), so -E_+ / ħ = (gamma B (ħ/2 )) / ħ = gamma B / 2.

So the frequency in the exponential is gamma B / 2, which is our ω. So in the expression for <Sz>, we have cos(2 ω t ), which is cos( gamma B t ).

Wait, because 2 * (gamma B / 2 ) t = gamma B t.

So <Sz> oscillates as cos( gamma B t ), multiplied by (ħ/2).

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. The average <mu_z> is gamma <Sz>, because mu = gamma S.

So mu_z = gamma <Sz> = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So the oscillation is in cos(gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the math again.

Wait, I think I have a miscalculation. Let's go through the steps again.

Earlier, E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 )

The energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B (ħ )

The frequency is omega = (E_- - E_+) / ħ = gamma B

So the time evolution for each state is:

exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B t/2 ) )

Similarly, exp( -i E_- t/ ħ )= exp( -i (gamma B t/2 ) )

So the time evolution leads to factors with exponents i gamma B t /2 and -i gamma B t /2.

When we express |psi(t)> in terms of |+z> and |-z>, we get:

|psi(t)> = |+z> cos( (gamma B t ) /2 ) + i | -z> sin( (gamma B t ) /2 )

Wait, no. Wait, let me re-express:

Wait, in the earlier steps, the expansion led to |+z> cos(w t) + i |-z> sin(w t ), where w is gamma B / 2.

Because in the expression, the state is |+z> cos(w t) + i |-z> sin(w t ), with w = gamma B / 2.

So when we compute <Sz> , we get (ħ/2) [ cos²(w t) - sin²(w t) ] = (ħ/2) cos( 2 w t )

Which is (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B, because the argument of the cosine is gamma B t.

But wait, no. Because in the expression for <Sz>, the oscillation is in cos(2w t ), which is cos(gamma B t ), as 2w = gamma B.

So the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but the options are:

A) gamma B/2

B) gamma B

C) sqrt(2) gamma B

D) gamma B / sqrt(2)

So if the oscillation frequency is gamma B, then option B.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought the frequency would be half of that. Let me think again.

Wait, the energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ. So the angular frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

So the energy oscillates with frequency gamma B, which should correspond to the Rabi frequency in such transitions.

But when we compute <Sz>, it's oscillating with frequency gamma B. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me compute the time dependence of <mu_z> directly.

mu_z = gamma <Sz> = gamma ( ħ/2 cos( gamma B t ) )

So the oscillation is with frequency gamma B.

So the average z-component of the moment oscillates with frequency gamma B. So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched off and turned on along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the state $|+z\rangle$, the eigenstate of $S_z$. When the magnetic field switches to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. The energy eigenvalues are $E_+ = -\gamma B (\hbar/2)$ and $E_- = \gamma B (\hbar/2)$.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The initial state $|+z\rangle$ is expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of $H$:  
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |-y\rangle \right).
   \]  
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:  
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle e^{i\gamma B t/2} + |-y\rangle e^{-i\gamma B t/2} \right).
   \]

3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The $z$-component of the spin operator is $S_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( |+z\rangle \langle +z| - |-z\rangle \langle -z| \right)$. The expectation value $\langle S_z \rangle$ is computed as:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( |\langle +z|\psi(t)\rangle|^2 - |\langle -z|\psi(t)\rangle|^2 \right).
   \]  
   Substituting $|\psi(t)\rangle$, it simplifies to:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The expectation value $\langle S_z \rangle$ oscillates as $\cos(\gamma B t)$, indicating that the oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$.

5. **Magnetic Moment**:  
   The magnetic moment $\mu_z = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle$ inherits the same oscillation frequency, $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:  
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.
