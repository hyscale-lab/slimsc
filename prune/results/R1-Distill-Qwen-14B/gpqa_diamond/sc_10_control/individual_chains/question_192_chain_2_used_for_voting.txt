Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R, and there's a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and the cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. Then, they put a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Wait, so the point P is outside the conductor, which has radius R. So the distance from the center of the conductor to P is L, and L is greater than R. Also, the point P is a distance l from the center of the cavity, and l is greater than R as well. Oh, and there's an angle theta between l and s, which is the distance from the conductor's center to the cavity's center.

Alright, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. When a conductor is neutral, charges can move freely. But when you put a charge inside a cavity, it induces charges on the cavity walls and the outer surface of the conductor.

Wait, so since the conductor is initially uncharged, when you put a positive charge +q inside the cavity, the inner cavity will have an induced charge. The inner wall of the cavity must have an induced -q charge because the conductor is neutral overall. Then, the outer surface of the conductor must have a +q charge because the total charge must balance.

But wait, wait. The conductor itself is neutral, so when you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q (since the charge inside induces opposite charges on the inner surface). And since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner surface's -q. So the total charge on the outer surface is +q.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor is uncharged, so yes, the inner surface has -q, outer has +q. So the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q.

But now, what's the electric field outside the conductor at point P? Since P is outside, I think the field should be as if all the charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface is acting. Wait, but the Gaussian surface outside would enclose only the +q charge on the outer surface of the conductor.

Wait, let's think about it. The Gaussian surface would be a sphere of radius L, centered on the conductor's center. The total enclosed charge would be the sum of the conductor's charges. The conductor itself is neutral, but the outer surface has +q. So the Gaussian surface would enclose +q.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor's own net charge is zero. Because the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, so sum is zero. So the Gaussian surface outside, which would enclose the entire conductor, would enclose a net charge of zero? No, wait, no, that's not right. Because the charge +q is on the outer surface of the conductor. So when you take a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, the conductor's inner and outer surfaces are within it. But the inner surface is -q, the outer is +q. So the total enclosed charge is zero? Wait, that can't be right because the +q is on the outer surface, so when you're outside the conductor, the field is due to all the enclosed charge. So if the conductor as a whole is neutral, the total charge inside the Gaussian surface is zero. But wait, that seems conflicting.

Wait, no, the initial conductor is neutral. So when you add +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the cavity has -q, and the outer surface of the conductor has +q. So the conductor as a whole is neutral because (inner) -q + (outer) +q = 0. So the conductor's total charge is zero.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor. So the Gaussian surface would enclose the conductor's outer surface, which has +q on it. Because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface's charge is +q, and the inner is -q, so overall conductor is neutral. So when you do the Gaussian surface at point P outside, the enclosed charge is the +q on the outer surface.

So the electric field at P would be the same as if that +q were concentrated at the center. Because the conductor's outer surface charge behaves like a point charge when outside. So the electric field would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but wait, the point P is at distance L from the center of the conductor, but the center of the cavity is at s distance away. Hmm, but the charge +q is inside the cavity, which is displaced from the center. So does this affect the electric field outside?

Wait, no. Because the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, and the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces are such that the field inside the conductor is zero. So when you're outside, the field is as if all the charge of the conductor is at the center. So the displacement of the cavity's center (the s distance and angle theta) shouldn't matter because the conductor's outer surface charge is uniformly distributed, or wait, no, maybe it's not.

Wait, wait, if the cavity isn't centered at the conductor's center, then the inner surface's charge distribution isn't uniform. So the outer surface's charge distribution would be uniform only if the inner is symmetric. But in this case, the inner is not symmetric. So the outer surface's charge distribution would adjust to ensure that the field inside the conductor is zero.

Wait, but regardless of where the inner charge is, as far as the outer surface is concerned, the field outside the conductor depends on the total charge. So for a point outside the conductor, the electric field is the same as if the total charge of the conductor (which is zero) were at the center. But wait, no, in this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, not zero. Wait, no, the conductor is neutral, so the outer surface has +q, so the total charge is +q.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The conductor is initially neutral. Then, you place +q inside the cavity. This induces -q on the inner surface of the cavity (inside the conductor) and +q on the outer surface of the conductor. So the conductor as a whole is neutral, but the outer surface has +q.

So when you're outside the conductor, the Gaussian surface encloses the conductor, which has a net charge of +q on the outer surface. So the field is as if +q is at the center.

Wait, but the position of the cavity (the s and theta) would affect the inner charge distribution, but not the outer. Because the outer surface's field would still be the same regardless of where the inner charge is placed. So the field outside only depends on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q.

So the electric field at point P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), because L is the distance from the center to P, and the charge +q acts as if it's at the center.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is exactly that: (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). So the answer would be option B.

But wait, another thought: the charge is inside the cavity, which is off-center. So could the field outside be affected by the position of the charge? No, because the outer surface's charge distribution rearranges to ensure that the field inside the conductor is zero, but the total charge on the outer surface is +q, so the field outside depends only on that +q.

So yeah, the answer should be B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is initially neutral. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity (due to charge induction). To maintain the conductor's neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a charged conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. For a point $P$ outside the conductor, the Gaussian surface encloses the entire conductor. The conductor's net charge is $+q$ (from the outer surface), and the field outside is as if this charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Effect of Cavity Position**: The cavity is offset from the center of the conductor, with its center at a distance $s$ and an angle $\theta$ relative to the center of the conductor. However, the position of the cavity does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is $+q$.

4. **Electric Field Expression**: Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at point $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2},
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ does not represent the correct distance for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ is not relevant to the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the form resembles Coulomb's law, it does not account for the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R, and there's a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and the cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. Then, they put a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Wait, so the point P is outside the conductor, which has radius R. So the distance from the center of the conductor to P is L, and L is greater than R. Also, the point P is a distance l from the center of the cavity, and l is greater than R as well. Oh, and there's an angle theta between l and s, which is the distance from the conductor's center to the cavity's center.

Alright, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. When a conductor is neutral, charges can move freely. But when you put a charge inside a cavity, it induces charges on the cavity walls and the outer surface of the conductor.

Wait, so since the conductor is initially uncharged, when you put a positive charge +q inside the cavity, the inner cavity will have an induced charge. The inner wall of the cavity must have an induced -q charge because the conductor is neutral overall. Then, the outer surface of the conductor must have a +q charge because the total charge must balance.

But wait, wait. The conductor itself is neutral, so when you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q (since the charge inside induces opposite charges on the inner surface). And since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner surface's -q. So the total charge on the outer surface is +q.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor is uncharged, so yes, the inner surface has -q, outer has +q. So the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q.

But now, what's the electric field outside the conductor at point P? Since P is outside, I think the field should be as if all the charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface is acting. Wait, but the Gaussian surface outside would enclose only the +q charge on the outer surface of the conductor.

Wait, let's think about it. The Gaussian surface would be a sphere of radius L, centered on the conductor's center. The total enclosed charge would be the sum of the conductor's charges. The conductor itself is neutral, but the outer surface has +q. So the Gaussian surface would enclose +q.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor's own net charge is zero. Because the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, so sum is zero. So the Gaussian surface outside, which would enclose the entire conductor, would enclose a net charge of zero? No, wait, no, that's not right. Because the charge +q is on the outer surface of the conductor. So when you take a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, the conductor's inner and outer surfaces are within it. But the inner surface is -q, the outer is +q. So the total enclosed charge is zero? Wait, that can't be right because the +q is on the outer surface, so when you're outside the conductor, the field is due to all the enclosed charge. So if the conductor as a whole is neutral, the total charge inside the Gaussian surface is zero. But wait, that seems conflicting.

Wait, no, the initial conductor is neutral. So when you add +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the cavity has -q, and the outer surface of the conductor has +q. So the conductor as a whole is neutral because (inner) -q + (outer) +q = 0. So the conductor's total charge is zero.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor. So the Gaussian surface would enclose the conductor's outer surface, which has +q on it. Because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface's charge is +q, and the inner is -q, so overall conductor is neutral. So when you do the Gaussian surface at point P outside, the enclosed charge is the +q on the outer surface.

So the electric field at P would be the same as if that +q were concentrated at the center. Because the conductor's outer surface charge behaves like a point charge when outside. So the electric field would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but wait, the point P is at distance L from the center of the conductor, but the center of the cavity is at s distance away. Hmm, but the charge +q is inside the cavity, which is displaced from the center. So does this affect the electric field outside?

Wait, no. Because the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, and the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces are such that the field inside the conductor is zero. So when you're outside, the field is as if all the charge of the conductor is at the center. So the displacement of the cavity's center (the s distance and angle theta) shouldn't matter because the conductor's outer surface charge is uniformly distributed, or wait, no, maybe it's not.

Wait, wait, if the cavity isn't centered at the conductor's center, then the inner surface's charge distribution isn't uniform. So the outer surface's charge distribution would be uniform only if the inner is symmetric. But in this case, the inner is not symmetric. So the outer surface's charge distribution would adjust to ensure that the field inside the conductor is zero.

Wait, but regardless of where the inner charge is, as far as the outer surface is concerned, the field outside the conductor depends on the total charge. So for a point outside the conductor, the electric field is the same as if the total charge of the conductor (which is zero) were at the center. But wait, no, in this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, not zero. Wait, no, the conductor is neutral, so the outer surface has +q, so the total charge is +q.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The conductor is initially neutral. Then, you place +q inside the cavity. This induces -q on the inner surface of the cavity (inside the conductor) and +q on the outer surface of the conductor. So the conductor as a whole is neutral, but the outer surface has +q.

So when you're outside the conductor, the Gaussian surface encloses the conductor, which has a net charge of +q on the outer surface. So the field is as if +q is at the center.

Wait, but the position of the cavity (the s and theta) would affect the inner charge distribution, but not the outer. Because the outer surface's field would still be the same regardless of where the inner charge is placed. So the field outside only depends on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q.

So the electric field at point P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), because L is the distance from the center to P, and the charge +q acts as if it's at the center.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is exactly that: (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). So the answer would be option B.

But wait, another thought: the charge is inside the cavity, which is off-center. So could the field outside be affected by the position of the charge? No, because the outer surface's charge distribution rearranges to ensure that the field inside the conductor is zero, but the total charge on the outer surface is +q, so the field outside depends only on that +q.

So yeah, the answer should be B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is initially neutral. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity (due to charge induction). To maintain the conductor's neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a charged conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. For a point $P$ outside the conductor, the Gaussian surface encloses the entire conductor. The conductor's net charge is $+q$ (from the outer surface), and the field outside is as if this charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

However, the position of the cavity does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is $+q$.

4. **Electric Field Expression**: Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at point $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2},
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ does not represent the correct distance for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ is not relevant to the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the form resembles Coulomb's law, it does not account for the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor.

Thus, the correct answer is:
