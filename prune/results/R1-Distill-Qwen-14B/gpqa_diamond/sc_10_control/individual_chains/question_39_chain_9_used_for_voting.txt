Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measure the position of the particles, they're only found between x=1 and x=3. So, I think this means the wave function is zero outside that region, but wait, actually, the question says the wave function is that expression in the part where it can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function is zero elsewhere? Or maybe it's non-zero only in that region. Oh wait, wait, when they measure the particles, none are found outside x=1 and x=3. So that suggests that the wave function is zero outside that interval. But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe the real part is zero outside x=1 to 3? Or perhaps the wave function as given applies only between x=1 and x=3, and is zero elsewhere. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the problem says in the part of space where it can exist, which is x between 1 and 3. So the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Because the particles are only found in that region. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function usually is non-zero where the particle can be found. So, maybe the wave function is given as that expression between 1 and 3, and zero outside. But in this case, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for where it exists. So perhaps the wave function is that expression in that interval, and zero outside. But wait, the wave function is a complex function, so modulus squared gives the probability density.

So, to find 'a', we probably need to normalize the wave function. Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over x from 1 to 3 should equal 1.

The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the absolute square is |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, because when you square a complex number (a + bi), the magnitude squared is a² + b². Wait, no, because ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So it's a complex number. So the square of its magnitude is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The modulus squared of a complex number z = a + ib is z*z̄, which is a² + b². So in this case, ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - (0.5)i. So the real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. So the probability density is (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx should equal 1.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says that the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) is this expression, but when you square it, you get |ψ|^2. So integrating that from 1 to 3 must be 1.

So let's set up the integral:

∫ (from 1 to 3) [ (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

Which can be written as:

∫[a²/(1+x) dx] + ∫[0.25 dx] from 1 to 3 equals 1.

We can compute these two integrals separately.

First integral: integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

Let me compute that. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C. So the first integral becomes a² [ln(1+x)] from 1 to 3.

So that's a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] because when x=3, 1+x=4; x=1, 1+x=2. ln(4) is approximately 1.386, ln(2) is about 0.693, so the difference is ln(4/2) = ln(2) ≈ 0.693. So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3. The integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So adding both integrals:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that numerically. Ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a squared is 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then, a is the square root of that. So sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. Which is approximately 0.85. So looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So that's correct.

The integral of (a²)/(1+x) is a² ln(1+x), evaluated from 1 to 3. So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2). So that part is correct.

The second integral is 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.5, correct.

So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. So a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. So option B is the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the square of the modulus is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So yes, the integral is correct.

So the calculation looks right, and the answer should be B) 0.85.

To determine the value of \( a \), we normalize the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), meaning the wave function is zero outside this region. The probability density is given by the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The total probability of finding the particle in the interval \( [1, 3] \) must equal 1. Therefore, we integrate \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over \( x \) from 1 to 3:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3.
   \]

   Evaluating the limits:

   \[
   \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(4/2) = \ln(2).
   \]

   So, the first integral becomes:

   \[
   a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding the two integrals:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately **0.85**, which corresponds to option **B**.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx should equal 1.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says that the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) is this expression, but when you square it, you get |ψ|^2. So integrating that from 1 to 3 must be 1.

So let's set up the integral:

∫ (from 1 to 3) [ (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

Which can be written as:

∫[a²/(1+x) dx] + ∫[0.25 dx] from 1 to 3 equals 1.

We can compute these two integrals separately.

First integral: integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

Let me compute that. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C. So the first integral becomes a² [ln(1+x)] from 1 to 3.

So that's a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] because when x=3, 1+x=4; x=1, 1+x=2. ln(4) is approximately 1.386, ln(2) is about 0.693, so the difference is ln(4/2) = ln(2) ≈ 0.693. So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3. The integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So adding both integrals:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that numerically. Ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a squared is 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then, a is the square root of that. So sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. Which is approximately 0.85. So looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So that's correct.

The integral of (a²)/(1+x) is a² ln(1+x), evaluated from 1 to 3. So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2). So that part is correct.

The second integral is 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.5, correct.

So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. So a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. So option B is the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the square of the modulus is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So yes, the integral is correct.

So the calculation looks right, and the answer should be B) 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we normalize the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), meaning the wave function is zero outside this region. The probability density is given by the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The total probability of finding the particle in the interval \( [1, 3] \) must equal 1. Therefore, we integrate \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over \( x \) from 1 to 3:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3.
   \]

   Evaluating the limits:

   \[
   \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(4/2) = \ln(2).
   \]

   So, the first integral becomes:

   \[
   a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding the two integrals:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately **0.85**, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
