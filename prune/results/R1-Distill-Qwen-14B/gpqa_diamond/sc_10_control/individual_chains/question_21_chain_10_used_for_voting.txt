Okay, so I have a chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It gives me two parts, A and B, and asks which compounds fit each part. The options are multiple-choice, and I need to pick the correct one.

Part A is about compounds that do not show tautomerism. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen and the shift of a bond, like in keto-enol tautomerism. So which of these two doesn't show that?

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which has two ketone groups. I think quinones can undergo enol tautomerism. For example, in para-benzoquinone, the structure allows for the movement of a hydrogen from the oxygen to form an enol form. So benzoquinone probably does show tautomerism.

What about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. Wait, can that structure support tautomerism? Let me think. Tautomerism typically involves adjacent hydrogen and double bonds or lone pairs. But in trione, the three ketone groups are in a symmetrical arrangement. Each carbonyl is across from each other. For enol tautomerism, the hydrogen would have to be adjacent to two carbonyl groups, but if each carbonyl is on a separate carbon without any adjacent H, maybe it can't tautomerize.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a cyclic compound where each of the three alternating carbons is a carbonyl. So each carbon has a carbonyl group, so there are no hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl because the adjacent carbons are also carbonyls. So, no Hs to shift. Therefore, it can't undergo tautomerism. So the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Moving to part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism. Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has four different substituents around a carbon.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon has: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the other bond goes where? Wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COO− but wait, wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2-COOCH3. So the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Oh wait, propanoic is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, the OH becomes OMe, so the structure is CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3? Or wait, perhaps it's CH3-COO-OCH2CH2-OH? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of propanoate. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate ester. Let me visualize: the propanoate is CH2CH2COO−, so the 2-hydroxy would be on the middle CH2. So the molecule would have the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to: OH, CH2COOCH3, two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Wait, the second carbon in propanoate is CH2 between the two carbonyls? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, propanoate is -COOCH3 attached to a two-carbon chain. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

In that case, the central CH2 has two CH2 groups attached. Let me look at the central carbons. The carbon adjacent to the OH is CH2. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong carbon. The structure has the ester group on the third carbon, and the hydroxyl on the second.

Wait, maybe the structure is as follows: the molecule is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? No, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the carboxylic acid is on the first carbon, then the second has OH, and the third is CH3. So the ester would have the structure: the carboxylic acid becomes COOCH3, and the second carbon has OH. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me number the carbons.

Carbon 1: COOCH3,

Carbon 2: OH and two CH2 groups? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

O

|

O-C-OCH3

|

CH2-C-OH

|

CH3

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In that structure, the central carbon (second CH2) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2 (from the first carbon),

- CH2COOCH3 (from the third carbon),

Wait, but each CH2 has two carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me think about chiral centers.

If the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to four different groups, it's a chiral center. Let's see: in CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the carbon with OH is connected to what? 

Wait, no, in the structure I'm imagining, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, which is CH2 between two CH2 groups. So the four substituents would be:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups (from the adjacent carbons). But wait, if the adjacent groups are the same, then it wouldn't have four different substituents. So if the carbon with OH is attached to two identical groups, it won't be a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the central carbon is a CH with different substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it mentally. Let's see, propanoate has three carbons. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon. So the structure is:

COOCH3

|

CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 ?

Wait, no, because that would make it 2-hydroxypropanoate as CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the middle CH. It's connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH (from the adjacent carbons? No, wait, the middle carbon is connected to two CH2 groups? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again.

In CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon is bonded to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a CH2 group? No, wait, the central carbon is connected to two CH2? No, wait, maybe I should think about the actual structure.

The molecule would be:

O

|

O-C-OCH3

|

CH(OH)-CH3

So, the central carbon is CH, attached to:

- OH,

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group? Or perhaps two CH2s?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a CH2 group (from the adjacent carbon). Wait, but that would mean it has four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH2 which is part of the same chain. Hmm, maybe that's enough for it to be a chiral center. Wait, but the adjacent group is CH2? Or another CH3?

Wait, I'm getting confused, perhaps it's better to check the other compound.

Dimethyl fumarate: fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is a diacid with two double bond carbonyls. Fumaric acid has the structure HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no, wait. Maleic acid is HO2C-CHCH2-COOH, but fumarate is when both COOH are esterified. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer, while maleate is cis.

Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait. No, wait. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's not right. Wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but in the cis configuration. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer: HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but the double bond is between the two middle carbons.

Wait, so dimethyl fumarate would be the diester: (CH2CH3O)OC-CH=CH-COO(CH2CH3O). No, wait, the structure is O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3 ?

No, perhaps it's more accurate to say that dimethyl fumarate is (Z)- or (E)-dimethyl fumarate. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) but with a double bond in trans configuration. No, wait, fumarate has a double bond between the two central carbons.

Wait, let me get the correct structure. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, that's not right. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but the double bond is between the two middle carbons, and the substituents (the two COOH groups) are on the same side, making it the cis isomer. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, where the substituents are on opposite sides.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

No, that's not correct. Actually, dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups. So it's (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester.

The structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3, but with a double bond? Wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the trans-diestereomer. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, but in trans configuration.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think of the structure as O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3 ?

Alternatively, the structure is O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH-COOCH3

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

O      O
||    ||
O-C-OCH3 and O-C-OCH3 are connected via a double bond.

Wait, no. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond in the middle. No, that would be maleic acid. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, but the double bond is between the two CH groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

No, not exactly. Alternatively, it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. Let's get it right. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, while dimethyl fumarate is (CH3O)OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So the structure has two ester groups, each on one end of the double bond. So the molecule is O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

No, wait, that would be if the double bond is between the second and third carbons. Alternatively, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

Wait, but in that case, each COOCH3 is on either end of the double bond. So each ester group is attached to a carbon that's part of a double bond.

So in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two middle carbons is connected to an ester group and part of a double bond. So the structure is O

O     O
||    ||
O-C-OCH3 and O-C-OCH3 are on each end of the double bond.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to consider the structure as:

O           O
||         ||
O-C-OCH3   O-C-OCH3
     \       /
      C=C

So the central double bond is between two carbons, each attached to an ester group. So each of the central carbons is connected to two ester groups and the double bond.

Wait, each of those central carbons would have:

Carbon 1: connected to O-C-OCH3, double bonded to Carbon 2, and two more bonds—what? Each of those would be bonded to another group. For fumarate, which is the trans isomer, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

But the point is, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Let me think. Each of the central carbons (those in the double bond) is connected to two ester groups and two other substituents.

Wait, each of those carbons in the double bond would have two ester groups and perhaps two methyl groups? No, the structure is O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

Wait, no. Let me think again. The actual structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3, but that would be a single bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't have a chiral center. Dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Does that make the molecule symmetrical?

If the two ester groups are on opposite sides, then the molecule might be symmetrical. Wait, let's imagine the structure: O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

No, perhaps the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

No, that's not with a double bond. Wait, back to the problem. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, so the structure must involve that.

Let me think of the structure as O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is:

(CH3OOC)CH2-CH2(COOCH3)

Wait, no, that's not a double bond. I think I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about whether dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to two ester groups (O-C-OCH3) and the other two groups. Wait, perhaps each of these carbons is connected to two ester groups and two CH2 groups. If so, then each of these carbons has two identical substituents (the two ester groups and two CH2 groups), so each carbon would not be a chiral center.

Wait, no. For a carbon in a double bond, each is bonded to two substituents. In the case of dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond is connected to two ester groups. So, for each of these carbons, the substituents are: two ester groups and two other groups, maybe. Hmm, perhaps each of these carbons is attached to two ester groups and two other carbons from the chain.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about whether these compounds have a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to four different groups, then it's chiral. Let's consider the groups attached to that carbon:

Assuming the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (the one with OH) would have:

- CH3 (from one side),

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group (from the adjacent carbon?).

Wait, in that case, the substituents would be CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2... but wait, the adjacent group is another CH2?

Wait, perhaps the structure is actually CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which would make that the central carbon is CH2. But in that case, the substituents would be two CH2 groups, so it's symmetric and not a chiral center.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Then, the central carbon (the one with OH and H) would have substituents: CH3, H, COOCH3, and another CH group. Wait, then it's CH3, H, COOCH3, and CH2... no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O

| 

O-C-OCH3

|

CH(OH)CH2CH3?

No, that's not right. I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should think about the other compound.

Dimethyl fumarate: does it have a chiral center? If the molecule is symmetrical, then no. If it's not symmetrical, perhaps it has a chiral center.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure is O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the correct structure is (CH2(COOCH3))2 with a double bond. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. Each of the central carbons is attached to one COOCH3, one CH2 group, and is double-bonded to the other.

So each of those central carbons would have substituents: CH2(COOCH3), the double bond (so only one substituent), and the other groups.

Wait, perhaps each has a COOCH3 group, a CH2 group, and the double bond. So each of those carbons has three substituents, but wait, that doesn't add up. Each carbon in a double bond has two substituents besides the double bond.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe an alternative approach: consider whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if it's symmetrical, it won't have a chiral center.

Dimethyl fumarate (E isomer) has the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule symmetrical. So the molecule is symmetrical along the plane bisecting the double bond. Therefore, it doesn't have a chiral center and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but what about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate? Let's think again. If the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the one with OH) would have substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another carbon. But wait, the other carbon is attached to what? If the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon has:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the other bond is to the adjacent carbon, which is perhaps a CH2 group.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is more accurately represented as:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2 with two CH2 groups and two other substituents. No, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O

|

O-C-OCH3

|

CH(OH)CH2CH3.

No, that's not right. Maybe the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group (from the adjacent carbon).

Wait, in that case, the four substituents would be CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2CH3? No, wait, that's not correct. Maybe it's connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the adjacent CH, which is connected to COOCH3.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should think about whether methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center.

If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH (which is connected to the COOCH3 group).

Wait, that would mean the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2COOCH3? No, perhaps that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In that case, the central carbon is CH2, which has two identical substituents (two CH2 groups), so it's not a chiral center.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should recall that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is also known as methyl acrylate or something else, but I think it's more likely that the hydroxyl is on a carbon adjacent to the ester group.

Wait, another approach: in which of these two compounds is there a carbon with four different substituents?

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: let's imagine the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the OH-bearing one) has:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a CH (from the adjacent carbon).

Wait, but if the adjacent carbon is a CH, then maybe it's attached to another group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. In that structure, the hydroxyl is on the first CH2 group. So the carbon with OH is CH2, connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- and two H's.

Wait, that can't be a chiral center because there are two H's. So that's not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that neither of these compounds has a chiral center. But that's unlikely, because the question suggests that one of them does.

Alternatively, maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Wait, perhaps not because it's symmetrical. So if dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical, it won't have a chiral center. But methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate might have a chiral center if the OH-bearing carbon has four different substituents.

Wait, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the OH-bearing one) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (the adjacent carbon, which is connected to another CH3? No, perhaps it's a CH2 group.

Wait, no, in that case, perhaps the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group (which is part of the chain).

So, if the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2COOCH3, then all four would be different. So that carbon would be a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another approach: which of the two compounds can have a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is the one with OH. The four substituents would be:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and CH2 group (but wait, if the adjacent group is another CH, perhaps it's attached to another group). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the OH-bearing carbon is connected to a methyl group, a hydroxyl, a carbonyl group, and another carbon (which is connected to the ester group). So in that case, the substituents would be four different groups, making it a chiral center.

On the other hand, dimethyl fumarate, being symmetrical, doesn't have a chiral center.

So then, the answer would be that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism, and dimethyl fumarate does not.

Wait, but the question is part B: among the two, which shows optical isomerism.

If methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (as I think), then it would show optical isomerism. So B would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Putting it all together:

Part A: the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Part B: the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But wait, earlier I thought that A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism. So looking at the options:

Option C says A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Option A says A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But in part B, if the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, then option A or B would be correct.

Wait, part B is about which one shows optical isomerism. If methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows it, and dimethyl fumarate doesn't, then part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (correct for part A), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (correct for part B). So option A would be correct.

But wait, earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry and thus doesn't have a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the one that does.

So the correct answer is option A: A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A says: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Yes, that's our conclusion.

Wait, but looking at the options, does any option have that?

Option A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Yes, that's option A.

But another thought: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate – does it have a chiral center?

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (from the adjacent carbon, which is connected to the COOCH3 group).

Wait, perhaps the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2COOCH3. No, that's not correct because the adjacent group is another CH.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual structure. The IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO−. 2-hydroxypropanoate is HOCH2CH2COO−. So when esterified with methyl, it becomes HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

In that structure, the central carbon (the second CH2) is connected to:

- HOCH2,

- CH2COOCH3,

- and two Hs.

Wait, that can't be a chiral center because two substituents are H. So that carbon can't be a chiral center.

Wait, so maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. Then, which one does?

Alternatively, perhaps I got the structures wrong. Let me think again. The other compound is dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate, if it has a double bond, perhaps it has two ester groups on opposite ends, which makes it symmetrical. So it doesn't have a chiral center.

Hmm, then neither would have a chiral center, which can't be right because the question says one does.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, which would have the central carbon as a chiral center. Then, the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH group (maybe from the adjacent carbon). So that would make it chiral.

But then, if the adjacent carbon is a CH group, perhaps it's connected to another group. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, making the central carbon a chiral center.

In that case, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center and show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, if the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3, the central carbon is CH2, which is not a chiral center.

I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not certain about the structures. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that dimethyl fumarate is a diester of a trans-diacid, which makes the molecule symmetric and thus not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center because the OH is on a carbon adjacent to the ester group. So that compound would show optical isomerism.

Therefore, part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the correct option is option A: A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the question:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
- **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups and can undergo enol tautomerism due to the presence of adjacent hydrogens and carbonyl groups. Therefore, it shows tautomerism.
- **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Due to the symmetrical arrangement of the carbonyl groups, there are no hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyls that can participate in tautomerism. Thus, it does not show tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
- **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (OH) is connected to four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH group. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.
- **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule is symmetrical due to the trans configuration of the double bond, and no carbon in the molecule has four different substituents. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer

- **A**: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione
- **B**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

The correct option is **A**.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have a chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It gives me two parts, A and B, and asks which compounds fit each part. The options are multiple-choice, and I need to pick the correct one.

Part A is about compounds that do not show tautomerism. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen and the shift of a bond, like in keto-enol tautomerism. So which of these two doesn't show that?

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which has two ketone groups. I think quinones can undergo enol tautomerism. For example, in para-benzoquinone, the structure allows for the movement of a hydrogen from the oxygen to form an enol form. So benzoquinone probably does show tautomerism.

What about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. Wait, can that structure support tautomerism? Let me think. Tautomerism typically involves adjacent hydrogen and double bonds or lone pairs. But in trione, the three ketone groups are in a symmetrical arrangement. Each carbonyl is across from each other. For enol tautomerism, the hydrogen would have to be adjacent to two carbonyl groups, but if each carbonyl is on a separate carbon without any adjacent H, maybe it can't tautomerize.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a cyclic compound where each of the three alternating carbons is a carbonyl. So each carbon has a carbonyl group, so there are no hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl because the adjacent carbons are also carbonyls. So, no Hs to shift. Therefore, it can't undergo tautomerism. So the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Moving to part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism. Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has four different substituents around a carbon.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon has: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the other bond goes where? Wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COO− but wait, wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2-COOCH3. So the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Oh wait, propanoic is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, the OH becomes OMe, so the structure is CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3? Or wait, perhaps it's CH3-COO-OCH2CH2-OH? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of propanoate. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate ester. Let me visualize: the propanoate is CH2CH2COO−, so the 2-hydroxy would be on the middle CH2. So the molecule would have the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to: OH, CH2COOCH3, two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Wait, the second carbon in propanoate is CH2 between the two carbonyls? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, propanoate is -COOCH3 attached to a two-carbon chain. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

In that case, the central CH2 has two CH2 groups attached. Let me look at the central carbons. The carbon adjacent to the OH is CH2. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong carbon. The structure has the ester group on the third carbon, and the hydroxyl on the second.

Wait, maybe the structure is as follows: the molecule is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? No, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the carboxylic acid is on the first carbon, then the second has OH, and the third is CH3. So the ester would have the structure: the carboxylic acid becomes COOCH3, and the second carbon has OH. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me number the carbons.

Carbon 1: COOCH3,

Carbon 2: OH and two CH2 groups? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

O

|

O-C-OCH3

|

CH2-C-OH

|

CH3

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In that structure, the central carbon (second CH2) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2 (from the first carbon),

- CH2COOCH3 (from the third carbon),

Wait, but each CH2 has two carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me think about chiral centers.

If the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to four different groups, it's a chiral center. Let's see: in CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the carbon with OH is connected to what? 

Wait, no, in the structure I'm imagining, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, which is CH2 between two CH2 groups. So the four substituents would be:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups (from the adjacent carbons). But wait, if the adjacent groups are the same, then it wouldn't have four different substituents. So if the carbon with OH is attached to two identical groups, it won't be a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the central carbon is a CH with different substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it mentally. Let's see, propanoate has three carbons. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon. So the structure is:

COOCH3

|

CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 ?

Wait, no, because that would make it 2-hydroxypropanoate as CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the middle CH. It's connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH (from the adjacent carbons? No, wait, the middle carbon is connected to two CH2 groups? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again.

In CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon is bonded to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a CH2 group? No, wait, the central carbon is connected to two CH2? No, wait, maybe I should think about the actual structure.

The molecule would be:

O

|

O-C-OCH3

|

CH(OH)-CH3

So, the central carbon is CH, attached to:

- OH,

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group? Or perhaps two CH2s?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a CH2 group (from the adjacent carbon). Wait, but that would mean it has four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH2 which is part of the same chain. Hmm, maybe that's enough for it to be a chiral center. Wait, but the adjacent group is CH2? Or another CH3?

Wait, I'm getting confused, perhaps it's better to check the other compound.

Dimethyl fumarate: fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is a diacid with two double bond carbonyls. Fumaric acid has the structure HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no, wait. Maleic acid is HO2C-CHCH2-COOH, but fumarate is when both COOH are esterified. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer, while maleate is cis.

Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait. No, wait. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's not right. Wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but in the cis configuration. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer: HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but the double bond is between the two middle carbons.

Wait, so dimethyl fumarate would be the diester: (CH2CH3O)OC-CH=CH-COO(CH2CH3O). No, wait, the structure is O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3 ?

No, perhaps it's more accurate to say that dimethyl fumarate is (Z)- or (E)-dimethyl fumarate. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) but with a double bond in trans configuration. No, wait, fumarate has a double bond between the two central carbons.

Wait, let me get the correct structure. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, that's not right. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but the double bond is between the two middle carbons, and the substituents (the two COOH groups) are on the same side, making it the cis isomer. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, where the substituents are on opposite sides.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

No, that's not correct. Actually, dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups. So it's (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester.

The structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3, but with a double bond? Wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the trans-diestereomer. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, but in trans configuration.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think of the structure as O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3 ?

Alternatively, the structure is O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH-COOCH3

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

O      O
||    ||
O-C-OCH3 and O-C-OCH3 are connected via a double bond.

Wait, no. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond in the middle. No, that would be maleic acid. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, but the double bond is between the two CH groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

No, not exactly. Alternatively, it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. Let's get it right. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, while dimethyl fumarate is (CH3O)OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So the structure has two ester groups, each on one end of the double bond. So the molecule is O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

No, wait, that would be if the double bond is between the second and third carbons. Alternatively, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

Wait, but in that case, each COOCH3 is on either end of the double bond. So each ester group is attached to a carbon that's part of a double bond.

So in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two middle carbons is connected to an ester group and part of a double bond. So the structure is O

O     O
||    ||
O-C-OCH3 and O-C-OCH3 are on each end of the double bond.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to consider the structure as:

O           O
||         ||
O-C-OCH3   O-C-OCH3
     \       /
      C=C

So the central double bond is between two carbons, each attached to an ester group. So each of the central carbons is connected to two ester groups and the double bond.

Wait, each of those central carbons would have:

Carbon 1: connected to O-C-OCH3, double bonded to Carbon 2, and two more bonds—what? Each of those would be bonded to another group. For fumarate, which is the trans isomer, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

But the point is, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Let me think. Each of the central carbons (those in the double bond) is connected to two ester groups and two other substituents.

Wait, each of those carbons in the double bond would have two ester groups and perhaps two methyl groups? No, the structure is O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

Wait, no. Let me think again. The actual structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3, but that would be a single bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't have a chiral center. Dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Does that make the molecule symmetrical?

If the two ester groups are on opposite sides, then the molecule might be symmetrical. Wait, let's imagine the structure: O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

No, perhaps the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

No, that's not with a double bond. Wait, back to the problem. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, so the structure must involve that.

Let me think of the structure as O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is:

(CH3OOC)CH2-CH2(COOCH3)

Wait, no, that's not a double bond. I think I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about whether dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to two ester groups (O-C-OCH3) and the other two groups. Wait, perhaps each of these carbons is connected to two ester groups and two CH2 groups. If so, then each of these carbons has two identical substituents (the two ester groups and two CH2 groups), so each carbon would not be a chiral center.

Wait, no. For a carbon in a double bond, each is bonded to two substituents. In the case of dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond is connected to two ester groups. So, for each of these carbons, the substituents are: two ester groups and two other groups, maybe. Hmm, perhaps each of these carbons is attached to two ester groups and two other carbons from the chain.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about whether these compounds have a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to four different groups, then it's chiral. Let's consider the groups attached to that carbon:

Assuming the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (the one with OH) would have:

- CH3 (from one side),

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group (from the adjacent carbon?).

Wait, in that case, the substituents would be CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2... but wait, the adjacent group is another CH2?

Wait, perhaps the structure is actually CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which would make that the central carbon is CH2. But in that case, the substituents would be two CH2 groups, so it's symmetric and not a chiral center.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Then, the central carbon (the one with OH and H) would have substituents: CH3, H, COOCH3, and another CH group. Wait, then it's CH3, H, COOCH3, and CH2... no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O

| 

O-C-OCH3

|

CH(OH)CH2CH3?

No, that's not right. I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should think about the other compound.

Dimethyl fumarate: does it have a chiral center? If the molecule is symmetrical, then no. If it's not symmetrical, perhaps it has a chiral center.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure is O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the correct structure is (CH2(COOCH3))2 with a double bond. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. Each of the central carbons is attached to one COOCH3, one CH2 group, and is double-bonded to the other.

So each of those central carbons would have substituents: CH2(COOCH3), the double bond (so only one substituent), and the other groups.

Wait, perhaps each has a COOCH3 group, a CH2 group, and the double bond. So each of those carbons has three substituents, but wait, that doesn't add up. Each carbon in a double bond has two substituents besides the double bond.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe an alternative approach: consider whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if it's symmetrical, it won't have a chiral center.

Dimethyl fumarate (E isomer) has the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule symmetrical. So the molecule is symmetrical along the plane bisecting the double bond. Therefore, it doesn't have a chiral center and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but what about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate? Let's think again. If the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the one with OH) would have substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another carbon. But wait, the other carbon is attached to what? If the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon has:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the other bond is to the adjacent carbon, which is perhaps a CH2 group.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is more accurately represented as:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2 with two CH2 groups and two other substituents. No, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O

|

O-C-OCH3

|

CH(OH)CH2CH3.

No, that's not right. Maybe the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group (from the adjacent carbon).

Wait, in that case, the four substituents would be CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2CH3? No, wait, that's not correct. Maybe it's connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the adjacent CH, which is connected to COOCH3.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should think about whether methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center.

If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH (which is connected to the COOCH3 group).

Wait, that would mean the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2COOCH3? No, perhaps that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In that case, the central carbon is CH2, which has two identical substituents (two CH2 groups), so it's not a chiral center.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should recall that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is also known as methyl acrylate or something else, but I think it's more likely that the hydroxyl is on a carbon adjacent to the ester group.

Wait, another approach: in which of these two compounds is there a carbon with four different substituents?

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: let's imagine the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the OH-bearing one) has:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a CH (from the adjacent carbon).

Wait, but if the adjacent carbon is a CH, then maybe it's attached to another group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. In that structure, the hydroxyl is on the first CH2 group. So the carbon with OH is CH2, connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- and two H's.

Wait, that can't be a chiral center because there are two H's. So that's not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that neither of these compounds has a chiral center. But that's unlikely, because the question suggests that one of them does.

Alternatively, maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Wait, perhaps not because it's symmetrical. So if dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical, it won't have a chiral center. But methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate might have a chiral center if the OH-bearing carbon has four different substituents.

Wait, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the OH-bearing one) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (the adjacent carbon, which is connected to another CH3? No, perhaps it's a CH2 group.

Wait, no, in that case, perhaps the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group (which is part of the chain).

So, if the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2COOCH3, then all four would be different. So that carbon would be a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another approach: which of the two compounds can have a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is the one with OH. The four substituents would be:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and CH2 group (but wait, if the adjacent group is another CH, perhaps it's attached to another group). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the OH-bearing carbon is connected to a methyl group, a hydroxyl, a carbonyl group, and another carbon (which is connected to the ester group). So in that case, the substituents would be four different groups, making it a chiral center.

On the other hand, dimethyl fumarate, being symmetrical, doesn't have a chiral center.

So then, the answer would be that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism, and dimethyl fumarate does not.

Wait, but the question is part B: among the two, which shows optical isomerism.

If methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (as I think), then it would show optical isomerism. So B would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Putting it all together:

Part A: the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Part B: the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But wait, earlier I thought that A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism. So looking at the options:

Option C says A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Option A says A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But in part B, if the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, then option A or B would be correct.

Wait, part B is about which one shows optical isomerism. If methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows it, and dimethyl fumarate doesn't, then part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (correct for part A), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (correct for part B). So option A would be correct.

But wait, earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry and thus doesn't have a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the one that does.

So the correct answer is option A: A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A says: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Yes, that's our conclusion.

Wait, but looking at the options, does any option have that?

Option A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Yes, that's option A.

But another thought: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate – does it have a chiral center?

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (from the adjacent carbon, which is connected to the COOCH3 group).

Wait, perhaps the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2COOCH3. No, that's not correct because the adjacent group is another CH.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual structure. The IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO−. 2-hydroxypropanoate is HOCH2CH2COO−. So when esterified with methyl, it becomes HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

In that structure, the central carbon (the second CH2) is connected to:

- HOCH2,

- CH2COOCH3,

- and two Hs.

Wait, that can't be a chiral center because two substituents are H. So that carbon can't be a chiral center.

Wait, so maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. Then, which one does?

Alternatively, perhaps I got the structures wrong. Let me think again. The other compound is dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate, if it has a double bond, perhaps it has two ester groups on opposite ends, which makes it symmetrical. So it doesn't have a chiral center.

Hmm, then neither would have a chiral center, which can't be right because the question says one does.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, which would have the central carbon as a chiral center. Then, the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH group (maybe from the adjacent carbon). So that would make it chiral.

But then, if the adjacent carbon is a CH group, perhaps it's connected to another group. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, making the central carbon a chiral center.

In that case, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center and show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, if the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3, the central carbon is CH2, which is not a chiral center.

I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not certain about the structures. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that dimethyl fumarate is a diester of a trans-diacid, which makes the molecule symmetric and thus not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center because the OH is on a carbon adjacent to the ester group. So that compound would show optical isomerism.

Therefore, part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the correct option is option A: A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the question:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
- **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups and can undergo enol tautomerism due to the presence of adjacent hydrogens and carbonyl groups. Therefore, it shows tautomerism.
- **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Due to the symmetrical arrangement of the carbonyl groups, there are no hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyls that can participate in tautomerism. Thus, it does not show tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
- **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (OH) is connected to four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH group. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.
- **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule is symmetrical due to the trans configuration of the double bond, and no carbon in the molecule has four different substituents. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results from both parts:
- **A**: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione
- **B**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

The correct option is **A**.

**Answer: A**
