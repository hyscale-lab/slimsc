Okay, so I have this problem about quantum mechanics and uncertainty. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. 

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. 

First, I remember that the uncertainty ΔA for an observable A is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(<A²> - <A>²). So I need to compute <P_z²> and <P_z>, then find the difference and take the square root.

Wait, but wait. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x. So the state is a vector given as (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2) as a column vector. Since it's an eigenstate of P_x, the expectation values might be related to its eigenvalue, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

But regardless, the state is given, so I can calculate the expectation values directly. 

The first thing I need is the matrix representation of P_z. Looking at the problem, the P_z matrix is given as:

Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)

So P_z is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ along the diagonal.

The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ]

Wait, but wait, the state is given as a column vector. So to compute <P_z>, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Similarly, <P_z²> would be ψ† P_z² ψ. But since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the squares of the diagonal elements. So the diagonal becomes (ħ², 0, (ħ)^2?), wait no, the third element is (-ħ), so squared, it's ħ².

So let's compute <P_z> first.

Let me denote the components of the state as a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(2), c = -1/2.

So <P_z> = a*(P_z)_{11} + b*(P_z)_{22} + c*(P_z)_{33}

Because P_z is diagonal, the matrix elements are only when i=j.

So <P_z> = a*ħ + b*0 + c*(-ħ)

Plugging a and c: 

= (-1/2)*ħ + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ)
= (-ħ/2) + 0 + (ħ/2)
= 0.

So <P_z> is zero. That's neat. So the expectation value is zero.

Now for <P_z^2>, which is ψ† P_z^2 ψ.

P_z squared matrix:

Row 1: (ħ)^2, 0, 0 → ħ², 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, ( - ħ )^2 → ħ², 0, ħ²?

Wait wait, the diagonal matrix for P_z is:

[ ħ, 0, 0 ]
[0, 0, 0 ]
[0, 0, -ħ ]

So P_z^2 is:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ]
[0, 0, 0 ]
[0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ] → which is ħ².

So P_z^2 matrix is diagonal with entries ħ², 0, ħ².

So <P_z²> is a^2*(ħ²) + b^2 *0 + c^2*(ħ²).

Compute each term:

a^2 = ( (-1/2) )^2 = 1/4.

c^2 = ( (-1/2) )^2 = 1/4.

b^2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

Wait, no wait. The state vector components are a, b, c. But for the expectation value, each term is a_i multiplied by (P_z^2)_i,i multiplied by a_i, because in matrix multiplication ψ† M ψ is sum( a_i^* M_i,i a_i ), since M is diagonal.

Wait, more accurately, the expectation value <M> for a diagonal matrix M is sum ( |a_i|^2 M_i,i ), because the basis is orthonormal.

So, in this case, <P_z^2> = |a|^2 * (ħ)^2 + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (ħ)^2.

Wait, but a is -1/2, b is 1/sqrt(2), c is -1/2.

So |a|^2 is ( (-1/2) )^2 = 1/4.

Similarly |c|^2 is 1/4.

|b|^2 is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So:

< P_z^2 > = (1/4) * ħ² + (1/2) * 0 + (1/4) * ħ².

Adding those terms: (1/4 + 1/4) * ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So <P_z^2> = (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). Since <P_z> is zero, this simplifies to sqrt( <P_z²> ), which is sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (√(1/2)) ħ = (1/√2) ħ.

So the uncertainty is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Let me just double-check my steps.

Wait, wait, did I compute <P_z^2> correctly? Let's re-calculate.

The state is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].

Each component is a_i.

The diagonal elements of P_z^2 are (ħ)^2, 0, (ħ)^2.

So, each term in <P_z^2> is |a_i|^2 * (P_z^2)_{i,i}.

So for i=1: |a1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 → (1/4)(ħ^2) → ħ²/4.

i=2: |a2|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2 → (1/2)(0) = 0.

i=3: |a3|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 → (1/4)(ħ^2) → ħ²/4.

Sum is (ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 ) = ħ²/2. So <P_z²> is ħ²/2.

So sqrt( <P_z²> ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2). Which is option B, ħ/sqrt(2).

Thus, the answer should be option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The matrix representation of $P_z$ is diagonal:
\[
P_z = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\hbar
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state of the system is given as:
\[
|\psi\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1/2 \\
1/\sqrt{2} \\
-1/2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = a \cdot \hbar + b \cdot 0 + c \cdot (-\hbar),
\]
where $a = -1/2$, $b = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c = -1/2$. Substituting these values:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = (-1/2)\hbar + (1/\sqrt{2})\cdot 0 + (-1/2)(-\hbar) = -\hbar/2 + \hbar/2 = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix representation of $P_z^2$ is:
\[
P_z^2 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \hbar^2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]
The squared magnitudes of the state components are:
\[
|a|^2 = \left(-1/2\right)^2 = 1/4, \quad |b|^2 = \left(1/\sqrt{2}\right)^2 = 1/2, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-1/2\right)^2 = 1/4.
\]
Substituting these values:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = (1/4)\hbar^2 + (1/2)\cdot 0 + (1/4)\hbar^2 = \hbar^2/4 + \hbar^2/4 = \hbar^2/2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]
Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\hbar^2/2} = \hbar/\sqrt{2}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar/\sqrt{2}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Okay, so I have this problem about quantum mechanics and uncertainty. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. 

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. 

First, I remember that the uncertainty ΔA for an observable A is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(<A²> - <A>²). So I need to compute <P_z²> and <P_z>, then find the difference and take the square root.

Wait, but wait. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x. So the state is a vector given as (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2) as a column vector. Since it's an eigenstate of P_x, the expectation values might be related to its eigenvalue, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

But regardless, the state is given, so I can calculate the expectation values directly. 

The first thing I need is the matrix representation of P_z. Looking at the problem, the P_z matrix is given as:

Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)

So P_z is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ along the diagonal.

The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ]

Wait, but wait, the state is given as a column vector. So to compute <P_z>, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Similarly, <P_z²> would be ψ† P_z² ψ. But since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the squares of the diagonal elements. So the diagonal becomes (ħ², 0, (ħ)^2?), wait no, the third element is (-ħ), so squared, it's ħ².

So let's compute <P_z> first.

Let me denote the components of the state as a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(2), c = -1/2.

So <P_z> = a*(P_z)_{11} + b*(P_z)_{22} + c*(P_z)_{33}

Because P_z is diagonal, the matrix elements are only when i=j.

So <P_z> = a*ħ + b*0 + c*(-ħ)

Plugging a and c: 

= (-1/2)*ħ + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ)
= (-ħ/2) + 0 + (ħ/2)
= 0.

So <P_z> is zero. That's neat. So the expectation value is zero.

Now for <P_z^2>, which is ψ† P_z^2 ψ.

P_z squared matrix:

Row 1: (ħ)^2, 0, 0 → ħ², 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, ( - ħ )^2 → ħ², 0, ħ²?

Wait wait, the diagonal matrix for P_z is:

[ ħ, 0, 0 ]
[0, 0, 0 ]
[0, 0, -ħ ]

So P_z^2 is:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ]
[0, 0, 0 ]
[0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ] → which is ħ².

So P_z^2 matrix is diagonal with entries ħ², 0, ħ².

So <P_z²> is a^2*(ħ²) + b^2 *0 + c^2*(ħ²).

Compute each term:

a^2 = ( (-1/2) )^2 = 1/4.

c^2 = ( (-1/2) )^2 = 1/4.

b^2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

Wait, no wait. The state vector components are a, b, c. But for the expectation value, each term is a_i multiplied by (P_z^2)_i,i multiplied by a_i, because in matrix multiplication ψ† M ψ is sum( a_i^* M_i,i a_i ), since M is diagonal.

Wait, more accurately, the expectation value <M> for a diagonal matrix M is sum ( |a_i|^2 M_i,i ), because the basis is orthonormal.

So, in this case, <P_z^2> = |a|^2 * (ħ)^2 + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (ħ)^2.

Wait, but a is -1/2, b is 1/sqrt(2), c is -1/2.

So |a|^2 is ( (-1/2) )^2 = 1/4.

Similarly |c|^2 is 1/4.

|b|^2 is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So:

< P_z^2 > = (1/4) * ħ² + (1/2) * 0 + (1/4) * ħ².

Adding those terms: (1/4 + 1/4) * ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So <P_z^2> = (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). Since <P_z> is zero, this simplifies to sqrt( <P_z²> ), which is sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (√(1/2)) ħ = (1/√2) ħ.

So the uncertainty is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Let me just double-check my steps.

Wait, wait, did I compute <P_z^2> correctly? Let's re-calculate.

The state is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].

Each component is a_i.

The diagonal elements of P_z^2 are (ħ)^2, 0, (ħ)^2.

So, each term in <P_z^2> is |a_i|^2 * (P_z^2)_{i,i}.

So for i=1: |a1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 → (1/4)(ħ^2) → ħ²/4.

i=2: |a2|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2 → (1/2)(0) = 0.

i=3: |a3|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 → (1/4)(ħ^2) → ħ²/4.

Sum is (ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 ) = ħ²/2. So <P_z²> is ħ²/2.

So sqrt( <P_z²> ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2). Which is option B, ħ/sqrt(2).

Thus, the answer should be option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The matrix representation of $P_z$ is diagonal:
\[
P_z = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\hbar
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state of the system is given as:
\[
|\psi\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1/2 \\
1/\sqrt{2} \\
-1/2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = a \cdot \hbar + b \cdot 0 + c \cdot (-\hbar),
\]
where $a = -1/2$, $b = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c = -1/2$. Substituting these values:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = (-1/2)\hbar + (1/\sqrt{2})\cdot 0 + (-1/2)(-\hbar) = -\hbar/2 + \hbar/2 = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix representation of $P_z^2$ is:
\[
P_z^2 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \hbar^2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]
The squared magnitudes of the state components are:
\[
|a|^2 = \left(-1/2\right)^2 = 1/4, \quad |b|^2 = \left(1/\sqrt{2}\right)^2 = 1/2, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-1/2\right)^2 = 1/4.
\]
Substituting these values:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = (1/4)\hbar^2 + (1/2)\cdot 0 + (1/4)\hbar^2 = \hbar^2/4 + \hbar^2/4 = \hbar^2/2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]
Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\hbar^2/2} = \hbar/\sqrt{2}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar/\sqrt{2}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
