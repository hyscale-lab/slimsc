Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic moments. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times S_z. Oh wait, S_z is the spin component in the z-direction. The magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude B. After that, the average z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating, and we need to find the oscillation frequency.

Wait, let me make sure I understand the setup. Initially, the magnetic field is along Z. So the magnetic moment mu would be aligned with the field. Then, the field is switched off, so the magnetic field becomes zero. But then another field is turned on along Y, same magnitude. So now the field is in the Y direction.

But the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Hmm. So when the magnetic field changes from Z to Y, how does the spin precess, and what effect does that have on the expectation value of S_z?

I remember that when a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque causing it to precess. For spin systems, this precession leads to oscillations in the expectation values of the components of spin.

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, right? Because S is a vector, so the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin vector. So when the magnetic field is in the Z direction, the spin aligns along Z. When we switch the field to Y, the spin will start to precess around the Y-axis.

So, the Hamiltonian of the system after the field is applied along Y would be H = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma S, and B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, let me think about the signs. Oh, right, the potential energy is U = -mu·B, so H = -mu · B.

So H = -gamma B S_y. Because B is along Y, so B = B \hat{y}. So mu is gamma times S, so mu · B = gamma S_y B. Thus, H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian for spin in a magnetic field is usually written as H = gamma B S · n, where n is the direction of the field. So for Y direction, it's H = gamma B S_y. Wait, does the sign matter? Or perhaps I'm missing a negative somewhere. Let me think again. The energy of a magnetic dipole in a field is U = -mu·B. So if mu is gamma S, then H = -gamma S · B.

So if B is in +Y direction, H = -gamma B S_y. But wait, wait. gamma could have a sign depending on the particle. For electrons, gamma is negative because the magnetic moment is opposite to the spin. Oh, but the problem says mu = gamma S_z. So perhaps gamma already includes the sign. So maybe H is -mu · B = -gamma S · B.

Wait, no, let me clarify. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times S_z. Wait, that's only the z-component. Oh, that's confusing. Wait, wait, the problem says mu = gamma S_z. Wait, that can't be right because mu should be a vector. Oh, perhaps it's a typo. Or perhaps the initial state is aligned with the Z field, so mu is along Z. So maybe the magnetic moment is just proportional to the spin, but they wrote it as mu = gamma S_z. Hmm. Or perhaps mu is a vector with components, but the problem states that mu is aligned along Z, so perhaps it's in the direction of the field. So maybe I can think of mu as gamma times the spin vector.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the problem states mu = gamma S_z. But S_z is an operator with eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for spin 1/2. So then, mu would be a vector along Z with magnitude gamma times S_z. Hmm, but that would mean mu is only in the Z direction. But then, when the field is turned on in Y, mu would be in Y? Or perhaps it's that mu is proportional to the spin vector. So perhaps mu = gamma S.

Wait, the question says mu = gamma S_z. Oh wait, that's a bit unclear. Maybe it's written as mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. Because that makes more sense because the magnetic moment is a vector proportional to spin. So perhaps the problem should have written it as mu = gamma S. But maybe it's a typo in the question. Alternatively, perhaps the initial statement is that the magnetic moment is mu = gamma times S_z, implying that mu points along Z. Hmm.

Wait, given the problem, after the field is turned off, the spin is free, but then another field is applied in Y. So perhaps the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z (since the field is along Z). Then, when the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y, which doesn't commute with S_z. So the state will precess, leading to time evolution that affects the expectation value of S_z.

So, regardless of the initial confusion, I think the key is that the Hamiltonian after the field is applied is proportional to S_y. So H = gamma B S_y, perhaps? Or maybe negative, but perhaps the sign won't affect the frequency.

Wait, perhaps let's get the Hamiltonian right. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma S_z. But that seems off because mu is a vector. Alternatively, perhaps mu is proportional to the spin vector, so mu = gamma S. So, if the magnetic field is in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian would be H = -mu · B = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but for a spin-1/2, the spin matrices are S_x = ħ/2 σ_x, etc. So in quantum mechanics, the energy levels are determined by the matrix elements of H.

But the question is about the oscillations in the expectation value of S_z. So perhaps the time evolution will cause S_z to oscillate. Let's model this.

The system starts in an eigenstate of S_z, say |↑⟩_z. The system's Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B S_y. So H = ( -gamma B ) (S_y) . The time evolution is governed by the Schrödinger equation, so the state will evolve as |ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-i H t / ħ) |↑⟩_z.

But wait, the expectation value of S_z in this state will oscillate over time. The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the energy splitting induced by the Hamiltonian.

The eigenvalues of H will give us the energy levels. Since S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, H will have eigenvalues ± (gamma B ħ / 2). So the energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B ħ / 2 ) and E_- = - (gamma B ħ / 2 ), but wait, no: because H is -gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues are ( - gamma B ) times the eigenvalues of S_y.

Wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So for H = -gamma B S_y, the eigenvalues are E = (-gamma B) * ( ± ħ/2 ) = ∓ (gamma B ħ / 2 ). So the energy levels are E_+ = - (gamma B ħ ) / 2 and E_- = (gamma B ħ ) / 2. Wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive, but perhaps that's correct.

Wait, but the system's initial state is |↑⟩_z, which is an eigenstate of S_z. The state is a superposition of the eigenstates of H. The time evolution will cause the state to precess, and the expectation value of S_z will oscillate with a frequency related to the energy difference.

The energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = [ (gamma B ħ/2) ) ] - [ - (gamma B ħ/2) ) ] = gamma B ħ.

The frequency omega is (E_- - E_+ ) / ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, that gives omega = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. Looking back at the options, option B is gamma B.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck this. The initial state is |↑⟩_z. The expectation value of S_z is ⟨↑| S_z |↑⟩ = ħ/2. But when the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y, the state will evolve in time, so the state becomes a combination of the eigenstates of H, leading to oscillations in ⟨S_z⟩.

The time dependence of the expectation value ⟨S_z⟩ can be found by expanding the initial state in terms of the eigenstates of H.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the time evolution operator and the expectation value.

But another approach is to model the system using the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The state will evolve, and the expectation value of S_z will oscillate. The frequency of oscillation is determined by the energy difference between the states.

Wait, but perhaps the frequency is given by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant. So if the energy difference is 2 (gamma B ħ / 2 ), that is, gamma B ħ, then the frequency is (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The energy difference between the two eigenstates is 2*(gamma B ħ / 2) )= gamma B ħ. So the frequency is gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency would be gamma B. So the answer is option B.

But wait, another approach. Let's think about the time evolution operator. For a spin in a magnetic field along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ ).

So H = -gamma B S_y. So S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H = -gamma B (ħ/2 ) sigma_y.

So H = (-gamma B ħ / 2 ) sigma_y.

Thus, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( i (gamma B ħ / 2 ) sigma_y t / ħ ) )

Simplify that: U(t) = exp( i (gamma B / 2 ) sigma_y t )

Because (gamma B ħ / 2 ) / ħ = gamma B / 2.

So U(t) = e^{i (gamma B t / 2 ) sigma_y }

Now, the initial state is |↑⟩_z, which is (1, 0)^T in the z-basis.

Expressed in terms of sigma_y, sigma_y |↑⟩ = i |↓⟩, I think. Wait, sigma_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So sigma_y |↑⟩ = sigma_y (1,0)^T = [0, i]^T = i |↓⟩.

So let's compute U(t) |↑⟩.

U(t) = e^{i theta sigma_y }, where theta = (gamma B / 2 ) t.

The exponential of sigma_y times i theta can be written using the identity for Pauli matrices:

e^{i theta sigma_y } = I cos(theta) + i sigma_y sin(theta).

So substituting, U(t) = I cos(theta) + i sigma_y sin(theta).

So when we apply U(t) to |↑⟩:

U(t)|↑⟩ = [ I cos(theta) + i sigma_y sin(theta) ] |↑⟩

= cos(theta) |↑⟩ + i sigma_y |↑⟩ sin(theta)

But sigma_y |↑⟩ = i |↓⟩.

So U(t)|↑⟩ = cos(theta) |↑⟩ + i (i |↓⟩) sin(theta )

= cos(theta)|↑⟩ + (i^2) |↓⟩ sin(theta )

i squared is -1, so this becomes:

cos(theta) |↑⟩ - |↓⟩ sin(theta )

So the state at time t is a superposition of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ with coefficients cos(theta) and - sin(theta), respectively.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is |↑⟩, so perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Wait, the time evolution operator is U(t) = e^(-i H t / ħ ). Wait, the initial Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y, so H = - gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y).

So H t / ħ = (- gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y ) t ) / ħ ) = (- gamma B t sigma_y ) / (2) )

Hence, U(t) = e^(-i H t / ħ ) = e^{ i (gamma B t sigma_y ) / 2 }

Wait, so that makes U(t) = e^{i (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y }

Which is the same as the previous expression.

So, the expression for U(t) is correct as written.

So, applying U(t) to |↑⟩:

U(t)|↑⟩ = [ I cos(theta) + i sigma_y sin(theta) ] |↑⟩

Which, as before, gives:

cos(theta) |↑⟩ + i sigma_y |↑⟩ sin(theta )

sigma_y |↑⟩ is i |↓⟩, so:

= cos(theta)|↑⟩ + i (i |↓⟩) sin(theta )

= cos(theta)|↑⟩ + (i^2) |↓⟩ sin(theta )

= cos(theta)|↑⟩ - |↓⟩ sin(theta )

So the state is |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(theta)|↑⟩ - |↓⟩ sin(theta )

Now, the expectation value of S_z is ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.

Since S_z |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩ and S_z |↓⟩ = (-ħ/2)|↓⟩.

So,

⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩ = [ cos(theta)* ⟨↑| - sin(theta) ⟨↓| ] S_z [ cos(theta) |↑⟩ - sin(theta) |↓⟩ ]

= cos^2(theta) ⟨↑| S_z |↑⟩ - cos(theta) sin(theta) ⟨↑| S_z |↓⟩ 
- sin(theta) cos(theta) ⟨↓| S_z |↑⟩ 
+ sin^2(theta) ⟨↓| S_z |↓⟩

Now, because S_z |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩ and S_z |↓⟩ = (-ħ/2)|↓⟩, and ⟨↑| S_z |↓⟩ = 0 because S_z is diagonal in the z basis.

So this simplifies to:

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) - 0 - 0 + sin^2(theta) (-ħ/2 )

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]

But cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) = cos(2 theta )

So ⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

Theta is (gamma B / 2) t, so 2 theta = gamma B t.

So,

⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but wait, the question is about the z-component of the particle’s moment. The magnetic moment mu is given as mu = gamma S_z, so the z-component of mu is gamma times S_z. So the average of the z-component of mu is mu_z = gamma ⟨S_z⟩.

So,

⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

But the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment. So the oscillation is cos( gamma B t ), implying the frequency is gamma B. So the frequency is omega = gamma B.

So the answer should be option B: gamma B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then switched off and turned on again along the $+Y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**:  
   The magnetic moment $\mu$ is proportional to the spin $S$, with $\mu = \gamma S$. Initially, the magnetic field is along $+Z$, so the spin aligns along $+Z$. After the field is switched to $+Y$, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y$.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The time evolution of the system is governed by the Schrödinger equation. The initial state is $| \uparrow \rangle_z$, an eigenstate of $S_z$. The Hamiltonian $H = -\gamma B S_y$ does not commute with $S_z$, so the state evolves into a superposition of eigenstates of $H$. This causes the expectation value of $S_z$ to oscillate over time.

3. **Energy Splitting**:  
   The eigenvalues of $S_y$ are $\pm \hbar/2$, so the eigenvalues of $H$ are $E_\pm = \mp (\gamma B \hbar / 2)$. The energy difference between the two eigenstates is $\Delta E = E_- - E_+ = \gamma B \hbar$.

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation frequency of $\langle S_z \rangle$ is determined by the energy difference $\Delta E$. The frequency is given by $\omega = \Delta E / \hbar = \gamma B$. Since $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is also $\gamma B$.

5. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A ($\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is not halved; it matches the energy splitting $\gamma B$.  
   - **Option B ($\gamma B$)**: Correct. The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference $\Delta E = \gamma B \hbar$, giving $\omega = \gamma B$.  
   - **Option C ($\sqrt{2} \gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\sqrt{2}$ in the oscillation frequency.  
   - **Option D ($\gamma B / \sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is not reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. 

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic moments. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times S_z. Oh wait, S_z is the spin component in the z-direction. The magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude B. After that, the average z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating, and we need to find the oscillation frequency.

Wait, let me make sure I understand the setup. Initially, the magnetic field is along Z. So the magnetic moment mu would be aligned with the field. Then, the field is switched off, so the magnetic field becomes zero. But then another field is turned on along Y, same magnitude. So now the field is in the Y direction.

But the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Hmm. So when the magnetic field changes from Z to Y, how does the spin precess, and what effect does that have on the expectation value of S_z?

I remember that when a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque causing it to precess. For spin systems, this precession leads to oscillations in the expectation values of the components of spin.

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, right? Because S is a vector, so the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin vector. So when the magnetic field is in the Z direction, the spin aligns along Z. When we switch the field to Y, the spin will start to precess around the Y-axis.

So, the Hamiltonian of the system after the field is applied along Y would be H = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma S, and B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, let me think about the signs. Oh, right, the potential energy is U = -mu·B, so H = -mu · B.

So H = -gamma B S_y. Because B is along Y, so B = B \hat{y}. So mu is gamma times S, so mu · B = gamma S_y B. Thus, H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian for spin in a magnetic field is usually written as H = gamma B S · n, where n is the direction of the field. So for Y direction, it's H = gamma B S_y. Wait, does the sign matter? Or perhaps I'm missing a negative somewhere. Let me think again. The energy of a magnetic dipole in a field is U = -mu·B. So if mu is gamma S, then H = -gamma S · B.

So if B is in +Y direction, H = -gamma B S_y. But wait, wait. gamma could have a sign depending on the particle. For electrons, gamma is negative because the magnetic moment is opposite to the spin. Oh, but the problem says mu = gamma S_z. So perhaps gamma already includes the sign. So maybe H is -mu · B = -gamma S · B.

Wait, no, let me clarify. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times S_z. Wait, that's only the z-component. Oh, that's confusing. Wait, wait, the problem says mu = gamma S_z. Wait, that can't be right because mu should be a vector. Oh, perhaps it's a typo. Or perhaps the initial state is aligned with the Z field, so mu is along Z. So maybe the magnetic moment is just proportional to the spin, but they wrote it as mu = gamma S_z. Hmm. Or perhaps mu is a vector with components, but the problem states that mu is aligned along Z, so perhaps it's in the direction of the field. So maybe I can think of mu as gamma times the spin vector.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the problem states mu = gamma S_z. But S_z is an operator with eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for spin 1/2. So then, mu would be a vector along Z with magnitude gamma times S_z. Hmm, but that would mean mu is only in the Z direction. But then, when the field is turned on in Y, mu would be in Y? Or perhaps it's that mu is proportional to the spin vector. So perhaps mu = gamma S.

Wait, the question says mu = gamma S_z. Oh wait, that's a bit unclear. Maybe it's written as mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. Because that makes more sense because the magnetic moment is a vector proportional to spin. So perhaps the problem should have written it as mu = gamma S. But maybe it's a typo in the question. Alternatively, perhaps the initial statement is that the magnetic moment is mu = gamma times S_z, implying that mu points along Z. Hmm.

Wait, given the problem, after the field is turned off, the spin is free, but then another field is applied in Y. So perhaps the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z (since the field is along Z). Then, when the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y, which doesn't commute with S_z. So the state will precess, leading to time evolution that affects the expectation value of S_z.

So, regardless of the initial confusion, I think the key is that the Hamiltonian after the field is applied is proportional to S_y. So H = gamma B S_y, perhaps? Or maybe negative, but perhaps the sign won't affect the frequency.

Wait, perhaps let's get the Hamiltonian right. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma S_z. But that seems off because mu is a vector. Alternatively, perhaps mu is proportional to the spin vector, so mu = gamma S. So, if the magnetic field is in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian would be H = -mu · B = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but for a spin-1/2, the spin matrices are S_x = ħ/2 σ_x, etc. So in quantum mechanics, the energy levels are determined by the matrix elements of H.

But the question is about the oscillations in the expectation value of S_z. So perhaps the time evolution will cause S_z to oscillate. Let's model this.

The system starts in an eigenstate of S_z, say |↑⟩_z. The system's Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B S_y. So H = ( -gamma B ) (S_y) . The time evolution is governed by the Schrödinger equation, so the state will evolve as |ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-i H t / ħ) |↑⟩_z.

But wait, the expectation value of S_z in this state will oscillate over time. The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the energy splitting induced by the Hamiltonian.

The eigenvalues of H will give us the energy levels. Since S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, H will have eigenvalues ± (gamma B ħ / 2). So the energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B ħ / 2 ) and E_- = - (gamma B ħ / 2 ), but wait, no: because H is -gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues are ( - gamma B ) times the eigenvalues of S_y.

Wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So for H = -gamma B S_y, the eigenvalues are E = (-gamma B) * ( ± ħ/2 ) = ∓ (gamma B ħ / 2 ). So the energy levels are E_+ = - (gamma B ħ ) / 2 and E_- = (gamma B ħ ) / 2. Wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive, but perhaps that's correct.

Wait, but the system's initial state is |↑⟩_z, which is an eigenstate of S_z. The state is a superposition of the eigenstates of H. The time evolution will cause the state to precess, and the expectation value of S_z will oscillate with a frequency related to the energy difference.

The energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = [ (gamma B ħ/2) ) ] - [ - (gamma B ħ/2) ) ] = gamma B ħ.

The frequency omega is (E_- - E_+ ) / ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, that gives omega = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. Looking back at the options, option B is gamma B.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck this. The initial state is |↑⟩_z. The expectation value of S_z is ⟨↑| S_z |↑⟩ = ħ/2. But when the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y, the state will evolve in time, so the state becomes a combination of the eigenstates of H, leading to oscillations in ⟨S_z⟩.

The time dependence of the expectation value ⟨S_z⟩ can be found by expanding the initial state in terms of the eigenstates of H.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the time evolution operator and the expectation value.

But another approach is to model the system using the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The state will evolve, and the expectation value of S_z will oscillate. The frequency of oscillation is determined by the energy difference between the states.

Wait, but perhaps the frequency is given by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant. So if the energy difference is 2 (gamma B ħ / 2 ), that is, gamma B ħ, then the frequency is (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The energy difference between the two eigenstates is 2*(gamma B ħ / 2) )= gamma B ħ. So the frequency is gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency would be gamma B. So the answer is option B.

But wait, another approach. Let's think about the time evolution operator. For a spin in a magnetic field along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ ).

So H = -gamma B S_y. So S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H = -gamma B (ħ/2 ) sigma_y.

So H = (-gamma B ħ / 2 ) sigma_y.

Thus, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( i (gamma B ħ / 2 ) sigma_y t / ħ ) )

Simplify that: U(t) = exp( i (gamma B / 2 ) sigma_y t )

Because (gamma B ħ / 2 ) / ħ = gamma B / 2.

So U(t) = e^{i (gamma B t / 2 ) sigma_y }

Now, the initial state is |↑⟩_z, which is (1, 0)^T in the z-basis.

Expressed in terms of sigma_y, sigma_y |↑⟩ = i |↓⟩, I think. Wait, sigma_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So sigma_y |↑⟩ = sigma_y (1,0)^T = [0, i]^T = i |↓⟩.

So let's compute U(t) |↑⟩.

U(t) = e^{i theta sigma_y }, where theta = (gamma B / 2 ) t.

The exponential of sigma_y times i theta can be written using the identity for Pauli matrices:

e^{i theta sigma_y } = I cos(theta) + i sigma_y sin(theta).

So substituting, U(t) = I cos(theta) + i sigma_y sin(theta).

So when we apply U(t) to |↑⟩:

U(t)|↑⟩ = [ I cos(theta) + i sigma_y sin(theta) ] |↑⟩

= cos(theta) |↑⟩ + i sigma_y |↑⟩ sin(theta)

But sigma_y |↑⟩ = i |↓⟩.

So U(t)|↑⟩ = cos(theta) |↑⟩ + i (i |↓⟩) sin(theta )

= cos(theta)|↑⟩ + (i^2) |↓⟩ sin(theta )

i squared is -1, so this becomes:

cos(theta) |↑⟩ - |↓⟩ sin(theta )

So the state at time t is a superposition of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ with coefficients cos(theta) and - sin(theta), respectively.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is |↑⟩, so perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Wait, the time evolution operator is U(t) = e^(-i H t / ħ ). Wait, the initial Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y, so H = - gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y).

So H t / ħ = (- gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y ) t ) / ħ ) = (- gamma B t sigma_y ) / (2) )

Hence, U(t) = e^(-i H t / ħ ) = e^{ i (gamma B t sigma_y ) / 2 }

Wait, so that makes U(t) = e^{i (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y }

Which is the same as the previous expression.

So, the expression for U(t) is correct as written.

So, applying U(t) to |↑⟩:

U(t)|↑⟩ = [ I cos(theta) + i sigma_y sin(theta) ] |↑⟩

Which, as before, gives:

cos(theta) |↑⟩ + i sigma_y |↑⟩ sin(theta )

sigma_y |↑⟩ is i |↓⟩, so:

= cos(theta)|↑⟩ + i (i |↓⟩) sin(theta )

= cos(theta)|↑⟩ + (i^2) |↓⟩ sin(theta )

= cos(theta)|↑⟩ - |↓⟩ sin(theta )

So the state is |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(theta)|↑⟩ - |↓⟩ sin(theta )

Now, the expectation value of S_z is ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.

Since S_z |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩ and S_z |↓⟩ = (-ħ/2)|↓⟩.

So,

⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩ = [ cos(theta)* ⟨↑| - sin(theta) ⟨↓| ] S_z [ cos(theta) |↑⟩ - sin(theta) |↓⟩ ]

= cos^2(theta) ⟨↑| S_z |↑⟩ - cos(theta) sin(theta) ⟨↑| S_z |↓⟩ 
- sin(theta) cos(theta) ⟨↓| S_z |↑⟩ 
+ sin^2(theta) ⟨↓| S_z |↓⟩

Now, because S_z |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩ and S_z |↓⟩ = (-ħ/2)|↓⟩, and ⟨↑| S_z |↓⟩ = 0 because S_z is diagonal in the z basis.

So this simplifies to:

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) - 0 - 0 + sin^2(theta) (-ħ/2 )

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]

But cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) = cos(2 theta )

So ⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

Theta is (gamma B / 2) t, so 2 theta = gamma B t.

So,

⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but wait, the question is about the z-component of the particle’s moment. The magnetic moment mu is given as mu = gamma S_z, so the z-component of mu is gamma times S_z. So the average of the z-component of mu is mu_z = gamma ⟨S_z⟩.

So,

⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

But the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment. So the oscillation is cos( gamma B t ), implying the frequency is gamma B. So the frequency is omega = gamma B.

So the answer should be option B: gamma B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then switched off and turned on again along the $+Y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**:  
   The magnetic moment $\mu$ is proportional to the spin $S$, with $\mu = \gamma S$. Initially, the magnetic field is along $+Z$, so the spin aligns along $+Z$. After the field is switched to $+Y$, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y$.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The time evolution of the system is governed by the Schrödinger equation. The initial state is $| \uparrow \rangle_z$, an eigenstate of $S_z$. The Hamiltonian $H = -\gamma B S_y$ does not commute with $S_z$, so the state evolves into a superposition of eigenstates of $H$. This causes the expectation value of $S_z$ to oscillate over time.

3. **Energy Splitting**:  
   The eigenvalues of $S_y$ are $\pm \hbar/2$, so the eigenvalues of $H$ are $E_\pm = \mp (\gamma B \hbar / 2)$. The energy difference between the two eigenstates is $\Delta E = E_- - E_+ = \gamma B \hbar$.

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation frequency of $\langle S_z \rangle$ is determined by the energy difference $\Delta E$. The frequency is given by $\omega = \Delta E / \hbar = \gamma B$. Since $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is also $\gamma B$.

5. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A ($\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is not halved; it matches the energy splitting $\gamma B$.  
   - **Option B ($\gamma B$)**: Correct. The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference $\Delta E = \gamma B \hbar$, giving $\omega = \gamma B$.  
   - **Option C ($\sqrt{2} \gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\sqrt{2}$ in the oscillation frequency.  
   - **Option D ($\gamma B / \sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is not reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$.
