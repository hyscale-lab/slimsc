Okay, so I've got this question about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through. The question gives a Lagrangian term L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that the mass dimension of the coupling constant affects whether the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, renormalizable theories require that the coupling constants have positive mass dimension, right? Because that way, the interactions don't get stronger at higher energies. Or wait, no. Wait, I think the condition is that the coupling has a mass dimension less than or equal to 4, because in four spacetime dimensions, the action must be dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So, the Lagrangian is in four dimensions. Each term in the Lagrangian (like L_int here) must have mass dimension 4. Because the action is the integral of the Lagrangian, which in 4D has dimension 4, making the action dimensionless.

So, each term in L must have [L] = 4. So, for L_int, which is given, I need to find the mass dimension of κ.

Let me break down each part of the term.

First, ψ is a spinor. What's the mass dimension of a spinor in 4D? Well, in the Standard Model, fermions like the electron have mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation has derivatives which are dimension 1, so the kinetic term is ψ̄ iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which is [ψ̄] + [ψ] + 1 = [ψ̄] + [ψ] = 1 (since the derivative is dimension 1). Wait, no: each ψ is dimension 3/2 because the term is [ψ̄] = [ψ] = 3/2. Because the Dirac term is [ψ̄] [i γ ∂ ψ] which is (3/2 + 3/2) + 1 = 4. Yeah, right.

So [ψ̄] = [ψ] = 3/2 each.

Next, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices γ are dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is just a product of γ matrices and thus is dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}] = 0.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is made from the derivatives of the gauge field A. So F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. Each derivative is dimension 1, and A is a vector potential, which has mass dimension 1. Because the gauge field kinetic term is (1/4) F² → [F]^2 must be [Lagrangian] which is 4. So [F] is sqrt(4) → 2. But wait, no. Because the term is F^2, so ( [F]^2 ) = [Lagrangian] → [F]^2 = 4 → [F] = 2. So each F^{μν} has dimension 2.

So putting it all together. The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let me compute the mass dimension of each part:

κ is the coupling, which is what we're trying to find.

Each ψ̄ and ψ is 3/2, so together that's 3.

σ_{μν} is 0, so that doesn't contribute.

F^{μν} is 2.

So the entire term: [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] + 5.

Wait, no. Wait, when you multiply terms, their dimensions add. So the term is κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F. So the dimension is [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F].

Wait, [ψ̄ σ ψ] is [ψ̄][σ][ψ] = (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) = 3.

[F] is 2.

So the entire term is [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] + 5.

But the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So:

[kappa] + 5 = 4 → [kappa] = 4 -5 = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check.

Wait, the term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let's think about each component's dimension.

ψ̄ has 3/2, F^{μν} has 2. What about σ_{μν}? Since it's made of gamma matrices (which are dimensionless) and derivatives? Wait no, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is a commutator of gamma matrices. Gamma matrices are dimensionless, so σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So no derivatives involved in σ; it's constructed from gammas only. So [σ_{μν}]=0.

So the term ψ̄ σ ψ is [ψ̄][ψ] + [σ] = 3/2 +3/2 + 0 =3.

Then, F^{μν} is 2. So the product (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F is 3 + 2 =5.

So the entire term is κ multiplied by that, so [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=-1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizable theories require that the coupling has a mass dimension ≤ (4 - [Lagrangian term dimension]). Wait, no, more accurately, each coupling's dimension must be such that the term is renormalizable, which depends on the interaction term's dimension.

Wait, another approach: in four dimensions, a renormalizable interaction term must have mass dimension ≤4. So each coupling's dimension must be ≤4.

Wait, but I think the condition is that the coupling's dimension must be ≥0. Because, for a term in the Lagrangian, the interaction term must have dimension 4. So our term is a dimension 4 term, which is okay.

But wait, wait. The mass dimension of the coupling is [κ]=-1. The Yang-Mills theory (like electromagnetism) is renormalizable because the coupling is dimensionless. Here, κ is dimension -1. So for renormalizability, the dimension of the coupling should be ≥0. Because higher dimension operators are non-renormalizable.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In four dimensions, a coupling constant's mass dimension d must satisfy d ≥ 0 for the theory to be renormalizable. Because each term in the Lagrangian must have [term] =4, and the coupling is part of that term. For example, a term like g φ^4 would have [g] =4 -4*[φ]. If phi is a scalar, [φ] is 1, so [g] must be 0. If the coupling were negative, like [g]=-1, then the term would have [g φ^4] = (-1) +4*(1)=3, which is less than 4. So you can't have such a term in the Lagrangian because the Lagrangian terms must be dimension 4. So in our case, our term is already dimension 4 because the coupling is -1 and the other terms make up the rest. So the Lagrangian is okay, but the coupling's dimension is negative.

Wait, but wait. The interaction term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4. So in this case, since [κ]=-1 and the rest of the term contributes +5, the total is 4. So the term is okay. But the question is whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizable theories require that all the coupling constants have positive mass dimensions? Or that their dimension is ≥0.

Wait, no. The condition for renormalizability is that the interaction terms have mass dimension ≤4. Each term in the Lagrangian must be of dimension 4. So as long as the Lagrangian terms are dimension 4, the theory is renormalizable. But that's not quite true because in higher loops, you might need more terms, but I think the key is whether the interaction terms are renormalizable, which depends on their dimension.

Wait, but another approach: The dimension of the coupling tells you the superficial degree of divergence. For a term with coupling dimension d, the superficial degree is (4 - d). So if d <4, the term is superficially divergent, requiring counterterms. But for renormalizability, the theory can only have terms with d ≥0. Because if d is negative, then the coupling becomes relevant, but I think that actually, the condition is that the coupling's dimension must be ≥0 for the theory to be renormalizable.

Wait, no. Let me think. The coupling dimension d is given by [κ] = d. The term in the Lagrangian has dimension 4. So, the term is L = κ O, where O has dimension (4 - d). For the term to be renormalizable, O must have dimension ≤4. Because if O has dimension higher than 4, the term itself wouldn't be allowed in a renormalizable theory.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. The coupling's dimension determines whether the interaction is relevant, marginal, or irrelevant. In four dimensions, if the coupling has dimension d, then:

- d >0: marginal (if d=0), relevant (if d>0), but wait, no. Wait, I think I'm getting confused with the terminology. Let me recall:

In 4D, the dimension of the coupling g in a term g φ^n is [g] =4 -n*(mass dimension of φ). For the theory to be renormalizable, [g] ≥0, so 4 -n [φ] ≥0. Since [φ] depends on the type of field. For scalar φ, [φ]=1, so 4 -n ≥0 → n ≤4. So for a φ^4 term, n=4, [g]=0. Which is renormalizable.

In our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's compute the mass dimension of each field. ψ has [ψ]=3/2, as before. F has [F]=2. So the term is κ (ψ̄ σ ψ) F.

Wait, but the term is not a product of fields; it's a product of fields and a coupling. Let's think about the Feynman diagrams. Each vertex comes from the term, and each vertex contributes a factor of κ. The superficial degree of divergence is given by D = 4 - (sum of the dimensions of the fields at the vertex). So for each vertex, the sum of the dimensions:

ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So sum is 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 5. So D =4 -5= -1.

Wait, that's the superficial degree of divergence. But wait, wait: each vertex contributes a factor of κ, which has dimension -1. So each vertex effectively contributes a factor of κ (dim -1) multiplied by other factors.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The superficial degree of divergence formula for a Feynman diagram is D = (4 - (sum of [fields])) ) * L + sum ( (n_i) [g_i] ), where L is the number of loops. But perhaps for the superficial degree, it's simpler: D = (4 - (sum of fields)) ) * L. But including the coupling constants.

Alternatively, I've heard that the superficial degree of divergence is D=4L - (E_p (p) + ... ), but maybe it's better to consider the formula for the superficial degree of divergence for a given diagram.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that for a renormalizable theory, all the superficial degrees of divergence must be non-positive for all loops. Or that each diagram is superficially convergent.

Wait, no. For a theory to be renormalizable, the superficial degree of divergence must be ≤ 0 for all 1PI diagrams. Because if D>0, the diagram is divergent and requires a counterterm that's not present in the original Lagrangian, implying the theory isn't renormalizable.

So, for our term, each vertex has a coupling κ with dimension -1. Let's compute the superficial degree of divergence for a diagram with L loops, V vertices, and I internal lines (which for a gauge theory might complicate things, but perhaps we can ignore that for now).

Each vertex contributes a term of dimension [κ] = -1. So each vertex contributes -1 to the superficial degree.

Wait, no. Wait, how does the superficial degree work? The formula is D = 4L - (sum over each field's dimension times their number in the diagram).

Alternatively, another approach: The superficial degree of divergence is given by D=4 - (sum of the dimensions of all the fields in the vertex factor) multiplied by the number of vertices, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the power counting. Each vertex in the Feynman diagram corresponds to the interaction term. The interaction term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Each vertex has three fermion lines (two ψ, one ψ̄) and two boson lines (since F^{μν} is a field, perhaps it's antisymmetric, but that's maybe a detail). Wait, no, F is a field, but in the term, it's a single F. So each vertex would have two fermion lines (in and out) and one F line.

Wait, no, the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each vertex is a trilinear or something else? Wait, ψ̄ is a Dirac spinor, ψ is another, and F is a field. So, each vertex would have two fermion lines (in and out) and two boson lines? Or maybe it's a three-point vertex: two fermions and one boson. Because the term is ψ̄ ψ F. So each vertex would connect two fermion lines and one boson line.

So, the vertex has three legs: two fermions (ψ̄ and ψ) and one boson (F). So, in terms of superficial degree of divergence for a diagram with V vertices, each contributing a factor of κ, which has dimension -1. So the total contribution from the vertices is V * [κ] = V*(-1).

Each loop contributes a factor of 4 (since each loop integrates over d^4k, which has dimension 4). So the total superficial degree is D = 4L - (sum of the dimensions of the fields in the diagram).

The sum of the fields' dimensions would be for each fermion propagator (which is dimension 3/2 each), each boson propagator (dimension 1 for a photon, but wait, F is the field strength. Wait, the field A has dimension 1, so F = ∂A has dimension 2. So the propagator for F would be something like 1/(k²), which is dimension -2. Hmm, but perhaps I'm complicating things. Maybe it's better to think about each external leg as contributing their field's dimension, and each internal line (propagator) as contributing their field's dimension as well. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just think about the superficial degree of divergence formula for a vertex.

Wait, another approach: each vertex comes with a factor of dimension [κ] = -1. Each loop contributes 4 dimensions. Each internal line (fermion or boson) contributes a certain dimension based on their field type.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the superficial degree for a simple diagram, like a tree-level diagram. For a tree diagram, L=0. So D =4*0 - (sum of field dimensions) + V* [κ].

Wait, but the formula I recall is D=4L - (sum of the dimensions of the fields in the diagram) + V*(dimension of the coupling). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is D = (4 - (sum of field dimensions in the term)) * V + 4L.

Wait, each vertex is associated with a certain number of fields. So, for each vertex, the fields are two ψ, one ψ̄, and one F. So each vertex contributes (3/2 +3/2 +2) = 5 dimensions. So each vertex's field contribution is 5. So for V vertices, the field contribution is 5V.

Then, each vertex contributes [κ] = -1, so the coupling's contribution is -V.

The loop's contribution is 4L, because each loop is an integral over d^4k, which is dimension 4.

So the superficial degree D is 4L -5V + (-V) = 4L -6V.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because the term in the Lagrangian is dimension 4, so for each vertex, the term is κ * something with dimension 5. So the vertex contributes a factor of dimension -1 (since [κ]=-1 and the other factors are 5, making the total 4 for the Lagrangian term).

Wait, perhaps the formula is D = 4L - (sum of [fields in propagators and vertices]).

Alternatively, maybe I should instead use the formula D = dim(Lagrangian term) - (sum of dim(fields in vertices)).

But I think I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach. Since the coupling has [κ]=-1, which is negative, the interaction is of higher dimension, meaning the term is non-renormalizable. Because in four dimensions, terms with couplings of negative mass dimension are non-renormalizable.

Wait, that makes sense. Because a dimensionless coupling (d=0) is renormalizable, a coupling with d>0 is super-renormalizable, and d<0 is non-renormalizable.

So since [κ]=-1 <0, the term is non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. The term in the Lagrangian is dimension 4 because [κ]=-1 and the rest of the term contributes +5. So the term is allowed, but the coupling's dimension being negative indicates that the interaction is non-renormalizable.

So the theory (the Lagrangian given) is non-renormalizable.

So looking back at the options:

Options:

A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable → No, because [κ]=-1 suggests non-ren.

B) [κ]=1, ren → No, because [κ] is -1.

C) [κ]=-1, not ren → Yes.

D) [κ]=1, not ren → No.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$
Each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions. Breaking down the components:
- The spinor fields $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$ each have mass dimension $3/2$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension 2.
- The commutator $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless since it is constructed from $\gamma$-matrices (which are dimensionless).

The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has the following total mass dimension:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = [\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = [\kappa] + 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian term must have mass dimension 4:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. This ensures that the interaction terms do not introduce higher-dimensional operators that cannot be counterbalanced in perturbation theory. In this case, the coupling constant $\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $-1$, which is negative. This indicates that the interaction term is non-renormalizable.

### Step 3: Analyzing the options
- **Option A**: Claims $[\kappa] = -1$ and the theory is renormalizable. This is incorrect because a coupling with $[\kappa] = -1$ implies the theory is non-renormalizable.
- **Option B**: Claims $[\kappa] = 1$ and the theory is renormalizable. This is incorrect because the calculated mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, not $1$.
- **Option C**: Claims $[\kappa] = -1$ and the theory is not renormalizable. This is correct, as the negative mass dimension of $\kappa$ confirms the non-renormalizability of the theory.
- **Option D**: Claims $[\kappa] = 1$ and the theory is not renormalizable. This is incorrect because the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is not $1$.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. 

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this question about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through. The question gives a Lagrangian term L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that the mass dimension of the coupling constant affects whether the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, renormalizable theories require that the coupling constants have positive mass dimension, right? Because that way, the interactions don't get stronger at higher energies. Or wait, no. Wait, I think the condition is that the coupling has a mass dimension less than or equal to 4, because in four spacetime dimensions, the action must be dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So, the Lagrangian is in four dimensions. Each term in the Lagrangian (like L_int here) must have mass dimension 4. Because the action is the integral of the Lagrangian, which in 4D has dimension 4, making the action dimensionless.

So, each term in L must have [L] = 4. So, for L_int, which is given, I need to find the mass dimension of κ.

Let me break down each part of the term.

First, ψ is a spinor. What's the mass dimension of a spinor in 4D? Well, in the Standard Model, fermions like the electron have mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation has derivatives which are dimension 1, so the kinetic term is ψ̄ iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which is [ψ̄] + [ψ] + 1 = [ψ̄] + [ψ] = 1 (since the derivative is dimension 1). Wait, no: each ψ is dimension 3/2 because the term is [ψ̄] = [ψ] = 3/2. Because the Dirac term is [ψ̄] [i γ ∂ ψ] which is (3/2 + 3/2) + 1 = 4. Yeah, right.

So [ψ̄] = [ψ] = 3/2 each.

Next, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices γ are dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is just a product of γ matrices and thus is dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}] = 0.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is made from the derivatives of the gauge field A. So F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. Each derivative is dimension 1, and A is a vector potential, which has mass dimension 1. Because the gauge field kinetic term is (1/4) F² → [F]^2 must be [Lagrangian] which is 4. So [F] is sqrt(4) → 2. But wait, no. Because the term is F^2, so ( [F]^2 ) = [Lagrangian] → [F]^2 = 4 → [F] = 2. So each F^{μν} has dimension 2.

So putting it all together. The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let me compute the mass dimension of each part:

κ is the coupling, which is what we're trying to find.

Each ψ̄ and ψ is 3/2, so together that's 3.

σ_{μν} is 0, so that doesn't contribute.

F^{μν} is 2.

So the entire term: [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] + 5.

Wait, no. Wait, when you multiply terms, their dimensions add. So the term is κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F. So the dimension is [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F].

Wait, [ψ̄ σ ψ] is [ψ̄][σ][ψ] = (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) = 3.

[F] is 2.

So the entire term is [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] + 5.

But the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So:

[kappa] + 5 = 4 → [kappa] = 4 -5 = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check.

Wait, the term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let's think about each component's dimension.

ψ̄ has 3/2, F^{μν} has 2. What about σ_{μν}? Since it's made of gamma matrices (which are dimensionless) and derivatives? Wait no, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is a commutator of gamma matrices. Gamma matrices are dimensionless, so σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So no derivatives involved in σ; it's constructed from gammas only. So [σ_{μν}]=0.

So the term ψ̄ σ ψ is [ψ̄][ψ] + [σ] = 3/2 +3/2 + 0 =3.

Then, F^{μν} is 2. So the product (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F is 3 + 2 =5.

So the entire term is κ multiplied by that, so [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=-1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizable theories require that the coupling has a mass dimension ≤ (4 - [Lagrangian term dimension]). Wait, no, more accurately, each coupling's dimension must be such that the term is renormalizable, which depends on the interaction term's dimension.

Wait, another approach: in four dimensions, a renormalizable interaction term must have mass dimension ≤4. So each coupling's dimension must be ≤4.

Wait, but I think the condition is that the coupling's dimension must be ≥0. Because, for a term in the Lagrangian, the interaction term must have dimension 4. So our term is a dimension 4 term, which is okay.

But wait, wait. The mass dimension of the coupling is [κ]=-1. The Yang-Mills theory (like electromagnetism) is renormalizable because the coupling is dimensionless. Here, κ is dimension -1. So for renormalizability, the dimension of the coupling should be ≥0. Because higher dimension operators are non-renormalizable.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In four dimensions, a coupling constant's mass dimension d must satisfy d ≥ 0 for the theory to be renormalizable. Because each term in the Lagrangian must have [term] =4, and the coupling is part of that term. For example, a term like g φ^4 would have [g] =4 -4*[φ]. If phi is a scalar, [φ] is 1, so [g] must be 0. If the coupling were negative, like [g]=-1, then the term would have [g φ^4] = (-1) +4*(1)=3, which is less than 4. So you can't have such a term in the Lagrangian because the Lagrangian terms must be dimension 4. So in our case, our term is already dimension 4 because the coupling is -1 and the other terms make up the rest. So the Lagrangian is okay, but the coupling's dimension is negative.

Wait, but wait. The interaction term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4. So in this case, since [κ]=-1 and the rest of the term contributes +5, the total is 4. So the term is okay. But the question is whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizable theories require that all the coupling constants have positive mass dimensions? Or that their dimension is ≥0.

Wait, no. The condition for renormalizability is that the interaction terms have mass dimension ≤4. Each term in the Lagrangian must be of dimension 4. So as long as the Lagrangian terms are dimension 4, the theory is renormalizable. But that's not quite true because in higher loops, you might need more terms, but I think the key is whether the interaction terms are renormalizable, which depends on their dimension.

Wait, but another approach: The dimension of the coupling tells you the superficial degree of divergence. For a term with coupling dimension d, the superficial degree is (4 - d). So if d <4, the term is superficially divergent, requiring counterterms. But for renormalizability, the theory can only have terms with d ≥0. Because if d is negative, then the coupling becomes relevant, but I think that actually, the condition is that the coupling's dimension must be ≥0 for the theory to be renormalizable.

Wait, no. Let me think. The coupling dimension d is given by [κ] = d. The term in the Lagrangian has dimension 4. So, the term is L = κ O, where O has dimension (4 - d). For the term to be renormalizable, O must have dimension ≤4. Because if O has dimension higher than 4, the term itself wouldn't be allowed in a renormalizable theory.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. The coupling's dimension determines whether the interaction is relevant, marginal, or irrelevant. In four dimensions, if the coupling has dimension d, then:

- d >0: marginal (if d=0), relevant (if d>0), but wait, no. Wait, I think I'm getting confused with the terminology. Let me recall:

In 4D, the dimension of the coupling g in a term g φ^n is [g] =4 -n*(mass dimension of φ). For the theory to be renormalizable, [g] ≥0, so 4 -n [φ] ≥0. Since [φ] depends on the type of field. For scalar φ, [φ]=1, so 4 -n ≥0 → n ≤4. So for a φ^4 term, n=4, [g]=0. Which is renormalizable.

In our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's compute the mass dimension of each field. ψ has [ψ]=3/2, as before. F has [F]=2. So the term is κ (ψ̄ σ ψ) F.

Wait, but the term is not a product of fields; it's a product of fields and a coupling. Let's think about the Feynman diagrams. Each vertex comes from the term, and each vertex contributes a factor of κ. The superficial degree of divergence is given by D = 4 - (sum of the dimensions of the fields at the vertex). So for each vertex, the sum of the dimensions:

ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So sum is 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 5. So D =4 -5= -1.

Wait, that's the superficial degree of divergence. But wait, wait: each vertex contributes a factor of κ, which has dimension -1. So each vertex effectively contributes a factor of κ (dim -1) multiplied by other factors.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The superficial degree of divergence formula for a Feynman diagram is D = (4 - (sum of [fields])) ) * L + sum ( (n_i) [g_i] ), where L is the number of loops. But perhaps for the superficial degree, it's simpler: D = (4 - (sum of fields)) ) * L. But including the coupling constants.

Alternatively, I've heard that the superficial degree of divergence is D=4L - (E_p (p) + ... ), but maybe it's better to consider the formula for the superficial degree of divergence for a given diagram.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that for a renormalizable theory, all the superficial degrees of divergence must be non-positive for all loops. Or that each diagram is superficially convergent.

Wait, no. For a theory to be renormalizable, the superficial degree of divergence must be ≤ 0 for all 1PI diagrams. Because if D>0, the diagram is divergent and requires a counterterm that's not present in the original Lagrangian, implying the theory isn't renormalizable.

So, for our term, each vertex has a coupling κ with dimension -1. Let's compute the superficial degree of divergence for a diagram with L loops, V vertices, and I internal lines (which for a gauge theory might complicate things, but perhaps we can ignore that for now).

Each vertex contributes a term of dimension [κ] = -1. So each vertex contributes -1 to the superficial degree.

Wait, no. Wait, how does the superficial degree work? The formula is D = 4L - (sum over each field's dimension times their number in the diagram).

Alternatively, another approach: The superficial degree of divergence is given by D=4 - (sum of the dimensions of all the fields in the vertex factor) multiplied by the number of vertices, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the power counting. Each vertex in the Feynman diagram corresponds to the interaction term. The interaction term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Each vertex has three fermion lines (two ψ, one ψ̄) and two boson lines (since F^{μν} is a field, perhaps it's antisymmetric, but that's maybe a detail). Wait, no, F is a field, but in the term, it's a single F. So each vertex would have two fermion lines (in and out) and one F line.

Wait, no, the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each vertex is a trilinear or something else? Wait, ψ̄ is a Dirac spinor, ψ is another, and F is a field. So, each vertex would have two fermion lines (in and out) and two boson lines? Or maybe it's a three-point vertex: two fermions and one boson. Because the term is ψ̄ ψ F. So each vertex would connect two fermion lines and one boson line.

So, the vertex has three legs: two fermions (ψ̄ and ψ) and one boson (F). So, in terms of superficial degree of divergence for a diagram with V vertices, each contributing a factor of κ, which has dimension -1. So the total contribution from the vertices is V * [κ] = V*(-1).

Each loop contributes a factor of 4 (since each loop integrates over d^4k, which has dimension 4). So the total superficial degree is D = 4L - (sum of the dimensions of the fields in the diagram).

The sum of the fields' dimensions would be for each fermion propagator (which is dimension 3/2 each), each boson propagator (dimension 1 for a photon, but wait, F is the field strength. Wait, the field A has dimension 1, so F = ∂A has dimension 2. So the propagator for F would be something like 1/(k²), which is dimension -2. Hmm, but perhaps I'm complicating things. Maybe it's better to think about each external leg as contributing their field's dimension, and each internal line (propagator) as contributing their field's dimension as well. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just think about the superficial degree of divergence formula for a vertex.

Wait, another approach: each vertex comes with a factor of dimension [κ] = -1. Each loop contributes 4 dimensions. Each internal line (fermion or boson) contributes a certain dimension based on their field type.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the superficial degree for a simple diagram, like a tree-level diagram. For a tree diagram, L=0. So D =4*0 - (sum of field dimensions) + V* [κ].

Wait, but the formula I recall is D=4L - (sum of the dimensions of the fields in the diagram) + V*(dimension of the coupling). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is D = (4 - (sum of field dimensions in the term)) * V + 4L.

Wait, each vertex is associated with a certain number of fields. So, for each vertex, the fields are two ψ, one ψ̄, and one F. So each vertex contributes (3/2 +3/2 +2) = 5 dimensions. So each vertex's field contribution is 5. So for V vertices, the field contribution is 5V.

Then, each vertex contributes [κ] = -1, so the coupling's contribution is -V.

The loop's contribution is 4L, because each loop is an integral over d^4k, which is dimension 4.

So the superficial degree D is 4L -5V + (-V) = 4L -6V.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because the term in the Lagrangian is dimension 4, so for each vertex, the term is κ * something with dimension 5. So the vertex contributes a factor of dimension -1 (since [κ]=-1 and the other factors are 5, making the total 4 for the Lagrangian term).

Wait, perhaps the formula is D = 4L - (sum of [fields in propagators and vertices]).

Alternatively, maybe I should instead use the formula D = dim(Lagrangian term) - (sum of dim(fields in vertices)).

But I think I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach. Since the coupling has [κ]=-1, which is negative, the interaction is of higher dimension, meaning the term is non-renormalizable. Because in four dimensions, terms with couplings of negative mass dimension are non-renormalizable.

Wait, that makes sense. Because a dimensionless coupling (d=0) is renormalizable, a coupling with d>0 is super-renormalizable, and d<0 is non-renormalizable.

So since [κ]=-1 <0, the term is non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. The term in the Lagrangian is dimension 4 because [κ]=-1 and the rest of the term contributes +5. So the term is allowed, but the coupling's dimension being negative indicates that the interaction is non-renormalizable.

So the theory (the Lagrangian given) is non-renormalizable.

So looking back at the options:

Options:

A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable → No, because [κ]=-1 suggests non-ren.

B) [κ]=1, ren → No, because [κ] is -1.

C) [κ]=-1, not ren → Yes.

D) [κ]=1, not ren → No.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$
Each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions. Breaking down the components:
- The spinor fields $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$ each have mass dimension $3/2$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension 2.
- The commutator $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless since it is constructed from $\gamma$-matrices (which are dimensionless).

The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has the following total mass dimension:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = [\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = [\kappa] + 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian term must have mass dimension 4:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. This ensures that the interaction terms do not introduce higher-dimensional operators that cannot be counterbalanced in perturbation theory. In this case, the coupling constant $\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $-1$, which is negative. This indicates that the interaction term is non-renormalizable.

### Step 3: Analyzing the options
- **Option A**: Claims $[\kappa] = -1$ and the theory is renormalizable. This is incorrect because a coupling with $[\kappa] = -1$ implies the theory is non-renormalizable.
- **Option B**: Claims $[\kappa] = 1$ and the theory is renormalizable. This is incorrect because the calculated mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, not $1$.
- **Option C**: Claims $[\kappa] = -1$ and the theory is not renormalizable. This is correct, as the negative mass dimension of $\kappa$ confirms the non-renormalizability of the theory.
- **Option D**: Claims $[\kappa] = 1$ and the theory is not renormalizable. This is incorrect because the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is not $1$.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
