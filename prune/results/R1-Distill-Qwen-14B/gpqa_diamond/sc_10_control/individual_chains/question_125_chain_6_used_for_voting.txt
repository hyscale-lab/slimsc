Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2)m ω² r². That potential looks familiar—it's the harmonic oscillator potential. So the particle is undergoing a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator.

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue. Then I have to choose the correct option from A to D.

Hmm, let me think about the energy levels first. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

In three dimensions, the energy levels can be given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω, where n_x, n_y, n_z are the quantum numbers for each direction (each being a non-negative integer: 0,1,2,...). Alternatively, this can be written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So n is the total number of quanta in all three directions.

Wait, another way to look at it: the energy levels are (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers. So each energy level depends on the value of n.

Now, the ground state is the lowest energy, which corresponds to n=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z = 0). Then, the first excited state would be n=1, the second excited state n=2, the third excited state n=3, and so on. Wait, no—that's not quite right. The number of excited states is based on how many quanta you have beyond the ground state. Oh, wait, no: the first excited state is the next higher energy level, which is n=1. So the ground state is n=0 (third excited state?), or is the ground state considered the 0th excited state? Let me clarify.

In quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy state, which is the first state, and excited states are higher than that. So the ground state would correspond to n=0. The first excited state is n=1, second n=2, third n=3, etc.

So if the question is about the third excited state, that would be n=3. Because the ground state is 0, first excited is 1, second is 2, third is 3.

So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Let me compute that: 3 is 6/2, so 6/2 +3/2 is 9/2. So E = (9/2) ħω.

Now, for the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions have this energy? That is, how many distinct combinations of (n_x, n_y, n_z) sum to n=3?

Each quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z can be 0,1,2,..., such that their sum is 3. So we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z =3.

This is a combinatorics problem. The number of ways to distribute 3 quanta among 3 directions. The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions is (n + k -1 choose k -1), where n is the total, and k is the number of variables. Here, n=3, k=3.

So that gives (3 + 3 -1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So there are 10 different eigenfunctions for n=3.

Wait, but are there any symmetry considerations? For example, in 3D harmonic oscillator, eigenfunctions with the same energy but different distributions (like different permutations of n_x, n_y, n_z) are linearly independent. So each unique combination counts as a distinct eigenfunction.

Yes, so for n=3, there are 10 eigenfunctions.

Looking at the options, option A says (9/2) ħ ω, 10. That matches. Option C has 3 eigenfunctions, which is wrong. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, let me make sure. Let me double-check the energy expression. The energy is given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω. For n=3, E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Yep, that's correct.

So the answer should be A.

The problem involves a particle of mass \( m \) moving in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are quantized and given by \( E = (n + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega \), where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the total number of quanta, and \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are the quantum numbers in the three spatial directions. These quantum numbers are non-negative integers.

The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second excited state to \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( n = 3 \). For \( n = 3 \), the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\omega = \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega.
\]

Next, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to \( n = 3 \) is determined by the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \). This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of solutions is given by the formula:

\[
\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1},
\]

where \( n = 3 \) is the total quanta, and \( k = 3 \) is the number of variables (directions). Substituting, we find:

\[
\binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for \( n = 3 \).

From the given options, the correct choice is:

**A) \( \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega, 10 \).**

Wait, another way to look at it: the energy levels are (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers. So each energy level depends on the value of n.

Now, the ground state is the lowest energy, which corresponds to n=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z = 0). Then, the first excited state would be n=1, the second excited state n=2, the third excited state n=3, and so on. Wait, no—that's not quite right. The number of excited states is based on how many quanta you have beyond the ground state. Oh, wait, no: the first excited state is the next higher energy level, which is n=1.

So if the question is about the third excited state, that would be n=3. Because the ground state is 0, first excited is 1, second is 2, third is 3.

So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Let me compute that: 3 is 6/2, so 6/2 +3/2 is 9/2. So E = (9/2) ħω.

Now, for the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions have this energy? That is, how many distinct combinations of (n_x, n_y, n_z) sum to n=3?

Each quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z can be 0,1,2,..., such that their sum is 3. So we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z =3.

This is a combinatorics problem. The number of ways to distribute 3 quanta among 3 directions. The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions is (n + k -1 choose k -1), where n is the total, and k is the number of variables. Here, n=3, k=3.

So that gives (3 + 3 -1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So there are 10 different eigenfunctions for n=3.

Wait, but are there any symmetry considerations? For example, in 3D harmonic oscillator, eigenfunctions with the same energy but different distributions (like different permutations of n_x, n_y, n_z) are linearly independent. So each unique combination counts as a distinct eigenfunction.

Yes, so for n=3, there are 10 eigenfunctions.

Looking at the options, option A says (9/2) ħ ω, 10. That matches. Option C has 3 eigenfunctions, which is wrong. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, let me make sure. Let me double-check the energy expression. The energy is given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω. For n=3, E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Yep, that's correct.

So the answer should be A.


The problem involves a particle of mass \( m \) moving in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are quantized and given by \( E = (n + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\omega \), where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the total number of quanta, and \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are the quantum numbers in the three spatial directions. These quantum numbers are non-negative integers.

The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second excited state to \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( n = 3 \). For \( n = 3 \), the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\omega = \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega.
\]

Next, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to \( n = 3 \) is determined by the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \). This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of solutions is given by the formula:

\[
\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1},
\]

where \( n = 3 \) is the total quanta, and \( k = 3 \) is the number of variables (directions). Substituting, we find:

\[
\binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for \( n = 3 \).

From the given options, the correct choice is:

**A) \( \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega, 10 \).**
