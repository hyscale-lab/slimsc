Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question involves reactions with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions.

The problem says there are two reactions: Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) and a chiral one. The question is about how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Hmm, so first, I think I need to figure out what each reaction produces. Let me recall: when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene. For (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene, how does that work?

Wait, (E)-oct-4-ene is trans, and (Z) is cis. When mCPBA adds across the double bond, it forms an epoxide. I remember that mCPBA adds in a way that the oxygen atoms add to opposite faces, leading to a trans epoxide. Or does it form a cyclic transition state where the stereochemistry is retained?

Wait, no, maybe it's more about the diastereomer formation. Oh wait, no, when an alkene is treated with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene? Or does it form a specific diastereomer based on the configuration?

Wait, no. Let me think again. For epoxidation, the mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the peracid approaches from the same face, leading to a cis addition. So, the resulting epoxide can have different stereochemistry depending on the starting alkene's configuration.

Wait, no, the starting alkene's configuration (E or Z) affects the product's stereochemistry. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the reaction mechanism.

Epoxidation typically occurs via an electrocyclic opening. Wait, no, more accurately, it's a concerted process where the peracid attacks the alkene, adding an oxygen across the double bond. The addition is such that the oxygen atoms add to opposite faces, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide ring.

Wait, no, perhaps that's incorrect. The mechanism forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So if the starting alkene is E (trans), the epoxide would have the same trans arrangement. But wait, no, that can't be right because the epoxide is a three-membered ring, so the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the starting alkenes. (E)-oct-4-ene has the two methyl groups (on C4 and C5, perhaps) on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide where the oxygen adds across the double bond. For each starting (E) and (Z), the epoxide formed will have different stereochemistry.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's say we have (E)-oct-4-ene. The structure is CH2CH2 in the middle, but for E, the substituents on each end of the double bond are opposite. So when mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide. The mCPBA adds the oxygen atoms to the same face. So for (E) and (Z) starting alkenes, the epoxide's stereochemistry changes.

Wait, no, perhaps the addition of mCPBA leads to the formation of an epoxide where the two new oxygen bonds are on opposite faces, leading to a trans epoxide relative to the starting alkene's configuration.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the product. When mCPBA is used on a trans-alkene, like (E)-oct-4-ene, the product epoxide will have the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides. Or maybe it's the same configuration as the starting alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a trans epoxide because the oxygen adds from the same face, leading to a cis addition. Wait, yes, the peracid adds across the double bond in a cis fashion, so the resulting epoxide would have the two new oxygen atoms on the same side of the ring. So the configuration of the starting alkene affects whether the epoxide has cis or trans stereochemistry.

Wait, for example, if the starting alkene is (E), which is trans, then the epoxide will form with the oxygen atoms in a cis arrangement. But wait, the original substituents (like the substituents on C4 and C5) are trans. So adding the oxygen in a cis fashion leads to a particular stereochemistry in the epoxide.

Wait, maybe I should consider each reaction separately.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA. Epoxidation occurs, forming an epoxide. Then treated with aqueous acid. Wait, what happens when an epoxide is treated with aqueous acid?

Epoxides under acidic conditions undergo ring-opening reactions. The acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. The nucleophile (water, in this case) attacks the more substituted carbon, leading to ring opening. But wait, the ring-opening can lead to different products depending on the structure.

Wait, in the case of symmetric epoxides, like those derived from symmetric alkenes, the ring-opening would give the same product regardless of which side the nucleophile attacks.

Wait, in this case, the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z)-oct-4-ene. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, which is CH2CH2 in the middle? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between C4 and C5. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 with substituents on either end.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structures mentally. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between C4 and C5. For (E), the substituents on C4 and C5 are on opposite sides, and for (Z), they are on the same side.

After epoxidation, the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms connected across the former double bond. Now, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide would undergo ring-opening. Let's think about the possible products.

Wait, the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene: after mCPBA treatment, it's an epoxide. Then, under acidic conditions, it would form a diol. The ring-opening of the epoxide under acid conditions typically gives a trans-diol, because the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon from the opposite side of the protonated oxygen.

Wait, but wait, the epoxide's structure determines the diol's structure. Let me think: the epoxide is a three-membered ring, and when it opens, the nucleophile (water) attacks the less hindered carbon. But without knowing the specific structure, perhaps I can think of the symmetry.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 with four CH2 groups on each end. So the epoxide would be a 4,5-epoxyoctane. So when you open it with acid, it would form a 4,5-diol. But the stereochemistry of the diol depends on the starting epoxide's structure.

Wait, but since the starting alkenes are E and Z, the epoxides would have different configurations, leading to different diols.

Wait, but let me think: (E)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide, and upon acid treatment, would form a diol with a certain stereochemistry. Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene would form a different epoxide and hence a different diol.

Wait, but perhaps they form the same diol? Or different diols?

Wait, let me clarify. For (E)-oct-4-ene: the double bond is trans. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are on the same face (since mCPBA adds in a syn addition). So the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms cis with respect to each other.

Wait, no: mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the two new oxygen atoms are added syn, meaning on the same face. So the epoxide's structure depends on the starting alkeneâ€™s configuration.

Wait, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are on opposite sides. So when mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds to the same face, leading to an epoxide where the two new bonds are on the same face. So in the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would form with the oxygen atoms on the same face, but because the starting alkene is trans, the substituents (like CH2CH2CH2CH3 on each end) are on opposite sides of the epoxide ring.

Hmm, perhaps it's getting complicated, but the key point is that the epoxide from the (E) and (Z) alkenes would have different configurations, leading to different diols after acid treatment.

Wait, but when the epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, it forms a diol. The ring opens with the attack of water on the more substituted carbon (since in acid, the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon, but in this case, both carbons are equally substituted since it's oct-4-ene, so perhaps both are similar. So the attack can be on either carbon, leading to possible diastereomers.

Wait, no, in a symmetric epoxide, the attack would lead to a single product because both carbons are the same. But wait, if the epoxide is not symmetric, then perhaps different products form.

Wait, but oct-4-ene is symmetric around the double bond. So the epoxide would be symmetric as well. So when the epoxide ring opens, it would form a diol with two adjacent stereocenters, but because the molecule is symmetric, perhaps the diol is meso.

Wait, okay, let me think about this more clearly. Suppose we have (E)-oct-4-ene, which is symmetric. When mCPBA adds, the epoxide would also be symmetric. Then, when treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. Because the molecule is symmetric, the diol would have two stereocenters but in a meso form, meaning it's a single compound.

Similarly, if (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, the epoxide would also be symmetric, leading to a diol that's also a meso compound. Wait, but wait: are the diols from (E) and (Z) alkenes different? Or the same?

Wait, no. Because the epoxide's configuration would differ based on the starting alkene's E or Z configuration. Let me imagine the structures.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is trans. After epoxidation with mCPBA, the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms added on the same face. So when you look at the epoxide, the two CH2CH2 groups (from C4 and C5) are on opposite sides of the ring. Then, upon ring-opening with acid, the two new hydroxyl groups would be on opposite sides, leading to a trans diol.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the ring-opening. Let me think about the epoxide as a three-membered ring. When the acid protonates the oxygen, it becomes a better leaving group. Water attacks the more substituted carbon (which, in this case, both carbons are the same), so attack can happen from either face.

Wait, but because the epoxide is symmetric, the attack can happen from either face, but the product would be the same due to the molecule's symmetry. So for each epoxide (from E and Z), the diol formed would be a single compound, but perhaps different between the two epoxides.

Wait, maybe the key point is whether the diol from each epoxide is the same or different. Alternatively, perhaps each epoxide leads to a different diol.

Wait, let's think about the (E) and (Z) alkenes. (E)-oct-4-ene is trans, so when mCPBA adds, the epoxide's groups are arranged in a certain way. When it opens, the diol's stereochemistry would be different compared to the diol from the (Z) epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps both epoxides lead to the same diol. Hmm, that's possible if the diastereomers are identical due to symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let's imagine the products.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxide â†’ diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxide â†’ diol.

After both reactions, the products are combined. What are the possible products?

Wait, maybe each reaction produces a diol with a certain configuration. Let's say Reaction 1 produces a diol with a specific stereoisomer, and Reaction 2 produces another stereoisomer.

Wait, but if (E) and (Z) epoxides lead to diastereomeric diols, then combining them would give a mixture of two diastereomers. But wait, maybe each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers, leading to multiple peaks in the HPLC.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a racemic mixture, but when combined, they form certain products.

Wait, no. Let's think again. mCPBA adds to the double bond, but since the starting alkenes are E and Z, the epoxides would have different configurations. Then, upon acid treatment, each epoxide would open to form a diol.

Wait, the acid treatment of epoxides typically leads to trans diols because the nucleophile attacks the less substituted carbon from the opposite side of the protonated oxygen. But in symmetric epoxides, perhaps the diol is a meso compound.

Wait, for example, in the case of cyclohexene oxide (a symmetric epoxide), treatment with acid gives a trans-diol, which is a single compound because the molecule is symmetric. So in that case, the diol is a single product, not a mix.

If oct-4-ene is symmetric, then the epoxide would be symmetric as well. So when it opens, the diol would be a meso compound, meaning a single product with two stereocenters but overall achiral.

Wait, but wait: the starting alkene is (E) or (Z), which are different. So the epoxides from (E) and (Z) would have different configurations, right?

Wait, perhaps the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene would have a different configuration than the one from (Z), leading to different diols upon acid treatment.

Wait, no, because if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would be a single product regardless of the starting alkene's configuration. Hmm, maybe not.

Let me think about the specific structures. (E)-oct-4-ene has groups on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds to the same face, leading to an epoxide where the substituents (like the CH2CH2 groups) are on the same face. But wait, noâ€”because the starting alkene is trans, the substituents are on opposite sides.

So in the epoxide, the substituents would be on adjacent positions, but their arrangement would be such that the epoxide is either cis or trans?

Wait, perhaps the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene is trans, meaning the two substituents (CH2CH2CH2CH3 groups) are on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. Then, upon acid treatment, the diol would form with the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides as well.

But wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would be a meso compound, which is achiral.

Similarly, the epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene would have substituents on the same side of the ring, leading to a different diol configuration.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then perhaps the diol from either (E) or (Z) would be the same, leading to the same product.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should consider that each reaction (E and Z) leads to the same diol.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the starting alkenes are different. So perhaps each reaction leads to a different diol.

Wait, let me think about the possible products. Let's say Reaction 1 (E) gives a diol with a certain configuration, and Reaction 2 (Z) gives another.

When you combine both products, you have two different diols. Each of these diols could be chiral, leading to multiple peaks in the chiral HPLC.

Wait, but maybe each diol is a pair of enantiomers, but that would depend on whether the diol has a chiral center.

Wait, the diol would have two adjacent stereocenters. If they're identical (like a meso compound), it's achiral. If they're different, then it could be chiral.

So for each reaction, the diol product would have two adjacent -OH groups, each on a stereocenter. If those stereocenters are the same, it's a meso compound; if different, it's a chiral molecule.

Wait, but in the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, perhaps the diol is a meso compound, while in (Z), it's a chiral diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction leads to a diol that is a pair of enantiomers, but in that case, they would be achiral in the HPLC if the column is achiral.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline possible outcomes.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxide â†’ acid â†’ diol (product A)
Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxide â†’ acid â†’ diol (product B)

Are product A and B the same or different?

If they're different, then when combined, the mixture has two diastereomers. Each diastereomer can have their own enantiomers, but if the diastereomers are enantiomers themselves, then the mixture could have multiple peaks.

Wait, perhaps each diol is a new compound with two stereocenters. Let me consider that:

Product A from (E)-epoxide: maybe a meso compound (if the two stereocenters are identical, leading to an achiral molecule).

Product B from (Z)-epoxide: maybe a non-meso compound, with two different stereocenters, making it a chiral molecule.

So, the products would be: a meso compound (A) and a pair of enantiomers (B and its mirror image).

Wait, but wait: if product B is a chiral diol, then it would exist as a racemic mixture if the epoxide ring-opening is symmetric. Or perhaps, since the starting epoxide is not symmetric, the ring-opening leads to a single enantiomer?

Wait, no, because the epoxide is derived from (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is symmetric. So when the epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. Because the epoxide is symmetric, the attack would lead to a single product, but whether it's a meso compound or a chiral one depends on the configuration.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a diol that is a pair of enantiomers. But when the starting material is a single enantiomer (E or Z), perhaps the product is a racemic mixture.

Wait, but the initial alkenes, (E) and (Z), are themselves achiral. Because in (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are on opposite sides, but the molecule is symmetric along the double bond, so it's not chiral.

Wait, (E) and (Z) alkenes are themselves achiral. Because for (Z), the substituents are on the same side, but the molecule is symmetric when looking along the double bond.

So when mCPBA adds, the product epoxide would be either an epoxide that is meso or not.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene is a meso compound, meaning it's achiral. So when it's treated with acid, the diol formed would be a meso compound, which is achiral.

Similarly, the epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene would be a non-meso compound, leading to a chiral diol.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think again.

(E)-oct-4-ene is trans. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen atoms are added on the same face, leading to an epoxide where the substituents (like CH2CH2CH2CH3) are on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. So the epoxide would be a meso compound, making it achiral.

When this meso epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. Because the starting epoxide is achiral, the diol would also be achiral, possibly a meso compound.

On the other hand, (Z)-oct-4-ene is cis. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen atoms are added on the same face, leading to an epoxide where the substituents are on the same side. So the epoxide would be a non-meso compound, hence chiral.

Then, when this epoxide is treated with acid, it would form a diol that is chiral. Depending on the attack direction, perhaps it forms a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but wait: if the epoxide is chiral, then the ring-opening under acidic conditions could lead to a racemic mixture of diols. Or maybe it leads to a single enantiomer.

Wait, no, when the epoxide is chiral, and the ring-opening occurs under acidic conditions, the nucleophile can attack either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But if the epoxide is a single enantiomer, then the attack could be more favored on one face, but in our case, since the epoxide is derived from a single starting material (Z), which is symmetric, perhaps the epoxide is a meso compound. Or is it?

Wait, no. If (Z)-oct-4-ene is symmetric, then the epoxide would also be symmetric, making it a meso compound. But wait, for (Z)-ene, the substituents are on the same side, but the molecule is symmetric. So the epoxide would have substituents on the same side, but since the molecule is symmetric, it would be a meso compound, hence achiral.

Wait, that can't be right because the substituents are on the same side. Hmm.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think about the possible products.

If both reactions produce the same diol, then when combined, there's only one product. But if each reaction produces a different diol, then combining them gives two diols.

Wait, but the question says that both reactions go to 100% completion, so each reaction produces a single product.

So, in the first reaction, (E)-oct-4-ene â†’ product 1.

Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene â†’ product 2.

So, what are product 1 and product 2?

If product 1 is a meso diol (achiral), and product 2 is a different meso diol, then when combined, they would each be a single compound, leading to two peaks on the achiral HPLC, and perhaps more on the chiral column.

But wait, maybe each product is a pair of enantiomers, but if the products are achiral, then on the chiral column, they would elute as one peak. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction leads to a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but if the starting material is symmetric, like (E) and (Z)-oct-4-ene, the products would be meso, leading to achiral diols. So each reaction produces a single achiral product.

In that case, when you combine the products of Reaction 1 and Reaction 2, you have two different achiral diols. So, on the standard (achiral) HPLC, each would elute as a single peak, leading to two peaks in total.

On a chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, but since the compounds are achiral, they would each elute as a single peak. So again, two peaks.

Wait, but that would suggest that the answer is option C: 2 peaks in both HPLC.

But wait, maybe each reaction produces two products, each of which is a pair of enantiomers, leading to four peaks in total.

Wait, no. Because each reaction produces a single product, as each goes to 100% completion. So, combining the two products would give two different compounds.

But if each compound is a pair of enantiomers, meaning each is a racemic mixture, then on a chiral column, each would split into two peaks. So, two compounds Ã— two enantiomers each = four peaks on the chiral HPLC, and two peaks on the achiral.

But wait, no. Because if the products are achiral (meso), then they would not split on the chiral column. So each would be a single peak, giving two peaks on both columns.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Suppose Reaction 1 (E) â†’ meso diol (achiral). Reaction 2 (Z) â†’ another meso diol (achiral). So, combining them gives two achiral diols. On the standard HPLC, each would be a single peak, so two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC, since the compounds are achiral, they would each elute as a single peak. So again, two peaks.

Therefore, standard HPLC shows two peaks, chiral HPLC shows two peaks. So the answer would be option C.

But wait, wait. What if each reaction produces two enantiomers, making each a racemic mixture. Then, when you combine them, you have two racemic mixtures.

In that case, on the standard HPLC (achiral), each racemic mixture would appear as a single peak, so two peaks in total.

On the chiral HPLC, each racemic mixture would split into two peaks, so two compounds Ã— two enantiomers = four peaks.

But that would make the standard HPLC show two peaks, chiral shows four. So the answer would be option D: 3 and 4 peaks? Wait, no, looking back at the options, the options for standard and chiral are given.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC

B) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC

C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC

D) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.

So, if the combined products are two achiral diols, then the standard HPLC shows two peaks, and the chiral HPLC also shows two peaks. So option C.

But earlier, I thought that each reaction produces a single product. But perhaps each reaction leads to two products.

Wait, no, because each reaction goes to 100% completion. So each reaction produces a single product, which is either a pair of enantiomers (if the product is chiral) or a single compound (if it's meso).

Wait, if the products are meso, then each reaction gives a single compound, so combining them gives two compounds.

But if each product is a pair of enantiomers, then each reaction gives a racemic mixture, which is a single compound, so combining gives two compounds (each being a racemic mixture). 

In that case, on standard HPLC, each racemic mixture is a single peak, so two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, each racemic mixture would split into two peaks, leading to four peaks (two for each product), but that's not possible because if you have two racemic mixtures, each would split into two peaks, giving a total of four peaks.

Wait, but the problem states that the products are combined. So, if each reaction produces a racemic mixture, combining them would give a 50:50 mixture of two different diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: reaction 1 produces a racemic mixture (two enantiomers) of diol A. Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture of diol B. Then, combining them gives a mixture with diols A and B, each as racemic.

On achiral HPLC, each diol would be a single peak, so two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, each racemic mixture would split into two peaks. So diol A gives two peaks, diol B gives two peaks. So total of four peaks.

But wait, the options don't have four peaks for chiral, but option D says the standard shows 3 and chiral 4. Hmm, perhaps there's another scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction leads to two different diols, each of which is a pair of enantiomers. Thus, four diastereomers, but I think that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps each reaction leads to a single diol, which itself is a pair of enantiomers. So, two diols, each as a racemic mixture.

So, on standard HPLC: two peaks (each diol as a racemic mixture).

On chiral HPLC: each diol would split into two peaks, so 2 Ã— 2 = 4 peaks.

So, the standard HPLC would show 2 peaks, chiral shows 4 peaks.

Looking at the options, option D says 3 in standard and 4 in chiral, which doesn't match this scenario. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe each reaction leads to a diol that is a pair of enantiomers, but when you combine the two reactions, you have four peaks.

But in that case, the standard HPLC would show two peaks (each diol as a racemic), and the chiral HPLC would show four peaks (each diol split into two).

Hmm, but the question says that both reactions go to 100% completion, so each reaction gives a single product. So, if each product is a racemic mixture, each reaction would give a single peak on the standard HPLC but two peaks on the chiral.

Wait, but that would mean that reaction 1 gives product A as racemic, and reaction 2 gives product B as racemic. So when combined, the mixture has product A (racemic) and B (racemic). On standard HPLC: each product is a single peak, so two peaks. On chiral HPLC: each racemic splits into two, so four peaks.

But none of the options match that. Option D says standard has 3 and chiral 4. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a diol that is a new chiral center, leading to four possible stereoisomers in total.

Wait, no. Let me think about the possible diols. Suppose each diol has two stereocenters.

If the diol is meso, it's achiral. If it's not meso, it's chiral.

So, Reaction 1: E â†’ meso diol (achiral). Reaction 2: Z â†’ non-meso diol (chiral).

Wait, but if reaction 2's product is chiral, it would form a pair of enantiomers, so a racemic mixture.

So, when you combine the products of both reactions, you have:

From Reaction 1: meso diol (single peak on both columns).

From Reaction 2: racemic mixture of chiral diol (two peaks on chiral, one peak on standard).

So, on standard HPLC: two peaks (meso and racemic as single peak).

On chiral HPLC: three peaks (meso is a single peak, racemic splits into two).

Wait, no. Because racemic mixture on chiral column would split into two. Meso is a single peak.

So, standard HPLC: two peaks (each product is a single compound).

Chiral HPLC: three peaks: meso (1 peak), and the two enantiomers from Reaction 2's product (2 peaks). So total of three peaks.

Hmm, but that would fit option B: standard has 2, chiral has 3.

But wait, how would that happen?

Reaction 1: meso diol (achiral) â†’ 1 peak on standard, 1 peak on chiral.

Reaction 2: racemic mixture of a chiral diol â†’ on standard, it's a single peak. On chiral, it's two peaks.

When combined, standard has two peaks (meso and racemic as single peak).

Chiral has three peaks: meso (1), and two from the racemic.

So, the answer would be 2 peaks on standard and 3 on chiral, which is option B.

But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, but reaction 2's product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. So, on the chiral column, it would split into two peaks.

So, combining reaction 1 (meso, 1 peak) and reaction 2 (racemic, 2 peaks on chiral), total on chiral is 3 peaks.

On standard, reaction 1 and reaction 2 each contribute one peak, so two peaks.

So option B is correct: standard 2, chiral 3.

But earlier, I thought that each reaction would produce a single product. So the products would be two compounds, but if one is a racemic and the other is meso, leading to three peaks on chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the product configurations.

Wait, perhaps Reaction 1 produces a meso diol (achiral) and Reaction 2 produces a different diol (chiral), which is a single enantiomer. But that's not possible if the reaction goes to 100% completion, because the ring-opening of a chiral epoxide under acidic conditions would lead to a racemic mixture.

Hmm, perhaps my confusion arises from not knowing whether the diol is meso or chiral.

Let me try to think of a specific example. Take (E)-2-pentene and (Z)-2-pentene.

Epoxidation of (E)-2-pentene would give a trans epoxide, which is a meso compound. Acid treatment would give a trans diol, which is a meso compound.

Epoxidation of (Z)-2-pentene would give a cis epoxide, which is a non-meso compound. Acid treatment would give a diol with two adjacent stereocenters, which is chiral.

So, in this case, Reaction 1 (E) gives a meso diol (achiral), Reaction 2 (Z) gives a racemic mixture of a chiral diol.

So when combined, the mixture contains:

- Meso diol (1 compound, achiral) â†’ 1 peak on standard, 1 peak on chiral.

- Racemic mixture of chiral diol (2 compounds, enantiomers) â†’ 1 peak on standard, 2 peaks on chiral.

Thus, standard HPLC: 2 peaks (meso and racemic as a single peak).

Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks (meso, and the two enantiomers).

So the correct answer would be option B: 2 peaks in standard, 3 in chiral.

But the options don't include that. Wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 4,4

B) 2,3

C) 2,2

D)3,4

So option B is 2 peaks in standard and 3 in chiral.

So the answer would be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The goal is to determine the number of peaks observed in the standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC chromatograms of the combined products.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**  
   - (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene.  
   - mCPBA adds across the double bond in a syn fashion, forming a meso epoxide due to the symmetry of the starting material.  
   - Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the meso epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a meso diol (achiral).  
   - **Product 1**: A single achiral diol.

2. **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**  
   - (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene.  
   - mCPBA adds across the double bond in a syn fashion, forming a non-meso epoxide.  
   - Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the non-meso epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a chiral diol.  
   - The reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers of the chiral diol.  
   - **Product 2**: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers.

3. **Combining the Products**  
   - The combined products include:  
     - Product 1: A single achiral meso diol.  
     - Product 2: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers of a chiral diol.  

4. **HPLC Analysis**  
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**:  
     - The achiral meso diol (Product 1) appears as a single peak.  
     - The racemic mixture of the chiral diol (Product 2) appears as a single peak because achiral columns cannot resolve enantiomers.  
     - **Total Peaks**: 2.  

   - **Chiral HPLC**:  
     - The achiral meso diol (Product 1) appears as a single peak.  
     - The racemic mixture of the chiral diol (Product 2) splits into two peaks corresponding to the two enantiomers.  
     - **Total Peaks**: 3.  

### Conclusion:  
The standard HPLC shows 2 peaks, and the chiral HPLC shows 3 peaks. This matches **Option B**.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question involves reactions with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions.

The problem says there are two reactions: Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) and a chiral one. The question is about how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Hmm, so first, I think I need to figure out what each reaction produces. Let me recall: when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene. For (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene, how does that work?

Wait, (E)-oct-4-ene is trans, and (Z) is cis. When mCPBA adds across the double bond, it forms an epoxide. I remember that mCPBA adds in a way that the oxygen atoms add to opposite faces, leading to a trans epoxide. Or does it form a cyclic transition state where the stereochemistry is retained?

Wait, no, maybe it's more about the diastereomer formation. Oh wait, no, when an alkene is treated with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene? Or does it form a specific diastereomer based on the configuration?

Wait, no. Let me think again. For epoxidation, the mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the peracid approaches from the same face, leading to a cis addition. So, the resulting epoxide can have different stereochemistry depending on the starting alkene's configuration.

Wait, no, the starting alkene's configuration (E or Z) affects the product's stereochemistry. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the reaction mechanism.

Epoxidation typically occurs via an electrocyclic opening. Wait, no, more accurately, it's a concerted process where the peracid attacks the alkene, adding an oxygen across the double bond. The addition is such that the oxygen atoms add to opposite faces, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide ring.

Wait, no, perhaps that's incorrect. The mechanism forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So if the starting alkene is E (trans), the epoxide would have the same trans arrangement. But wait, no, that can't be right because the epoxide is a three-membered ring, so the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the starting alkenes. (E)-oct-4-ene has the two methyl groups (on C4 and C5, perhaps) on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide where the oxygen adds across the double bond. For each starting (E) and (Z), the epoxide formed will have different stereochemistry.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's say we have (E)-oct-4-ene. The structure is CH2CH2 in the middle, but for E, the substituents on each end of the double bond are opposite. So when mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide. The mCPBA adds the oxygen atoms to the same face. So for (E) and (Z) starting alkenes, the epoxide's stereochemistry changes.

Wait, no, perhaps the addition of mCPBA leads to the formation of an epoxide where the two new oxygen bonds are on opposite faces, leading to a trans epoxide relative to the starting alkene's configuration.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the product. When mCPBA is used on a trans-alkene, like (E)-oct-4-ene, the product epoxide will have the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides. Or maybe it's the same configuration as the starting alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a trans epoxide because the oxygen adds from the same face, leading to a cis addition. Wait, yes, the peracid adds across the double bond in a cis fashion, so the resulting epoxide would have the two new oxygen atoms on the same side of the ring. So the configuration of the starting alkene affects whether the epoxide has cis or trans stereochemistry.

Wait, for example, if the starting alkene is (E), which is trans, then the epoxide will form with the oxygen atoms in a cis arrangement. But wait, the original substituents (like the substituents on C4 and C5) are trans. So adding the oxygen in a cis fashion leads to a particular stereochemistry in the epoxide.

Wait, maybe I should consider each reaction separately.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA. Epoxidation occurs, forming an epoxide. Then treated with aqueous acid. Wait, what happens when an epoxide is treated with aqueous acid?

Epoxides under acidic conditions undergo ring-opening reactions. The acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. The nucleophile (water, in this case) attacks the more substituted carbon, leading to ring opening. But wait, the ring-opening can lead to different products depending on the structure.

Wait, in the case of symmetric epoxides, like those derived from symmetric alkenes, the ring-opening would give the same product regardless of which side the nucleophile attacks.

Wait, in this case, the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z)-oct-4-ene. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, which is CH2CH2 in the middle? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between C4 and C5. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 with substituents on either end.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structures mentally. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between C4 and C5. For (E), the substituents on C4 and C5 are on opposite sides, and for (Z), they are on the same side.

After epoxidation, the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms connected across the former double bond. Now, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide would undergo ring-opening. Let's think about the possible products.

Wait, the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene: after mCPBA treatment, it's an epoxide. Then, under acidic conditions, it would form a diol. The ring-opening of the epoxide under acid conditions typically gives a trans-diol, because the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon from the opposite side of the protonated oxygen.

Wait, but wait, the epoxide's structure determines the diol's structure. Let me think: the epoxide is a three-membered ring, and when it opens, the nucleophile (water) attacks the less hindered carbon. But without knowing the specific structure, perhaps I can think of the symmetry.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 with four CH2 groups on each end. So the epoxide would be a 4,5-epoxyoctane. So when you open it with acid, it would form a 4,5-diol. But the stereochemistry of the diol depends on the starting epoxide's structure.

Wait, but since the starting alkenes are E and Z, the epoxides would have different configurations, leading to different diols.

Wait, but let me think: (E)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide, and upon acid treatment, would form a diol with a certain stereochemistry. Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene would form a different epoxide and hence a different diol.

Wait, but perhaps they form the same diol? Or different diols?

Wait, let me clarify. For (E)-oct-4-ene: the double bond is trans. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are on the same face (since mCPBA adds in a syn addition). So the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms cis with respect to each other.

Wait, no: mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the two new oxygen atoms are added syn, meaning on the same face. So the epoxide's structure depends on the starting alkeneâ€™s configuration.

Wait, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are on opposite sides. So when mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds to the same face, leading to an epoxide where the two new bonds are on the same face. So in the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would form with the oxygen atoms on the same face, but because the starting alkene is trans, the substituents (like CH2CH2CH2CH3 on each end) are on opposite sides of the epoxide ring.

Hmm, perhaps it's getting complicated, but the key point is that the epoxide from the (E) and (Z) alkenes would have different configurations, leading to different diols after acid treatment.

Wait, but when the epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, it forms a diol. The ring opens with the attack of water on the more substituted carbon (since in acid, the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon, but in this case, both carbons are equally substituted since it's oct-4-ene, so perhaps both are similar. So the attack can be on either carbon, leading to possible diastereomers.

Wait, no, in a symmetric epoxide, the attack would lead to a single product because both carbons are the same. But wait, if the epoxide is not symmetric, then perhaps different products form.

Wait, but oct-4-ene is symmetric around the double bond. So the epoxide would be symmetric as well. So when the epoxide ring opens, it would form a diol with two adjacent stereocenters, but because the molecule is symmetric, perhaps the diol is meso.

Wait, okay, let me think about this more clearly. Suppose we have (E)-oct-4-ene, which is symmetric. When mCPBA adds, the epoxide would also be symmetric. Then, when treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. Because the molecule is symmetric, the diol would have two stereocenters but in a meso form, meaning it's a single compound.

Similarly, if (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, the epoxide would also be symmetric, leading to a diol that's also a meso compound. Wait, but wait: are the diols from (E) and (Z) alkenes different? Or the same?

Wait, no. Because the epoxide's configuration would differ based on the starting alkene's E or Z configuration. Let me imagine the structures.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is trans. After epoxidation with mCPBA, the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms added on the same face. So when you look at the epoxide, the two CH2CH2 groups (from C4 and C5) are on opposite sides of the ring. Then, upon ring-opening with acid, the two new hydroxyl groups would be on opposite sides, leading to a trans diol.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the ring-opening. Let me think about the epoxide as a three-membered ring. When the acid protonates the oxygen, it becomes a better leaving group. Water attacks the more substituted carbon (which, in this case, both carbons are the same), so attack can happen from either face.

Wait, but because the epoxide is symmetric, the attack can happen from either face, but the product would be the same due to the molecule's symmetry. So for each epoxide (from E and Z), the diol formed would be a single compound, but perhaps different between the two epoxides.

Wait, maybe the key point is whether the diol from each epoxide is the same or different. Alternatively, perhaps each epoxide leads to a different diol.

Wait, let's think about the (E) and (Z) alkenes. (E)-oct-4-ene is trans, so when mCPBA adds, the epoxide's groups are arranged in a certain way. When it opens, the diol's stereochemistry would be different compared to the diol from the (Z) epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps both epoxides lead to the same diol. Hmm, that's possible if the diastereomers are identical due to symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let's imagine the products.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxide â†’ diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxide â†’ diol.

After both reactions, the products are combined. What are the possible products?

Wait, maybe each reaction produces a diol with a certain configuration. Let's say Reaction 1 produces a diol with a specific stereoisomer, and Reaction 2 produces another stereoisomer.

Wait, but if (E) and (Z) epoxides lead to diastereomeric diols, then combining them would give a mixture of two diastereomers. But wait, maybe each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers, leading to multiple peaks in the HPLC.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a racemic mixture, but when combined, they form certain products.

Wait, no. Let's think again. mCPBA adds to the double bond, but since the starting alkenes are E and Z, the epoxides would have different configurations. Then, upon acid treatment, each epoxide would open to form a diol.

Wait, the acid treatment of epoxides typically leads to trans diols because the nucleophile attacks the less substituted carbon from the opposite side of the protonated oxygen. But in symmetric epoxides, perhaps the diol is a meso compound.

Wait, for example, in the case of cyclohexene oxide (a symmetric epoxide), treatment with acid gives a trans-diol, which is a single compound because the molecule is symmetric. So in that case, the diol is a single product, not a mix.

If oct-4-ene is symmetric, then the epoxide would be symmetric as well. So when it opens, the diol would be a meso compound, meaning a single product with two stereocenters but overall achiral.

Wait, but wait: the starting alkene is (E) or (Z), which are different. So the epoxides from (E) and (Z) would have different configurations, right?

Wait, perhaps the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene would have a different configuration than the one from (Z), leading to different diols upon acid treatment.

Wait, no, because if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would be a single product regardless of the starting alkene's configuration. Hmm, maybe not.

Let me think about the specific structures. (E)-oct-4-ene has groups on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds to the same face, leading to an epoxide where the substituents (like the CH2CH2 groups) are on the same face. But wait, noâ€”because the starting alkene is trans, the substituents are on opposite sides.

So in the epoxide, the substituents would be on adjacent positions, but their arrangement would be such that the epoxide is either cis or trans?

Wait, perhaps the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene is trans, meaning the two substituents (CH2CH2CH2CH3 groups) are on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. Then, upon acid treatment, the diol would form with the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides as well.

But wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would be a meso compound, which is achiral.

Similarly, the epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene would have substituents on the same side of the ring, leading to a different diol configuration.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then perhaps the diol from either (E) or (Z) would be the same, leading to the same product.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should consider that each reaction (E and Z) leads to the same diol.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the starting alkenes are different. So perhaps each reaction leads to a different diol.

Wait, let me think about the possible products. Let's say Reaction 1 (E) gives a diol with a certain configuration, and Reaction 2 (Z) gives another.

When you combine both products, you have two different diols. Each of these diols could be chiral, leading to multiple peaks in the chiral HPLC.

Wait, but maybe each diol is a pair of enantiomers, but that would depend on whether the diol has a chiral center.

Wait, the diol would have two adjacent stereocenters. If they're identical (like a meso compound), it's achiral. If they're different, then it could be chiral.

So for each reaction, the diol product would have two adjacent -OH groups, each on a stereocenter. If those stereocenters are the same, it's a meso compound; if different, it's a chiral molecule.

Wait, but in the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, perhaps the diol is a meso compound, while in (Z), it's a chiral diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction leads to a diol that is a pair of enantiomers, but in that case, they would be achiral in the HPLC if the column is achiral.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline possible outcomes.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxide â†’ acid â†’ diol (product A)
Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxide â†’ acid â†’ diol (product B)

Are product A and B the same or different?

If they're different, then when combined, the mixture has two diastereomers. Each diastereomer can have their own enantiomers, but if the diastereomers are enantiomers themselves, then the mixture could have multiple peaks.

Wait, perhaps each diol is a new compound with two stereocenters. Let me consider that:

Product A from (E)-epoxide: maybe a meso compound (if the two stereocenters are identical, leading to an achiral molecule).

Product B from (Z)-epoxide: maybe a non-meso compound, with two different stereocenters, making it a chiral molecule.

So, the products would be: a meso compound (A) and a pair of enantiomers (B and its mirror image).

Wait, but wait: if product B is a chiral diol, then it would exist as a racemic mixture if the epoxide ring-opening is symmetric. Or perhaps, since the starting epoxide is not symmetric, the ring-opening leads to a single enantiomer?

Wait, no, because the epoxide is derived from (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is symmetric. So when the epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. Because the epoxide is symmetric, the attack would lead to a single product, but whether it's a meso compound or a chiral one depends on the configuration.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a diol that is a pair of enantiomers. But when the starting material is a single enantiomer (E or Z), perhaps the product is a racemic mixture.

Wait, but the initial alkenes, (E) and (Z), are themselves achiral. Because in (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are on opposite sides, but the molecule is symmetric along the double bond, so it's not chiral.

Wait, (E) and (Z) alkenes are themselves achiral. Because for (Z), the substituents are on the same side, but the molecule is symmetric when looking along the double bond.

So when mCPBA adds, the product epoxide would be either an epoxide that is meso or not.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene is a meso compound, meaning it's achiral. So when it's treated with acid, the diol formed would be a meso compound, which is achiral.

Similarly, the epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene would be a non-meso compound, leading to a chiral diol.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think again.

(E)-oct-4-ene is trans. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen atoms are added on the same face, leading to an epoxide where the substituents (like CH2CH2CH2CH3) are on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. So the epoxide would be a meso compound, making it achiral.

When this meso epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. Because the starting epoxide is achiral, the diol would also be achiral, possibly a meso compound.

On the other hand, (Z)-oct-4-ene is cis. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen atoms are added on the same face, leading to an epoxide where the substituents are on the same side. So the epoxide would be a non-meso compound, hence chiral.

Then, when this epoxide is treated with acid, it would form a diol that is chiral. Depending on the attack direction, perhaps it forms a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but wait: if the epoxide is chiral, then the ring-opening under acidic conditions could lead to a racemic mixture of diols. Or maybe it leads to a single enantiomer.

Wait, no, when the epoxide is chiral, and the ring-opening occurs under acidic conditions, the nucleophile can attack either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But if the epoxide is a single enantiomer, then the attack could be more favored on one face, but in our case, since the epoxide is derived from a single starting material (Z), which is symmetric, perhaps the epoxide is a meso compound. Or is it?

Wait, no. If (Z)-oct-4-ene is symmetric, then the epoxide would also be symmetric, making it a meso compound. But wait, for (Z)-ene, the substituents are on the same side, but the molecule is symmetric. So the epoxide would have substituents on the same side, but since the molecule is symmetric, it would be a meso compound, hence achiral.

Wait, that can't be right because the substituents are on the same side. Hmm.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think about the possible products.

If both reactions produce the same diol, then when combined, there's only one product. But if each reaction produces a different diol, then combining them gives two diols.

Wait, but the question says that both reactions go to 100% completion, so each reaction produces a single product.

So, in the first reaction, (E)-oct-4-ene â†’ product 1.

Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene â†’ product 2.

So, what are product 1 and product 2?

If product 1 is a meso diol (achiral), and product 2 is a different meso diol, then when combined, they would each be a single compound, leading to two peaks on the achiral HPLC, and perhaps more on the chiral column.

But wait, maybe each product is a pair of enantiomers, but if the products are achiral, then on the chiral column, they would elute as one peak. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction leads to a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but if the starting material is symmetric, like (E) and (Z)-oct-4-ene, the products would be meso, leading to achiral diols. So each reaction produces a single achiral product.

In that case, when you combine the products of Reaction 1 and Reaction 2, you have two different achiral diols. So, on the standard (achiral) HPLC, each would elute as a single peak, leading to two peaks in total.

On a chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, but since the compounds are achiral, they would each elute as a single peak. So again, two peaks.

Wait, but that would suggest that the answer is option C: 2 peaks in both HPLC.

But wait, maybe each reaction produces two products, each of which is a pair of enantiomers, leading to four peaks in total.

Wait, no. Because each reaction produces a single product, as each goes to 100% completion. So, combining the two products would give two different compounds.

But if each compound is a pair of enantiomers, meaning each is a racemic mixture, then on a chiral column, each would split into two peaks. So, two compounds Ã— two enantiomers each = four peaks on the chiral HPLC, and two peaks on the achiral.

But wait, no. Because if the products are achiral (meso), then they would not split on the chiral column. So each would be a single peak, giving two peaks on both columns.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Suppose Reaction 1 (E) â†’ meso diol (achiral). Reaction 2 (Z) â†’ another meso diol (achiral). So, combining them gives two achiral diols. On the standard HPLC, each would be a single peak, so two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC, since the compounds are achiral, they would each elute as a single peak. So again, two peaks.

Therefore, standard HPLC shows two peaks, chiral HPLC shows two peaks. So the answer would be option C.

But wait, wait. What if each reaction produces two enantiomers, making each a racemic mixture. Then, when you combine them, you have two racemic mixtures.

In that case, on the standard HPLC (achiral), each racemic mixture would appear as a single peak, so two peaks in total.

On the chiral HPLC, each racemic mixture would split into two peaks, so two compounds Ã— two enantiomers = four peaks.

But that would make the standard HPLC show two peaks, chiral shows four. So the answer would be option D: 3 and 4 peaks? Wait, no, looking back at the options, the options for standard and chiral are given.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC

B) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC

C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC

D) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.

So, if the combined products are two achiral diols, then the standard HPLC shows two peaks, and the chiral HPLC also shows two peaks. So option C.

But earlier, I thought that each reaction produces a single product. But perhaps each reaction leads to two products.

Wait, no, because each reaction goes to 100% completion. So each reaction produces a single product, which is either a pair of enantiomers (if the product is chiral) or a single compound (if it's meso).

Wait, if the products are meso, then each reaction gives a single compound, so combining them gives two compounds.

But if each product is a pair of enantiomers, then each reaction gives a racemic mixture, which is a single compound, so combining gives two compounds (each being a racemic mixture). 

In that case, on standard HPLC, each racemic mixture is a single peak, so two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, each racemic mixture would split into two peaks, leading to four peaks (two for each product), but that's not possible because if you have two racemic mixtures, each would split into two peaks, giving a total of four peaks.

Wait, but the problem states that the products are combined. So, if each reaction produces a racemic mixture, combining them would give a 50:50 mixture of two different diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: reaction 1 produces a racemic mixture (two enantiomers) of diol A. Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture of diol B. Then, combining them gives a mixture with diols A and B, each as racemic.

On achiral HPLC, each diol would be a single peak, so two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, each racemic mixture would split into two peaks. So diol A gives two peaks, diol B gives two peaks. So total of four peaks.

But wait, the options don't have four peaks for chiral, but option D says the standard shows 3 and chiral 4. Hmm, perhaps there's another scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction leads to two different diols, each of which is a pair of enantiomers. Thus, four diastereomers, but I think that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps each reaction leads to a single diol, which itself is a pair of enantiomers. So, two diols, each as a racemic mixture.

So, on standard HPLC: two peaks (each diol as a racemic mixture).

On chiral HPLC: each diol would split into two peaks, so 2 Ã— 2 = 4 peaks.

So, the standard HPLC would show 2 peaks, chiral shows 4 peaks.

Looking at the options, option D says 3 in standard and 4 in chiral, which doesn't match this scenario. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe each reaction leads to a diol that is a pair of enantiomers, but when you combine the two reactions, you have four peaks.

But in that case, the standard HPLC would show two peaks (each diol as a racemic), and the chiral HPLC would show four peaks (each diol split into two).

Hmm, but the question says that both reactions go to 100% completion, so each reaction gives a single product. So, if each product is a racemic mixture, each reaction would give a single peak on the standard HPLC but two peaks on the chiral.

Wait, but that would mean that reaction 1 gives product A as racemic, and reaction 2 gives product B as racemic. So when combined, the mixture has product A (racemic) and B (racemic). On standard HPLC: each product is a single peak, so two peaks. On chiral HPLC: each racemic splits into two, so four peaks.

But none of the options match that. Option D says standard has 3 and chiral 4. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a diol that is a new chiral center, leading to four possible stereoisomers in total.

Wait, no. Let me think about the possible diols. Suppose each diol has two stereocenters.

If the diol is meso, it's achiral. If it's not meso, it's chiral.

So, Reaction 1: E â†’ meso diol (achiral). Reaction 2: Z â†’ non-meso diol (chiral).

Wait, but if reaction 2's product is chiral, it would form a pair of enantiomers, so a racemic mixture.

So, when you combine the products of both reactions, you have:

From Reaction 1: meso diol (single peak on both columns).

From Reaction 2: racemic mixture of chiral diol (two peaks on chiral, one peak on standard).

So, on standard HPLC: two peaks (meso and racemic as single peak).

On chiral HPLC: three peaks (meso is a single peak, racemic splits into two).

Wait, no. Because racemic mixture on chiral column would split into two. Meso is a single peak.

So, standard HPLC: two peaks (each product is a single compound).

Chiral HPLC: three peaks: meso (1 peak), and the two enantiomers from Reaction 2's product (2 peaks). So total of three peaks.

Hmm, but that would fit option B: standard has 2, chiral has 3.

But wait, how would that happen?

Reaction 1: meso diol (achiral) â†’ 1 peak on standard, 1 peak on chiral.

Reaction 2: racemic mixture of a chiral diol â†’ on standard, it's a single peak. On chiral, it's two peaks.

When combined, standard has two peaks (meso and racemic as single peak).

Chiral has three peaks: meso (1), and two from the racemic.

So, the answer would be 2 peaks on standard and 3 on chiral, which is option B.

But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, but reaction 2's product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. So, on the chiral column, it would split into two peaks.

So, combining reaction 1 (meso, 1 peak) and reaction 2 (racemic, 2 peaks on chiral), total on chiral is 3 peaks.

On standard, reaction 1 and reaction 2 each contribute one peak, so two peaks.

So option B is correct: standard 2, chiral 3.

But earlier, I thought that each reaction would produce a single product. So the products would be two compounds, but if one is a racemic and the other is meso, leading to three peaks on chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the product configurations.

Wait, perhaps Reaction 1 produces a meso diol (achiral) and Reaction 2 produces a different diol (chiral), which is a single enantiomer. But that's not possible if the reaction goes to 100% completion, because the ring-opening of a chiral epoxide under acidic conditions would lead to a racemic mixture.

Hmm, perhaps my confusion arises from not knowing whether the diol is meso or chiral.

Let me try to think of a specific example. Take (E)-2-pentene and (Z)-2-pentene.

Epoxidation of (E)-2-pentene would give a trans epoxide, which is a meso compound. Acid treatment would give a trans diol, which is a meso compound.

Epoxidation of (Z)-2-pentene would give a cis epoxide, which is a non-meso compound. Acid treatment would give a diol with two adjacent stereocenters, which is chiral.

So, in this case, Reaction 1 (E) gives a meso diol (achiral), Reaction 2 (Z) gives a racemic mixture of a chiral diol.

So when combined, the mixture contains:

- Meso diol (1 compound, achiral) â†’ 1 peak on standard, 1 peak on chiral.

- Racemic mixture of chiral diol (2 compounds, enantiomers) â†’ 1 peak on standard, 2 peaks on chiral.

Thus, standard HPLC: 2 peaks (meso and racemic as a single peak).

Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks (meso, and the two enantiomers).

So the correct answer would be option B: 2 peaks in standard, 3 in chiral.

But the options don't include that. Wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 4,4

B) 2,3

C) 2,2

D)3,4

So option B is 2 peaks in standard and 3 in chiral.

So the answer would be option B.


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The goal is to determine the number of peaks observed in the standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC chromatograms of the combined products.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**  
   - (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene.  
   - mCPBA adds across the double bond in a syn fashion, forming a meso epoxide due to the symmetry of the starting material.  
   - Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the meso epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a meso diol (achiral).  
   - **Product 1**: A single achiral diol.

2. **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**  
   - (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene.  
   - mCPBA adds across the double bond in a syn fashion, forming a non-meso epoxide.  
   - Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the non-meso epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a chiral diol.  
   - The reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers of the chiral diol.  
   - **Product 2**: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers.

3. **Combining the Products**  
   - The combined products include:  
     - Product 1: A single achiral meso diol.  
     - Product 2: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers of a chiral diol.  

4. **HPLC Analysis**  
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**:  
     - The achiral meso diol (Product 1) appears as a single peak.  
     - The racemic mixture of the chiral diol (Product 2) appears as a single peak because achiral columns cannot resolve enantiomers.  
     - **Total Peaks**: 2.  

   - **Chiral HPLC**:  
     - The achiral meso diol (Product 1) appears as a single peak.  
     - The racemic mixture of the chiral diol (Product 2) splits into two peaks corresponding to the two enantiomers.  
     - **Total Peaks**: 3.  

### Conclusion:  
The standard HPLC shows 2 peaks, and the chiral HPLC shows 3 peaks. This matches **Option B**.
