Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene, and figuring out the correct sequence of reactions from the options given.

The target compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me draw that structure out mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (t-Bu), and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2).

Wait, wait. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. When numbering, the substituents are arranged in the order of their priority. But in this case, the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3. Wait, actually, the numbering is such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So I need to think about the structure correctly.

So the substituents are ethoxy (ethoxy group has low priority compared to nitro and t-Bu?), nitro is a strong activating group, but wait, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, 3. Let me consider the substituents.

Wait, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So in a meta arrangement? Or perhaps ortho and para? Wait, let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are on adjacent carbons. Let me think about the structure:

Imagine benzene with substituents on carbons 1, 2, and 3. So positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent each. Wait, but for a benzene ring, numbering can be a bit tricky.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of which substituents are where. Let's see, the substituents are ethoxy (OEt), t-Bu, and nitro (NO2). The positions are 1,2,3.

Wait, in the target molecule, the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3. So on adjacent positions: 1 is OEt, 2 is t-Bu, and 3 is NO2. Wait, but that might not be possible in a benzene ring because the numbering goes in a circle.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the substituents and see the order of reactions needed to attach them.

The substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. But wait, nitro is a meta-directing group, and ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. The tert-butyl is a bulky group, which is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group (since it's an alkyl group, but substituted with three methyl groups, so less activating than regular alkyl groups? Or maybe it's still activating? Wait, no. Alkyl groups are activating (they donate electrons through the inductive effect), but bulky. So tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So when adding substituents, the order in which they are added matters because each new substituent will influence the next reaction.

So, the plan is to start with benzene and add substituents in a way that each new group directs the next substitution appropriately.

Let me think about the substituents required: nitro, ethoxy, and tert-butyl. The target has them in positions 1, 2, and 3. So perhaps the substituents are arranged in a particular order that allows each step to proceed with the directing effects.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible steps in each option and see which one makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to approach this by considering the order of substitution reactions. Since benzene is the starting material, the first substituent will affect where the next substituent goes.

The target molecule has three substituents: OEt, t-Bu, and NO2. Let's think about which substituent is added first, second, and third.

But let me recall: when adding substituents, the order can influence the positions because each substitution directs the next.

So, for example, if I add a nitro group first, which is meta-directing, then the next substituent would be added in a meta position relative to nitro. Alternatively, if I add an activating group first, like ethoxy or t-Bu, the next substituents would be added in ortho or para positions relative to them.

Wait, but in the target, there are three substituents, so perhaps the order is to add the strongest director first, or the one that can control the positions better.

Wait, the target has nitro at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and t-Bu at 2. So perhaps the nitro is added first, then ethoxy, then t-Bu? Or some other order.

Wait, let's think: if we add nitro first, the ring would have a nitro group. Then, when adding the next substituent, say ethoxy, which is activating, it would be added in the ortho or para position relative to nitro. But nitro is meta-directing, so the next substituent would go meta to nitro. So, for benzene with nitro, adding ethoxy would be in the meta position relative to nitro.

Wait, but in the target molecule, nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, t-Bu at 2. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added first. So, benzene first becomes phenol, but wait, no, the first step is perhaps a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or something else.

Wait, the substituents can be added in various orders. Let me think about each option's steps. Let's look at the options.

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 (so Friedel-Crafts alkylation), then HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), then SO3/H2SO4 (maybe sulfonation?), then NaNO2/HCl (diazotization?), H2SO4 dilute, H3O+ and heat (hydrolysis?), Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration). Hmm, that seems complicated. The steps are too many, possibly multiple nitration steps.

Option B: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3, then nitration, then Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction step?), then nitration again, then diazotization, and so on. Hmm, perhaps adding more nitro groups but that's not desired.

Option C: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3, then sulfonation, nitration, Fe/HCl, diazotization, nitration again, and so on. Not sure.

Option D: i) Nitration first, then Fe/HCl, which is a catalyst for what? Oh, maybe a substitution, but Fe in HCl is often for reductions, like in the reduction of nitro groups. Then Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl, then nitration again, etc.

Wait, perhaps D's steps are: first nitrate (add NO2), then maybe reduce it? Or maybe something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add ethoxy first, then nitro, then the tert-butyl. Or another order.

Wait, let me think about the substituents.

Ethoxy (OEt) is an activating group, so directs incoming groups to ortho and para positions. Nitro is deactivating, meta-directing. t-Bu is activating, but bulky, so it would direct ortho and para, but perhaps the steric hindrance would cause more para addition? Or maybe ortho addition is difficult due to the bulk.

So, to get the substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3, perhaps the order of addition is ethoxy first, then nitro, then t-Bu.

Wait, let's imagine:

1. Start with benzene.

2. Add ethoxy group via nucleophilic substitution, but wait, benzene isn't nucleophilic. Oh, wait, ethoxy is an ether group. To add an ethoxy group, you can perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkyl halides attaching. Wait, but ethoxy group is an activating group, so maybe via an ether substitution. Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to have a nitration followed by something else.

Wait, no. Another approach: to get an ethoxy group on benzene, you can use a Williamson ether synthesis, but that typically requires an alkoxide attacking an alkyl halide. Alternatively, perhaps using a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I'm not sure that's the way.

Wait, perhaps using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's usually under strong conditions and requires a strong leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps first activating the ring with a nitration, but that would deactivate it.

Wait, wait, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a substitution reaction. For example, after nitration, perhaps a directing group is introduced, but that may complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acyl group, which is a meta director.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the substituent addition order.

The target has three substituents: OEt, t-Bu, NO2. Let's think in terms of which substituent is added when.

Suppose we add ethoxy first. Benzene + ethoxy group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation tends to form carbocations, which for ethyl might not be stable. Alternatively, maybe using a better alkylating agent like ethyl chloride with AlCl3 as catalyst. So first step: benzene + ethyl chloride, AlCl3 → ethylbenzene.

Wait, but ethyl group is an activating group, so next step would be to add another substituent. Let's say nitration. Where would nitration occur? Since ethyl is ortho/para directing, nitration would add nitro group in ortho or para positions. Then, the next substituent.

Wait, but the target has the nitro group in position 3. Let me try to visualize:

If benzene becomes ethylbenzene (ethyl at position 1), then nitration would add nitro group at ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) relative to ethyl.

Hmm, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3. So perhaps the order is to add the nitro group first, then the ethoxy, then the tert-butyl.

Wait, let's try that. First, nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.

Then, in nitrobenzene, the next substituent would be added. Since nitro is meta-directing, the next group would go meta to it.

So, if nitro is at position 1, the next substituent (say, ethoxy) would go to position 3 (meta). Then, the next substituent (t-Bu) would go where?

Wait, but the target has substituents at 1, 2, 3. So perhaps that's not the right order.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is added first. Let me try that path.

Benzene → ethylbenzene (via Friedel-Crafts). Then, the next substituent is nitro group. Since ethyl is ortho/para director, nitro would go in ortho or para to ethyl.

Assuming it goes ortho, so nitro at position 2. Then, the next substituent, say t-Bu, would be added. Since now the ring has ethyl at 1 and nitro at 2. The nitro group is a meta director, and ethyl is ortho/para. So where would the next substituent go? Hmm, perhaps the directing effect would be a mix, but the strongest director would be the one with higher priority.

Wait, substituent priority is usually based on their activating/deactivating nature. Nitro is deactivating and meta-directing, while ethyl is activating and ortho/para. So when both are present, the nitro group would exert a stronger influence because it's deactivating. So the next substituent would go meta to the nitro group.

If nitro is at position 2, then meta would be position 5. But that's not where we want the t-Bu. Alternatively, perhaps during the third substitution, the ethyl directs the t-Bu to an ortho or para position.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to think about the steps in each option and see which sequence correctly builds the target molecule.

Looking at the options, each option has a series of reactions. Let me try to parse each option's steps.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → benzene becomes t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Where would the nitro group go? Since t-Bu is activating and ortho/para directing, the nitro could go ortho or para. But t-Bu is bulky, so para is more likely.

So after step ii, structure is t-Bu at 1, NO2 at 4 (para).

Then step iii: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Sulfonating the ring would add a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). Where would it go? The ring now has t-Bu (activating, ortho/para) and NO2 (deactivating, meta). The strongest director is the nitro group, which is meta. So sulfonic acid would add meta to nitro, which is position 1 or 3. Wait, but t-Bu is already at 1, so position 3 would be available. So now we have t-Bu at 1, NO2 at 4, SO3H at 3.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. So this step might not be correct. So perhaps option A is not the right path.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me see the full steps.

Wait, the target has OEt, t-Bu, and NO2. So any step that adds another group (like SO3H) would be incorrect. So option A's step iii introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not in the target. So option A is probably wrong.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-Bu-benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. As before, nitro adds para to t-Bu.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction, but Fe in HCl is typically for something else. Or is it a catalyst for another reaction? Alternatively, perhaps it's a step to replace a nitro group into an amine? Wait, but nitro to amine is usually with H2 and a catalyst. Fe and HCl might be for something else, like a diazotization step.

Wait, step iv in option B is another nitration. So perhaps after the first nitration, another nitro group is added. But the target has only one nitro group. So this would be incorrect. So option B's steps probably lead to more nitro groups, which is not desired. So option B is unlikely.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-Bu-benzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Adds SO3H group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has t-Bu (activating, ortho/para) and SO3H (deactivating, meta). Nitro would go where? The strongest director would be the SO3H, which is deactivating. So nitro would go meta to SO3H.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me imagine the structure after each step.

After i: t-Bu at position 1.

After ii: sulfonic acid at position 3 (meta to t-Bu? Or perhaps para?)

Wait, t-Bu is activating, so when sulfonating, the sulfonic acid group (a strong deactivating group) would be added where? The ring is activated by t-Bu, so the incoming electrophile would go ortho or para to t-Bu. But the sulfonic acid group is a strong deactivator, so it's best to add it in the position that's most activated.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe after adding t-Bu, sulfonating would add SO3H in the para position relative to t-Bu.

So after ii, t-Bu at 1, SO3H at 4.

Then step iii: nitration. The ring now has t-Bu (activating, ortho/para) and SO3H (deactivating, meta).

The nitro group would be directed by the strongest director, which is the deactivating group. So nitro would go meta to SO3H. SO3H is at 4, so meta would be position 1 or 7. But position 1 is already occupied by t-Bu, so perhaps position 7 is a possibility, but that doesn't make sense on a benzene ring (since positions are 1-6). Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think again.

Benzene ring with t-Bu at position 1 (let's fix that as the top position). After sulfonation, SO3H is added at position 4 (directly opposite, para). Then, nitration would occur meta to SO3H, which is position 1 (taken) or position 7, but that's equivalent to position 1. Hmm, maybe the nitration would go to position 6, which is meta to position 4.

Wait, position 4 is at the bottom. So meta positions would be 1 and 7 (which is same as 1 in a six-membered ring), so that's not possible. So perhaps the nitration is at position 6, which is adjacent to position 4? Or am I getting this wrong.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe option C is adding too many substituents, and perhaps the order is wrong.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to give nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps a reduction step. Wait, nitro group can be reduced to amine using Fe/HCl (like in the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline). So after step ii, benzene has an amine (-NH2) group.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Now, benzene has an amine group (activating, ortho/para director). Adding t-Bu would go ortho or para to the amine.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group; amine is strongly activating, so it's possible.

So, after step iii, the structure is 1-amino-3-t-Bu benzene? Wait, let's think.

Wait, original nitro is at position 1. Then, reducing to amine would put NH2 at 1. Then, adding t-Bu would go ortho or para to NH2.

So t-Bu could be at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

Then, step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

Where would the next nitro group go? The ring now has NH2 (activating, ortho/para) and t-Bu (activating, ortho/para). The nitro group is a strong deactivator, so it would be directed by the strongest activating group. Since both NH2 and t-Bu are activating, perhaps the nitro group goes into a position ortho or para to them.

But I'm not sure. Let me think, after adding t-Bu, the structure is 1-NH2, 3-t-Bu (assuming t-Bu was added para to NH2). Then nitration would occur where?

Wait, perhaps the nitro group would be added meta to the t-Bu, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps after nitration, another substituent is added. Let me try to follow each step.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → t-Bu is added ortho or para to NH2. Let's say para, so t-Bu at position 4.

iv) Nitrate again → nitration occurs where? The ring has NH2 (activating, ortho/para) and t-Bu (activating, ortho/para). So the nitro group could go in a position ortho or para to either. But since the ring is quite substituted, perhaps the nitro group would go meta to t-Bu, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the target has nitro at position 3. So if t-Bu is at position 4, maybe the nitro is at position 6? Hmm, getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro at position 1.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → NH2 at 1.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation: add t-Bu at position 4 (para to NH2).

4. Then, nitrate again → where would the nitro go? The ring has NH2 (ortho/para) and t-Bu (ortho/para). So the new nitro group could be added at position 2 or 6 (ortho to NH2) or position 3 or 5 (meta to NH2). But t-Bu is at 4; so where is available?

Alternatively, perhaps after steps i-iii, the structure is NH2 at 1 and t-Bu at 4. When nitrating, the new nitro group would go para to NH2 (position 3) or meta to t-Bu (position 2 or 6?).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but let me proceed.

Assuming the nitro group goes para to NH2, which is position 3. So now, the ring has NH2 at 1, t-Bu at 4, nitro at 3.

But the target has OEt, t-Bu, and nitro. So we're missing the ethoxy group. Hmm.

Wait, but in the target, the substituents are OEt, t-Bu, and NO2. So perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution reaction.

Wait, but in the steps, after nitration in step iv, what comes next? Let's see option D's steps:

After iv, step v: NaNO2/HCl → this is a diazotization step, which would convert an amine to a diazonium salt. But in this case, after step iv, we have an amine (from step ii) and nitro groups. Wait, no, in step iv, we added another nitro group, so the amine is still at position 1.

Wait, step v is NaNO2/HCl, which would convert the amine to a diazonium chloride. Then, step vi: H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis, which would typically form a hydroxyl group from the diazonium salt. So after step vi, the amine (position 1) becomes OH.

Then step vii: NaOH and EtBr → this is an SN2 reaction where the ethoxy group would substitute the hydroxyl group. So the OH at 1 would become OEt.

So putting this all together, let's track the substituents:

1. Step i: nitro at 1.

2. Step ii: nitro reduced to NH2 at 1.

3. Step iii: t-Bu added at 4 (para to NH2).

4. Step iv: nitro added at 3 (meta to t-Bu? Or ortho to NH2? Not entirely sure, but let's say it's at 3.

5. Step v: NH2 at 1 is converted to diazonium.

6. Step vi: diazonium converted to OH at 1.

7. Step vii: OH at 1 is replaced by OEt.

So the final structure would have OEt at 1, t-Bu at 4, and NO2 at 3. Wait, but the target is 2-(t-Bu), 1-OEt, 3-NO2. So in this scenario, t-Bu is at 4, which would be para to OEt (at 1). But the target has t-Bu at 2, which is ortho to OEt (at 1) and NO2 at 3.

So perhaps this isn't matching. Maybe I made a mistake in the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial substitution order is different. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the target has substituents at positions 1 (OEt), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (NO2). So perhaps the order of addition is OEt first, then t-Bu, then NO2. Or perhaps OEt and t-Bu are added first, then NO2.

Wait, let's think about adding OEt first. But how? OEt is ethoxy. To add ethoxy group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So benzene + ethyl chloride and AlCl3 → ethylbenzene.

Then, the next step is nitration. Ethyl is ortho/para director, so nitro would go to position 2 or 4.

But in the target, nitro is at 3. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is nitro, then ethoxy, then t-Bu. Let me see.

If nitro is added first (position 1), then ethoxy is added. Nitro is meta director, so ethoxy would go to position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3.

Then, adding t-Bu would be directed by the ethoxy group (ortho/para). So t-Bu could go to position 2 or 4. If position 2 is available, that would match the target.

So then, the substituents would be: NO2 at 1, OEt at 3, t-Bu at 2. But the target has OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2, NO2 at 3. So the order would have to be OEt, t-Bu, then NO2? No, that wouldn't work because NO2 is meta to OEt.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me consider that the substituents are in a different arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Add t-Bu first.

2. Then add NO2.

3. Then add OEt.

But how would that work? Let's see:

After t-Bu (position 1), nitration would add NO2 at position 4 (para) or position 2 (ortho).

If NO2 is at 4, then adding OEt, which is ortho/para to t-Bu, would go to position 2 or 6. But the target has OEt at 1, which is the same as t-Bu.

Hmm, not working.

Alternatively, maybe the nitration is the first step.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro at 1.

2. Then, perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add ethoxy group? Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group, not an ether. To add an ethoxy group, perhaps a different approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. For example, after nitration, we might have a leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that usually requires a strongly activating group, which nitro is not. So that might not work.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added after the nitro group. Let me think: if we have nitro at 1, and then add ethoxy, which would go to position 3 (meta to nitro). Then, add t-Bu to position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

So, the substituents would be:

- Ethoxy at 3 (assuming nitro is at 1).

- t-Bu at 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

- Nitro at 1.

But the target has OEt at 1, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitro at 1.

ii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with ethyl chloride → ethyl group at position 3 (meta to nitro).

iii) Then, add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The ring now has nitro (1) and ethyl (3). The t-Bu would be directed by the ethyl group, which is ortho/para. So t-Bu could go to position 2 (ortho to ethyl) or position 4 (para).

In this case, t-Bu at position 2 would be ortho to ethyl (3), which is adjacent. So substituents would be nitro (1), ethyl (3), t-Bu (2). But the target has OEt at 1, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again, perhaps focusing on the steps that add the ethoxy group.

Looking at the options, which options have steps that add the OEt group?

Looking at each option's steps:

Option A: No step that adds OEt. It adds SO3 and multiple nitro groups, which doesn't fit. So A is out.

Option B: Steps don't include adding OEt. The steps include nitration, Fe/HCl, nitration again, etc. But no OEt addition. So B is out.

Option C: Steps include sulfonation, nitration, Fe/HCl, etc., but I don't see a step that introduces OEt. So C is out.

Option D: Steps include i) nitration, ii) Fe/HCl (reduces nitro to amine), iii) Friedel-Crafts for t-Bu, iv) nitration, v) diazotization, vi) hydrolysis to OH, vii) NaOH and EtBr (introducing OEt). 

So in option D, the OEt is added in step vii, replacing the OH introduced in step vi. 

So let me re-examine option D's steps:

i) Nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Reduce → NH2 at 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-Bu added at position 4 (para to NH2).

iv) Nitrate → where? NH2 is activating, so nitro would go ortho or para. But since NH2 is at 1, para would be 3, ortho 2 and 6. Also, t-Bu is at 4, which is an activating group, so nitro could go ortho or para to t-Bu, which would be positions 3,5 (para to 4), or positions 5 would be adjacent to 4.

Wait, if t-Bu is at 4, the ortho positions would be 3 and 5, and para would be 1 (which is already NH2). So nitro might go to position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3.

v) Then NaNO2/HCl → converts NH2 at 1 to diazonium.

vi) H3O+ and heat → hydrolyzes diazonium to OH at 1.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → substitutes OH at 1 with OEt.

So the substituents after each step:

i) nitro at 1.

ii) NH2 at 1.

iii) t-Bu at 4.

iv) nitro at 3.

v) NH2 → diazonium at 1.

vi) OH at 1.

vii) OEt at 1.

So the final structure would have OEt at 1, t-Bu at 4, nitro at 3.

But the target is OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

So the t-Bu is at 4 in this scenario, which doesn't match the target's position 2.

Therefore, perhaps option D's steps don't produce the target structure, but maybe I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps in step iii, the t-Bu is added at position 2 instead of 4. How would that happen?

Because when adding t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts to aniline (NH2 at 1), the t-Bu could go ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) to NH2.

If it goes ortho, then t-Bu is at position 2.

Then, in step iv, nitration would occur where? The ring has NH2 (activating, ortho/para) and t-Bu (activating, ortho/para). The nitro group would be directed by the strongest effect. Both groups are activating, so perhaps the position with the most activation is preferred.

But NH2 is a stronger activating group than t-Bu. So nitration would prefer to be ortho or para to NH2.

NH2 is at 1, so para would be position 3. So nitro at 3.

So after step iv, substituents are NH2 at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

Then step v: NH2 → diazonium at 1.

Step vi: OH at 1.

Step vii: OEt at 1.

So the final structure has OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. Which matches the target! So that would be correct.

So in this scenario, the steps in option D would lead to the correct structure.

Therefore, the correct option is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro) are added in the correct positions (1, 2, and 3, respectively) while considering the directing effects of each group.

### Analysis of Option D:
1. **Step i: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration)**  
   Benzene is nitrated, introducing a nitro group at position 1.

2. **Step ii: Fe/HCl (Reduction)**  
   The nitro group at position 1 is reduced to an amine (-NH₂).

3. **Step iii: tert-Butyl chloride/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation)**  
   The amine group (-NH₂) is strongly activating and ortho/para-directing. tert-Butyl chloride is introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, and the tert-butyl group is added at position 2 (ortho to the amine group).

4. **Step iv: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration)**  
   The ring now has -NH₂ at position 1 and tert-butyl at position 2. The amine group directs the nitro group to position 3 (meta to the tert-butyl group).

5. **Step v: NaNO₂/HCl (Diazotization)**  
   The amine group (-NH₂) at position 1 is converted into a diazonium salt.

6. **Step vi: H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat (Hydrolysis)**  
   The diazonium group at position 1 is hydrolyzed to form a hydroxyl group (-OH).

7. **Step vii: NaOH/EtBr (Substitution)**  
   The hydroxyl group (-OH) at position 1 is replaced with an ethoxy group (-OEt) via an SN2 reaction.

### Final Structure:
After these steps, the final structure is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, with the substituents in the correct positions:
- Ethoxy (-OEt) at position 1,
- tert-Butyl (-C(CH₃)₃) at position 2,
- Nitro (-NO₂) at position 3.

This matches the target molecule, making **Option D** the correct sequence of reactions.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene, and figuring out the correct sequence of reactions from the options given.

The target compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me draw that structure out mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (t-Bu), and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2).

Wait, wait. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. When numbering, the substituents are arranged in the order of their priority. But in this case, the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3. Wait, actually, the numbering is such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So I need to think about the structure correctly.

So the substituents are ethoxy (ethoxy group has low priority compared to nitro and t-Bu?), nitro is a strong activating group, but wait, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, 3. Let me consider the substituents.

Wait, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So in a meta arrangement? Or perhaps ortho and para? Wait, let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are on adjacent carbons. Let me think about the structure:

Imagine benzene with substituents on carbons 1, 2, and 3. So positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent each. Wait, but for a benzene ring, numbering can be a bit tricky.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of which substituents are where. Let's see, the substituents are ethoxy (OEt), t-Bu, and nitro (NO2). The positions are 1,2,3.

Wait, in the target molecule, the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3. So on adjacent positions: 1 is OEt, 2 is t-Bu, and 3 is NO2. Wait, but that might not be possible in a benzene ring because the numbering goes in a circle.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the substituents and see the order of reactions needed to attach them.

The substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. But wait, nitro is a meta-directing group, and ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. The tert-butyl is a bulky group, which is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group (since it's an alkyl group, but substituted with three methyl groups, so less activating than regular alkyl groups? Or maybe it's still activating? Wait, no. Alkyl groups are activating (they donate electrons through the inductive effect), but bulky. So tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So when adding substituents, the order in which they are added matters because each new substituent will influence the next reaction.

So, the plan is to start with benzene and add substituents in a way that each new group directs the next substitution appropriately.

Let me think about the substituents required: nitro, ethoxy, and tert-butyl. The target has them in positions 1, 2, and 3. So perhaps the substituents are arranged in a particular order that allows each step to proceed with the directing effects.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible steps in each option and see which one makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to approach this by considering the order of substitution reactions. Since benzene is the starting material, the first substituent will affect where the next substituent goes.

The target molecule has three substituents: OEt, t-Bu, and NO2. Let's think about which substituent is added first, second, and third.

But let me recall: when adding substituents, the order can influence the positions because each substitution directs the next.

So, for example, if I add a nitro group first, which is meta-directing, then the next substituent would be added in a meta position relative to nitro. Alternatively, if I add an activating group first, like ethoxy or t-Bu, the next substituents would be added in ortho or para positions relative to them.

Wait, but in the target, there are three substituents, so perhaps the order is to add the strongest director first, or the one that can control the positions better.

Wait, the target has nitro at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and t-Bu at 2. So perhaps the nitro is added first, then ethoxy, then t-Bu? Or some other order.

Wait, let's think: if we add nitro first, the ring would have a nitro group. Then, when adding the next substituent, say ethoxy, which is activating, it would be added in the ortho or para position relative to nitro. But nitro is meta-directing, so the next substituent would go meta to nitro. So, for benzene with nitro, adding ethoxy would be in the meta position relative to nitro.

Wait, but in the target molecule, nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, t-Bu at 2. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added first. So, benzene first becomes phenol, but wait, no, the first step is perhaps a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or something else.

Wait, the substituents can be added in various orders. Let me think about each option's steps. Let's look at the options.

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 (so Friedel-Crafts alkylation), then HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), then SO3/H2SO4 (maybe sulfonation?), then NaNO2/HCl (diazotization?), H2SO4 dilute, H3O+ and heat (hydrolysis?), Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration). Hmm, that seems complicated. The steps are too many, possibly multiple nitration steps.

Option B: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3, then nitration, then Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction step?), then nitration again, then diazotization, and so on. Hmm, perhaps adding more nitro groups but that's not desired.

Option C: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3, then sulfonation, nitration, Fe/HCl, diazotization, nitration again, and so on. Not sure.

Option D: i) Nitration first, then Fe/HCl, which is a catalyst for what? Oh, maybe a substitution, but Fe in HCl is often for reductions, like in the reduction of nitro groups. Then Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl, then nitration again, etc.

Wait, perhaps D's steps are: first nitrate (add NO2), then maybe reduce it? Or maybe something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add ethoxy first, then nitro, then the tert-butyl. Or another order.

Wait, let me think about the substituents.

Ethoxy (OEt) is an activating group, so directs incoming groups to ortho and para positions. Nitro is deactivating, meta-directing. t-Bu is activating, but bulky, so it would direct ortho and para, but perhaps the steric hindrance would cause more para addition? Or maybe ortho addition is difficult due to the bulk.

So, to get the substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3, perhaps the order of addition is ethoxy first, then nitro, then t-Bu.

Wait, let's imagine:

1. Start with benzene.

2. Add ethoxy group via nucleophilic substitution, but wait, benzene isn't nucleophilic. Oh, wait, ethoxy is an ether group. To add an ethoxy group, you can perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkyl halides attaching. Wait, but ethoxy group is an activating group, so maybe via an ether substitution. Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to have a nitration followed by something else.

Wait, no. Another approach: to get an ethoxy group on benzene, you can use a Williamson ether synthesis, but that typically requires an alkoxide attacking an alkyl halide. Alternatively, perhaps using a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I'm not sure that's the way.

Wait, perhaps using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's usually under strong conditions and requires a strong leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps first activating the ring with a nitration, but that would deactivate it.

Wait, wait, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a substitution reaction. For example, after nitration, perhaps a directing group is introduced, but that may complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acyl group, which is a meta director.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the substituent addition order.

The target has three substituents: OEt, t-Bu, NO2. Let's think in terms of which substituent is added when.

Suppose we add ethoxy first. Benzene + ethoxy group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation tends to form carbocations, which for ethyl might not be stable. Alternatively, maybe using a better alkylating agent like ethyl chloride with AlCl3 as catalyst. So first step: benzene + ethyl chloride, AlCl3 → ethylbenzene.

Wait, but ethyl group is an activating group, so next step would be to add another substituent. Let's say nitration. Where would nitration occur? Since ethyl is ortho/para directing, nitration would add nitro group in ortho or para positions. Then, the next substituent.

Wait, but the target has the nitro group in position 3. Let me try to visualize:

If benzene becomes ethylbenzene (ethyl at position 1), then nitration would add nitro group at ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) relative to ethyl.

Hmm, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3. So perhaps the order is to add the nitro group first, then the ethoxy, then the tert-butyl.

Wait, let's try that. First, nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.

Then, in nitrobenzene, the next substituent would be added. Since nitro is meta-directing, the next group would go meta to it.

So, if nitro is at position 1, the next substituent (say, ethoxy) would go to position 3 (meta). Then, the next substituent (t-Bu) would go where?

Wait, but the target has substituents at 1, 2, 3. So perhaps that's not the right order.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is added first. Let me try that path.

Benzene → ethylbenzene (via Friedel-Crafts). Then, the next substituent is nitro group. Since ethyl is ortho/para director, nitro would go in ortho or para to ethyl.

Assuming it goes ortho, so nitro at position 2. Then, the next substituent, say t-Bu, would be added. Since now the ring has ethyl at 1 and nitro at 2. The nitro group is a meta director, and ethyl is ortho/para. So where would the next substituent go? Hmm, perhaps the directing effect would be a mix, but the strongest director would be the one with higher priority.

Wait, substituent priority is usually based on their activating/deactivating nature. Nitro is deactivating and meta-directing, while ethyl is activating and ortho/para. So when both are present, the nitro group would exert a stronger influence because it's deactivating. So the next substituent would go meta to the nitro group.

If nitro is at position 2, then meta would be position 5. But that's not where we want the t-Bu. Alternatively, perhaps during the third substitution, the ethyl directs the t-Bu to an ortho or para position.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to think about the steps in each option and see which sequence correctly builds the target molecule.

Looking at the options, each option has a series of reactions. Let me try to parse each option's steps.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → benzene becomes t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Where would the nitro group go? Since t-Bu is activating and ortho/para directing, the nitro could go ortho or para. But t-Bu is bulky, so para is more likely.

So after step ii, structure is t-Bu at 1, NO2 at 4 (para).

Then step iii: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Sulfonating the ring would add a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). Where would it go? The ring now has t-Bu (activating, ortho/para) and NO2 (deactivating, meta). The strongest director is the nitro group, which is meta. So sulfonic acid would add meta to nitro, which is position 1 or 3. Wait, but t-Bu is already at 1, so position 3 would be available. So now we have t-Bu at 1, NO2 at 4, SO3H at 3.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. So this step might not be correct. So perhaps option A is not the right path.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me see the full steps.

Wait, the target has OEt, t-Bu, and NO2. So any step that adds another group (like SO3H) would be incorrect. So option A's step iii introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not in the target. So option A is probably wrong.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-Bu-benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. As before, nitro adds para to t-Bu.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction, but Fe in HCl is typically for something else. Or is it a catalyst for another reaction? Alternatively, perhaps it's a step to replace a nitro group into an amine? Wait, but nitro to amine is usually with H2 and a catalyst. Fe and HCl might be for something else, like a diazotization step.

Wait, step iv in option B is another nitration. So perhaps after the first nitration, another nitro group is added. But the target has only one nitro group. So this would be incorrect. So option B's steps probably lead to more nitro groups, which is not desired. So option B is unlikely.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-Bu-benzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Adds SO3H group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has t-Bu (activating, ortho/para) and SO3H (deactivating, meta). Nitro would go where? The strongest director would be the SO3H, which is deactivating. So nitro would go meta to SO3H.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me imagine the structure after each step.

After i: t-Bu at position 1.

After ii: sulfonic acid at position 3 (meta to t-Bu? Or perhaps para?)

Wait, t-Bu is activating, so when sulfonating, the sulfonic acid group (a strong deactivating group) would be added where? The ring is activated by t-Bu, so the incoming electrophile would go ortho or para to t-Bu. But the sulfonic acid group is a strong deactivator, so it's best to add it in the position that's most activated.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe after adding t-Bu, sulfonating would add SO3H in the para position relative to t-Bu.

So after ii, t-Bu at 1, SO3H at 4.

Then step iii: nitration. The ring now has t-Bu (activating, ortho/para) and SO3H (deactivating, meta).

The nitro group would be directed by the strongest director, which is the deactivating group. So nitro would go meta to SO3H. SO3H is at 4, so meta would be position 1 or 7. But position 1 is already occupied by t-Bu, so perhaps position 7 is a possibility, but that doesn't make sense on a benzene ring (since positions are 1-6). Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think again.

Benzene ring with t-Bu at position 1 (let's fix that as the top position). After sulfonation, SO3H is added at position 4 (directly opposite, para). Then, nitration would occur meta to SO3H, which is position 1 (taken) or position 7, but that's equivalent to position 1. Hmm, maybe the nitration would go to position 6, which is meta to position 4.

Wait, position 4 is at the bottom. So meta positions would be 1 and 7 (which is same as 1 in a six-membered ring), so that's not possible. So perhaps the nitration is at position 6, which is adjacent to position 4? Or am I getting this wrong.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe option C is adding too many substituents, and perhaps the order is wrong.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to give nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps a reduction step. Wait, nitro group can be reduced to amine using Fe/HCl (like in the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline). So after step ii, benzene has an amine (-NH2) group.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Now, benzene has an amine group (activating, ortho/para director). Adding t-Bu would go ortho or para to the amine.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group; amine is strongly activating, so it's possible.

So, after step iii, the structure is 1-amino-3-t-Bu benzene? Wait, let's think.

Wait, original nitro is at position 1. Then, reducing to amine would put NH2 at 1. Then, adding t-Bu would go ortho or para to NH2.

So t-Bu could be at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

Then, step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

Where would the next nitro group go? The ring now has NH2 (activating, ortho/para) and t-Bu (activating, ortho/para). The nitro group is a strong deactivator, so it would be directed by the strongest activating group. Since both NH2 and t-Bu are activating, perhaps the nitro group goes into a position ortho or para to them.

But I'm not sure. Let me think, after adding t-Bu, the structure is 1-NH2, 3-t-Bu (assuming t-Bu was added para to NH2). Then nitration would occur where?

Wait, perhaps the nitro group would be added meta to the t-Bu, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps after nitration, another substituent is added. Let me try to follow each step.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → t-Bu is added ortho or para to NH2. Let's say para, so t-Bu at position 4.

iv) Nitrate again → nitration occurs where? The ring has NH2 (activating, ortho/para) and t-Bu (activating, ortho/para). So the nitro group could go in a position ortho or para to either. But since the ring is quite substituted, perhaps the nitro group would go meta to t-Bu, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the target has nitro at position 3. So if t-Bu is at position 4, maybe the nitro is at position 6? Hmm, getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro at position 1.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → NH2 at 1.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation: add t-Bu at position 4 (para to NH2).

4. Then, nitrate again → where would the nitro go? The ring has NH2 (ortho/para) and t-Bu (ortho/para). So the new nitro group could be added at position 2 or 6 (ortho to NH2) or position 3 or 5 (meta to NH2). But t-Bu is at 4; so where is available?

Alternatively, perhaps after steps i-iii, the structure is NH2 at 1 and t-Bu at 4. When nitrating, the new nitro group would go para to NH2 (position 3) or meta to t-Bu (position 2 or 6?).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but let me proceed.

Assuming the nitro group goes para to NH2, which is position 3. So now, the ring has NH2 at 1, t-Bu at 4, nitro at 3.

But the target has OEt, t-Bu, and nitro. So we're missing the ethoxy group. Hmm.

Wait, but in the target, the substituents are OEt, t-Bu, and NO2. So perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution reaction.

Wait, but in the steps, after nitration in step iv, what comes next? Let's see option D's steps:

After iv, step v: NaNO2/HCl → this is a diazotization step, which would convert an amine to a diazonium salt. But in this case, after step iv, we have an amine (from step ii) and nitro groups. Wait, no, in step iv, we added another nitro group, so the amine is still at position 1.

Wait, step v is NaNO2/HCl, which would convert the amine to a diazonium chloride. Then, step vi: H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis, which would typically form a hydroxyl group from the diazonium salt. So after step vi, the amine (position 1) becomes OH.

Then step vii: NaOH and EtBr → this is an SN2 reaction where the ethoxy group would substitute the hydroxyl group. So the OH at 1 would become OEt.

So putting this all together, let's track the substituents:

1. Step i: nitro at 1.

2. Step ii: nitro reduced to NH2 at 1.

3. Step iii: t-Bu added at 4 (para to NH2).

4. Step iv: nitro added at 3 (meta to t-Bu? Or ortho to NH2? Not entirely sure, but let's say it's at 3.

5. Step v: NH2 at 1 is converted to diazonium.

6. Step vi: diazonium converted to OH at 1.

7. Step vii: OH at 1 is replaced by OEt.

So the final structure would have OEt at 1, t-Bu at 4, and NO2 at 3. Wait, but the target is 2-(t-Bu), 1-OEt, 3-NO2. So in this scenario, t-Bu is at 4, which would be para to OEt (at 1). But the target has t-Bu at 2, which is ortho to OEt (at 1) and NO2 at 3.

So perhaps this isn't matching. Maybe I made a mistake in the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial substitution order is different. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the target has substituents at positions 1 (OEt), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (NO2). So perhaps the order of addition is OEt first, then t-Bu, then NO2. Or perhaps OEt and t-Bu are added first, then NO2.

Wait, let's think about adding OEt first. But how? OEt is ethoxy. To add ethoxy group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So benzene + ethyl chloride and AlCl3 → ethylbenzene.

Then, the next step is nitration. Ethyl is ortho/para director, so nitro would go to position 2 or 4.

But in the target, nitro is at 3. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is nitro, then ethoxy, then t-Bu. Let me see.

If nitro is added first (position 1), then ethoxy is added. Nitro is meta director, so ethoxy would go to position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3.

Then, adding t-Bu would be directed by the ethoxy group (ortho/para). So t-Bu could go to position 2 or 4. If position 2 is available, that would match the target.

So then, the substituents would be: NO2 at 1, OEt at 3, t-Bu at 2. But the target has OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2, NO2 at 3. So the order would have to be OEt, t-Bu, then NO2? No, that wouldn't work because NO2 is meta to OEt.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me consider that the substituents are in a different arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Add t-Bu first.

2. Then add NO2.

3. Then add OEt.

But how would that work? Let's see:

After t-Bu (position 1), nitration would add NO2 at position 4 (para) or position 2 (ortho).

If NO2 is at 4, then adding OEt, which is ortho/para to t-Bu, would go to position 2 or 6. But the target has OEt at 1, which is the same as t-Bu.

Hmm, not working.

Alternatively, maybe the nitration is the first step.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro at 1.

2. Then, perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add ethoxy group? Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group, not an ether. To add an ethoxy group, perhaps a different approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. For example, after nitration, we might have a leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that usually requires a strongly activating group, which nitro is not. So that might not work.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added after the nitro group. Let me think: if we have nitro at 1, and then add ethoxy, which would go to position 3 (meta to nitro). Then, add t-Bu to position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

So, the substituents would be:

- Ethoxy at 3 (assuming nitro is at 1).

- t-Bu at 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

- Nitro at 1.

But the target has OEt at 1, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitro at 1.

ii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with ethyl chloride → ethyl group at position 3 (meta to nitro).

iii) Then, add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The ring now has nitro (1) and ethyl (3). The t-Bu would be directed by the ethyl group, which is ortho/para. So t-Bu could go to position 2 (ortho to ethyl) or position 4 (para).

In this case, t-Bu at position 2 would be ortho to ethyl (3), which is adjacent. So substituents would be nitro (1), ethyl (3), t-Bu (2). But the target has OEt at 1, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again, perhaps focusing on the steps that add the ethoxy group.

Looking at the options, which options have steps that add the OEt group?

Looking at each option's steps:

Option A: No step that adds OEt. It adds SO3 and multiple nitro groups, which doesn't fit. So A is out.

Option B: Steps don't include adding OEt. The steps include nitration, Fe/HCl, nitration again, etc. But no OEt addition. So B is out.

Option C: Steps include sulfonation, nitration, Fe/HCl, etc., but I don't see a step that introduces OEt. So C is out.

Option D: Steps include i) nitration, ii) Fe/HCl (reduces nitro to amine), iii) Friedel-Crafts for t-Bu, iv) nitration, v) diazotization, vi) hydrolysis to OH, vii) NaOH and EtBr (introducing OEt). 

So in option D, the OEt is added in step vii, replacing the OH introduced in step vi. 

So let me re-examine option D's steps:

i) Nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Reduce → NH2 at 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-Bu added at position 4 (para to NH2).

iv) Nitrate → where? NH2 is activating, so nitro would go ortho or para. But since NH2 is at 1, para would be 3, ortho 2 and 6. Also, t-Bu is at 4, which is an activating group, so nitro could go ortho or para to t-Bu, which would be positions 3,5 (para to 4), or positions 5 would be adjacent to 4.

Wait, if t-Bu is at 4, the ortho positions would be 3 and 5, and para would be 1 (which is already NH2). So nitro might go to position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3.

v) Then NaNO2/HCl → converts NH2 at 1 to diazonium.

vi) H3O+ and heat → hydrolyzes diazonium to OH at 1.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → substitutes OH at 1 with OEt.

So the substituents after each step:

i) nitro at 1.

ii) NH2 at 1.

iii) t-Bu at 4.

iv) nitro at 3.

v) NH2 → diazonium at 1.

vi) OH at 1.

vii) OEt at 1.

So the final structure would have OEt at 1, t-Bu at 4, nitro at 3.

But the target is OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

So the t-Bu is at 4 in this scenario, which doesn't match the target's position 2.

Therefore, perhaps option D's steps don't produce the target structure, but maybe I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps in step iii, the t-Bu is added at position 2 instead of 4. How would that happen?

Because when adding t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts to aniline (NH2 at 1), the t-Bu could go ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) to NH2.

If it goes ortho, then t-Bu is at position 2.

Then, in step iv, nitration would occur where? The ring has NH2 (activating, ortho/para) and t-Bu (activating, ortho/para). The nitro group would be directed by the strongest effect. Both groups are activating, so perhaps the position with the most activation is preferred.

But NH2 is a stronger activating group than t-Bu. So nitration would prefer to be ortho or para to NH2.

NH2 is at 1, so para would be position 3. So nitro at 3.

So after step iv, substituents are NH2 at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

Then step v: NH2 → diazonium at 1.

Step vi: OH at 1.

Step vii: OEt at 1.

So the final structure has OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. Which matches the target! So that would be correct.

So in this scenario, the steps in option D would lead to the correct structure.

Therefore, the correct option is D.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro) are added in the correct positions (1, 2, and 3, respectively) while considering the directing effects of each group.

### Analysis of Option D:
1. **Step i: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration)**  
   Benzene is nitrated, introducing a nitro group at position 1.

2. **Step ii: Fe/HCl (Reduction)**  
   The nitro group at position 1 is reduced to an amine (-NH₂).

3. **Step iii: tert-Butyl chloride/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation)**  
   The amine group (-NH₂) is strongly activating and ortho/para-directing. tert-Butyl chloride is introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, and the tert-butyl group is added at position 2 (ortho to the amine group).

4. **Step iv: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration)**  
   The ring now has -NH₂ at position 1 and tert-butyl at position 2. The amine group directs the nitro group to position 3 (meta to the tert-butyl group).

5. **Step v: NaNO₂/HCl (Diazotization)**  
   The amine group (-NH₂) at position 1 is converted into a diazonium salt.

6. **Step vi: H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat (Hydrolysis)**  
   The diazonium group at position 1 is hydrolyzed to form a hydroxyl group (-OH).

7. **Step vii: NaOH/EtBr (Substitution)**  
   The hydroxyl group (-OH) at position 1 is replaced with an ethoxy group (-OEt) via an SN2 reaction.

### Final Structure:
After these steps, the final structure is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, with the substituents in the correct positions:
- Ethoxy (-OEt) at position 1,
- tert-Butyl (-C(CH₃)₃) at position 2,
- Nitro (-NO₂) at position 3.

This matches the target molecule, making **Option D** the correct sequence of reactions.

**Answer: D**
