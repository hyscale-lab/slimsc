Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants, which are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Hmm, wait, stability constants usually increase with the complexity of the complex, right? But here β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. That's a bit confusing, but maybe the complexes have different structures or something.

So the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN^- ligands attached to the Co^2+ ion. So I'm looking for the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is the second one, I think. Wait, the stability constants given are β1 to β4. So β1 is for the first complex, Co(SCN), β2 for the second, Co(SCN)_2, β3 for the third, Co(SCN)_3, and β4 for the fourth, Co(SCN)_4? Or wait, perhaps the stability constants are for different structural isomers or maybe different oxidation states? No, it's Co(II), so the oxidation state is fixed. Ok, so the complexes are in a stepwise formation.

Wait, but the problem statement says "dithiocyanato" which is two SCN ligands. So that would correspond to the second complex, with β2=40. But wait, the stability constants are given in order, so β1 is the first complex, β2 is the second, etc. So the stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) would be βn? Wait, no. Wait, the stability constant βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the ions. So for each step, adding one SCN^-.

So the overall formation would be stepwise. For example, the first complex is Co^2+ + SCN^- <-> Co(SCN)^(+) with stability constant β1 =9.

The second complex, Co(SCN)_2^0, would form from Co(SCN)^+ + SCN^- <-> Co(SCN)_2^0, with β2=40. So the overall stability for the second complex is β1*β2, right? Wait, no. Wait, the overall β for Co(SCN)_2^0 would be β1*β2, and similarly for higher complexes.

Wait no, stability constants can be a bit tricky. The overall formation constant K for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) would be the product of each step's β. So for n=1, K= β1. For n=2, K = β1 * β2. For n=3, K = β1 * β2 * β3. And for n=4, K = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

Wait, but wait, the problem gives the stability constants as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is for adding one SCN. So the overall formation constant for the second complex is β1*β2 = 9*40=360. For the third, it's 9*40*63, and for the fourth, 9*40*63*16.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which is the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So we need to find the mole fraction of that complex out of all possible Co species.

So in the solution, Co exists in various forms: as free Co^2+, as [Co(SCN)], [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3], and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-. The total concentration of all these complexes plus the free ion equals the total Co concentration, which is 1e-2 M.

So to find the percentage of the second complex, I need to calculate the fraction of the total cobalt species that is present as [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

The approach would be to calculate the concentration of each complex, given the total Co concentration and the concentrations of SCN-.

But since the formation of these complexes depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions, we can model this using the formation constants.

Alternatively, sometimes in such cases, the fraction can be found by using the ratio of the formation constants. Because the concentrations of SCN are high, the complexes will form extensively.

Wait, the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the Co concentration (1e-2 M). So the formation of the complexes will be favored, especially the higher-order ones.

But wait, the stability constants: the highest β is for β3 at 63. Then β4 is 16, which is lower. So the formation of the third complex is more favored than the fourth. Hmm, that's a bit unusual because typically, higher β values mean more stable complexes. So perhaps the third complex is the most stable, and the fourth is less, so the distribution might peak at the third complex.

But our question is about the second complex.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The starting point is the dissociation of each complex into Co and the appropriate number of SCN-.

So for each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), it can dissociate step by step. The concentration of each complex is determined by the product of the stability constant up to that step, multiplied by the concentrations of the ions.

But the problem is that the formation of each complex involves multiple steps, and the overall formation constant is the product of the individual βs.

Wait, perhaps we can model the distribution using the cumulative formation constants. Let me define K1 = β1 =9, K2= β1*β2=9*40=360, K3= β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680, K4= β1*β2*β3*β4=9*40*63*16= 362880.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because each β is for adding another SCN, so the overall formation constant for a complex with n SCN ligands is K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So the four possible complexes are:

n=1: [CoSCN]^+ → K1=9

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → K2=9*40=360

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^− → K3=9*40*63= 22680

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2− → K4=9*40*63*16= 362880

But wait, that seems a bit strange because K4 is much larger than K3. So the fourth complex is more stable than the third? But β4 is lower than β3. Oh, that's because the overall K increases as you include more βs. So the overall K for each complex is the product of all the βs up to that step.

So the higher the K, the more the complex is favored. So K4 is the largest, so the fourth complex is the most stable, followed by K3, K2, etc.

Wait, but that's confusing because β4 is 16, which is lower than β3's 63. But K4 is 362,880, which is higher than K3's 22,680. So the product makes K4 much larger. So the fourth complex is more favored, but that's because each step's β contributes to the overall K.

Wait, but if the product β1β2β3β4 is bigger than the others, then the fourth complex is the most stable. So in a solution with excess SCN-, most of the Co would form the fourth complex. But wait, the problem is about the second complex. Hmm, but perhaps the answer isn't that straightforward.

But let me think about how to calculate the fractions.

The total concentration of Co is the sum of all species:

[Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-] = 1e-2 M.

But solving for all these concentrations might be complicated. Another approach is to use the concept of fraction of each complex, which can be found using the relative K values and the concentrations of SCN^-.

Wait, I recall that in such problems, when the concentration of the ligand is much higher than the metal ion, higher-order complexes are more populated. But with the K values given, for each complex, the fraction can be calculated.

Alternatively, the fraction f_n of each complex is given by f_n = (K_n * [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum_{i=1 to 4} K_i [SCN]^i )

But wait, because the overall formation is a stepwise process, and each K is the product of the βs up to that step.

Wait, but the general formula for the fraction of each species in a complexation reaction can be derived using the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

In the case of a metal ion M forming complexes with ligand L, the fraction of the metal in each complex is given by:

f_n = (K_n [L]^n) / (1 + sum_{i=1 to n_max} K_i [L]^i )

In this problem, n_max is 4, because the highest complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

So, [L] is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Each K_n is the formation constant for the n-th complex, which is the product of β1 to βn.

So K1=9, K2=9*40=360, K3=9*40*63=22680, K4=9*40*63*16=362880.

So, let's compute each term in the denominator.

Compute each K_i [L]^i:

For i=0: 1 (the free Co^2+ term)

For i=1: K1 [L]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

i=2: K2 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 =3.6

i=3: K3 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001=22.68

i=4: K4 * (0.1)^4 =362880 * 0.0001= 36.288

So the denominator is 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = let's compute that step by step.

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So denominator is 64.468.

Now, the fraction f_2 is (K2 [L]^2) / denominator.

Which is 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.055575, or 5.5575%.

Wait, that's about 5.56%. But the options don't have that. Hmm. So perhaps I've done something wrong here.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about dithiocyanato, which is n=2. So f_2 would be the fraction for the second complex.

But according to my calculation, it's only about 5.56%, but the options are like 16%, 25%, 38%, 42%.

Hmm, so this suggests either my approach is wrong or I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's double-check the K_i [L]^i values.

K1=9, [L]=0.1 → 0.9 → correct.

K2=360, [L]^2=0.01 → 360 * 0.01 =3.6 → correct.

K3=22680, [L]^3=0.001 → 22.68 → correct.

K4=362880, [L]^4=0.0001 → 36.288 → correct.

Sum is 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Wait 0.9 +3.6 is 4.5, plus 22.68 is 27.18, plus 36.288 is 63.468. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Oh wait, my previous sum was 64.468, but now I'm getting 63.468.

Wait let me re-calculate:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468? Or wait, 28.18 + 36.288 is 64.468.

Wait, 28.18 +36.288: 28 +36 is 64, 0.18 +0.288 is 0.468 → total 64.468.

So that's correct.

Wait, but f_2 is 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.055575, about 5.56%. But none of the options match that. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the formation constants wrong.

Wait, maybe the stability constants are not cumulative. Wait, wait, another way to model this is considering each step as a separate reaction.

Another approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step.

The first complex: Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+ ; β1=9.

The second complex: CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^0 ; β2=40.

The third complex: Co(SCN)_2^0 + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_3^- ; β3=63.

The fourth complex: Co(SCN)_3^- + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_4^2- ; β4=16.

In this case, each step adds another ligand with a certain β.

The fraction of each complex can be found by considering each step's contribution.

But this seems complicated because each complex's concentration depends on the previous steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of each complex can be written as:

[Co(SCN)_n] = [Co]_total * (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN]^n / (1 + sum_{i=1 to 4} (product β1 to βi) [SCN]^i )

But that's the same as the previous approach.

Wait, but perhaps the way I calculated the denominator is incorrect.

Wait another thought: the denominator includes all possible complexes, but maybe I forgot the free Co^2+.

Wait in the denominator, the 1 represents [Co^2+], the free ion. So the sum is correctly 1 (free Co) + all the complex terms.

So the previous calculation should be correct.

But the result I'm getting for f_2 is about 5.56%, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are not all in the same way. Let's think again: is β1 the formation constant for the first complex, and so on?

Wait, another possible approach: the problem might be referring to the dithiocyanato complex as the [Co(SCN)_2] which is the second complex. But perhaps the question is about the blue color, which could correspond to a different complex. Wait, I'm not sure about the colors of the different cobalt complexes. But the question states that it's the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think refers to the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So that should be what we're calculating.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the stability constants are given as log β, but the problem states β is 9, etc. So no, they're given as β.

Another possibility is that the total concentration includes all the Co species, but perhaps I'm miscalculating the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should be (1 + sum_{i=1 to 4} (K_i [SCN]^i )) multiplied by [Co]_total?

No, because the fractions are calculated as (K_n [L]^n ) / (denominator), and then multiplied by [Co]_total to get the concentration. Wait, no, because the fractions are given by:

f_n = [Co L_n] / [Co_total]

Where [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + sum [Co L_n].

So the denominator is (1 + sum K_i [L]^i ), and each f_n = (K_n [L]^n ) / denominator.

So in that case, the fractions seem correct.

But according to that, the fraction for n=2 is about 5.56%, which is not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in K calculation. Let me recheck.

K1 =9, yes.

K2= β1 * β2 =9*40=360 yes.

K3 = 360 *63=22680 yes.

K4=22680 *16=362,880 yes.

So the K_i [L]^i are correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the stability constants are given for the overall formation, not stepwise. That is, β1 is the overall K for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

In that case, the K_n would be the same as β_n, not the product. But the way the problem states it, the stability constants are for each step. So for example, β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So it's more likely that K_n is the product.

Wait, but wait, another approach: the problem says 'the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.'

So maybe each βn is the overall stability constant for the [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) complex.

In that case, K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

But wait, that would make K4=16, which is lower than K3=63. So the fourth complex is less stable than the third. That might make more sense, as higher K means more stability.

If that's the case, then the K for each complex is βn, not the product.

So then, the fractions would be:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum_{i=1 to 4} β_i [SCN]^i )

So let's recalculate with this assumption.

Compute each term:

i=1: β1 [L]^1 =9 *0.1 =0.9

i=2: β2 [L]^2 =40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

i=3: β3 [L]^3=63*(0.001)=0.063

i=4: β4 [L]^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016

So denominator is 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 1 +0.9=1.9; 1.9+0.4=2.3; 2.3+0.063=2.363; 2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is ~2.3646.

Now f_2 = (0.4) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%. That's option D.

Wait, but earlier when I thought that K_n is the product, I was getting 5.5%, but with this approach, I get 16.9%, which is option D.

So which assumption is correct?

The problem states: "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Stability constants (formation constants) are typically given as the overall constant for the entire reaction. So if [Co(SCN)_n]^(x) has a stability constant βn, then K_n = βn.

In that case, the approach where each K_n is βn, not the product, would be correct.

So in that case, the fraction for the second complex is (40 * (0.1)^2 ) / denominator.

Which is 40*0.01=0.4.

Denominator is 1 +0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016=2.3646.

So 0.4/2.3646≈0.169, 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, why did I get confused earlier? Because sometimes, the stability constant is given for each step, but in this case, the problem says they are the stability constants for the complexes. So each βn is the K for forming [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) from Co^2+ and n SCN^-.

So the correct approach is to treat each βn as the overall K for the nth complex. Thus, the fractions would be as calculated.

So the correct answer is D) 16.9%.

To determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]^0) in the solution, we calculate the fraction of the second complex among all cobalt species. The stability constants provided are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16, which are the overall stability constants for the complexes [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^−, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, respectively. The [SCN^-] concentration is 0.1 M, and the total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M.

The fraction of each complex is given by:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{1 + \sum_{i=1}^{4} \beta_i [\text{SCN}]^i}
\]

### Step 1: Compute the terms in the denominator
For each complex, calculate \(\beta_i [\text{SCN}]^i\):
- \(i=1\): \(\beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9\)
- \(i=2\): \(\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4\)
- \(i=3\): \(\beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063\)
- \(i=4\): \(\beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016\)

The denominator is the sum of all terms:
\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction of the second complex
The fraction of the second complex is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{\text{denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants, which are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

So the overall formation would be stepwise. For example, the first complex is Co^2+ + SCN^- <-> Co(SCN)^(+) with stability constant β1 =9.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which is the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So we need to find the mole fraction of that complex out of all possible Co species.

So to find the percentage of the second complex, I need to calculate the fraction of the total cobalt species that is present as [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, but that's confusing because β4 is 16, which is lower than β3's 63. But K4 is 362,880, which is higher than K3's 22,680. So the product makes K4 much larger. So the fourth complex is more favored, but that's because each step's β contributes to the overall K.

But let me think about how to calculate the fractions.

The total concentration of Co is the sum of all species:

[Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-] = 1e-2 M.

But solving for all these concentrations might be complicated. Another approach is to use the concept of fraction of each complex, which can be found using the relative K values and the concentrations of SCN^-.

Wait, I recall that in such problems, when the concentration of the ligand is much higher than the metal ion, higher-order complexes are more populated. But with the K values given, for each complex, the fraction can be calculated.

Alternatively, the fraction f_n of each complex is given by f_n = (K_n * [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum_{i=1 to 4} K_i [SCN]^i )

But wait, because the overall formation is a stepwise process, and each K is the product of the βs up to that step.

Wait, but the general formula for the fraction of each species in a complexation reaction can be derived using the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

In the case of a metal ion M forming complexes with ligand L, the fraction of the metal in each complex is given by:

f_n = (K_n [L]^n) / (1 + sum_{i=1 to n_max} K_i [L]^i )

In this problem, n_max is 4, because the highest complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

So, [L] is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Each K_n is the formation constant for the n-th complex, which is the product of β1 to βn.

So K1=9, K2=9*40=360, K3=9*40*63=22680, K4=9*40*63*16=362880.

So, let's compute each term in the denominator.

Compute each K_i [L]^i:

For i=0: 1 (the free Co^2+ term)

For i=1: K1 [L]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

i=2: K2 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 =3.6

i=3: K3 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001=22.68

i=4: K4 * (0.1)^4 =362880 * 0.0001= 36.288

So the denominator is 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = let's compute that step by step.

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So denominator is 64.468.

Now, the fraction f_2 is (K2 [L]^2) / denominator.

Which is 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.055575, or 5.5575%.

Wait, that's about 5.56%. But the options don't have that. Hmm. So perhaps I've done something wrong here.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about dithiocyanato, which is n=2. So f_2 would be the fraction for the second complex.

But according to my calculation, it's only about 5.56%, but the options are like 16%, 25%, 38%, 42%.

Hmm, so this suggests either my approach is wrong or I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's double-check the K_i [L]^i values.

K1=9, [L]=0.1 → 0.9 → correct.

K2=360, [L]^2=0.01 → 360 * 0.01 =3.6 → correct.

K3=22680, [L]^3=0.001 → 22.68 → correct.

K4=362880, [L]^4=0.0001 → 36.288 → correct.

Sum is 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Wait 0.9 +3.6 is 4.5, plus 22.68 is 27.18, plus 36.288 is 63.468. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Oh wait, my previous sum was 64.468, but now I'm getting 63.468.

Wait let me re-calculate:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468? Or wait, 28.18 + 36.288 is 64.468.

Wait, 28.18 +36.288: 28 +36 is 64, 0.18 +0.288 is 0.468 → total 64.468.

So that's correct.

Wait, but f_2 is 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.055575, about 5.56%. But none of the options match that. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the formation constants wrong.

Wait, maybe the stability constants are not cumulative. Wait, wait, another way to model this is considering each step as a separate reaction.

Another approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step.

The first complex: Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+ ; β1=9.

The second complex: CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^0 ; β2=40.

The third complex: Co(SCN)_2^0 + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_3^- ; β3=63.

The fourth complex: Co(SCN)_3^- + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_4^2- ; β4=16.

In this case, each step adds another ligand with a certain β.

The fraction of each complex can be found by considering each step's contribution.

But this seems complicated because each complex's concentration depends on the previous steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of each complex can be written as:

[Co(SCN)_n] = [Co]_total * (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN]^n / (1 + sum_{i=1 to 4} (product β1 to βi) [SCN]^i )

But that's the same as the previous approach.

Wait, but perhaps the way I calculated the denominator is incorrect.

Wait another thought: the denominator includes all possible complexes, but maybe I forgot the free Co^2+.

Wait in the denominator, the 1 represents [Co^2+], the free ion. So the sum is correctly 1 (free Co) + all the complex terms.

So the previous calculation should be correct.

But the result I'm getting for f_2 is about 5.56%, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are not all in the same way. Let's think again: is β1 the formation constant for the first complex, and so on?

Wait, another possible approach: the problem might be referring to the dithiocyanato complex as the [Co(SCN)_2] which is the second complex. But perhaps the question is about the blue color, which could correspond to a different complex. Wait, I'm not sure about the colors of the different cobalt complexes. But the question states that it's the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think refers to the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So that should be what we're calculating.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the stability constants are given as log β, but the problem states β is 9, etc. So no, they're given as β.

Another possibility is that the total concentration includes all the Co species, but perhaps I'm miscalculating the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should be (1 + sum_{i=1 to 4} (K_i [SCN]^i )) multiplied by [Co]_total?

No, because the fractions are calculated as (K_n [L]^n ) / (denominator), and then multiplied by [Co]_total to get the concentration. Wait, no, because the fractions are given by:

f_n = [Co L_n] / [Co_total]

Where [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + sum [Co L_n].

So the denominator is (1 + sum K_i [L]^i ), and each f_n = (K_n [L]^n ) / denominator.

So in that case, the fractions seem correct.

But according to that, the fraction for n=2 is about 5.56%, which is not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in K calculation. Let me recheck.

K1 =9, yes.

K2= β1 * β2 =9*40=360 yes.

K3 = 360 *63=22680 yes.

K4=22680 *16=362,880 yes.

So the K_i [L]^i are correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the stability constants are given for the overall formation, not stepwise. That is, β1 is the overall K for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

In that case, the K_n would be the same as β_n, not the product. But the way the problem states it, the stability constants are for each step. So for example, β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So it's more likely that K_n is the product.

Wait, but wait, another approach: the problem says 'the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.'

So maybe each βn is the overall stability constant for the [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) complex.

In that case, K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

But wait, that would make K4=16, which is lower than K3=63. So the fourth complex is less stable than the third. That might make more sense, as higher K means more stability.

If that's the case, then the K for each complex is βn, not the product.

So then, the fractions would be:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum_{i=1 to 4} β_i [SCN]^i )

So let's recalculate with this assumption.

Compute each term:

i=1: β1 [L]^1 =9 *0.1 =0.9

i=2: β2 [L]^2 =40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

i=3: β3 [L]^3=63*(0.001)=0.063

i=4: β4 [L]^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016

So denominator is 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 1 +0.9=1.9; 1.9+0.4=2.3; 2.3+0.063=2.363; 2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is ~2.3646.

Now f_2 = (0.4) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%. That's option D.

Wait, but earlier when I thought that K_n is the product, I was getting 5.5%, but with this approach, I get 16.9%, which is option D.

So which assumption is correct?

The problem states: "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Stability constants (formation constants) are typically given as the overall constant for the entire reaction. So if [Co(SCN)_n]^(x) has a stability constant βn, then K_n = βn.

In that case, the approach where each K_n is βn, not the product, would be correct.

So in that case, the fraction for the second complex is (40 * (0.1)^2 ) / denominator.

Which is 40*0.01=0.4.

Denominator is 1 +0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016=2.3646.

So 0.4/2.3646≈0.169, 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, why did I get confused earlier? Because sometimes, the stability constant is given for each step, but in this case, the problem says they are the stability constants for the complexes. So each βn is the K for forming [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) from Co^2+ and n SCN^-.

So the correct approach is to treat each βn as the overall K for the nth complex. Thus, the fractions would be as calculated.

So the correct answer is D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]^0) in the solution, we calculate the fraction of the second complex among all cobalt species. The stability constants provided are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16, which are the overall stability constants for the complexes [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^−, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, respectively. The [SCN^-] concentration is 0.1 M, and the total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M.

The fraction of each complex is given by:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{1 + \sum_{i=1}^{4} \beta_i [\text{SCN}]^i}
\]

### Step 1: Compute the terms in the denominator
For each complex, calculate \(\beta_i [\text{SCN}]^i\):
- \(i=1\): \(\beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9\)
- \(i=2\): \(\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4\)
- \(i=3\): \(\beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063\)
- \(i=4\): \(\beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016\)

The denominator is the sum of all terms:
\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction of the second complex
The fraction of the second complex is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{\text{denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
