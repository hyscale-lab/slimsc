Okay, so I have this question about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology, and I need to find which statement is incorrect. Let's think through each option.

The question asks which statement is NOT correct. So I'll go through each option one by one.

Option A: It says that nsp10 and nsp14-ExoN work as heterodimers in a mismatch repair. Wait, I remember that nsp14 has an ExoN domain and that nsp10 is a cofactor. The nsp14's N-terminal ExoN might bind to nsp10, forming a complex. Oh, but wait, their function is in mismatch repair? Or is it more about RNA editing or something else? I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, I think some coronaviruses have a replication proofreading system. Oh right, the nsp10/nsp14 complex might be involved in RNA editing, but mismatch repair is more of a DNA repair process. Wait, but coronaviruses have an RNA replication, so maybe they have a way to correct errors. Alternatively, perhaps the statement is correct because it's part of their replication mechanism.

Option B: ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation, which is part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. The extrinsic pathway uses death receptors, like FAS or TNF receptors, and caspase-8 gets activated. Bcl-2 is involved in the intrinsic pathway because it controls mitochondrial permeability. So if ORF3a doesn't affect Bcl-2 levels, then the apoptosis is via extrinsic. I think this is correct because I've read that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a can induce apoptosis, possibly through caspase-8, which is death receptor-mediated. So B seems correct.

Option C: Frameshifting rate is linear with the number of pseudoknot conformations. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have two conformations under tension. Frameshifting is a process where ribosomes shift reading frames, often via structures like pseudoknots. I remember that the frameshifting efficiency depends on the structure's ability to form different conformations, which can affect how the ribosome moves. So if a pseudoknot has two conformations, it might allow for more efficient frameshifting. So C is probably correct.

Option D: Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near the 5' end by shifting back 1 nucleotide with slippery nucleotides and a pseudoknot. Wait, the 5' end or the 3' end? Wait, SARS-CoV-2's genome is positive-sense, and the 5' end has the ORF1a/b, which encodes a polyprotein. Frameshifting usually occurs in the 5' region to switch from one protein to another. So the frameshifting is near the 5' end, yes. But does it shift back by 1 or forward? Wait, frameshifting is about the ribosome moving forward or backward. In most cases, like in SARS-CoV, it's a +1 frameshift. So the ribosome moves ahead by one nucleotide, not back. The statement says 'moving back by 1 nucleotide' which would imply a -1 frameshift. That doesn't sound right. Because shifting back would mean the ribosome misses a codon, which is less common. So D's statement might be incorrect. 

Wait, what's the correct frameshifting direction? I think in SARS-CoV-2, the ribosome shifts forward by one nucleotide. So the description in D is wrong because it says the ribosome moves back. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but let me double-check. Frameshifting is when the ribosome shifts, either forward or backward, relative to the mRNA. In the case of SARS-CoV, the frameshift is a +1, meaning the ribosome moves forward one nucleotide. So the description in D says 'moving back', which would be a -1 shift. That's incorrect. So statement D is wrong.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is incorrect. So the wrong statement would be D.

Alternatively, let me think again. The question is about the exception. So the incorrect statement is D.

So the correct answer is D. Because it says the ribosome moves back by 1 nucleotide, which is incorrect. It should be moving forward.

To determine which statement about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology is incorrect, each option is analyzed as follows:

**Option A:** The statement describes the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex as a heterodimer involved in mismatch repair. While nsp14 has an ExoN domain and nsp10 acts as a cofactor, their primary role is in RNA proofreading during replication, not mismatch repair, which is a DNA repair mechanism. This makes the statement potentially incorrect, but further clarification is needed.

**Option B:** ORF3a is described as triggering caspase-8 activation, a hallmark of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, while not affecting Bcl-2 levels, which are associated with the intrinsic pathway. This aligns with known mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-induced apoptosis, making this statement correct.

**Option C:** The statement links frameshifting rates to the number of pseudoknot conformations, noting that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have two conformations under tension. This is consistent with the role of pseudoknots in frameshifting, making this statement correct.

**Option D:** The statement claims that programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near the 5' end of the genome by moving back one nucleotide. However, frameshifting in SARS-CoV-2 involves a +1 shift (forward by one nucleotide), not a -1 shift (backward). This makes the statement incorrect.

Based on this analysis, the incorrect statement is **Option D**, as it inaccurately describes the direction of frameshifting.

**Answer: D**
