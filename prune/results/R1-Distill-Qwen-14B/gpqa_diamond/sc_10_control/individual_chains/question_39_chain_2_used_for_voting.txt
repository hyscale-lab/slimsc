Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measured the positions, none were found at x < 1 or x > 3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, wait. In quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition. That is, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Because this describes the probability distribution, right?

So the wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but I should check if this is correct. Because I remember wave functions usually are complex, but the square of the absolute value is real and positive. So the absolute square is |ψ(x)|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because (a/sqrt(1+x)) is the real part and -0.5i is the imaginary part.

Wait, but wait. Actually, I'm a bit confused. The wave function is a complex function, ψ(x) = real part + imaginary part. The absolute square is [real]^2 + [imaginary]^2. So the probability density is |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

But wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when you square the absolute value, it's [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2.

So the normalization condition is the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 equals 1.

So the integral becomes ∫ from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me write that as the equation: ∫₁³ [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this integral into two parts. The integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

Let me compute each part.

First, the integral of a²/(1+x) dx. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|, so:

a² * [ ln(1+x) ] evaluated from 1 to 3. So that's a² (ln(4) - ln(2)) = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), and ln(2) is subtracted, so 2 ln 2 - ln 2 = ln 2. So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Second part: integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So adding both parts: a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, what's the value of ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a is the square root of that. Let me compute sqrt(0.7213).

Well, sqrt(0.72) is about 0.8485. Let me check: 0.8485 squared is approximately 0.72.

So a is approximately 0.8485. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. Option A is 1.1, which is much higher. Option C is 0.35, which is lower. Option D is 0.6, which is lower.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the setup. Because in the wave function given, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when we compute |ψ|², it's [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So that part is correct.

Wait, but I think I messed up the setup a bit. Let me re-express the equation:

The integral from 1 to3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

Wait, (0.5)^2 is 0.25, yes.

So the integral is:

a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 + 0.25*(3-1) = 1.

Which gives a² (ln(4) - ln(2)) ) + 0.5 =1.

Which is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a²=0.5/(ln2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Hmm, so option B is 0.85, which is very close.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me compute 0.5 / ln(2) numerically.

ln(2) is approximately 0.69314718056.

0.5 / 0.69314718056 ≈ 0.72134752044.

Square root of 0.72134752044 is about 0.8493.

So 0.8493 is approximately 0.85, which is option B.

But wait, let me check if I have any other possible mistake. For example, perhaps the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i, but when taking the absolute square, the real part is a / sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute [a/(sqrt(1+x)) ]^2 + [ (-0.5) ]^2, which is correct as I did.

Yes, that seems right.

So the answer should be option B) 0.85.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 0.35 and option D is 0.6. So 0.85 is the closest. So yeah, the correct answer is B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function in quantum mechanics. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the region where the particle exists (from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \)) equals 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx
   \]  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \), so:

   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is closest to \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Hmm, wait. In quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition. That is, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Because this describes the probability distribution, right?

So the wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but I should check if this is correct. Because I remember wave functions usually are complex, but the square of the absolute value is real and positive. So the absolute square is |ψ(x)|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because (a/sqrt(1+x)) is the real part and -0.5i is the imaginary part.

Wait, but wait. Actually, I'm a bit confused. The wave function is a complex function, ψ(x) = real part + imaginary part. The absolute square is [real]^2 + [imaginary]^2. So the probability density is |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

But wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when you square the absolute value, it's [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2.

So the normalization condition is the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 equals 1.

So the integral becomes ∫ from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me write that as the equation: ∫₁³ [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this integral into two parts. The integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

Let me compute each part.

First, the integral of a²/(1+x) dx. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|, so:

a² * [ ln(1+x) ] evaluated from 1 to 3. So that's a² (ln(4) - ln(2)) = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), and ln(2) is subtracted, so 2 ln 2 - ln 2 = ln 2. So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Second part: integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So adding both parts: a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, what's the value of ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a is the square root of that. Let me compute sqrt(0.7213).

Well, sqrt(0.72) is about 0.8485. Let me check: 0.8485 squared is approximately 0.72.

So a is approximately 0.8485. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. Option A is 1.1, which is much higher. Option C is 0.35, which is lower. Option D is 0.6, which is lower.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the setup. Because in the wave function given, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when we compute |ψ|², it's [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So that part is correct.

Wait, but I think I messed up the setup a bit. Let me re-express the equation:

The integral from 1 to3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

Wait, (0.5)^2 is 0.25, yes.

So the integral is:

a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 + 0.25*(3-1) = 1.

Which gives a² (ln(4) - ln(2)) ) + 0.5 =1.

Which is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a²=0.5/(ln2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Hmm, so option B is 0.85, which is very close.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me compute 0.5 / ln(2) numerically.

ln(2) is approximately 0.69314718056.

0.5 / 0.69314718056 ≈ 0.72134752044.

Square root of 0.72134752044 is about 0.8493.

So 0.8493 is approximately 0.85, which is option B.

But wait, let me check if I have any other possible mistake. For example, perhaps the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i, but when taking the absolute square, the real part is a / sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute [a/(sqrt(1+x)) ]^2 + [ (-0.5) ]^2, which is correct as I did.

Yes, that seems right.

So the answer should be option B) 0.85.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 0.35 and option D is 0.6. So 0.85 is the closest. So yeah, the correct answer is B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function in quantum mechanics. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the region where the particle exists (from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \)) equals 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx
   \]  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \), so:

   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is closest to \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
