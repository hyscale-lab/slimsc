Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's take a deep breath and tackle this step by step.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a certain reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the reaction called the Hittig reaction, but wait, isn't HI a strong acid? Oh right, another possibility is that this is a reaction involving the opening of epoxides, but wait, the molecule doesn't have an epoxide. Oh wait, maybe it's a diels-alder reaction, but no, that's usually with dienes and dienophiles. Wait, maybe it's a hydration or a reaction with a carbonyl group.

Wait, the reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, wait, I think I remember something about this. Red phosphorus reacts with iodine to form phosphorus triiodide (PI3), which is a reagent used in the Wittig reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction, but that usually uses a different setup. Oh wait, no, the Horner reaction uses phosphonate esters. Back to the question: red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the formation of a ylide? Or more likely, the reagent here is for deoxygenative cleavage of carbonyl groups?

Wait, another thought: when a carbonyl (like a ketone or aldehyde) is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it might undergo a reduction. Wait, but red phosphorus is a reducing agent sometimes. Alternatively, I think that when alkenes are treated with HI, they undergo addition reactions. But wait, the reagent here is HI and red phosphorus. Let me think.

Wait, maybe it's about the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But that's not the same as this. Oh, maybe it's the Wolff-Kishner reaction, which uses ammonia, heat, and something else to reduce ketones to alkanes. No, Wolff-Kishner uses hydrazine and strong base. Hmm.

Wait, I'm probably overcomplicating this. Let me think about the structure of the starting molecule. The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the cyclohexene part has a double bond at position 3, and substituents at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so the substituent is -CH2CH2? No, wait, the substituent is -CH2CH2? Wait, no, the substituent is a vinyl group, so it's -(CH2CH2)? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH– as a substituent. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene), and at position 2, a carbonyl (formyl) group, and at position 5, a vinyl group (-CH2CH2?), wait no, substituents on the ring would be CH2CH2-? No, wait, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is a CH2CH2 group attached to the ring with a double bond. Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH2=CH– attached to the ring. So the ring is substituted at positions 2 and 5.

Wait, perhaps drawing a rough structure would help. So, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. At C2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at C5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2 with a double bond?), but wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH– attached to the ring. So the ring has substituents at 2 and 5, and a double bond between 3 and 4.

Now, when this reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Wait, what's the reaction here? Red phosphorus with HI – I think this is the formation of a ylide. Wait, no, that's more in the context of the Wittig reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's the reduction of the cyclohexene ring's double bond. Oh, wait, wait. Red phosphorus and HI can cause the opening of epoxides, but this compound doesn't have an epoxide group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the diene part undergoing some reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the addition of HI to the double bonds in the molecule. So, if there are any alkenes present, they could undergo addition. Let's see: the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (so a double bond), and a vinyl group (another double bond). So two double bonds in the molecule.

Red phosphorus and HI: I think this is a dehydrohalogenation scenario, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihydroxylation, but that usually uses different reagents. Wait, another thought: when a dienophile or diene is treated with HI and a reducing agent, maybe it's a hydrogenation. But red phosphorus isn't a catalyst for hydrogenation. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the hydration of the double bond. No, that would require acid and water, perhaps. Alternatively, the addition of HI to the double bonds. So, if the starting material has two double bonds, would they both react?

Wait, but the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring has a double bond, and the vinyl group (which is CH2CH2? No, wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH–. So the substituent at C5 is a vinyl group, which is another double bond. So the molecule has two double bonds: the cyclohexene ring (C3-C4 double bond) and the vinyl group (C5 substituent: CH2=CH– attached to the ring).

So, when this is treated with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? I think red phosphorus and HI form phosphorus triiodide (PI3), which is a good nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the hydroiodination of the double bonds.

Wait, but wait: the starting material has two double bonds (the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group), and the reaction conditions are with HI. So perhaps each of these double bonds will add HI.

Wait, let's consider each double bond:

1. The cyclohexene ring (C3-C4 double bond) would add HI across the double bond, leading to a diol? No, wait, adding HI to an alkene would typically give an addition product. For example, cyclohexene with HI would add HI across the double bond, giving a cyclohexane diiodide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the opening of the double bond, adding two iodines.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each possible reaction.

The main reaction I think is relevant here is the addition of HI to the double bonds. Each double bond would add HI, turning each into a single bond with adjacent iodines.

So the product would have both double bonds saturated.

Wait, but let me think again. The starting molecule has two double bonds: the cyclohexene ring (cyclohex-3-ene) and the vinyl group (CH2=CH–). So the vinyl group is a substituent on the ring.

So, when HI adds to each double bond, the cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane with two adjacent I atoms, and the vinyl group would become CH2-I and CH2-I adjacent? Wait, no, adding HI to a double bond gives a diiodide. So for each double bond, we add two iodine atoms.

Wait, but wait: when a double bond reacts with HI, it's an acid-catalyzed addition. For example, cyclohexene + HI → cyclohexane with adjacent I and H. But in this case, the reaction is with excess HI and red phosphorus. Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation, but that uses OsO4. Alternatively, is it a hydration reaction? No, that would require H2O and an acid catalyst.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide, but that's not applicable here. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reagents again. Red phosphorus and excess HI: I think I've heard that this is used in the Birch reduction, but Birch uses ammonia and a metal. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Clemmensen reduction, but that uses Zn(Hg)/HCl.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to the alkenes. So each double bond would add two iodide groups. So the cyclohexene ring would become a cyclohexane with two adjacent iodide substituents, and the vinyl group would become a CH2I-CH2I group.

Wait, but adding HI across each double bond would lead to each double bond becoming a single bond with adjacent I and H groups. But considering that the molecule has two double bonds, each would undergo addition, leading to four new bonds (two from each addition of HI).

Wait, but maybe I'm mistaken. Let me think: adding HI to a double bond (like in cyclohexene) would form a vicinal dihalide. So cyclohexene + HI → cyclohexane diiodide. Similarly, the vinyl group would add HI, turning into CH2I-CH2I.

So the product would have the cyclohexane ring with two adjacent I atoms, and a substituent that is a -CH2I-CH2I group.

Wait, but wait: the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So after adding HI to both double bonds, the formyl group (CHO) would perhaps be reduced? Wait, formyl groups (CHO) are aldehydes. If HI is used with a reducing agent, like red phosphorus, perhaps the aldehyde group is reduced.

Ah! Wait, so red phosphorus and HI can also reduce carbonyl groups. I think I've heard of the reduction of ketones and aldehydes using HI and red phosphorus. So the formyl group (CHO) would be reduced to a CH2I group.

Wait, but let me think: the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI. I think that's the standard reagent for the reduction of carbonyl groups to CH2I. So, when an aldehyde or ketone is treated with red phosphorus and HI, the carbonyl group is converted into a CH2I group. So the formyl group (CHO) would become CH2I.

So putting it all together:

1. The cyclohexene ring (C3-C4 double bond) would add HI, becoming a cyclohexane diiodide (adjacent I atoms on C3 and C4).

2. The vinyl group (CH2=CH– at C5) would add HI, becoming CH2I-CH2I as a substituent.

3. The formyl group (CHO) at C2 would be reduced to CH2I.

Wait, but wait: the formyl group is at C2. So when reduced, it becomes CH2I. So the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (no double bonds anymore)
- At C2: a CH2I group (from the formyl)
- At C5: a -CH2I-CH2I substituent (from the vinyl)
- And the carboxylic acid group (COOH) is probably unaffected, as it's a strong acid and not reactive in this condition.

Wait, but wait: the starting molecule is a carboxylic acid. So 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So after the reaction, the carboxylic acid (COOH) remains as is because it's not reactive under these conditions. But the formyl (CHO) is reduced to CH2I, the cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, the vinyl group adds HI twice.

So the product would have the structure:

cyclohexane ring (single bonds), with substituents:

- At C2: CH2I
- At C5: CH2I-CH2I
- And the COOH group at position 1 (as it's a cyclohexene, so the numbering would be such that the COOH is at position 1, but I'm not entirely sure about the numbering here).

Wait, but wait: the initial structure is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, since the numbering starts from the carboxylic acid. So the substituents are at positions 2 (CHO), 3 (double bond), 5 (vinyl). So after the reaction, the double bonds are all saturated, and the carbonyl is converted.

So the product would have:

- At C2: CH2I
- The ring is cyclohexane
- At C5: CH2I-CH2I (from the vinyl group adding two I atoms)
- COOH at C1

Now, the question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation. IHD is calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H the hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens. But in this case, the product has iodine atoms, which are X.

Wait, but wait, when calculating IHD, do we count X as hydrogens? Or is it treated differently?

Wait, I think the formula is IHD = (2C +2 - H + X - N)/2. Because each X (halogen) is considered as a hydrogen equivalent in this formula. So when X is present, it adds to H.

Wait, no, let me get this right. The formula for IHD is:

IHD = [2C + 2 - H - X + N]/2

Where:
C = number of carbon atoms
H = number of hydrogen atoms
X = number of halogens
N = number of nitrogen atoms

So, for the product, I need to count C, H, X (I), and N.

But wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down the structure.

The molecule is cyclohexene (6 carbons) with substituents:

- At C2: formyl group (CHO) → 1 carbon (so total so far: 6 +1 + (vinyl group is 2 carbons) + 1 (carboxylic acid is part of the cyclohexane) → wait, no, the cyclohexane is 6 carbons, but the substituents are attached to it. So the total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) + 2 (COOH is -COOH, which is O and O but carbons? Wait, COOH is -COOH, which is one carbon (the carboxylic acid is part of the cyclohexane ring, so as a substituent, it's the carbonyl and the OH. So the ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents are:

- CHO (1 C)
- CH2CH2 (vinyl is CH2=CH–, so 2 Cs)
- COOH (which is -COOH, so 2 O's but 1 C (the carbonyl C))

Wait, wait, the carboxylic acid is part of the ring. So the structure is cyclohexene with substituents at C2 (CHO), C5 (CH2CH2), and the ring has a carboxylic acid group at a certain position (probably C1). So the total carbons in the starting molecule would be 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 9 carbons? No, because the ring itself is 6 carbons, and each substituent adds their own carbons. So the CHO is 1, vinyl is 2, and the COOH is part of the ring, so it's a substituent on the ring, adding one more carbon (the one where the COOH is attached). Wait, no, the COOH is -COOH attached to the ring, so that's one carbon (the ring's C is connected to a carbonyl group and an OH group). So the ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents are:

- At C2: 1 C (CHO)
- At C5: 2 C (vinyl group)
- At the COOH position (probably C1): 1 C (the carbonyl group is double-bonded to O, and the OH is attached).

Wait, perhaps it's better to count the total carbons in the product.

In the product, after reaction, the substituents would be:

- At C2: CH2I (1 C)
- At C5: CH2I-CH2I (2 C)
- The COOH remains as -COOH (1 C)

So the total carbons: ring (6) + C2 (1) + C5 (2) + COOH (1) → 6+1+2+1=10? Or wait, because the ring is 6, and each substituent is attached to it, not adding to the ring's carbons. So perhaps the substituents are just additions, so the total carbons are 6 (ring) +1 (CHO) +2 (vinyl) in the starting material, but in the product, CHO becomes CH2I (still 1 C), vinyl becomes CH2I-CH2I (2 C), and the COOH is 1 C. So the product would have 6 (ring) +1 (CH2I) +2 (CH2I-CH2I) +1 (COOH) = 10 C.

Wait, no, because the ring is 6 carbons, and each substituent is attached to the ring but doesn't add to the ring's count. So the substituents are:

CHO → CH2I (1 C)
vinyl → CH2I-CH2I (2 C)
COOH is part of the ring, so it's one C (the ring's carbon connected to COOH).

So total C in product: 6 (ring) +1 (CH2I) +2 (CH2I-CH2I) + 0 (since COOH is already part of the ring) → 6+3=9? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just count all the carbons in the product.

Wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down: cyclohexene has 6 carbons. The substituents are:

- At C2: formyl (CHO) → 1 C
- At C5: vinyl (CH2=CH–) → 2 C (since it's a two-carbon substituent)
- The carboxylic acid is at another position, perhaps C1 → 1 C (but this is part of the ring, so maybe the total is 6 +1 +2 +1? No, because the ring is 6, and substituents are attached to it.)

Wait, perhaps the initial molecule has 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) =9 carbons. Because the COOH is part of the ring's carbon, so it's just the substituent (the -COOH is attached to the ring, which is already counted in the 6 carbons). So the starting material has 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) =9 C.

After reaction:

CHO → CH2I → 1 C
Vinyl → CH2I-CH2I → 2 C
COOH remains → 1 C (but it's part of the ring, so maybe not an additional C)
So the product has 6 (ring) +1 (CH2I) +2 (CH2I-CH2I) =9 C.

Now, let's count the H, X (I), and N.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to think that the product has no double bonds left, so the IHD should be zero? Because all double bonds have been saturated.

Wait, but wait: the starting material has two double bonds (cyclohexene and vinyl group), each contributing 1 to the IHD. So the starting IHD is 2 (one from the ring, one from the vinyl). After the reaction, both double bonds are saturated, so IHD would be zero.

Wait, but wait: the formyl group (CHO) is a double bond (C=O), which is another degree of unsaturation. So the starting IHD is 3: one from the cyclohexene double bond, one from the vinyl double bond, and one from the carbonyl group of the formyl.

Wait, no, the formyl group is CHO: that's a carbonyl (C=O), which is a double bond, so that's another degree of unsaturation. So starting IHD is 3.

After reaction, the formyl (C=O) is reduced to CH2I, which is a single bond. The cyclohexene and vinyl groups both add HI, becoming single bonds.

So in the product, all double bonds would be gone. So the IHD would drop from 3 to 0.

Wait, but wait, the carboxylic acid group (COOH) has a carbonyl (C=O), but that's a double bond. So in the starting material, the COOH contributes to IHD. So the starting material's IHD is:

- Cyclohexene: 1
- Vinyl group: 1
- Formyl group: 1 (C=O)
- COOH: 1 (C=O)
So total IHD is 4?

Wait, no. The formula is:

Each ring or double bond = 1
Each triple bond = 2
Each C=O =1

So for the starting material:

Cyclohexene (1 ring double bond) → 1
Vinyl group (another double bond) → 1
Formyl group (C=O) → 1
COOH (C=O) → 1
So total IHD is 4.

But wait, the COOH is a substituent on the ring, so the ring is a six-membered with one double bond contributing 1. The substituents have their own double bonds.

Wait, but the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the structure is cyclohexene (1 double bond) plus the formyl (C=O) and vinyl (another double bond) → 3 double bonds. So IHD is 3.

Wait, the COOH is a substituent on the ring, so it's another C=O group, making it a fourth double bond.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let's think again:

The molecule is a cyclohexene ring (one double bond), with substituents:

- At C2: formyl group (CHO) → C=O, another double bond
- At C5: vinyl group (CH2=CH–) → another double bond
- At C1 (assuming): COOH group → another C=O, another double bond.

So four double bonds in total. So IHD is 4.

After reaction, the formyl (CHO) becomes CH2I → single bond → no double bond. The vinyl group (CH2=CH–) becomes CH2I-CH2I → single bond → no double bond. The cyclohexene ring becomes cyclohexane → single bond. The COOH group remains → still C=O, which is a double bond.

Wait, so in the product, the COOH group's C=O is still present. So the product would have one double bond remaining (from COOH), which contributes 1 to IHD.

Wait, but wait: the reaction conditions are with excess HI and red phosphorus. Could the COOH group be affected? I don't think so. Because the COOH is a strong acid, but in the presence of HI (a strong acid), perhaps it would protonate, but I don't think it would react under these conditions. So the COOH's C=O remains.

So the product would have one double bond (from COOH), so IHD is 1.

Wait, but earlier I thought the product would have no double bonds, but that's not correct because COOH still has a C=O.

Wait, let's recount:

In the product, after reaction:

- The cyclohexene ring → cyclohexane (no double bond)
- The vinyl group → CH2I-CH2I (no double bond)
- The formyl group → CH2I (no double bond)
- The COOH group → still has C=O (so one double bond)

So the product has one double bond (from COOH), so IHD is 1.

So the answer would be option A) 1.

Wait, but let me confirm:

Original structure:

- Cyclohexene (1)
- Formyl (CHO) (1)
- Vinyl (CH2=CH–) (1)
- COOH (1)
→ Total IHD: 4.

After reaction:

- Cyclohexane (0)
- CH2I (0)
- CH2I-CH2I (0)
- COOH (1)
→ So IHD is 1.

Thus, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 1, so the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The starting material contains the following structural features:

1. A cyclohexene ring with a double bond (C3-C4).
2. A formyl group (CHO) at position 2.
3. A vinyl group (CH2=CH–) at position 5.
4. A carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 1.

### Reaction Analysis:
- **Red phosphorus and excess HI** are reagents commonly used to reduce carbonyl groups (e.g., aldehydes and ketones) to CH2I. Additionally, the double bonds in the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group are expected to undergo saturation.
- The reaction converts:
  - The formyl group (CHO) to CH2I.
  - The cyclohexene ring (C3-C4 double bond) to a single bond.
  - The vinyl group (CH2=CH–) to CH2I-CH2I.
- The carboxylic acid group (COOH) remains unaffected, as it is not reactive under these conditions and retains its C=O double bond.

### Product Structure:
The product will have:
- A cyclohexane ring (no double bonds).
- A CH2I group at position 2 (from the reduction of the formyl group).
- A CH2I-CH2I group at position 5 (from the saturation of the vinyl group).
- A COOH group at position 1, which retains its C=O double bond.

### Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):
The IHD is calculated based on the number of double bonds, rings, and triple bonds in the molecule. Each double bond or ring contributes 1 to the IHD, while each triple bond contributes 2. For the product:
- The cyclohexane ring has no double bonds.
- The CH2I group and CH2I-CH2I group are fully saturated.
- The COOH group retains one double bond (C=O).

Thus, the product has **1 double bond** (from the COOH group), and the IHD is **1**.

### Final Answer:
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's take a deep breath and tackle this step by step.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a certain reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the reaction called the Hittig reaction, but wait, isn't HI a strong acid? Oh right, another possibility is that this is a reaction involving the opening of epoxides, but wait, the molecule doesn't have an epoxide. Oh wait, maybe it's a diels-alder reaction, but no, that's usually with dienes and dienophiles. Wait, maybe it's a hydration or a reaction with a carbonyl group.

Wait, the reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, wait, I think I remember something about this. Red phosphorus reacts with iodine to form phosphorus triiodide (PI3), which is a reagent used in the Wittig reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction, but that usually uses a different setup. Oh wait, no, the Horner reaction uses phosphonate esters. Back to the question: red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the formation of a ylide? Or more likely, the reagent here is for deoxygenative cleavage of carbonyl groups?

Wait, another thought: when a carbonyl (like a ketone or aldehyde) is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it might undergo a reduction. Wait, but red phosphorus is a reducing agent sometimes. Alternatively, I think that when alkenes are treated with HI, they undergo addition reactions. But wait, the reagent here is HI and red phosphorus. Let me think.

Oh, maybe it's the Wolff-Kishner reaction, which uses ammonia, heat, and something else to reduce ketones to alkanes. No, Wolff-Kishner uses hydrazine and strong base. Hmm.

Wait, I'm probably overcomplicating this. Let me think about the structure of the starting molecule. The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the cyclohexene part has a double bond at position 3, and substituents at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so the substituent is -CH2CH2? No, wait, the substituent is -CH2CH2? Wait, no, the substituent is a vinyl group, so it's -(CH2CH2)? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH– as a substituent. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene), and at position 2, a carbonyl (formyl) group, and at position 5, a vinyl group (-CH2CH2?), wait no, substituents on the ring would be CH2CH2-? No, wait, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is a CH2CH2 group attached to the ring with a double bond. Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH2=CH– attached to the ring. So the ring is substituted at positions 2 and 5.

Wait, perhaps drawing a rough structure would help. So, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. At C2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at C5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2 with a double bond?), but wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH– attached to the ring. So the ring has substituents at 2 and 5, and a double bond between 3 and 4.

Now, when this reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Wait, what's the reaction here? Red phosphorus with HI – I think this is the formation of a ylide. Wait, no, that's more in the context of the Wittig reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's the reduction of the cyclohexene ring's double bond. Oh, wait, wait. Red phosphorus and HI can cause the opening of epoxides, but this compound doesn't have an epoxide group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the diene part undergoing some reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the addition of HI to the double bonds in the molecule. So, if there are any alkenes present, they could undergo addition. Let's see: the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (so a double bond), and a vinyl group (another double bond). So two double bonds in the molecule.

Red phosphorus and HI: I think this is a dehydrohalogenation scenario, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihydroxylation, but that usually uses different reagents. Wait, another thought: when a dienophile or diene is treated with HI and a reducing agent, maybe it's a hydrogenation. But red phosphorus isn't a catalyst for hydrogenation. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the hydration of the double bond. No, that would require acid and water, perhaps. Alternatively, the addition of HI to the double bonds. So, if the starting material has two double bonds, would they both react?

Wait, but the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring has a double bond, and the vinyl group (which is CH2CH2? No, wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH–. So the substituent at C5 is a vinyl group, which is another double bond. So the molecule has two double bonds: the cyclohexene ring (C3-C4 double bond) and the vinyl group (C5 substituent: CH2=CH– attached to the ring).

So, when this is treated with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? I think red phosphorus and HI form phosphorus triiodide (PI3), which is a good nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the hydroiodination of the double bonds.

Wait, but wait: the starting material has two double bonds (the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group), and the reaction conditions are with HI. So perhaps each of these double bonds will add HI.

Wait, let's consider each double bond:

1. The cyclohexene ring (C3-C4 double bond) would add HI across the double bond, leading to a diol? No, wait, adding HI to an alkene would typically give an addition product. For example, cyclohexene with HI would add HI across the double bond, giving a cyclohexane diiodide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the opening of the double bond, adding two iodines.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each possible reaction.

The main reaction I think is relevant here is the addition of HI to the double bonds. Each double bond would add HI, turning each into a single bond with adjacent iodines.

So the product would have both double bonds saturated.

Wait, but let me think again. The starting molecule has two double bonds: the cyclohexene ring (cyclohex-3-ene) and the vinyl group (CH2=CH–). So the vinyl group is a substituent on the ring.

So, when HI adds to each double bond, the cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane with two adjacent I atoms, and the vinyl group would become CH2-I and CH2-I adjacent? Wait, no, adding HI to a double bond gives a diiodide. So for each double bond, we add two iodine atoms.

Wait, but wait: when a double bond reacts with HI, it's an acid-catalyzed addition. For example, cyclohexene + HI → cyclohexane with adjacent I and H. But in this case, the reaction is with excess HI and red phosphorus. Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation, but that uses OsO4. Alternatively, is it a hydration reaction? No, that would require H2O and an acid catalyst.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide, but that's not applicable here. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reagents again. Red phosphorus and excess HI: I think I've heard that this is used in the Birch reduction, but Birch uses ammonia and a metal. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Clemmensen reduction, but that uses Zn(Hg)/HCl.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to the alkenes. So each double bond would add two iodide groups. So the cyclohexene ring would become a cyclohexane with two adjacent iodide substituents, and the vinyl group would become a CH2I-CH2I group.

Wait, but adding HI across each double bond would lead to each double bond becoming a single bond with adjacent I and H groups. But considering that the molecule has two double bonds, each would undergo addition, leading to four new bonds (two from each addition of HI).

Wait, but maybe I'm mistaken. Let me think: adding HI to a double bond (like in cyclohexene) would form a vicinal dihalide. So cyclohexene + HI → cyclohexane diiodide. Similarly, the vinyl group would add HI, turning into CH2I-CH2I.

So the product would have the cyclohexane ring with two adjacent I atoms, and a substituent that is a -CH2I-CH2I group.

Wait, but wait: the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So after adding HI to both double bonds, the formyl group (CHO) would perhaps be reduced? Wait, formyl groups (CHO) are aldehydes. If HI is used with a reducing agent, like red phosphorus, perhaps the aldehyde group is reduced.

Ah! Wait, so red phosphorus and HI can also reduce carbonyl groups. I think I've heard of the reduction of ketones and aldehydes using HI and red phosphorus. So the formyl group (CHO) would be reduced to a CH2I group.

Wait, but let me think: the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI. I think that's the standard reagent for the reduction of carbonyl groups to CH2I. So, when an aldehyde or ketone is treated with red phosphorus and HI, the carbonyl group is converted into a CH2I group. So the formyl group (CHO) would become CH2I.

So putting it all together:

1. The cyclohexene ring (C3-C4 double bond) would add HI, becoming a cyclohexane diiodide (adjacent I atoms on C3 and C4).

2. The vinyl group (CH2=CH– at C5) would add HI, becoming CH2I-CH2I as a substituent.

3. The formyl group (CHO) at C2 would be reduced to CH2I.

Wait, but wait: the formyl group is at C2. So when reduced, it becomes CH2I. So the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (no double bonds anymore)
- At C2: a CH2I group (from the formyl)
- At C5: a -CH2I-CH2I substituent (from the vinyl)
- And the carboxylic acid group (COOH) is probably unaffected, as it's a strong acid and not reactive in this condition.

Wait, but wait: the starting molecule is a carboxylic acid. So 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So after the reaction, the carboxylic acid (COOH) remains as is because it's not reactive under these conditions. But the formyl (CHO) is reduced to CH2I, the cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, the vinyl group adds HI twice.

So the product would have the structure:

cyclohexane ring (single bonds), with substituents:

- At C2: CH2I
- At C5: CH2I-CH2I
- And the COOH group at position 1 (as it's a cyclohexene, so the numbering would be such that the COOH is at position 1, but I'm not entirely sure about the numbering here).

Wait, but wait: the initial structure is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, since the numbering starts from the carboxylic acid. So the substituents are at positions 2 (CHO), 3 (double bond), 5 (vinyl). So after the reaction, the double bonds are all saturated, and the carbonyl is converted.

So the product would have:

- At C2: CH2I
- The ring is cyclohexane
- At C5: CH2I-CH2I (from the vinyl group adding two I atoms)
- COOH at C1

Now, the question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation. IHD is calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H the hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens. But in this case, the product has iodine atoms, which are X.

Wait, but wait, when calculating IHD, do we count X as hydrogens? Or is it treated differently?

Wait, I think the formula is IHD = (2C +2 - H + X - N)/2. Because each X (halogen) is considered as a hydrogen equivalent in this formula. So when X is present, it adds to H.

Wait, no, let me get this right. The formula for IHD is:

IHD = [2C + 2 - H - X + N]/2

Where:
C = number of carbon atoms
H = number of hydrogen atoms
X = number of halogens
N = number of nitrogen atoms

So, for the product, I need to count C, H, X (I), and N.

But wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down the structure.

The molecule is cyclohexene (6 carbons) with substituents:

- At C2: formyl group (CHO) → 1 carbon (so total so far: 6 +1 + (vinyl group is 2 carbons) + 1 (carboxylic acid is part of the cyclohexane) → wait, no, the cyclohexane is 6 carbons, but the substituents are attached to it. So the total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) + 2 (COOH is -COOH, which is O and O but carbons? Wait, COOH is -COOH, which is one carbon (the carboxylic acid is part of the cyclohexane ring, so as a substituent, it's the carbonyl and the OH. So the ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents are:

- CHO (1 C)
- CH2CH2 (vinyl is CH2=CH–, so 2 Cs)
- COOH (which is -COOH, so 2 O's but 1 C (the carbonyl C))

Wait, wait, the carboxylic acid is part of the ring. So the structure is cyclohexene with substituents at C2 (CHO), C5 (CH2CH2), and the ring has a carboxylic acid group at a certain position (probably C1). So the total carbons in the starting molecule would be 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 9 carbons? No, because the ring itself is 6 carbons, and each substituent adds their own carbons. So the CHO is 1, vinyl is 2, and the COOH is part of the ring, so it's a substituent on the ring, adding one more carbon (the one where the COOH is attached). Wait, no, the COOH is -COOH attached to the ring, so that's one carbon (the ring's C is connected to a carbonyl group and an OH group). So the ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents are:

- At C2: 1 C (CHO)
- At C5: 2 C (vinyl group)
- At the COOH position (probably C1): 1 C (the carbonyl group is double-bonded to O, and the OH is attached).

Wait, perhaps it's better to count the total carbons in the product.

In the product, after reaction, the substituents would be:

- At C2: CH2I (1 C)
- At C5: CH2I-CH2I (2 C)
- The COOH remains as -COOH (1 C)

So the total carbons: ring (6) + C2 (1) + C5 (2) + COOH (1) → 6+1+2+1=10? Or wait, because the ring is 6, and each substituent is attached to it, not adding to the ring's carbons. So perhaps the substituents are just additions, so the total carbons are 6 (ring) +1 (CHO) +2 (vinyl) in the starting material, but in the product, CHO becomes CH2I (still 1 C), vinyl becomes CH2I-CH2I (2 C), and the COOH is 1 C. So the product would have 6 (ring) +1 (CH2I) +2 (CH2I-CH2I) +1 (COOH) = 10 C.

Wait, no, because the ring is 6 carbons, and each substituent is attached to the ring but doesn't add to the ring's count. So the substituents are:

CHO → CH2I (1 C)
vinyl → CH2I-CH2I (2 C)
COOH is part of the ring, so it's one C (the ring's carbon connected to COOH).

So total C in product: 6 (ring) +1 (CH2I) +2 (CH2I-CH2I) + 0 (since COOH is already part of the ring) → 6+3=9? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just count all the carbons in the product.

Wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down: cyclohexene has 6 carbons. The substituents are:

- At C2: formyl (CHO) → 1 C
- At C5: vinyl (CH2=CH–) → 2 C (since it's a two-carbon substituent)
- The carboxylic acid is at another position, perhaps C1 → 1 C (but this is part of the ring, so maybe the total is 6 +1 +2 +1? No, because the ring is 6, and substituents are attached to it.)

Wait, perhaps the initial molecule has 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) =9 carbons. Because the COOH is part of the ring's carbon, so it's just the substituent (the -COOH is attached to the ring, which is already counted in the 6 carbons). So the starting material has 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) =9 C.

After reaction:

CHO → CH2I → 1 C
Vinyl → CH2I-CH2I → 2 C
COOH remains → 1 C (but it's part of the ring, so maybe not an additional C)
So the product has 6 (ring) +1 (CH2I) +2 (CH2I-CH2I) =9 C.

Now, let's count the H, X (I), and N.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to think that the product has no double bonds left, so the IHD should be zero? Because all double bonds have been saturated.

Wait, but wait: the starting material has two double bonds (cyclohexene and vinyl group), each contributing 1 to the IHD. So the starting IHD is 2 (one from the ring, one from the vinyl). After the reaction, both double bonds are saturated, so IHD would be zero.

Wait, but wait: the formyl group (CHO) is a double bond (C=O), which is another degree of unsaturation. So the starting IHD is 3: one from the cyclohexene double bond, one from the vinyl double bond, and one from the carbonyl group of the formyl.

Wait, no, the formyl group is CHO: that's a carbonyl (C=O), which is a double bond, so that's another degree of unsaturation. So starting IHD is 3.

After reaction, the formyl (C=O) is reduced to CH2I, which is a single bond. The cyclohexene and vinyl groups both add HI, becoming single bonds.

So in the product, all double bonds would be gone. So the IHD would drop from 3 to 0.

Wait, but wait, the carboxylic acid group (COOH) has a carbonyl (C=O), but that's a double bond. So in the starting material, the COOH contributes to IHD. So the starting material's IHD is:

- Cyclohexene: 1
- Vinyl group: 1
- Formyl group: 1 (C=O)
- COOH: 1 (C=O)
So total IHD is 4?

Wait, no. The formula is:

Each ring or double bond = 1
Each triple bond = 2
Each C=O =1

So for the starting material:

Cyclohexene (1 ring double bond) → 1
Vinyl group (another double bond) → 1
Formyl group (C=O) → 1
COOH (C=O) → 1
So total IHD is 4.

But wait, the COOH is a substituent on the ring, so the ring is a six-membered with one double bond contributing 1. The substituents have their own double bonds.

Wait, but the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the structure is cyclohexene (1 double bond) plus the formyl (C=O) and vinyl (another double bond) → 3 double bonds. So IHD is 3.

Wait, the COOH is a substituent on the ring, so it's another C=O group, making it a fourth double bond.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let's think again:

The molecule is a cyclohexene ring (one double bond), with substituents:

- At C2: formyl group (CHO) → C=O, another double bond
- At C5: vinyl group (CH2=CH–) → another double bond
- At C1 (assuming): COOH group → another C=O, another double bond.

So four double bonds in total. So IHD is 4.

After reaction, the formyl (CHO) becomes CH2I → single bond → no double bond. The vinyl group (CH2=CH–) becomes CH2I-CH2I → single bond → no double bond. The cyclohexene ring becomes cyclohexane → single bond. The COOH group remains → still C=O, which is a double bond.

Wait, so in the product, the COOH group's C=O is still present. So the product would have one double bond remaining (from COOH), which contributes 1 to IHD.

Wait, but wait: the reaction conditions are with excess HI and red phosphorus. Could the COOH group be affected? I don't think so. Because the COOH is a strong acid, but in the presence of HI (a strong acid), perhaps it would protonate, but I don't think it would react under these conditions. So the COOH's C=O remains.

So the product would have one double bond (from COOH), so IHD is 1.

Wait, but earlier I thought the product would have no double bonds, but that's not correct because COOH still has a C=O.

Wait, let's recount:

In the product, after reaction:

- The cyclohexene ring → cyclohexane (no double bond)
- The vinyl group → CH2I-CH2I (no double bond)
- The formyl group → CH2I (no double bond)
- The COOH group → still has C=O (so one double bond)

So the product has one double bond (from COOH), so IHD is 1.

So the answer would be option A) 1.

Wait, but let me confirm:

Original structure:

- Cyclohexene (1)
- Formyl (CHO) (1)
- Vinyl (CH2=CH–) (1)
- COOH (1)
→ Total IHD: 4.

After reaction:

- Cyclohexane (0)
- CH2I (0)
- CH2I-CH2I (0)
- COOH (1)
→ So IHD is 1.

Thus, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 1, so the correct answer is option A.


The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The starting material contains the following structural features:

1. A cyclohexene ring with a double bond (C3-C4).
2. A formyl group (CHO) at position 2.
3. A vinyl group (CH2=CH–) at position 5.
4. A carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 1.

### Reaction Analysis:
- **Red phosphorus and excess HI** are reagents commonly used to reduce carbonyl groups (e.g., aldehydes and ketones) to CH2I. Additionally, the double bonds in the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group are expected to undergo saturation.
- The reaction converts:
  - The formyl group (CHO) to CH2I.
  - The cyclohexene ring (C3-C4 double bond) to a single bond.
  - The vinyl group (CH2=CH–) to CH2I-CH2I.
- The carboxylic acid group (COOH) remains unaffected, as it is not reactive under these conditions and retains its C=O double bond.

### Product Structure:
The product will have:
- A cyclohexane ring (no double bonds).
- A CH2I group at position 2 (from the reduction of the formyl group).
- A CH2I-CH2I group at position 5 (from the saturation of the vinyl group).
- A COOH group at position 1, which retains its C=O double bond.

### Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):
The IHD is calculated based on the number of double bonds, rings, and triple bonds in the molecule. Each double bond or ring contributes 1 to the IHD, while each triple bond contributes 2. For the product:
- The cyclohexane ring has no double bonds.
- The CH2I group and CH2I-CH2I group are fully saturated.
- The COOH group retains one double bond (C=O).

Thus, the product has **1 double bond** (from the COOH group), and the IHD is **1**.

### Final Answer:
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**.
