Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see. The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. And the question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer. The options are A to D with various expressions.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects the speed of light observed, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

First, the index of refraction n determines the speed of light within the medium. Normally, when the medium isn't moving, the speed of light v_light in the medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So in this case, if the glass wasn't moving, the speed would be 1/n since c is given as 1.

But now the glass is moving at velocity v. So how does that affect the observed speed? I'm trying to recall if there's a relativistic effect here or if it's something simpler. Oh wait, maybe it's about adding velocities in classical mechanics, but that can't be right because the speed of light is supposed to be constant in all inertial frames according to Einstein. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the speed of light in the moving glass, not about the speed as observed from another frame. Or is it? Let me read the question again. It says, "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer." Oh, right, so the glass is moving, but the light is within the glass. So from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, what's the speed of the light beam?

Wait, but according to special relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame should be c. Oh wait, but no, because the light is inside a medium, which complicates things. Because in a medium, the speed is c/n. But when the medium is moving, does that affect the observed speed of light within it?

Wait, another approach: in the frame of the glass (which is moving at velocity v relative to the lab), the speed of light would be c/n. But in the lab frame, the glass is moving. So how would we transform the speed?

But I think this is tricky because light's speed doesn't just add like velocities in the classical way. The relativistic velocity addition formula comes into play here. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c² ). But wait, u is the velocity of the object in the first frame, and u' is in the second frame moving at velocity v relative to the first.

Wait, no, I think I might be getting the frames mixed up. Let me think: the lab frame is S, and the glass frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. In S', the speed of light is c/n. So what's the speed in S?

Wait, no, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the glass frame, the light is moving at speed u' = c/n. So to find the speed u in the lab frame, we can apply the velocity transformation.

The lorentz velocity transformation is u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² )

But wait, let me double-check the direction. Since the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, which is towards the observer. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, no, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in that same direction. Hmm, wait, that seems contradictory. If the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction (towards the observer), then in the lab frame, the light is moving towards the observer, same as the glass's movement.

But in the glass's frame, which is moving at velocity v towards the observer, the light is moving at c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass frame, the light may appear moving at c/n towards the observer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the reference frames.

In the glass's rest frame (S'), the light is propagating towards the observer at speed u' = c/n.

The glass itself is moving at velocity v in the lab frame (S), so the lab sees the glass moving at v.

Wait, but the light is moving towards the observer in the lab, same direction as the glass's velocity. So the observer is at rest, the glass is moving towards him.

So, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass in the lab frame. So in S (lab), the light's speed is what we're after.

But wait, in S', the glass is stationary, and the light is moving at u' = c/n in the same direction as the glass's velocity (which in S is towards the observer).

So using the velocity addition formula, the lab frame (S) will see the light moving at u = (u' + v) / [1 + (u' * v)/(c^2)]

Because in S', u' is the speed of the light, and from S' to S, the velocity adds.

Wait, but u' is in the same direction as v. So both are positive.

So plugging in u' = c/n.

So u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

So denominator is [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ] ?

Wait, let me compute denominator.

Denominator: 1 + (u' v)/c² = 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ) = 1 + v/(n c)

So, denominator is (n c + v)/(n c )

Now, numerator is (c/n + v ) = (c + n v ) / n

So u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c ) ) ]

Divide these fractions: multiply numerator by reciprocal denominator.

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] * [ (n c) / (n c + v) ) ]

The (n c) in numerator and denominator can be simplified. Let's see:

The numerator becomes (c + n v) * n c 

Denominator: n * (n c + v )

Wait, wait:

Wait, (c + n v ) * n c = n c (c + n v )

Denominator is n (n c + v )

So u = [ n c (c + n v) ] / [ n (n c + v ) ) ]

The n's cancel out.

u = [ c (c + n v) ] / [ (n c + v) ]

But wait, since c is 1 (as given in the problem), let's substitute.

c=1, so:

u = [ 1 * (1 + n v ) ] / [ (n * 1 + v ) ]

So u = (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v ). So that's the answer.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the light propagates through the glass with an index of refraction \( n \). 

In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \). To find the speed of light in the lab frame (S), where the glass is moving at velocity \( v \), we use the relativistic velocity transformation:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \) into the formula:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
\]

Multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n c \) to simplify further:

\[
u = \frac{c + n v}{n + v}
\]

Since the problem states \( c = 1 \), substitute \( c = 1 \):

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option **A**. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Answer: A

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see. The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n.

In the glass's rest frame (S'), the light is propagating towards the observer at speed u' = c/n.

The glass itself is moving at velocity v in the lab frame (S), so the lab sees the glass moving at v.

Wait, but the light is moving towards the observer in the lab, same direction as the glass's velocity. So the observer is at rest, the glass is moving towards him.

So, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass in the lab frame. So in S (lab), the light's speed is what we're after.

But wait, in S', the glass is stationary, and the light is moving at u' = c/n in the same direction as the glass's velocity (which in S is towards the observer).

So using the velocity addition formula, the lab frame (S) will see the light moving at u = (u' + v) / [1 + (u' * v)/(c^2)]

Because in S', u' is the speed of the light, and from S' to S, the velocity adds.

Wait, but u' is in the same direction as v. So both are positive.

So plugging in u' = c/n.

So u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

So denominator is [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ] ?

Wait, let me compute denominator.

Denominator: 1 + (u' v)/c² = 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ) = 1 + v/(n c)

So, denominator is (n c + v)/(n c )

Now, numerator is (c/n + v ) = (c + n v ) / n

So u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c ) ) ]

Divide these fractions: multiply numerator by reciprocal denominator.

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] * [ (n c) / (n c + v) ) ]

The (n c) in numerator and denominator can be simplified. Let's see:

The numerator becomes (c + n v) * n c 

Denominator: n * (n c + v )

Wait, wait:

Wait, (c + n v ) * n c = n c (c + n v )

Denominator is n (n c + v )

So u = [ n c (c + n v) ] / [ n (n c + v ) ) ]

The n's cancel out.

u = [ c (c + n v) ] / [ (n c + v) ]

But wait, since c is 1 (as given in the problem), let's substitute.

c=1, so:

u = [ 1 * (1 + n v ) ] / [ (n * 1 + v ) ]

So u = (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v ). So that's the answer.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the light propagates through the glass with an index of refraction \( n \). 

In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \). To find the speed of light in the lab frame (S), where the glass is moving at velocity \( v \), we use the relativistic velocity transformation:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \) into the formula:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
\]

Multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n c \) to simplify further:

\[
u = \frac{c + n v}{n + v}
\]

Since the problem states \( c = 1 \), substitute \( c = 1 \):

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option **A**. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Answer: A
