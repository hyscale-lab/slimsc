Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Wait, wait, wait. First, let me make sure I understand the structure of the starting material. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, "d" usually stands for deuterium, right? So, benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Or wait, maybe the notation is a bit different. Oh, benzene with substituents at specific positions. Let's see, 1-bromo would be one position, and then another substituent at position 2. But the 'd' probably indicates a deuterium atom attached. So perhaps the structure is bromobenzene with an additional deuterium on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So 1-bromo means the bromine is on carbon 1. Then, 2-d would mean deuterium is on carbon 2. So the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. So, it's a benzene ring with Br at position 1 and a deuterium (D) at position 2. So, the structure looks like this: Br is at C1, D is at C2, and the rest are hydrogens.

Now, the reaction conditions are NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. In the context of aromatic compounds, especially with substituents, it might be involved in some kind of elimination or perhaps a coupling reaction. But wait, more likely, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond, but wait, benzene is already aromatic with conjugated double bonds. Hmm, maybe it's a Birch reduction? No, Birch uses different conditions, like Li and NH3 in a solvent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, benzyne is a aryne, which is a benzene ring with a triple bond (a diradical or a ring with two adjacent sp carbons). But wait, how does that form? Usually, benzyne is formed from a dihalobenzene, like 1,2-dihaloarenes. The two halogens are on adjacent carbons, and then upon treatment with a strong base, they eliminate to form the triple bond, releasing HX (like HBr or HI, depending on the halogen).

So in this case, I have 1-bromo-2-d (deutero) benzene. Wait, but that's only one substituent? Or is there another substituent? Wait, no, the molecule is just 1-bromo and 2-deutero. So, perhaps the structure is benzene with Br on C1 and D on C2, and the rest are Hs.

Wait, but for benzyne formation, you need two leaving groups, right? Like 1,2-dihalobenzene. Because then the base can abstract a beta hydrogen (or deuterium in this case) leading to the elimination of the halogen and the formation of a triple bond. But in this case, the starting material only has one bromide and a deuterium. So perhaps the D isn't a leaving group. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation. If we have a benzene ring with Br and another substituent that can leave, like maybe another Br, then elimination can occur. But the starting material here is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. So maybe the D is just a hydrogen isotope, and the reaction proceeds based on the Br.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation where the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. Wait, but benzene already has conjugated double bonds. Wait, perhaps it's about forming a ring with a triple bond, but that requires two leaving groups.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like 1-bromo-2-fluoro-benzene, but no, the question says 2-d. So perhaps the D is a hydrogen, but it's deuterated. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a di-elimination, forming benzyne. But for that, you need two leaving groups. So let me think: if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene, how can elimination occur?

Wait, maybe the D is just a regular hydrogen, meaning it's a benzene ring with Br at C1 and a hydrogen (deuterium) at C2. So, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-fluoro? No, the D is deuterium.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's already part of the aromatic system. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a carbanion, which then loses Br- to form a benzene ring with a triple bond? But that would require another leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromide is a good leaving group, and the base abstracts a hydrogen (deuterium?) adjacent to it, leading to the formation of a benzynelike structure.

Wait, but without two leaving groups, how can benzyne form? Because benzyne requires two adjacent leaving groups so that elimination can occur. So perhaps the starting material only has one leaving group (Br), but maybe the D is a hydrogen that can be abstracted.

Wait, no, because D is just a heavier isotope of hydrogen and doesn't leave. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzyne.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a simple elimination. Let's think about the structure. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. If NaNH2 is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. But wait, benzene is already a conjugated system of double bonds. So perhaps this is not feasible.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Fittig reaction, but that typically involves coupling two aryl halides to form a biaryl compound, but that usually requires a metal catalyst, like Na or another base, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a triple bond. But as I thought earlier, typically, you need two leaving groups for that. So, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, let me think about the possible products. The question is asking how many possible organic products there are. So, maybe the reaction can lead to multiple products due to different possible elimination pathways or isomerism.

Wait, let me think about the structure again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. So, the ring has Br on C1, D on C2, and H on C3, C4, C5, C6.

If the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, perhaps the base (NaNH2) abstracts a beta hydrogen (deutero?) to form a double bond. But wait, deuterium is a heavier isotope; maybe the base abstracts a regular hydrogen adjacent to Br, but in this molecule, the only adjacent position is C2 (which has D) and C6 (which has H). So, the base can abstract a hydrogen from C6, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, benzene is already a conjugated system, so forming a double bond would just be part of the ring.

Wait, maybe this is a typo, and the starting material is 1-bromo-2-iodobenzene, which would make sense for benzyne formation. Because then, with Br and I on adjacent carbons, elimination would occur. But the question says 2-d, which is deuterium, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple substitution. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. Or perhaps it's dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene with a triple bond. But without two leaving groups, that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the reaction conditions. NaNH2 in liquid ammonia is a strong base. Another possibility is that it's used for elimination reactions, like forming alkynes from dihalides. But in the case of benzene rings, perhaps it's used for forming benzyne. So, for benzyne, you need two adjacent leaving groups. So, if the starting material has Br at C1 and another leaving group at C2, elimination can occur.

Wait, but in the starting material, C2 has a deuterium. Deuterium is not a good leaving group. So, perhaps the D is not a leaving group. So, perhaps the reaction cannot form benzyne, because there's only one leaving group (Br). So, no elimination.

Wait, but then what reaction is happening here? Maybe the Br is leaving, but that would require a good nucleophile. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation where the base abstracts a proton (deuterium?) next to Br, and the Br leaves, forming a double bond.

Wait, but in aromatic compounds, dehydrohalogenation is not straightforward because the aromatic ring is already conjugated. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and no product forms. But the question states that the reaction produces some products, so that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. But for aromatic substitution, you'd need a strong activating group, but Br is a deactivating group. So, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires electron-withdrawing groups and a good leaving group. Br is a leaving group, but in aromatic substitution, you usually need a ring that's activated towards nucleophilic attack. Bromobenzene isn't very reactive for nucleophilic substitution without some strong activating groups. But NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe it's deprotonating something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a Ullmann-type coupling, but that usually requires a copper catalyst and high temperatures. I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming a benzene ring with a triple bond by eliminating HBr. But for that, you need two adjacent Br atoms, which is not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but rather a hydrogen/deuterium exchange. But I don't think that's the case here because NaNH2 is a base, not a catalyst for exchange.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible products. The question is about how many organic products are formed. So, if the reaction leads to the formation of a triple bond in the ring, how many structural isomers would that produce?

Wait, but wait, if the starting material only has Br at C1 and D at C2, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3 or C6, leading to elimination of Br and forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. But only one possibility because the D is on C2, so the only adjacent H is at C6? Wait, no, the positions adjacent to C1 are C2 and C6. C2 has D, which is not abstractable as a proton, so the base can abstract H from C6. So, elimination would occur between C1 and C6, forming a triple bond between them.

Wait, but wait, if the base abstracts H from C6, that's adjacent to Br on C1. So elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6, leading to a structure where the ring has a triple bond between C1 and C6, making it a diradical or sp-hybridized carbons.

Wait, but if that's the case, how many possible products are there? Let's think about the structure after elimination. The triple bond is between C1 and C6. But wait, the ring would have two substituents: the D at C2 and the triple bond between C1 and C6. So, the structure would be a benzene with a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a D at C2.

Wait, but wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. If we have a triple bond between C1 and C2, that's one possibility. But in this case, the D is at C2 and the Br at C1, so elimination would form between C1 and C6. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the triple bond between C1 and C2, but that requires adjacent leaving groups, which we don't have. So, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction. If the Br is a good leaving group, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a carbanion, which could attack another molecule. But without another leaving group, I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to a benzene ring with a single triple bond. But as I thought before, without two leaving groups, this isn't possible. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question is about possible products, so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Maybe the Br is replaced by something else. But what's the nucleophile here? NaNH2 is a source of NH2^- ions, which might act as a nucleophile. But in aromatic substitution, for bromobenzene, substitution is difficult because Br is a meta director, and the ring is deactivated. So, perhaps the nucleophile (NH2-) replaces Br in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that usually requires a strongly activated ring, which this isn't. So, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, but if the ring is activated towards nucleophilic substitution, perhaps by having strong electron-withdrawing groups, but here the substituents are Br and D, which are not strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the possible products. The question is about how many products are formed. If elimination is possible, perhaps only one major product forms. But let's think about the structure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a ring-strained diradical or a triple bond. But without two leaving groups, I don't see how that can happen.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a single substituent, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the D is involved in some way. Oh, wait, if the D is on C2, and the Br is on C1, then perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3 or C6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C2 and C3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that's a deuterium and a triple bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed and no product forms, but the options don't include zero, so that's not an option.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the possible reaction mechanisms. The reaction is NaNH2 in ammonia. NaNH2 is a strong base, so perhaps it's deprotonating something. The molecule has a Br and a D. So, the only H's available are on C3, C4, C5, and C6. The base could abstract a H from C6, which is adjacent to Br on C1.

Wait, abstracting a H from C6 would lead to the formation of a carbanion on C6, adjacent to Br on C1. Then, the Br would leave as Br^-, and a double bond would form between C1 and C6. But wait, benzene already has conjugated double bonds. So, forming another double bond might not be possible, but perhaps it's more about rearrangement.

Wait, but in reality, benzene can't have more than three double bonds. So, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. But again, without another leaving group, that's not feasible.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a substitution, where Br is replaced by NH2^-. But for that, the ring must be activated. Since Br is a deactivating group, it's not easy. But maybe in this case, with such strong base conditions, it could proceed.

So, if substitution occurs, the product would be 1-amino-2-d-benzene. But wait, NaNH2 provides NH2^- ions. So, substitution would replace Br with NH2. But would that be possible under these conditions?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1-nitro-2-d-benzene, but that doesn't fit here. Wait, no, the substituent would be amino.

But wait, in aromatic substitution, the position of substitution depends on the directing groups. Br is a meta director, so the incoming NH2^- would substitute in the meta position relative to Br. But wait, the starting material has Br at C1. So, the incoming group would go to C3 or C5. But wait, the starting material already has D at C2, so substitution might not be possible there.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction again. If elimination isn't possible due to only one leaving group, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question says it does produce products.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is at position 2, so when the base abstracts a H from C3 or C6, leading to some kind of diradical or triple bond formation. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe the D is just a regular hydrogen, and the presence of Br and D on adjacent carbons allows elimination. But D is not a good leaving group, so perhaps the Br leaves, and the base abstracts a H from C2. But wait, C2 has D, which is not a good proton source for elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is simply the dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, but that would require another leaving group, which we don't have.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for similar reactions. I recall that NaNH2 in ammonia is used to prepare benzyne from 1,2-dihalobenzenes. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene treated with NaNH2 in NH3 would form benzyne (a triple bond between C1 and C2) and release HBr. But in this case, the starting material is only 1-bromo-2-d-benzene. So, only one bromine and one deuterium.

Wait, but wait a second. Maybe the D is actually a mistake, and the correct structure is 1-bromo-2-fluorobenzene. Because then, we have two leaving groups (Br and F) on adjacent carbons, which would allow the formation of benzyne. But the question says 2-d, so I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is irrelevant, and the reaction proceeds by eliminating HBr, but I don't see how with only one Br.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the deuterium is actually a hydrogen, and the structure is 1-bromo-2-fluoro-benzene. Then, both Br and F are leaving groups, and elimination would form benzyne. But the question says 2-d, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is just a substituent, and the reaction is about dehydrohalogenation, leading to formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond. But without another leaving group, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzyne but instead forms a benzene ring with a single substituent, like an amino group. But then, the number of products would depend on where the substitution occurs.

Wait, if substitution occurs, and the incoming group is NH2, then where would it substitute? The starting material has Br at C1 and D at C2. Br is a meta director, so the incoming NH2 would attach at C3 or C5. But since there's a D at C2, perhaps substitution occurs at C3 or C5, but that depends on steric and electronic factors.

But wait, the product would be 3-amino-1-bromo-2-d-benzene? Or substitution would replace Br, leading to 2-d-phenylamine. Wait, no, substitution would replace Br with NH2.

Wait, but in that case, the product would be 1-nitrogen must be attached where Br was. So, the product would be 1-amino-2-d-benzene. But I'm not sure if that's feasible under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't substitute Br but instead leads to the formation of aniline via some kind of reduction, but I don't think Birch conditions are involved here.

I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think about the possible products again. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4 products.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of benzyne, which is a highly strained molecule, but depending on the substituents, it could form different products when it reacts further. But in this case, the question is about the products of the initial reaction, not any subsequent reactions.

So, if the starting material doesn't have two leaving groups, perhaps no benzyne is formed, and the reaction doesn't proceed. But the question says "how many possible organic products are there," implying that there are some products.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a single product, which is the elimination product. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't eliminate but instead deprotonates the ring, leading to a carbanion. But that doesn't make much sense as a product.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for other possibilities. Another reaction that NaNH2 can induce is the formation of aryl lithium or Grignard reagents, but that typically requires a metal, which isn't present here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but in this case, the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6 (adjacent to Br on C1), leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6. But that would require the elimination of H and Br, forming a triple bond. However, benzene is already a ring with conjugated double bonds. So, maybe this isn't feasible, but if it were, how many products would form?

If the triple bond can form between C1 and C2, or between C1 and C6, but in this case, the starting material has D on C2, which is adjacent to C1 (Br). So, perhaps the base can abstract a hydrogen from C6, leading to the triple bond between C1 and C6. But that would be just one product.

Wait, but benzene is symmetric. So, whether the triple bond forms between C1 and C2 or C1 and C6 could lead to different products based on the positions. But I'm not sure if that leads to different structural isomers.

Wait, no, because the ring is symmetric. So, if the triple bond forms between C1 and C2, it's the same as forming it between C1 and C6, considering the ring's symmetry. So, perhaps only one product is formed.

Wait, but wait: the starting material has D at C2. So, if the elimination occurs between C1 and C2 (with D on C2), that would form a triple bond between C1 and C2, but the D is on C2. Hmm, but D is just a substituent; would that affect the product's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the triple bond between C1 and C2, but since C2 has D, the product would have a D on C2 and a triple bond between C1 and C2. But that seems unlikely, as the triple bond would require two adjacent carbons to lose substituents.

Wait, perhaps the D is not involved in the elimination. Let me think: the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, which is adjacent to C1 (Br). So elimination would occur between C1 and C6, forming a triple bond. But C6 is next to C5 and C1. So, the product would have a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a D at C2.

But I'm not sure how many isomers that would produce. The ring is symmetric, so the position of the triple bond and the D would determine the isomerism.

Wait, let's imagine the benzene ring. If the triple bond is between C1 and C6, then the D is at C2, which is adjacent to C1. So, the structure would look like C1-C2 (with D) and C1-C6 (triple bond). But that's a specific structure.

Alternatively, could the triple bond form between C1 and C2, but C2 has D? Then, the structure would have triple bond between C1 and C2, and D on C2. But I'm not sure if that's possible because the D is on the same carbon as the triple bond.

Wait, in that case, maybe the D would be on a carbon adjacent to the triple bond, but that's a different structure. So, perhaps there are two possible products, depending on where the triple bond forms.

Wait, but I'm getting confused about the positions. Let me try to draw this mentally. The ring has six positions. Starting at C1 (Br), moving clockwise, C2 (D), C3 (H), C4 (H), C5 (H), C6 (H). So, C1 is connected to C2 and C6.

If the base abstracts a H from C6, then the elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6. So the product would have a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a D at C2.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts a H from C3, but wait, C3 is not adjacent to Br. So, the base can only abstract H from C2 or C6, but C2 has D, which is not abstracted. So, only H from C6 can be abstracted.

Thus, the elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6, leading to a single product. So, only one product is formed.

But wait, another possibility: the triple bond could form between C1 and C2, but that would require the adjacent carbon (C2) to have a leaving group, which it doesn't (it has D). So, that's not possible.

Thus, only one product is formed, which would correspond to option B)1.

Wait, but wait, the ring is symmetric. So, the triple bond between C1 and C6 is equivalent to the triple bond between C1 and C2, depending on the numbering. So, perhaps the same structure is formed regardless of which position the triple bond is in, so it counts as one product.

Wait, no, because the substituents (D) are in different positions relative to the triple bond. If the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and D is at C2, that's a specific structure. If the triple bond were between C1 and C2, but that's not possible because the D is on C2 and not a leaving group.

So, the only possible product is the one with the triple bond between C1 and C6, and D at C2.

Thus, the number of products is 1. So, the answer is option B)1.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material is a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used in dehydrohalogenation reactions. For the formation of benzyne (a benzene ring with a triple bond), two adjacent leaving groups are typically required. However, in this case, the starting material only has one bromine atom and a deuterium atom at position 2. Deuterium is not a good leaving group, so the reaction cannot proceed via the usual benzyne pathway.

Instead, the base (NaNH₂) can abstract a hydrogen atom from position 6 (adjacent to the bromine at position 1), leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. This results in a single product: a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6 and a deuterium atom at position 2. Due to the symmetry of the benzene ring, there is only one possible product, as the triple bond cannot form in any other position given the substituents.

Thus, the reaction produces only one organic product.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Wait, wait, wait. First, let me make sure I understand the structure of the starting material. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, "d" usually stands for deuterium, right? So, benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Or wait, maybe the notation is a bit different. Oh, benzene with substituents at specific positions. Let's see, 1-bromo would be one position, and then another substituent at position 2. But the 'd' probably indicates a deuterium atom attached. So perhaps the structure is bromobenzene with an additional deuterium on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So 1-bromo means the bromine is on carbon 1. Then, 2-d would mean deuterium is on carbon 2. So the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. So, it's a benzene ring with Br at position 1 and a deuterium (D) at position 2. So, the structure looks like this: Br is at C1, D is at C2, and the rest are hydrogens.

Now, the reaction conditions are NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. In the context of aromatic compounds, especially with substituents, it might be involved in some kind of elimination or perhaps a coupling reaction. But wait, more likely, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond, but wait, benzene is already aromatic with conjugated double bonds. Hmm, maybe it's a Birch reduction? No, Birch uses different conditions, like Li and NH3 in a solvent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, benzyne is a aryne, which is a benzene ring with a triple bond (a diradical or a ring with two adjacent sp carbons). But wait, how does that form? Usually, benzyne is formed from a dihalobenzene, like 1,2-dihaloarenes. The two halogens are on adjacent carbons, and then upon treatment with a strong base, they eliminate to form the triple bond, releasing HX (like HBr or HI, depending on the halogen).

So in this case, I have 1-bromo-2-d (deutero) benzene. Wait, but that's only one substituent? Or is there another substituent? Wait, no, the molecule is just 1-bromo and 2-deutero. So, perhaps the structure is benzene with Br on C1 and D on C2, and the rest are Hs.

Wait, but for benzyne formation, you need two leaving groups, right? Like 1,2-dihalobenzene. Because then the base can abstract a beta hydrogen (or deuterium in this case) leading to the elimination of the halogen and the formation of a triple bond. But in this case, the starting material only has one bromide and a deuterium. So perhaps the D isn't a leaving group. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation. If we have a benzene ring with Br and another substituent that can leave, like maybe another Br, then elimination can occur. But the starting material here is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. So maybe the D is just a hydrogen isotope, and the reaction proceeds based on the Br.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation where the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. Wait, but benzene already has conjugated double bonds. Wait, perhaps it's about forming a ring with a triple bond, but that requires two leaving groups.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like 1-bromo-2-fluoro-benzene, but no, the question says 2-d. So perhaps the D is a hydrogen, but it's deuterated. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a di-elimination, forming benzyne. But for that, you need two leaving groups. So let me think: if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene, how can elimination occur?

Wait, maybe the D is just a regular hydrogen, meaning it's a benzene ring with Br at C1 and a hydrogen (deuterium) at C2. So, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-fluoro? No, the D is deuterium.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's already part of the aromatic system. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a carbanion, which then loses Br- to form a benzene ring with a triple bond? But that would require another leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromide is a good leaving group, and the base abstracts a hydrogen (deuterium?) adjacent to it, leading to the formation of a benzynelike structure.

Wait, but without two leaving groups, how can benzyne form? Because benzyne requires two adjacent leaving groups so that elimination can occur. So perhaps the starting material only has one leaving group (Br), but maybe the D is a hydrogen that can be abstracted.

Wait, no, because D is just a heavier isotope of hydrogen and doesn't leave. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzyne.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a simple elimination. Let's think about the structure. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. If NaNH2 is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. But wait, benzene is already a conjugated system of double bonds. So perhaps this is not feasible.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Fittig reaction, but that typically involves coupling two aryl halides to form a biaryl compound, but that usually requires a metal catalyst, like Na or another base, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a triple bond. But as I thought earlier, typically, you need two leaving groups for that. So, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, let me think about the possible products. The question is asking how many possible organic products there are. So, maybe the reaction can lead to multiple products due to different possible elimination pathways or isomerism.

Wait, let me think about the structure again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. So, the ring has Br on C1, D on C2, and H on C3, C4, C5, C6.

If the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, perhaps the base (NaNH2) abstracts a beta hydrogen (deutero?) to form a double bond. But wait, deuterium is a heavier isotope; maybe the base abstracts a regular hydrogen adjacent to Br, but in this molecule, the only adjacent position is C2 (which has D) and C6 (which has H). So, the base can abstract a hydrogen from C6, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, benzene is already a conjugated system, so forming a double bond would just be part of the ring.

Wait, maybe this is a typo, and the starting material is 1-bromo-2-iodobenzene, which would make sense for benzyne formation. Because then, with Br and I on adjacent carbons, elimination would occur. But the question says 2-d, which is deuterium, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple substitution. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. Or perhaps it's dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene with a triple bond. But without two leaving groups, that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the reaction conditions. NaNH2 in liquid ammonia is a strong base. Another possibility is that it's used for elimination reactions, like forming alkynes from dihalides. But in the case of benzene rings, perhaps it's used for forming benzyne. So, for benzyne, you need two adjacent leaving groups. So, if the starting material has Br at C1 and another leaving group at C2, elimination can occur.

Wait, but in the starting material, C2 has a deuterium. Deuterium is not a good leaving group. So, perhaps the D is not a leaving group. So, perhaps the reaction cannot form benzyne, because there's only one leaving group (Br). So, no elimination.

Wait, but then what reaction is happening here? Maybe the Br is leaving, but that would require a good nucleophile. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation where the base abstracts a proton (deuterium?) next to Br, and the Br leaves, forming a double bond.

Wait, but in aromatic compounds, dehydrohalogenation is not straightforward because the aromatic ring is already conjugated. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and no product forms. But the question states that the reaction produces some products, so that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. But for aromatic substitution, you'd need a strong activating group, but Br is a deactivating group. So, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires electron-withdrawing groups and a good leaving group. Br is a leaving group, but in aromatic substitution, you usually need a ring that's activated towards nucleophilic attack. Bromobenzene isn't very reactive for nucleophilic substitution without some strong activating groups. But NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe it's deprotonating something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a Ullmann-type coupling, but that usually requires a copper catalyst and high temperatures. I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming a benzene ring with a triple bond by eliminating HBr. But for that, you need two adjacent Br atoms, which is not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but rather a hydrogen/deuterium exchange. But I don't think that's the case here because NaNH2 is a base, not a catalyst for exchange.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible products. The question is about how many organic products are formed. So, if the reaction leads to the formation of a triple bond in the ring, how many structural isomers would that produce?

Wait, but wait, if the starting material only has Br at C1 and D at C2, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3 or C6, leading to elimination of Br and forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. But only one possibility because the D is on C2, so the only adjacent H is at C6? Wait, no, the positions adjacent to C1 are C2 and C6. C2 has D, which is not abstractable as a proton, so the base can abstract H from C6. So, elimination would occur between C1 and C6, forming a triple bond between them.

Wait, but wait, if the base abstracts H from C6, that's adjacent to Br on C1. So elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6, leading to a structure where the ring has a triple bond between C1 and C6, making it a diradical or sp-hybridized carbons.

Wait, but if that's the case, how many possible products are there? Let's think about the structure after elimination. The triple bond is between C1 and C6. But wait, the ring would have two substituents: the D at C2 and the triple bond between C1 and C6. So, the structure would be a benzene with a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a D at C2.

Wait, but wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. If we have a triple bond between C1 and C2, that's one possibility. But in this case, the D is at C2 and the Br at C1, so elimination would form between C1 and C6. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the triple bond between C1 and C2, but that requires adjacent leaving groups, which we don't have. So, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction. If the Br is a good leaving group, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a carbanion, which could attack another molecule. But without another leaving group, I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to a benzene ring with a single triple bond. But as I thought before, without two leaving groups, this isn't possible. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question is about possible products, so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Maybe the Br is replaced by something else. But what's the nucleophile here? NaNH2 is a source of NH2^- ions, which might act as a nucleophile. But in aromatic substitution, for bromobenzene, substitution is difficult because Br is a meta director, and the ring is deactivated. So, perhaps the nucleophile (NH2-) replaces Br in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that usually requires a strongly activated ring, which this isn't. So, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, but if the ring is activated towards nucleophilic substitution, perhaps by having strong electron-withdrawing groups, but here the substituents are Br and D, which are not strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the possible products. The question is about how many products are formed. If elimination is possible, perhaps only one major product forms. But let's think about the structure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a ring-strained diradical or a triple bond. But without two leaving groups, I don't see how that can happen.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a single substituent, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the D is involved in some way. Oh, wait, if the D is on C2, and the Br is on C1, then perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3 or C6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C2 and C3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that's a deuterium and a triple bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed and no product forms, but the options don't include zero, so that's not an option.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the possible reaction mechanisms. The reaction is NaNH2 in ammonia. NaNH2 is a strong base, so perhaps it's deprotonating something. The molecule has a Br and a D. So, the only H's available are on C3, C4, C5, and C6. The base could abstract a H from C6, which is adjacent to Br on C1.

Wait, abstracting a H from C6 would lead to the formation of a carbanion on C6, adjacent to Br on C1. Then, the Br would leave as Br^-, and a double bond would form between C1 and C6. But wait, benzene already has conjugated double bonds. So, forming another double bond might not be possible, but perhaps it's more about rearrangement.

Wait, but in reality, benzene can't have more than three double bonds. So, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. But again, without another leaving group, that's not feasible.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a substitution, where Br is replaced by NH2^-. But for that, the ring must be activated. Since Br is a deactivating group, it's not easy. But maybe in this case, with such strong base conditions, it could proceed.

So, if substitution occurs, the product would be 1-amino-2-d-benzene. But wait, NaNH2 provides NH2^- ions. So, substitution would replace Br with NH2. But would that be possible under these conditions?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1-nitro-2-d-benzene, but that doesn't fit here. Wait, no, the substituent would be amino.

But wait, in aromatic substitution, the position of substitution depends on the directing groups. Br is a meta director, so the incoming NH2^- would substitute in the meta position relative to Br. But wait, the starting material has Br at C1. So, the incoming group would go to C3 or C5. But wait, the starting material already has D at C2, so substitution might not be possible there.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction again. If elimination isn't possible due to only one leaving group, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question says it does produce products.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is at position 2, so when the base abstracts a H from C3 or C6, leading to some kind of diradical or triple bond formation. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe the D is just a regular hydrogen, and the presence of Br and D on adjacent carbons allows elimination. But D is not a good leaving group, so perhaps the Br leaves, and the base abstracts a H from C2. But wait, C2 has D, which is not a good proton source for elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is simply the dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, but that would require another leaving group, which we don't have.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for similar reactions. I recall that NaNH2 in ammonia is used to prepare benzyne from 1,2-dihalobenzenes. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene treated with NaNH2 in NH3 would form benzyne (a triple bond between C1 and C2) and release HBr. But in this case, the starting material is only 1-bromo-2-d-benzene. So, only one bromine and one deuterium.

Wait, but wait a second. Maybe the D is actually a mistake, and the correct structure is 1-bromo-2-fluorobenzene. Because then, we have two leaving groups (Br and F) on adjacent carbons, which would allow the formation of benzyne. But the question says 2-d, so I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is irrelevant, and the reaction proceeds by eliminating HBr, but I don't see how with only one Br.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the deuterium is actually a hydrogen, and the structure is 1-bromo-2-fluoro-benzene. Then, both Br and F are leaving groups, and elimination would form benzyne. But the question says 2-d, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is just a substituent, and the reaction is about dehydrohalogenation, leading to formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond. But without another leaving group, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzyne but instead forms a benzene ring with a single substituent, like an amino group. But then, the number of products would depend on where the substitution occurs.

Wait, if substitution occurs, and the incoming group is NH2, then where would it substitute? The starting material has Br at C1 and D at C2. Br is a meta director, so the incoming NH2 would attach at C3 or C5. But since there's a D at C2, perhaps substitution occurs at C3 or C5, but that depends on steric and electronic factors.

But wait, the product would be 3-amino-1-bromo-2-d-benzene? Or substitution would replace Br, leading to 2-d-phenylamine. Wait, no, substitution would replace Br with NH2.

Wait, but in that case, the product would be 1-nitrogen must be attached where Br was. So, the product would be 1-amino-2-d-benzene. But I'm not sure if that's feasible under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't substitute Br but instead leads to the formation of aniline via some kind of reduction, but I don't think Birch conditions are involved here.

I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think about the possible products again. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4 products.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of benzyne, which is a highly strained molecule, but depending on the substituents, it could form different products when it reacts further. But in this case, the question is about the products of the initial reaction, not any subsequent reactions.

So, if the starting material doesn't have two leaving groups, perhaps no benzyne is formed, and the reaction doesn't proceed. But the question says "how many possible organic products are there," implying that there are some products.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a single product, which is the elimination product. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't eliminate but instead deprotonates the ring, leading to a carbanion. But that doesn't make much sense as a product.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for other possibilities. Another reaction that NaNH2 can induce is the formation of aryl lithium or Grignard reagents, but that typically requires a metal, which isn't present here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but in this case, the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6 (adjacent to Br on C1), leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6. But that would require the elimination of H and Br, forming a triple bond. However, benzene is already a ring with conjugated double bonds. So, maybe this isn't feasible, but if it were, how many products would form?

If the triple bond can form between C1 and C2, or between C1 and C6, but in this case, the starting material has D on C2, which is adjacent to C1 (Br). So, perhaps the base can abstract a hydrogen from C6, leading to the triple bond between C1 and C6. But that would be just one product.

Wait, but benzene is symmetric. So, whether the triple bond forms between C1 and C2 or C1 and C6 could lead to different products based on the positions. But I'm not sure if that leads to different structural isomers.

Wait, no, because the ring is symmetric. So, if the triple bond forms between C1 and C2, it's the same as forming it between C1 and C6, considering the ring's symmetry. So, perhaps only one product is formed.

Wait, but wait: the starting material has D at C2. So, if the elimination occurs between C1 and C2 (with D on C2), that would form a triple bond between C1 and C2, but the D is on C2. Hmm, but D is just a substituent; would that affect the product's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the triple bond between C1 and C2, but since C2 has D, the product would have a D on C2 and a triple bond between C1 and C2. But that seems unlikely, as the triple bond would require two adjacent carbons to lose substituents.

Wait, perhaps the D is not involved in the elimination. Let me think: the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, which is adjacent to C1 (Br). So elimination would occur between C1 and C6, forming a triple bond. But C6 is next to C5 and C1. So, the product would have a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a D at C2.

But I'm not sure how many isomers that would produce. The ring is symmetric, so the position of the triple bond and the D would determine the isomerism.

Wait, let's imagine the benzene ring. If the triple bond is between C1 and C6, then the D is at C2, which is adjacent to C1. So, the structure would look like C1-C2 (with D) and C1-C6 (triple bond). But that's a specific structure.

Alternatively, could the triple bond form between C1 and C2, but C2 has D? Then, the structure would have triple bond between C1 and C2, and D on C2. But I'm not sure if that's possible because the D is on the same carbon as the triple bond.

Wait, in that case, maybe the D would be on a carbon adjacent to the triple bond, but that's a different structure. So, perhaps there are two possible products, depending on where the triple bond forms.

Wait, but I'm getting confused about the positions. Let me try to draw this mentally. The ring has six positions. Starting at C1 (Br), moving clockwise, C2 (D), C3 (H), C4 (H), C5 (H), C6 (H). So, C1 is connected to C2 and C6.

If the base abstracts a H from C6, then the elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6. So the product would have a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a D at C2.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts a H from C3, but wait, C3 is not adjacent to Br. So, the base can only abstract H from C2 or C6, but C2 has D, which is not abstracted. So, only H from C6 can be abstracted.

Thus, the elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6, leading to a single product. So, only one product is formed.

But wait, another possibility: the triple bond could form between C1 and C2, but that would require the adjacent carbon (C2) to have a leaving group, which it doesn't (it has D). So, that's not possible.

Thus, only one product is formed, which would correspond to option B)1.

Wait, but wait, the ring is symmetric. So, the triple bond between C1 and C6 is equivalent to the triple bond between C1 and C2, depending on the numbering. So, perhaps the same structure is formed regardless of which position the triple bond is in, so it counts as one product.

Wait, no, because the substituents (D) are in different positions relative to the triple bond. If the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and D is at C2, that's a specific structure. If the triple bond were between C1 and C2, but that's not possible because the D is on C2 and not a leaving group.

So, the only possible product is the one with the triple bond between C1 and C6, and D at C2.

Thus, the number of products is 1. So, the answer is option B)1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material is a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used in dehydrohalogenation reactions. For the formation of benzyne (a benzene ring with a triple bond), two adjacent leaving groups are typically required. However, in this case, the starting material only has one bromine atom and a deuterium atom at position 2. Deuterium is not a good leaving group, so the reaction cannot proceed via the usual benzyne pathway.

Instead, the base (NaNH₂) can abstract a hydrogen atom from position 6 (adjacent to the bromine at position 1), leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. This results in a single product: a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6 and a deuterium atom at position 2. Due to the symmetry of the benzene ring, there is only one possible product, as the triple bond cannot form in any other position given the substituents.

Thus, the reaction produces only one organic product.

Answer: B
