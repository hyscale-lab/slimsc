Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question is about the effective temperatures of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms. Let me try to break it down.

So, the scenario is that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh wait, wait. No, more accurately, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So the excitation level is higher in star_1 than in star_2.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, 1.38 is a familiar number—like the Boltzmann constant? Because I remember that Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is k times something. Oh wait, ΔE = k*T, but I'm not sure. Or wait, in the Boltzmann distribution, the probability of a particle being in an energy state is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)). 

Wait, the Boltzmann factor. So the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. If E1 and E2 are two energy levels with E2 > E1, then the ratio n2/n1 = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ).

In this problem, the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So I think that refers to the number of atoms in the excited state. So let's say n1 is the number in star_1, and n2 is in star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. The problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited", implying that more are in the higher energy state. So n1 is the excited state population for star_1, and n2 for star_2. So n1 = 2 n2.

But wait, no. Let me think again. The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation level is higher, so the ratio is n1 (excited) / n2 (ground state) = 2? Or maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the lower state. Hmm, not entirely clear. Alternatively, the ratio of the excited population in star_1 to that in star_2 is 2:1.

Wait, but the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2". So perhaps the excitation refers to the fraction in that particular energy level. So maybe the number of atoms in the excited state for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1 = 2 n2.

Wait, no. Let's clarify. Suppose in star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state is higher. So using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio (n1 / n2) = exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), right? Or perhaps the ratio is (n_upper / n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference E_upper - E_lower.

Wait, the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k.

So for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy level to the lower is given by:

n_high / n_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But since ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is k, so:

n_high / n_low = exp( -k/(k T) ) = exp( -1/T )

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me make sure. So the energy difference is ΔE = E_upper - E_lower = k, so that's 1.38e-23 J.

Now, for each star, the ratio of the excited (higher) level population to the lower level is:

n1_high / n1_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) )

n2_high / n2_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) )

But the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, what exactly is the ratio given? The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. I think that refers to the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state population.

So for star_1, (n1_high / n1_low) = 2 * (n2_high / n2_low)

Wait, no. Let me read the question again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm. Does that mean that n1_high / n2_high = 2? Or n1_high / n1_low = 2 * (n2_high / n2_low)?

Wait, perhaps it's that the excitation level is twice as high. So maybe for star_1, the ratio n_high/n_low is twice that for star_2. So:

(n_high)_1 / (n_low)_1 = 2 * [ (n_high)_2 / (n_low)_2 ]

But another way to look at it is that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So perhaps the ratio of (n_high/n_low) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n_high_1 = 2 n_high_2.

Wait, but the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the fraction of excited atoms is higher. For example, if the fraction is f1 for star_1 and f2 for star_2, then f1 = 2 f2. Or, more accurately, the ratio of f1 to f2 is 2.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the excited state population to the lower state is given. So for each star, that ratio is (n_high / n_low) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Given ΔE is k, so exp(-1/T).

So for star_1, ratio is R1 = exp(-1/T1)

For star_2, ratio is R2 = exp(-1/T2)

The problem says that R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, wait. Let me think. If in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2, then R1 = 2 R2.

So:

exp(-1/T1) = 2 exp(-1/T2)

Wait, no. Because the ratio is n_high/n_low. If star_1 has higher excitation, then R1 is smaller than R2 because higher temperature makes exp(-1/T) smaller. Wait, wait, no. Let me think: The exponent is -1/T. So as T increases, -1/T becomes less negative, so the exponent becomes larger, making R larger.

Wait, wait. Let's take an example. If T is high, then 1/T is small. So exp(-x) where x is small is larger. So higher T would mean higher R, meaning more excitation. Because when T is high, the exponent is less negative, so exp(-ΔE/(kT)) is larger, meaning n_high/n_low is larger, meaning more excitation.

So, R1 = exp(-1/T1), R2= exp(-1/T2).

According to the problem, R1 is twice R2? Or is R1 higher or lower than R2?

Wait, the problem states that star_1 has twice as excited in a specific level. So which star has higher R? Because R is the ratio of higher to lower. So if star_1 has more excitation, its R is higher. So R1 = 2 R2.

So:

exp(-1/T1) = 2 exp(-1/T2 )

Let me write this as:

exp( -1/T1 ) = 2 exp( -1/T2 )

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

-1/T1 = ln(2) + (-1/T2 )

Rearranging:

-1/T1 + 1/T2 = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by -1:

1/T1 - 1/T2 = - ln(2)

Wait, not sure, let's rearrange the previous equation:

-1/T1 = ln(2) -1/T2 

Wait, that's correct. So:

(-1/T1) = ln(2) - (1/T2 )

Rearranged:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = ln(2)

Wait, no, let's move terms around. Add 1/T2 to both sides:

-1/T1 + 1/T2 = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Hmm. Now, let's see the answer options.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, let's see:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Which can be written as ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Because:

1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, no. Because [1/T2 -1/T1] is [T1 - T2]/(T1 T2) ), so the equation is:

([T1 - T2] ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which is what option D says, because option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, so option D is correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option A: ln(2) = T2 / T1 → no, because our equation is (1/T2 -1/T1) = ln(2), which is not that.

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2 ) → that would be if 1/T1 + 1/T2, which it's not.

Option C: ln(2) = (T1-T2)/( (T1 T2 )^2 ) → no, the denominator is squared, which is not the case.

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars, \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the Boltzmann constant \( k \). Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right).
\]

For star 1 and star 2, the ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high,1}}}{n_{\text{low,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{T_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{\text{high,2}}}{n_{\text{low,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation level in star 1 is twice that of star 2, meaning:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high,1}}}{n_{\text{low,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{high,2}}}{n_{\text{low,2}}}.
\]

Substituting the expressions for the ratios:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{1}{T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{1}{T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Now, comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \) — Incorrect, as the equation does not match.
- **Option B**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{T_1 T_2} \) — Incorrect, as the equation involves a sum, not a difference.
- **Option C**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{(T_1 T_2)^2} \) — Incorrect, as the denominator is squared.
- **Option D**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \) — Correct, as it matches the derived equation.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question is about the effective temperatures of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms. Let me try to break it down.

So, the scenario is that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh wait, wait. No, more accurately, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So the excitation level is higher in star_1 than in star_2.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, 1.38 is a familiar number—like the Boltzmann constant? Because I remember that Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is k times something. Oh wait, ΔE = k*T, but I'm not sure. Or wait, in the Boltzmann distribution, the probability of a particle being in an energy state is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)). 

Wait, the Boltzmann factor. So the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. If E1 and E2 are two energy levels with E2 > E1, then the ratio n2/n1 = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ).

In this problem, the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So I think that refers to the number of atoms in the excited state. So let's say n1 is the number in star_1, and n2 is in star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. The problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited", implying that more are in the higher energy state. So n1 is the excited state population for star_1, and n2 for star_2. So n1 = 2 n2.

But wait, no. Let me think again. The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation level is higher, so the ratio is n1 (excited) / n2 (ground state) = 2? Or maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the lower state. Hmm, not entirely clear. Alternatively, the ratio of the excited population in star_1 to that in star_2 is 2:1.

Wait, but the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2". So perhaps the excitation refers to the fraction in that particular energy level. So maybe the number of atoms in the excited state for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1 = 2 n2.

Wait, no. Let's clarify. Suppose in star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state is higher. So using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio (n1 / n2) = exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), right? Or perhaps the ratio is (n_upper / n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference E_upper - E_lower.

Wait, the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k.

So for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy level to the lower is given by:

n_high / n_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But since ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is k, so:

n_high / n_low = exp( -k/(k T) ) = exp( -1/T )

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me make sure. So the energy difference is ΔE = E_upper - E_lower = k, so that's 1.38e-23 J.

Now, for each star, the ratio of the excited (higher) level population to the lower level is:

n1_high / n1_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) )

n2_high / n2_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) )

But the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, what exactly is the ratio given? The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. I think that refers to the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state population.

So for star_1, (n1_high / n1_low) = 2 * (n2_high / n2_low)

Wait, no. Let me read the question again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm. Does that mean that n1_high / n2_high = 2? Or n1_high / n1_low = 2 * (n2_high / n2_low)?

Wait, perhaps it's that the excitation level is twice as high. So maybe for star_1, the ratio n_high/n_low is twice that for star_2. So:

(n_high)_1 / (n_low)_1 = 2 * [ (n_high)_2 / (n_low)_2 ]

But another way to look at it is that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So perhaps the ratio of (n_high/n_low) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n_high_1 = 2 n_high_2.

Wait, but the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the fraction of excited atoms is higher. For example, if the fraction is f1 for star_1 and f2 for star_2, then f1 = 2 f2. Or, more accurately, the ratio of f1 to f2 is 2.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the excited state population to the lower state is given. So for each star, that ratio is (n_high / n_low) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Given ΔE is k, so exp(-1/T).

So for star_1, ratio is R1 = exp(-1/T1)

For star_2, ratio is R2 = exp(-1/T2)

The problem says that R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, wait. Let me think. If in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2, then R1 = 2 R2.

So:

exp(-1/T1) = 2 exp(-1/T2)

Wait, no. Because the ratio is n_high/n_low. If star_1 has higher excitation, then R1 is smaller than R2 because higher temperature makes exp(-1/T) smaller. Wait, wait, no. Let me think: The exponent is -1/T. So as T increases, -1/T becomes less negative, so the exponent becomes larger, making R larger.

Wait, wait. Let's take an example. If T is high, then 1/T is small. So exp(-x) where x is small is larger. So higher T would mean higher R, meaning more excitation. Because when T is high, the exponent is less negative, so exp(-ΔE/(kT)) is larger, meaning n_high/n_low is larger, meaning more excitation.

So, R1 = exp(-1/T1), R2= exp(-1/T2).

According to the problem, R1 is twice R2? Or is R1 higher or lower than R2?

Wait, the problem states that star_1 has twice as excited in a specific level. So which star has higher R? Because R is the ratio of higher to lower. So if star_1 has more excitation, its R is higher. So R1 = 2 R2.

So:

exp(-1/T1) = 2 exp(-1/T2 )

Let me write this as:

exp( -1/T1 ) = 2 exp( -1/T2 )

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

-1/T1 = ln(2) + (-1/T2 )

Rearranging:

-1/T1 + 1/T2 = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by -1:

1/T1 - 1/T2 = - ln(2)

Wait, not sure, let's rearrange the previous equation:

-1/T1 = ln(2) -1/T2 

Wait, that's correct. So:

(-1/T1) = ln(2) - (1/T2 )

Rearranged:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = ln(2)

Wait, no, let's move terms around. Add 1/T2 to both sides:

-1/T1 + 1/T2 = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Hmm. Now, let's see the answer options.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, let's see:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Which can be written as ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Because:

1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, no. Because [1/T2 -1/T1] is [T1 - T2]/(T1 T2) ), so the equation is:

([T1 - T2] ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which is what option D says, because option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, so option D is correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option A: ln(2) = T2 / T1 → no, because our equation is (1/T2 -1/T1) = ln(2), which is not that.

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2 ) → that would be if 1/T1 + 1/T2, which it's not.

Option C: ln(2) = (T1-T2)/( (T1 T2 )^2 ) → no, the denominator is squared, which is not the case.

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars, \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the Boltzmann constant \( k \). Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right).
\]

For star 1 and star 2, the ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high,1}}}{n_{\text{low,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{T_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{\text{high,2}}}{n_{\text{low,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation level in star 1 is twice that of star 2, meaning:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high,1}}}{n_{\text{low,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{high,2}}}{n_{\text{low,2}}}.
\]

Substituting the expressions for the ratios:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{1}{T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{1}{T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Now, comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \) — Incorrect, as the equation does not match.
- **Option B**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{T_1 T_2} \) — Incorrect, as the equation involves a sum, not a difference.
- **Option C**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{(T_1 T_2)^2} \) — Incorrect, as the denominator is squared.
- **Option D**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \) — Correct, as it matches the derived equation.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
