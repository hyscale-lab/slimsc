Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, I'll draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, positions are numbered in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So, let me imagine the benzene ring. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, but the numbering might be adjusted. Alternatively, maybe it's more like position 1: ethoxy, position 2: tert-butyl, position 3: nitro. Or could it be position 1: ethoxy, position 2: nitro, position 3: tert-butyl? No, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, so positions 1, 2, 3 have substituents in that order. So benzene ring with substituents at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, the substituents are at adjacent positions? Let me think. 1, 2, 3 would be consecutive positions. So ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So that's a meta arrangement for the ethoxy and nitro groups, but adjacent to each other.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the directing effects of the substituents. So, in the synthesis steps, each group is introduced through a substitution reaction, and the order of substitution will affect where the next group attaches.

So the target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's think about their positions in the target structure. Since the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, the molecule is more or less a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Now, the substituents' order of introduction is crucial. We start with benzene. Let's think about the possible substituents and the directing effects.

Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an O-alkyl group, which is ortho/para directing). Nitro is a deactivating, meta-directing group. The tert-butyl group is a bulky, activating, but since it's a strong alkyl group, it's ortho/para directing.

But wait, tert-butyl is a strong activating group? No, wait. Alkyl groups are activating, as they are electron-donating through sigma bonds. So, yes, tert-butyl is activating and ortho/para directing.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating and meta directing. So if we introduce nitro after ethoxy, its position would be determined by the other substituents.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's think step by step.

We need to introduce three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro. Let me consider the possible order of substitution.

But wait, the nitro group is a meta director, but if it's introduced first, where would the next groups go? Or maybe the nitro is introduced last because it's a strong deactivating group, making subsequent substitutions difficult. Or perhaps the nitro is introduced second.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced first because it's an activating group, which allows for easier substitution.

Wait, but let's think about each possible reaction in the options and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options, all of them start with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3, which is Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride would introduce a tert-butyl group. But wait, benzene can undergo Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but the tert-butyl group is bulky—so it may undergo some carbocation rearrangements. Hmm, but perhaps in this case, the t-butyl is introduced as a substituent.

But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is only possible if the alkylating agent forms a stable carbocation. t-butyl is a tertiary carbocation, so it's pretty stable. So, the reaction would proceed, and the t-butyl group would add to benzene, giving 2-tert-butylbenzene or more accurately, maybe it's more likely to substitute in para position, but due to steric hindrance, perhaps ortho is minor and para is major. Wait, but with a bulky group like t-butyl, the major product might be para, but depending on the method.

But wait, perhaps the first step is adding t-butyl chloride using AlCl3 as a catalyst, so that gives the tert-butyl benzene.

Then, the next step in each option varies.

Looking at option A: after t-butyl, it's HNO3/H2SO4, which is nitration. So the next substituent would be nitro. Then, SO3/H2SO4, which is sulfonation. Then, NaNO2/HCl, which is diazotization. Then, H3O+ and heat, which is hydrolysis. Then, NaOH and EtBr, which is ethoxy group introduction via alkylation.

Wait, but order matters because substituents direct where new groups go.

Alternatively, perhaps let's outline the steps needed to reach the target structure.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

We need to find the order of introducing these groups.

Let me think about the order that will best facilitate the synthesis.

One approach is to introduce the groups that are meta directors first because once they're in place, they can influence the positions of the next substituents.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director, so if introduced early, it will influence where other groups go.

Alternatively, considering that the ethoxy and t-butyl groups are activating, perhaps we should introduce them after nitro, because once nitro is present, it deactivates the ring and directs meta.

Wait, but maybe that's the other way around.

Let me think: Suppose I first introduce nitro. Benzene → nitrobenzene (via nitration). Then, nitro is meta-directing. Next, I could introduce ethoxy. When I nitro is present, the ethoxy would come in the meta position relative to nitro. But wait, ethoxy is an activating group, so it can be introduced via substitution, perhaps via the ethoxy being added later.

But the target has ethoxy at position 1, t-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Let's think about the positions.

Wait, perhaps the order is: ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

If ethoxy is introduced first, it's an activating, ortho/para director. Then, when t-butyl is added via Friedel-Crafts, it would be directed to ortho or para positions relative to ethoxy.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. So, after ethoxy is attached, the ring is activated, so Friedel-Crafts can proceed.

So, benzene → ethoxybenzene (ethoxy group via, say, an etherification, but how? Wait, introducing ethoxy would require an alkoxy group, which is typically done via a nucleophilic substitution, but benzene is not nucleophilic. Wait, perhaps via a substitution using something like Williamson-type synthesis, but that's for ethers. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a leaving group is present.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The ethoxy group is OCH2CH3. To introduce an ethoxy group onto benzene, the common method is via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires strong activating groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's introduced via a substitution after a nitration or another reaction.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an alkoxy group using a Friedel-Crafts type mechanism, but wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation or acylation, not alkoxy. Because alkoxy groups are typically introduced through other methods, such as using an alkyl halide with a strong base or via another mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution, but that's difficult unless there's a leaving group. So maybe it's introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after the ring has been activated with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently.

The target molecule has three substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's think about their directing effects.

Ethoxy (OCH2CH3) is activating, ortho/para-directing.

t-Butyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.

Nitro is deactivating, meta-directing.

So, when introducing the substituents, the order matters because each new group directs the next substitution.

Let's say we introduce the nitro group last. Then, the other substituents would have to be added in positions such that the nitro group can be placed correctly.

Wait, but if nitro is introduced last, we have to have the ring already activated by other groups, but nitro is deactivating, which makes further substitution difficult. So perhaps nitro is introduced earlier.

Wait, but maybe the nitro is introduced after t-butyl and ethoxy groups are already present. Because once nitro is on the ring, the ring becomes deactivated, making further substitution difficult.

But in the target, the nitro group is at position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy (position 1) and t-butyl (position 2). So, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ethoxy and t-butyl groups are in place.

Wait, but that's tricky because after introducing ethoxy and t-butyl, the ring might be highly activated. Then, adding nitro via nitration would be possible.

Wait, but when the ring is activated, like with two activating groups, the nitration would be more difficult because nitro is a deactivating group. Or maybe it's easier? No, wait, the ring's activation would make the nitration happen more readily, but the position would be determined by the substituents present.

Wait, but let's think of this: the t-butyl group is introduced first.

So, benzene → t-butyl benzene via Friedel-Crafts.

Now, the t-butyl group is ortho/para directing. Next, perhaps introduce the ethoxy group.

But introducing OCH2CH3 via Friedel-Crafts isn't possible because that's for alkylation. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method, like using an electrophilic substitution with a good leaving group. Wait, but benzene rings don't typically undergo substitution easily unless activated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires strong activating groups. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after nitration. Let me think:

Another approach: Introduce the nitro group first. Benzene → nitrobenzene. Then, nitro is meta directing. Next, introduce the ethoxy group. Since nitro is meta directing, the ethoxy would go into the meta position relative to nitro.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3, and the ethoxy is at position 1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced first. Benzene → ethoxybenzene. Then, the ethoxy directs the next substituent to ortho or para positions. Let's say the next substituent is the t-butyl group. So, adding t-butyl to ethoxybenzene would go to ortho or para. If it's para, then the positions would be 1 (ethoxy) and 4 (t-butyl). But the target has t-butyl at position 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the t-butyl is added to the ortho position of ethoxy, making positions 1 (ethoxy) and 2 (t-butyl). Then, the third substituent (nitro) would need to be at position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy and t-butyl.

Wait, but adding nitro after ethoxy and t-butyl would require the ring to be activated enough to undergo nitration. But nitro is a deactivating group, so perhaps that's not the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added before the ethoxy group.

Wait, let's outline the steps again.

Option D is:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → this is a reaction for removing a nitro group via reduction. Wait, Fe/HCl is sometimes used for the hydrolysis of nitro groups under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Fe/HCl is a catalyst for some reactions, like diazotization. Wait, no, more likely, it's used in the reduction of nitro groups. For example, nitrobenzene can be reduced to phenyl amine using Fe/HCl as a catalyst.

So, if the first step is nitration, then the ring has a nitro group. Then, perhaps the next step is reduction of the nitro group to an amine, but why would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the option is suggesting a different order. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced last.

Wait, let's think about each option.

Looking at option B:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So benzene becomes t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So nitro group is added. Now, where does the nitro group go?

The t-butyl is ortho/para directing. So in t-butylbenzene, the nitro group would be introduced either ortho, meta, or para to the t-butyl. Wait, no, wait: no, the substituent directs the next group. The t-butyl is ortho/para directing, so the nitro would be in ortho or para position relative to t-butyl.

Wait, but after nitration, we have a nitro group. Then, step iii is Fe/HCl, which might reduce the nitro group to an amine. Then step iv is another nitration, which doesn't make sense because the ring is already deactivated by the nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps Fe/HCl is used for some other purpose, like converting a nitro group to a diazonium salt.

Wait, perhaps I'm not following correctly. Let me think of each option step by step.

Option B:

i) t-butyl chloride, AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Since t-butyl is ortho/para director, the nitro group would be added either ortho or para to t-butyl.

Assuming para is major, so structure becomes 1-t-butyl-4-nitrobenzene.

Then, step iii is Fe/HCl. What's that? Fe/HCl is often used for the reduction of nitro groups. So, nitrobenzene → phenyl amine.

So, nitro group is converted to amine. So, structure becomes 1-t-butyl-4-aminobenzene.

Then, step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration. But now, the ring has an amine group, which is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So, the nitration would occur at ortho or para positions relative to the amine.

Wait, but the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy at 1 and t-butyl at 2. Hmm, not sure if that aligns.

Wait, maybe this isn't the correct path. Let's think about the target structure again.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, the nitro is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and t-butyl (position 2).

So, the nitro group is at position 3. Let me imagine the ring:

Position 1: ethoxy

Position 2: t-butyl

Position 3: nitro

Positions 4,5,6: H or other groups.

So, how to direct the groups to these positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is t-butyl → ethoxy → nitro.

After t-butyl is added to benzene, then ethoxy is added in ortho position. Then nitro is added in position 3, which is adjacent to both.

Wait, but wait, once ethoxy and t-butyl are present, where would the nitro group go?

Let me think:

If the first substituent is t-butyl, then ethoxy is added, which is ortho/para to t-butyl.

So, if ethoxy is added ortho to t-butyl, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy) and 2 (t-butyl). Then, the next substituent, nitro, would be added in which position?

After the ethoxy and t-butyl are present, the ring has two activating groups. The nitro group will be a meta director. Wait, no, the ring is activated, so nitration would be easier.

Wait, but in a ring with ethoxy (ortho/para) and t-butyl (ortho/para), where would the third substituent go?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a meta-directing group, but in this case, the substituents are activating, so the nitro would be added in a position influenced by both.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look at each option and see which sequence logically leads to the target.

Looking at option C:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So introducing a sulfonic acid group would direct the next substituents to meta positions.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So, nitro group would be added meta to sulfonic acid.

Wait, but then the next steps involve Fe/HCl, which again might be a reduction step.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the steps involved in introducing each group.

Another approach: the target has an ethoxy group. How is that introduced?

Ethoxy groups can be introduced via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires strong electron-withdrawing groups on the ring. So, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced after a nitro group is present.

Wait, but let's say the synthesis is done as follows:

1. Introduce tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Then, introduce nitro group via nitration, which would be para to tert-butyl.

3. Then, perhaps reduce the nitro group to amine.

4. Then, introduce ethoxy group via some substitution.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: The nitro group is introduced after ethoxy and t-butyl.

Wait, let's think about introducing ethoxy first. How?

Wait, benzene isn't nucleophilic enough for a direct substitution. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a good leaving group. But how to get that leaving group onto benzene?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has been activated by another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 reaction, but that requires a good leaving group attached to the benzene ring. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamson-type synthesis, but that's usually for forming ethers from alcohols and alkyl halides. Not sure how that applies here.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the steps in each option and see which sequence logically builds the target molecule.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → this often reduces nitro groups to amines. So nitrobenzene becomes phenyl amine (aminobenzene).

iii) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But aminobenzene is strongly activating, so FC alkylation could proceed.

So, adding t-butyl to aminobenzene. The amine is ortho/para director, so the t-butyl would go to ortho or para.

Then, iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again. But the ring is already activated by amine and t-butyl.

Wait, but after the first nitration, the ring becomes deactivated. Hmm, perhaps this isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps after introducing the t-butyl group, the ring is activated, so further nitration is possible.

Wait, but the target has three substituents, so let me see if option D's steps could lead to that.

Wait, step vi is SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Then, step vii is dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis. Step viii is H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis (like a diazonium salt hydrolysis). Step ix is NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy group via alkylation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit lost. Let me think again.

Alternatively, let's consider the target molecule. It has an ethoxy group, which is a strong activating group. So perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, but that requires the benzene ring to have a good leaving group.

Hmm, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced as a last step, via an SN2 reaction where a chloride is replaced by ethoxide. But how do we get a chloride on the benzene ring?

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after a nitration and reduction steps.

Wait, maybe I should think about each option's steps in the order given.

Looking again at option B:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So, t-butyl is ortho/para director. Let's say nitro is at para.

So structure is 4-nitro-1-t-butylbenzene.

iii) Fe/HCl → this reduces the nitro group to amine. So structure becomes 4-amino-1-t-butylbenzene.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again. Now, the ring has amine (which is ortho/para director) and t-butyl. So the new nitro would go ortho or para to the amine.

Wait, but the ring already has t-butyl and amine. So positions 1 (t-butyl), 4 (amine). If another nitro is added, where?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me imagine the t-butyl at position 1, amine at position 4. Then, adding a new nitro group would go to position 2 or 6 (ortho to amine) or position 3 or 5 (para to amine). But the target has nitro at position 3.

Hmm, maybe this is getting too confusing. Let me think differently.

Perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce the tert-butyl group.

2. Introduce the nitro group.

3. Introduce the ethoxy group.

But how?

Wait, introducing the ethoxy group last would require the ring to have activating groups to facilitate substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires strong deactivating groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a nitro group is already present.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, making substitution harder.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a diazo coupling or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's steps.

Option A: Steps are i) t-butyl, ii) nitration, iii) sulfonation, iv) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), v) H3O+/heat (hydrolysis), vi) NaOH/EtBr (ethoxy group via alkylation), vii) Fe/HCl, viii) HNO3/H2SO4, ix) dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, this seems a bit all over the place. Let me see.

t-butyl → nitration (so nitro added to t-butylbenzene, perhaps para). Then sulfonation (SO3 adds a sulfonic acid group, which is deactivating, meta director). Then, diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) and hydrolysis (H3O+/heat) would convert an amine to a nitro group, but I'm not sure where. Wait, perhaps sulfonation is followed by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are for introducing substituents in a way that directs the next group correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is introducing t-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy.

But how does that happen?

Wait, t-butyl is introduced (Friedel-Crafts). Then, nitro is introduced (nitration, para to t-butyl). Then, perhaps the nitro group is reduced to amine (Fe/HCl), then the ethoxy group is introduced via substitution.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would add an acyl group, which I don't think is the case here.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an option where the ethoxy group is introduced via an alkylation using NaOH and EtBr. Because that's one of the steps in some options.

Wait, looking at the options, they include steps like NaOH/EtBr, which is an alkoxy group introduction via SN2 mechanism. So, perhaps this step is used to introduce the ethoxy group.

So, when does this step occur?

If during the synthesis, the ethoxy group is introduced via NaOH and EtBr, that would require a good leaving group on the benzene ring. So, perhaps the leaving group is introduced earlier, such as through a nitro group which is then replaced.

Wait, but nitro groups can be converted into good leaving groups via diazotization and hydrolysis. For example, a nitro group can be converted into a diazonium salt, which upon heating with H2O, becomes a hydroxyl group, but that's a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

Nitro group → Diazotization → Hydrolysis to -OH → Then, alkoxy group via substitution with EtBr.

Wait, perhaps that's a way.

So, let's try that:

1. Introduce t-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Introduce nitro group via nitration, directed by t-butyl.

3. Convert nitro to diazonium salt (NaNO2/HCl) → then hydrolyze to -OH (using H3O+ and heat).

4. Then, perform alkylation with EtBr in NaOH to introduce ethoxy group.

But wait, this would place the ethoxy group in the position where the nitro group was.

Hmm, let me try to map this.

Let's say the t-butyl is at position 2. Then, nitro is introduced at position 3 (since t-butyl is ortho/para directing; but wait, in a ring with substituents, the nitro can go to para or ortho. Let me assume para is major. So nitro at position 4. But we need nitro at position 3 in the target.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the order wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is introduced in a position such that after conversion to OH and then to ethoxy, it ends up in position 3.

Wait, perhaps the steps in option A are:

i) t-butyl

ii) nitration → nitro at para

iii) sulfonation → adds a SO3 group. Wait, sulfonation would add a sulfonic acid group (SO3H), which is a strong deactivating, meta director.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → forms diazonium chloride.

v) H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis to produce a hydroxyl group.

vi) NaOH/EtBr → introduces ethoxy group via SN2 substitution.

vii) Fe/HCl → reduces something, perhaps the t-butyl group? No, t-butyl is not reducible under those conditions. Or maybe it's a different reaction.

viii) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

ix) Dilute H2SO4 → perhaps an acid workup.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but let's go step by step.

After step i: t-butyl benzene → substituent at position 1 (assuming t-butyl at position 1).

Step ii: nitration → nitro group at position 4 (para to t-butyl).

Structure: 1-t-butyl-4-nitrobenzene.

Step iii: sulfonation → adds SO3H group. Where? Sulfonic acid is meta director. So, the SO3H would be at position 3, meta to the existing nitro group (position 4). So, structure is 1-t-butyl-3-SO3H-4-nitrobenzene.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic group is added to the t-butyl group.

Wait, the sulfonation of t-butylbenzene would direct the sulfonic acid group to the positions ortho and para to the t-butyl group. Since t-butyl is ortho/para directing.

So, after step iii, the sulfonic acid group would be at position 2 or 4.

But in our target, position 3 is nitro. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid group is not needed in the target, but maybe it's a step towards introducing another group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option C:

Steps are:

i) t-butyl

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation: adds SO3H group, which is deactivating, meta director.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, with the ring having t-butyl and SO3H groups, where does nitro go?

The t-butyl is ortho/para, and SO3H is meta. So the nitro group would be in a position directed by both.

Hmm, perhaps not the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Introduce ethoxy group via sulfonation and substitution.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, another approach: Nitro group is meta with respect to t-butyl, and ethoxy is para to t-butyl.

Wait, but in the target, ethoxy is at position 1, t-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, position 1 is adjacent to 2.

So perhaps the order is:

t-butyl → ethoxy → nitro.

But how to direct the nitro to position 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add t-butyl (Friedel-Crafts).

2. Add ethoxy group.

3. Add nitro group.

But how to add ethoxy group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after activating the ring with another group.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think of the options again.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3 → nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine: aminobenzene.

iii) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → alkylation. Since amine is a strong activating group, t-butyl would be added ortho or para.

Assuming para, the structure is 4-t-butyl-aminobenzene.

iv) HNO3 → nitration again. Since amine is ortho/para director, nitro adds ortho or para to aminobenzene.

Assuming para, then where? The t-butyl is at 4, aminobenzene would have the amine at 1. So adding nitro at position 3 (para to amine) would be possible.

Wait, but the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and t-butyl (position 2).

Hmm, perhaps this is getting somewhere.

After step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce nitro to amine at 1.

Step iii: add t-butyl at position 4 (para to amine).

Step iv: nitration adds nitro at position 3 (para to amine at 1? Or ortho to amine? Wait, amine is ortho/para director.

Wait, perhaps nitration adds nitro at position 3 (if the ring is such that the amine is at 1, t-butyl at 4, and nitro at 3. But then, where is the ethoxy group?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting nowhere.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is option C.

Option C:

i) t-butyl → t-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3 → sulfonation. Sulfonic acid group is at position 3, meta to t-butyl.

iii) HNO3 → nitration. Now, where? The ring has t-butyl (ortho/para) and SO3H (meta). Nitro group could be directed by each.

Wait, perhaps the nitro ends up at position 4 (para to t-butyl), but that's just a guess.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Another idea: The target has the ethoxy group at position 1, t-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, the substituents are in adjacent positions (1,2,3). How can this happen?

Perhaps the ethoxy and t-butyl groups are added first in adjacent positions, then the nitro group is added in the meta position relative to one of them.

But how?

Wait, if ethoxy is at 1, t-butyl at 2, then nitro can be added at 3. But how to achieve that.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after activating the ring with a nitro group. Wait, but nitro is deactivating.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option C's steps:

i) t-butyl

ii) SO3 → sulfonic acid (SO3H) at meta to t-butyl → position 3.

iii) HNO3 → nitration. Now, the ring has t-butyl (ortho/para) and SO3H (meta). So, where would the nitro go?

Perhaps it would go to position 4 (para to t-butyl), since t-butyl is a stronger director than SO3H.

Then, step iv → Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. So, nitro at 4 → amine at 4.

Step v → NaNO2/HCl → diazotization → forms diazonium chloride.

Step vi → HNO3 → nitration again? Or perhaps another reaction.

Wait, perhaps step vi is another nitration, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe this is a way to introduce a substituent.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the presence of the ethoxy group introduction via NaOH and EtBr. Which options have that?

Options A, B, C, D all have NaOH/EtBr as a step. Let me think about when that occurs.

In option A, step vii is NaOH/EtBr. So, after several other steps, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced here.

But in the target, the ethoxy is at position 1, which is next to t-butyl at 2 and nitro at 3.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced after the nitro group is in place. But that would require the ring to have a good leaving group at the desired position.

Wait, let's think about option D again.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3 → nitro at position 1 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aminobenzene.

iii) t-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts → t-butyl adds to aminobenzene. So, since amine is ortho/para, t-butyl can be at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

Assuming para, t-butyl at 4.

iv) HNO3 → nitration again. Now, the ring has amine at 1 and t-butyl at 4. Nitration would occur ortho or para to amine. So, possible positions 2 or 3.

If nitro is added at position 3, that's adjacent to positions 2 and 4 (t-butyl is at 4).

Wait, but in the target, nitro is at 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (1) and t-butyl (2). Hmm, but in this case, the amine is at 1, t-butyl at 4, and nitro at 3.

Then, step v → NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. The amine at position 1 is converted to diazonium chloride.

Step vi → SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Wait, not sure about this step.

Step vii → dilute H2SO4 → perhaps acid workup.

Step viii → H3O+/heat → hydrolysis of diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group (at position 1).

Step ix → NaOH/EtBr → substitution to introduce ethoxy group at position 1.

So, putting it all together:

After step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: amine at 1.

Step iii: t-butyl at 4.

Step iv: nitro at 3.

Step v: diazonium at 1.

Step vi: not sure.

Step viii: hydroxyl at 1.

Step ix: ethoxy at 1.

So, the substituents are ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 4, nitro at 3. But the target has ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps during step iii, the t-butyl adds at position 2 (ortho to amine at 1). Then, position 4 would be available.

Let me try that:

After step iii: t-butyl at 2 (ortho to amine at 1).

Then, step iv: nitration → nitro added at position 3 (para to amine at 1, which is ortho to t-butyl at 2).

So, nitro at position 3.

Then, step v: amine at 1 → diazonium.

Step viii: hydroxyl at 1.

Step ix: ethoxy at 1.

So, substituents are ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. Which matches the target.

So, the steps in option D would lead to this.

Wait, let me check option D's steps again.

Option D steps:

i) HNO3 → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine at 1.

iii) t-butyl chloride → t-butyl at 2 (ortho to amine).

iv) HNO3 → nitro at 3.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazonium at 1.

vi) SO3 → sulfonation? Not sure about this step's purpose.

vi) SO3/H2SO4.

Wait, but after this step, the structure has SO3 group. Then step vii is dilute H2SO4. Then viii) H3O+/heat → hydrolysis of diazonium to OH. Then ix) NaOH and EtBr → ethoxy.

So, the order makes sense. After nitration and adding the substituents, the amine is converted to OH, then to ethoxy.

So, the sequence in option D would lead to the target.

Wait, but let me outline this:

After step iv, the structure is 1-amino-2-t-butyl-3-nitrobenzene.

Step v: diazonium at 1.

Step vi: sulfonation? Maybe adding a SO3 group, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps that step is a mistake, but let's proceed.

Step vii: dilute H2SO4 → maybe nothing, or perhaps a workup.

Step viii: H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis of diazonium salt at position 1 to OH. So now, structure is 1-OH-2-t-butyl-3-nitrobenzene.

Step ix: NaOH and EtBr → SN2 substitution, OH replaced by OEt. So, ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. Which is the target.

So, this seems to fit.

Therefore, option D is the correct sequence.

To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro) are introduced in a way that their directing effects lead to the desired positions on the benzene ring. The target molecule has the tert-butyl group at position 2, the ethoxy group at position 1, and the nitro group at position 3. The synthesis involves the following key steps:

1. **Introduction of the Amine Group**: The synthesis begins with nitration of benzene to introduce a nitro group at position 1, forming nitrobenzene. This is followed by reduction of the nitro group to an amine using Fe/HCl, resulting in aminobenzene (phenylamine).

2. **Introduction of the tert-Butyl Group**: The amine group is a strong ortho/para director. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride in the presence of AlCl₃ introduces the tert-butyl group at position 2 (ortho to the amine group).

3. **Introduction of the Nitro Group**: With the amine at position 1 and tert-butyl at position 2, the nitro group is introduced via nitration. The amine directs the nitro group to position 3 (meta to the tert-butyl group).

4. **Conversion of the Amine to a Hydroxyl Group**: The amine group at position 1 is converted to a diazonium salt using NaNO₂/HCl. Subsequent hydrolysis with H₃O⁺/heat replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group.

5. **Introduction of the Ethoxy Group**: The hydroxyl group at position 1 is replaced with an ethoxy group via an SN2 reaction using NaOH and ethyl bromide (EtBr).

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: This sequence introduces the tert-butyl group first, followed by nitration, sulfonation, diazotization, hydrolysis, and ethoxy introduction. However, the sequence does not align with the required directing effects to achieve the target structure.

- **Option B**: This sequence introduces the tert-butyl group first, followed by nitration, reduction, and subsequent reactions. However, the steps do not logically lead to the correct positions of the substituents in the target molecule.

- **Option C**: This sequence introduces the tert-butyl group first, followed by sulfonation and nitration. However, the directing effects of the sulfonic acid group complicate the placement of the nitro group, making it inconsistent with the target structure.

- **Option D**: This sequence begins with nitration to introduce the nitro group, followed by reduction to an amine, Friedel-Crafts alkylation to introduce the tert-butyl group, and subsequent nitration to add the nitro group at position 3. The amine is then converted to a hydroxyl group and finally replaced with the ethoxy group. This sequence aligns perfectly with the required directing effects and leads to the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is provided in **Option D**, as it ensures the correct placement of the substituents on the benzene ring through the proper use of directing effects and reaction conditions.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, I'll draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, positions are numbered in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So, let me imagine the benzene ring. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, but the numbering might be adjusted. Alternatively, maybe it's more like position 1: ethoxy, position 2: tert-butyl, position 3: nitro. Or could it be position 1: ethoxy, position 2: nitro, position 3: tert-butyl? No, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, so positions 1, 2, 3 have substituents in that order. So benzene ring with substituents at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, the substituents are at adjacent positions? Let me think. 1, 2, 3 would be consecutive positions. So ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So that's a meta arrangement for the ethoxy and nitro groups, but adjacent to each other.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the directing effects of the substituents. So, in the synthesis steps, each group is introduced through a substitution reaction, and the order of substitution will affect where the next group attaches.

So the target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's think about their positions in the target structure. Since the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, the molecule is more or less a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Now, the substituents' order of introduction is crucial. We start with benzene. Let's think about the possible substituents and the directing effects.

Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an O-alkyl group, which is ortho/para directing). Nitro is a deactivating, meta-directing group. The tert-butyl group is a bulky, activating, but since it's a strong alkyl group, it's ortho/para directing.

But wait, tert-butyl is a strong activating group? No, wait. Alkyl groups are activating, as they are electron-donating through sigma bonds. So, yes, tert-butyl is activating and ortho/para directing.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating and meta directing. So if we introduce nitro after ethoxy, its position would be determined by the other substituents.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's think step by step.

We need to introduce three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro. Let me consider the possible order of substitution.

But wait, the nitro group is a meta director, but if it's introduced first, where would the next groups go? Or maybe the nitro is introduced last because it's a strong deactivating group, making subsequent substitutions difficult. Or perhaps the nitro is introduced second.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced first because it's an activating group, which allows for easier substitution.

Wait, but let's think about each possible reaction in the options and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options, all of them start with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3, which is Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride would introduce a tert-butyl group. But wait, benzene can undergo Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but the tert-butyl group is bulky—so it may undergo some carbocation rearrangements. Hmm, but perhaps in this case, the t-butyl is introduced as a substituent.

But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is only possible if the alkylating agent forms a stable carbocation. t-butyl is a tertiary carbocation, so it's pretty stable. So, the reaction would proceed, and the t-butyl group would add to benzene, giving 2-tert-butylbenzene or more accurately, maybe it's more likely to substitute in para position, but due to steric hindrance, perhaps ortho is minor and para is major. Wait, but with a bulky group like t-butyl, the major product might be para, but depending on the method.

But wait, perhaps the first step is adding t-butyl chloride using AlCl3 as a catalyst, so that gives the tert-butyl benzene.

Then, the next step in each option varies.

Looking at option A: after t-butyl, it's HNO3/H2SO4, which is nitration. So the next substituent would be nitro. Then, SO3/H2SO4, which is sulfonation. Then, NaNO2/HCl, which is diazotization. Then, H3O+ and heat, which is hydrolysis. Then, NaOH and EtBr, which is ethoxy group introduction via alkylation.

Wait, but order matters because substituents direct where new groups go.

Alternatively, perhaps let's outline the steps needed to reach the target structure.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

We need to find the order of introducing these groups.

Let me think about the order that will best facilitate the synthesis.

One approach is to introduce the groups that are meta directors first because once they're in place, they can influence the positions of the next substituents.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director, so if introduced early, it will influence where other groups go.

Alternatively, considering that the ethoxy and t-butyl groups are activating, perhaps we should introduce them after nitro, because once nitro is present, it deactivates the ring and directs meta.

Wait, but maybe that's the other way around.

Let me think: Suppose I first introduce nitro. Benzene → nitrobenzene (via nitration). Then, nitro is meta-directing. Next, I could introduce ethoxy. When I nitro is present, the ethoxy would come in the meta position relative to nitro. But wait, ethoxy is an activating group, so it can be introduced via substitution, perhaps via the ethoxy being added later.

But the target has ethoxy at position 1, t-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Let's think about the positions.

Wait, perhaps the order is: ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

If ethoxy is introduced first, it's an activating, ortho/para director. Then, when t-butyl is added via Friedel-Crafts, it would be directed to ortho or para positions relative to ethoxy.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. So, after ethoxy is attached, the ring is activated, so Friedel-Crafts can proceed.

So, benzene → ethoxybenzene (ethoxy group via, say, an etherification, but how? Wait, introducing ethoxy would require an alkoxy group, which is typically done via a nucleophilic substitution, but benzene is not nucleophilic. Wait, perhaps via a substitution using something like Williamson-type synthesis, but that's for ethers. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a leaving group is present.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The ethoxy group is OCH2CH3. To introduce an ethoxy group onto benzene, the common method is via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires strong activating groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's introduced via a substitution after a nitration or another reaction.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an alkoxy group using a Friedel-Crafts type mechanism, but wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation or acylation, not alkoxy. Because alkoxy groups are typically introduced through other methods, such as using an alkyl halide with a strong base or via another mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution, but that's difficult unless there's a leaving group. So maybe it's introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after the ring has been activated with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently.

The target molecule has three substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's think about their directing effects.

Ethoxy (OCH2CH3) is activating, ortho/para-directing.

t-Butyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.

Nitro is deactivating, meta-directing.

So, when introducing the substituents, the order matters because each new group directs the next substitution.

Let's say we introduce the nitro group last. Then, the other substituents would have to be added in positions such that the nitro group can be placed correctly.

Wait, but if nitro is introduced last, we have to have the ring already activated by other groups, but nitro is deactivating, which makes further substitution difficult. So perhaps nitro is introduced earlier.

Wait, but maybe the nitro is introduced after t-butyl and ethoxy groups are already present. Because once nitro is on the ring, the ring becomes deactivated, making further substitution difficult.

But in the target, the nitro group is at position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy (position 1) and t-butyl (position 2). So, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ethoxy and t-butyl groups are in place.

Wait, but that's tricky because after introducing ethoxy and t-butyl, the ring might be highly activated. Then, adding nitro via nitration would be possible.

Wait, but when the ring is activated, like with two activating groups, the nitration would be more difficult because nitro is a deactivating group. Or maybe it's easier? No, wait, the ring's activation would make the nitration happen more readily, but the position would be determined by the substituents present.

Wait, but let's think of this: the t-butyl group is introduced first.

So, benzene → t-butyl benzene via Friedel-Crafts.

Now, the t-butyl group is ortho/para directing. Next, perhaps introduce the ethoxy group.

But introducing OCH2CH3 via Friedel-Crafts isn't possible because that's for alkylation. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method, like using an electrophilic substitution with a good leaving group. Wait, but benzene rings don't typically undergo substitution easily unless activated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires strong activating groups. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after nitration. Let me think:

Another approach: Introduce the nitro group first. Benzene → nitrobenzene. Then, nitro is meta directing. Next, introduce the ethoxy group. Since nitro is meta directing, the ethoxy would go into the meta position relative to nitro.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3, and the ethoxy is at position 1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced first. Benzene → ethoxybenzene. Then, the ethoxy directs the next substituent to ortho or para positions. Let's say the next substituent is the t-butyl group. So, adding t-butyl to ethoxybenzene would go to ortho or para. If it's para, then the positions would be 1 (ethoxy) and 4 (t-butyl). But the target has t-butyl at position 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the t-butyl is added to the ortho position of ethoxy, making positions 1 (ethoxy) and 2 (t-butyl). Then, the third substituent (nitro) would need to be at position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy and t-butyl.

Wait, but adding nitro after ethoxy and t-butyl would require the ring to be activated enough to undergo nitration. But nitro is a deactivating group, so perhaps that's not the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added before the ethoxy group.

Wait, let's outline the steps again.

Option D is:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → this is a reaction for removing a nitro group via reduction. Wait, Fe/HCl is sometimes used for the hydrolysis of nitro groups under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Fe/HCl is a catalyst for some reactions, like diazotization. Wait, no, more likely, it's used in the reduction of nitro groups. For example, nitrobenzene can be reduced to phenyl amine using Fe/HCl as a catalyst.

So, if the first step is nitration, then the ring has a nitro group. Then, perhaps the next step is reduction of the nitro group to an amine, but why would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the option is suggesting a different order. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced last.

Wait, let's think about each option.

Looking at option B:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So benzene becomes t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So nitro group is added. Now, where does the nitro group go?

The t-butyl is ortho/para directing. So in t-butylbenzene, the nitro group would be introduced either ortho, meta, or para to the t-butyl. Wait, no, wait: no, the substituent directs the next group. The t-butyl is ortho/para directing, so the nitro would be in ortho or para position relative to t-butyl.

Wait, but after nitration, we have a nitro group. Then, step iii is Fe/HCl, which might reduce the nitro group to an amine. Then step iv is another nitration, which doesn't make sense because the ring is already deactivated by the nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps Fe/HCl is used for some other purpose, like converting a nitro group to a diazonium salt.

Wait, perhaps I'm not following correctly. Let me think of each option step by step.

Option B:

i) t-butyl chloride, AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Since t-butyl is ortho/para director, the nitro group would be added either ortho or para to t-butyl.

Assuming para is major, so structure becomes 1-t-butyl-4-nitrobenzene.

Then, step iii is Fe/HCl. What's that? Fe/HCl is often used for the reduction of nitro groups. So, nitrobenzene → phenyl amine.

So, nitro group is converted to amine. So, structure becomes 1-t-butyl-4-aminobenzene.

Then, step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration. But now, the ring has an amine group, which is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So, the nitration would occur at ortho or para positions relative to the amine.

Wait, but the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy at 1 and t-butyl at 2. Hmm, not sure if that aligns.

Wait, maybe this isn't the correct path. Let's think about the target structure again.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, the nitro is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and t-butyl (position 2).

So, the nitro group is at position 3. Let me imagine the ring:

Position 1: ethoxy

Position 2: t-butyl

Position 3: nitro

Positions 4,5,6: H or other groups.

So, how to direct the groups to these positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is t-butyl → ethoxy → nitro.

After t-butyl is added to benzene, then ethoxy is added in ortho position. Then nitro is added in position 3, which is adjacent to both.

Wait, but wait, once ethoxy and t-butyl are present, where would the nitro group go?

Let me think:

If the first substituent is t-butyl, then ethoxy is added, which is ortho/para to t-butyl.

So, if ethoxy is added ortho to t-butyl, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy) and 2 (t-butyl). Then, the next substituent, nitro, would be added in which position?

After the ethoxy and t-butyl are present, the ring has two activating groups. The nitro group will be a meta director. Wait, no, the ring is activated, so nitration would be easier.

Wait, but in a ring with ethoxy (ortho/para) and t-butyl (ortho/para), where would the third substituent go?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a meta-directing group, but in this case, the substituents are activating, so the nitro would be added in a position influenced by both.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look at each option and see which sequence logically leads to the target.

Looking at option C:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So introducing a sulfonic acid group would direct the next substituents to meta positions.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So, nitro group would be added meta to sulfonic acid.

Wait, but then the next steps involve Fe/HCl, which again might be a reduction step.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the steps involved in introducing each group.

Another approach: the target has an ethoxy group. How is that introduced?

Ethoxy groups can be introduced via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires strong electron-withdrawing groups on the ring. So, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced after a nitro group is present.

Wait, but let's say the synthesis is done as follows:

1. Introduce tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Then, introduce nitro group via nitration, which would be para to tert-butyl.

3. Then, perhaps reduce the nitro group to amine.

4. Then, introduce ethoxy group via some substitution.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: The nitro group is introduced after ethoxy and t-butyl.

Wait, let's think about introducing ethoxy first. How?

Wait, benzene isn't nucleophilic enough for a direct substitution. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a good leaving group. But how to get that leaving group onto benzene?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has been activated by another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 reaction, but that requires a good leaving group attached to the benzene ring. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamson-type synthesis, but that's usually for forming ethers from alcohols and alkyl halides. Not sure how that applies here.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the steps in each option and see which sequence logically builds the target molecule.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → this often reduces nitro groups to amines. So nitrobenzene becomes phenyl amine (aminobenzene).

iii) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But aminobenzene is strongly activating, so FC alkylation could proceed.

So, adding t-butyl to aminobenzene. The amine is ortho/para director, so the t-butyl would go to ortho or para.

Then, iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again. But the ring is already activated by amine and t-butyl.

Wait, but after the first nitration, the ring becomes deactivated. Hmm, perhaps this isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps after introducing the t-butyl group, the ring is activated, so further nitration is possible.

Wait, but the target has three substituents, so let me see if option D's steps could lead to that.

Wait, step vi is SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Then, step vii is dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis. Step viii is H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis (like a diazonium salt hydrolysis). Step ix is NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy group via alkylation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit lost. Let me think again.

Alternatively, let's consider the target molecule. It has an ethoxy group, which is a strong activating group. So perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, but that requires the benzene ring to have a good leaving group.

Hmm, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced as a last step, via an SN2 reaction where a chloride is replaced by ethoxide. But how do we get a chloride on the benzene ring?

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after a nitration and reduction steps.

Wait, maybe I should think about each option's steps in the order given.

Looking again at option B:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So, t-butyl is ortho/para director. Let's say nitro is at para.

So structure is 4-nitro-1-t-butylbenzene.

iii) Fe/HCl → this reduces the nitro group to amine. So structure becomes 4-amino-1-t-butylbenzene.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again. Now, the ring has amine (which is ortho/para director) and t-butyl. So the new nitro would go ortho or para to the amine.

Wait, but the ring already has t-butyl and amine. So positions 1 (t-butyl), 4 (amine). If another nitro is added, where?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me imagine the t-butyl at position 1, amine at position 4. Then, adding a new nitro group would go to position 2 or 6 (ortho to amine) or position 3 or 5 (para to amine). But the target has nitro at position 3.

Hmm, maybe this is getting too confusing. Let me think differently.

Perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce the tert-butyl group.

2. Introduce the nitro group.

3. Introduce the ethoxy group.

But how?

Wait, introducing the ethoxy group last would require the ring to have activating groups to facilitate substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires strong deactivating groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a nitro group is already present.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, making substitution harder.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a diazo coupling or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's steps.

Option A: Steps are i) t-butyl, ii) nitration, iii) sulfonation, iv) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), v) H3O+/heat (hydrolysis), vi) NaOH/EtBr (ethoxy group via alkylation), vii) Fe/HCl, viii) HNO3/H2SO4, ix) dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, this seems a bit all over the place. Let me see.

t-butyl → nitration (so nitro added to t-butylbenzene, perhaps para). Then sulfonation (SO3 adds a sulfonic acid group, which is deactivating, meta director). Then, diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) and hydrolysis (H3O+/heat) would convert an amine to a nitro group, but I'm not sure where. Wait, perhaps sulfonation is followed by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are for introducing substituents in a way that directs the next group correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is introducing t-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy.

But how does that happen?

Wait, t-butyl is introduced (Friedel-Crafts). Then, nitro is introduced (nitration, para to t-butyl). Then, perhaps the nitro group is reduced to amine (Fe/HCl), then the ethoxy group is introduced via substitution.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would add an acyl group, which I don't think is the case here.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an option where the ethoxy group is introduced via an alkylation using NaOH and EtBr. Because that's one of the steps in some options.

Wait, looking at the options, they include steps like NaOH/EtBr, which is an alkoxy group introduction via SN2 mechanism. So, perhaps this step is used to introduce the ethoxy group.

So, when does this step occur?

If during the synthesis, the ethoxy group is introduced via NaOH and EtBr, that would require a good leaving group on the benzene ring. So, perhaps the leaving group is introduced earlier, such as through a nitro group which is then replaced.

Wait, but nitro groups can be converted into good leaving groups via diazotization and hydrolysis. For example, a nitro group can be converted into a diazonium salt, which upon heating with H2O, becomes a hydroxyl group, but that's a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

Nitro group → Diazotization → Hydrolysis to -OH → Then, alkoxy group via substitution with EtBr.

Wait, perhaps that's a way.

So, let's try that:

1. Introduce t-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Introduce nitro group via nitration, directed by t-butyl.

3. Convert nitro to diazonium salt (NaNO2/HCl) → then hydrolyze to -OH (using H3O+ and heat).

4. Then, perform alkylation with EtBr in NaOH to introduce ethoxy group.

But wait, this would place the ethoxy group in the position where the nitro group was.

Hmm, let me try to map this.

Let's say the t-butyl is at position 2. Then, nitro is introduced at position 3 (since t-butyl is ortho/para directing; but wait, in a ring with substituents, the nitro can go to para or ortho. Let me assume para is major. So nitro at position 4. But we need nitro at position 3 in the target.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the order wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is introduced in a position such that after conversion to OH and then to ethoxy, it ends up in position 3.

Wait, perhaps the steps in option A are:

i) t-butyl

ii) nitration → nitro at para

iii) sulfonation → adds a SO3 group. Wait, sulfonation would add a sulfonic acid group (SO3H), which is a strong deactivating, meta director.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → forms diazonium chloride.

v) H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis to produce a hydroxyl group.

vi) NaOH/EtBr → introduces ethoxy group via SN2 substitution.

vii) Fe/HCl → reduces something, perhaps the t-butyl group? No, t-butyl is not reducible under those conditions. Or maybe it's a different reaction.

viii) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

ix) Dilute H2SO4 → perhaps an acid workup.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but let's go step by step.

After step i: t-butyl benzene → substituent at position 1 (assuming t-butyl at position 1).

Step ii: nitration → nitro group at position 4 (para to t-butyl).

Structure: 1-t-butyl-4-nitrobenzene.

Step iii: sulfonation → adds SO3H group. Where? Sulfonic acid is meta director. So, the SO3H would be at position 3, meta to the existing nitro group (position 4). So, structure is 1-t-butyl-3-SO3H-4-nitrobenzene.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic group is added to the t-butyl group.

Wait, the sulfonation of t-butylbenzene would direct the sulfonic acid group to the positions ortho and para to the t-butyl group. Since t-butyl is ortho/para directing.

So, after step iii, the sulfonic acid group would be at position 2 or 4.

But in our target, position 3 is nitro. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid group is not needed in the target, but maybe it's a step towards introducing another group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option C:

Steps are:

i) t-butyl

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation: adds SO3H group, which is deactivating, meta director.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, with the ring having t-butyl and SO3H groups, where does nitro go?

The t-butyl is ortho/para, and SO3H is meta. So the nitro group would be in a position directed by both.

Hmm, perhaps not the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Introduce ethoxy group via sulfonation and substitution.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, another approach: Nitro group is meta with respect to t-butyl, and ethoxy is para to t-butyl.

Wait, but in the target, ethoxy is at position 1, t-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, position 1 is adjacent to 2.

So perhaps the order is:

t-butyl → ethoxy → nitro.

But how to direct the nitro to position 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add t-butyl (Friedel-Crafts).

2. Add ethoxy group.

3. Add nitro group.

But how to add ethoxy group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after activating the ring with another group.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think of the options again.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3 → nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine: aminobenzene.

iii) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → alkylation. Since amine is a strong activating group, t-butyl would be added ortho or para.

Assuming para, the structure is 4-t-butyl-aminobenzene.

iv) HNO3 → nitration again. Since amine is ortho/para director, nitro adds ortho or para to aminobenzene.

Assuming para, then where? The t-butyl is at 4, aminobenzene would have the amine at 1. So adding nitro at position 3 (para to amine) would be possible.

Wait, but the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and t-butyl (position 2).

Hmm, perhaps this is getting somewhere.

After step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce nitro to amine at 1.

Step iii: add t-butyl at position 4 (para to amine).

Step iv: nitration adds nitro at position 3 (para to amine at 1? Or ortho to amine? Wait, amine is ortho/para director.

Wait, perhaps nitration adds nitro at position 3 (if the ring is such that the amine is at 1, t-butyl at 4, and nitro at 3. But then, where is the ethoxy group?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting nowhere.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is option C.

Option C:

i) t-butyl → t-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3 → sulfonation. Sulfonic acid group is at position 3, meta to t-butyl.

iii) HNO3 → nitration. Now, where? The ring has t-butyl (ortho/para) and SO3H (meta). Nitro group could be directed by each.

Wait, perhaps the nitro ends up at position 4 (para to t-butyl), but that's just a guess.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Another idea: The target has the ethoxy group at position 1, t-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, the substituents are in adjacent positions (1,2,3). How can this happen?

Perhaps the ethoxy and t-butyl groups are added first in adjacent positions, then the nitro group is added in the meta position relative to one of them.

But how?

Wait, if ethoxy is at 1, t-butyl at 2, then nitro can be added at 3. But how to achieve that.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after activating the ring with a nitro group. Wait, but nitro is deactivating.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option C's steps:

i) t-butyl

ii) SO3 → sulfonic acid (SO3H) at meta to t-butyl → position 3.

iii) HNO3 → nitration. Now, the ring has t-butyl (ortho/para) and SO3H (meta). So, where would the nitro go?

Perhaps it would go to position 4 (para to t-butyl), since t-butyl is a stronger director than SO3H.

Then, step iv → Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. So, nitro at 4 → amine at 4.

Step v → NaNO2/HCl → diazotization → forms diazonium chloride.

Step vi → HNO3 → nitration again? Or perhaps another reaction.

Wait, perhaps step vi is another nitration, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe this is a way to introduce a substituent.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the presence of the ethoxy group introduction via NaOH and EtBr. Which options have that?

Options A, B, C, D all have NaOH/EtBr as a step. Let me think about when that occurs.

In option A, step vii is NaOH/EtBr. So, after several other steps, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced here.

But in the target, the ethoxy is at position 1, which is next to t-butyl at 2 and nitro at 3.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced after the nitro group is in place. But that would require the ring to have a good leaving group at the desired position.

Wait, let's think about option D again.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3 → nitro at position 1 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aminobenzene.

iii) t-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts → t-butyl adds to aminobenzene. So, since amine is ortho/para, t-butyl can be at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

Assuming para, t-butyl at 4.

iv) HNO3 → nitration again. Now, the ring has amine at 1 and t-butyl at 4. Nitration would occur ortho or para to amine. So, possible positions 2 or 3.

If nitro is added at position 3, that's adjacent to positions 2 and 4 (t-butyl is at 4).

Wait, but in the target, nitro is at 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (1) and t-butyl (2). Hmm, but in this case, the amine is at 1, t-butyl at 4, and nitro at 3.

Then, step v → NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. The amine at position 1 is converted to diazonium chloride.

Step vi → SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Wait, not sure about this step.

Step vii → dilute H2SO4 → perhaps acid workup.

Step viii → H3O+/heat → hydrolysis of diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group (at position 1).

Step ix → NaOH/EtBr → substitution to introduce ethoxy group at position 1.

So, putting it all together:

After step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: amine at 1.

Step iii: t-butyl at 4.

Step iv: nitro at 3.

Step v: diazonium at 1.

Step vi: not sure.

Step viii: hydroxyl at 1.

Step ix: ethoxy at 1.

So, the substituents are ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 4, nitro at 3. But the target has ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps during step iii, the t-butyl adds at position 2 (ortho to amine at 1). Then, position 4 would be available.

Let me try that:

After step iii: t-butyl at 2 (ortho to amine at 1).

Then, step iv: nitration → nitro added at position 3 (para to amine at 1, which is ortho to t-butyl at 2).

So, nitro at position 3.

Then, step v: amine at 1 → diazonium.

Step viii: hydroxyl at 1.

Step ix: ethoxy at 1.

So, substituents are ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. Which matches the target.

So, the steps in option D would lead to this.

Wait, let me check option D's steps again.

Option D steps:

i) HNO3 → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine at 1.

iii) t-butyl chloride → t-butyl at 2 (ortho to amine).

iv) HNO3 → nitro at 3.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazonium at 1.

vi) SO3 → sulfonation? Not sure about this step's purpose.

vi) SO3/H2SO4.

Wait, but after this step, the structure has SO3 group. Then step vii is dilute H2SO4. Then viii) H3O+/heat → hydrolysis of diazonium to OH. Then ix) NaOH and EtBr → ethoxy.

So, the order makes sense. After nitration and adding the substituents, the amine is converted to OH, then to ethoxy.

So, the sequence in option D would lead to the target.

Wait, but let me outline this:

After step iv, the structure is 1-amino-2-t-butyl-3-nitrobenzene.

Step v: diazonium at 1.

Step vi: sulfonation? Maybe adding a SO3 group, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps that step is a mistake, but let's proceed.

Step vii: dilute H2SO4 → maybe nothing, or perhaps a workup.

Step viii: H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis of diazonium salt at position 1 to OH. So now, structure is 1-OH-2-t-butyl-3-nitrobenzene.

Step ix: NaOH and EtBr → SN2 substitution, OH replaced by OEt. So, ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. Which is the target.

So, this seems to fit.

Therefore, option D is the correct sequence.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro) are introduced in a way that their directing effects lead to the desired positions on the benzene ring. The target molecule has the tert-butyl group at position 2, the ethoxy group at position 1, and the nitro group at position 3. The synthesis involves the following key steps:

1. **Introduction of the Amine Group**: The synthesis begins with nitration of benzene to introduce a nitro group at position 1, forming nitrobenzene. This is followed by reduction of the nitro group to an amine using Fe/HCl, resulting in aminobenzene (phenylamine).

2. **Introduction of the tert-Butyl Group**: The amine group is a strong ortho/para director. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride in the presence of AlCl₃ introduces the tert-butyl group at position 2 (ortho to the amine group).

3. **Introduction of the Nitro Group**: With the amine at position 1 and tert-butyl at position 2, the nitro group is introduced via nitration. The amine directs the nitro group to position 3 (meta to the tert-butyl group).

4. **Conversion of the Amine to a Hydroxyl Group**: The amine group at position 1 is converted to a diazonium salt using NaNO₂/HCl. Subsequent hydrolysis with H₃O⁺/heat replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group.

5. **Introduction of the Ethoxy Group**: The hydroxyl group at position 1 is replaced with an ethoxy group via an SN2 reaction using NaOH and ethyl bromide (EtBr).

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: This sequence introduces the tert-butyl group first, followed by nitration, sulfonation, diazotization, hydrolysis, and ethoxy introduction. However, the sequence does not align with the required directing effects to achieve the target structure.

- **Option B**: This sequence introduces the tert-butyl group first, followed by nitration, reduction, and subsequent reactions. However, the steps do not logically lead to the correct positions of the substituents in the target molecule.

- **Option C**: This sequence introduces the tert-butyl group first, followed by sulfonation and nitration. However, the directing effects of the sulfonic acid group complicate the placement of the nitro group, making it inconsistent with the target structure.

- **Option D**: This sequence begins with nitration to introduce the nitro group, followed by reduction to an amine, Friedel-Crafts alkylation to introduce the tert-butyl group, and subsequent nitration to add the nitro group at position 3. The amine is then converted to a hydroxyl group and finally replaced with the ethoxy group. This sequence aligns perfectly with the required directing effects and leads to the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is provided in **Option D**, as it ensures the correct placement of the substituents on the benzene ring through the proper use of directing effects and reaction conditions.
