Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question involves two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're supposed to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has l=1 because it's a p orbital. The total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1.

The question asks for the joint probability of measuring both electrons' Lz components and getting -ℏ each. So we need to find the probability that L1z = -ℏ and L2z = -ℏ.

Hmm, let me think about angular momentum coupling. When you couple two angular momenta, you can express the total state as a combination of product states. Each product state is |l1, m1> |l2, m2>, and the total state is a linear combination of these.

The coupled state here is |1,1,2,-1>. I remember that states with total l and m are formed by combining all possible combinations of m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = m_total.

In this case, the total m is -1. So each product state contributing to |1,1,2,-1> must have m1 + m2 = -1.

Electron 1 has l1=1, so m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Similarly for electron 2. But when we combine them, the total m is -1. So we need all pairs (m1, m2) where m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible pairs are (m1, m2) = (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -2), but wait, wait. Wait, l2 is 1, so m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, m2 can be -1, 0, +1 only. So the possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Because 1 + (-2) is impossible since m2 can't be -2.

Wait, no, let me think again. For the coupled state |l=2, m=-1>, the possible m1 and m2 combinations are such that m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

(-1, 0) → sum is -1.

(0, -1) → sum is -1.

But what about (1, -2)? No, because m2 can't be -2 for l2=1. So only two possible product states contribute.

Wait, but wait. The total state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m1=1, m2=-2> → but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2=1. So that's not possible. So only the two possibilities I mentioned before are valid.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the general expansion of |l, m> states. The |l=2, m= -1> state is formed by a linear combination of |l1=1, m1> |l2=1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

The possible m1 and m2 are:
m1 = -1 → m2 =0
m1=0 → m2=-1
m1=1 → m2= -2 → invalid.

So only two terms contribute. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |1,-1> |1,0> and |1,0> |1,-1>.

Wait, but how exactly do they combine? The coefficients are determined by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. But maybe I don't need the exact coefficients for this problem.

Wait the question is about the probability of measuring L1z = -ℏ and L2z = -ℏ. So each electron's m is their eigenvalue for Lz. So we're measuring m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

But wait, in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, what is the expansion in terms of the product states |m1, m2>? Because the state is a linear combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

So in the expansion, the only product states are |1, -2> (invalid because m2 can't be -2), |0, -1>, |-1, 0>.

But wait, for l1=1, m1 can be -1,0,1. For l2=1, same. So possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1 are:

m1=-1, m2=0 → sum = -1.

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum = -1.

m1=1, m2=-2 → invalid.

So only two product states contribute to the coupled state |2, -1>.

Wait, but the coupled state is |l=2, m=-1>, which is a combination of these two product states. So the state can be written as a linear combination α|1,-1> |1,0> + β|1,0> |1,-1>.

But for the specific coefficients α and β, I might not need their exact values. However, the question is about the probability of measuring both m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Wait, but in the expansion of the coupled state, are there any terms where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1? Let's think: m1 + m2 = -2 in that case, which would correspond to m_total = -2. But our coupled state has m_total = -1. So that's not part of the expansion for |2, -1>. Therefore, the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is not present in the expansion of |2, -1>.

So if the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, then the coefficients for other product states (like m1=-1, m2=-1) are zero.

Therefore, when measuring L1z and L2z, the possible outcomes are (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) and (0, -1). There's no term where both m1 and m2 are -1. So the probability is zero.

Wait, but wait another thought. The coupled state is |l=2, m=-1>. But what about when you measure the individual m1 and m2? The state is a linear combination of |m1, m2> states. So when you make a measurement of L1z and L2z, you're projecting the state onto a product state |m1, m2>.

If the state is a combination of |m1, m2> states, each with their own coefficients, the probability of a particular outcome is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient of that product state.

In this case, the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. So for each of these, the coefficients are non-zero.

But the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is not part of this combination. So its coefficient is zero. Therefore, the probability is zero.

So the answer should be D) 0.

The problem involves two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states, with the coupled angular momentum state given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = l_2 = 1$ (since they are in p orbitals), $l = 2$ (total angular momentum quantum number), and $m = -1$ (the Z component of the total angular momentum). The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$.

When coupling two angular momenta, the total state $|l, m>$ is a linear combination of product states $|m_1, m_2>$, where $m_1 + m_2 = m$. For the given coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$, the possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs that satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ are:

1. $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$
2. $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$

The pair $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ is invalid because $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which does not match the total $m = -1$. Therefore, the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ does not include the product state $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1>$.

When measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, the possible outcomes correspond to the $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs in the expansion of the coupled state. Since the product state $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1>$ is not part of the coupled state, its coefficient is zero. Thus, the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is zero.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question involves two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're supposed to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has l=1 because it's a p orbital. The total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1.

The question asks for the joint probability of measuring both electrons' Lz components and getting -ℏ each. So we need to find the probability that L1z = -ℏ and L2z = -ℏ.

Hmm, let me think about angular momentum coupling. When you couple two angular momenta, you can express the total state as a combination of product states. Each product state is |l1, m1> |l2, m2>, and the total state is a linear combination of these.

The coupled state here is |1,1,2,-1>. I remember that states with total l and m are formed by combining all possible combinations of m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = m_total.

In this case, the total m is -1. So each product state contributing to |1,1,2,-1> must have m1 + m2 = -1.

Electron 1 has l1=1, so m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Similarly for electron 2. But when we combine them, the total m is -1. So we need all pairs (m1, m2) where m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible pairs are (m1, m2) = (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -2), but wait, wait. Wait, l2 is 1, so m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, m2 can be -1, 0, +1 only. So the possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Because 1 + (-2) is impossible since m2 can't be -2.

Wait, no, let me think again. For the coupled state |l=2, m=-1>, the possible m1 and m2 combinations are such that m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

(-1, 0) → sum is -1.

(0, -1) → sum is -1.

But what about (1, -2)? No, because m2 can't be -2 for l2=1. So only two possible product states contribute.

Wait, but wait. The total state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m1=1, m2=-2> → but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2=1. So that's not possible. So only the two possibilities I mentioned before are valid.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the general expansion of |l, m> states. The |l=2, m= -1> state is formed by a linear combination of |l1=1, m1> |l2=1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

The possible m1 and m2 are:
m1 = -1 → m2 =0
m1=0 → m2=-1
m1=1 → m2= -2 → invalid.

So only two terms contribute. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |1,-1> |1,0> and |1,0> |1,-1>.

Wait, but how exactly do they combine? The coefficients are determined by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. But maybe I don't need the exact coefficients for this problem.

Wait the question is about the probability of measuring L1z = -ℏ and L2z = -ℏ. So each electron's m is their eigenvalue for Lz. So we're measuring m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

But wait, in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, what is the expansion in terms of the product states |m1, m2>? Because the state is a linear combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

So in the expansion, the only product states are |1, -2> (invalid because m2 can't be -2), |0, -1>, |-1, 0>.

But wait, for l1=1, m1 can be -1,0,1. For l2=1, same. So possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1 are:

m1=-1, m2=0 → sum = -1.

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum = -1.

m1=1, m2=-2 → invalid.

So only two product states contribute to the coupled state |2, -1>.

Wait, but the coupled state is |l=2, m=-1>, which is a combination of these two product states. So the state can be written as a linear combination α|1,-1> |1,0> + β|1,0> |1,-1>.

But for the specific coefficients α and β, I might not need their exact values. However, the question is about the probability of measuring both m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Wait, but in the expansion of the coupled state, are there any terms where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1? Let's think: m1 + m2 = -2 in that case, which would correspond to m_total = -2. But our coupled state has m_total = -1. So that's not part of the expansion for |2, -1>. Therefore, the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is not present in the expansion of |2, -1>.

So if the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, then the coefficients for other product states (like m1=-1, m2=-1) are zero.

Therefore, when measuring L1z and L2z, the possible outcomes are (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) and (0, -1). There's no term where both m1 and m2 are -1. So the probability is zero.

Wait, but wait another thought. The coupled state is |l=2, m=-1>. But what about when you measure the individual m1 and m2? The state is a linear combination of |m1, m2> states. So when you make a measurement of L1z and L2z, you're projecting the state onto a product state |m1, m2>.

If the state is a combination of |m1, m2> states, each with their own coefficients, the probability of a particular outcome is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient of that product state.

In this case, the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. So for each of these, the coefficients are non-zero.

But the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is not part of this combination. So its coefficient is zero. Therefore, the probability is zero.

So the answer should be D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states, with the coupled angular momentum state given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = l_2 = 1$ (since they are in p orbitals), $l = 2$ (total angular momentum quantum number), and $m = -1$ (the Z component of the total angular momentum). The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$.

When coupling two angular momenta, the total state $|l, m>$ is a linear combination of product states $|m_1, m_2>$, where $m_1 + m_2 = m$. For the given coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$, the possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs that satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ are:

1. $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$
2. $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$

The pair $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ is invalid because $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which does not match the total $m = -1$. Therefore, the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ does not include the product state $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1>$.

When measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, the possible outcomes correspond to the $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs in the expansion of the coupled state. Since the product state $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1>$ is not part of the coupled state, its coefficient is zero. Thus, the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is zero.
