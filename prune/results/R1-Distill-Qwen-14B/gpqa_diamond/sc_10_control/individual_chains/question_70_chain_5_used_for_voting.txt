Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the reactions and what each substance might be.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, I'm thinking about what reacts in such a way. 8 equivalents suggest maybe a ratio of 1:8 in the reaction. Like, for every mole of A, 8 moles of B are used. Bright red product—could that be something like sulfur? Or maybe a transition metal complex. Wait, another thought: when metals react with something to form colored products, maybe it's a metal sulfide or oxide.

Wait, another angle: when something reacts with excess gas, maybe B is a diatomic gas like O2 or Cl2. Let's think, for example, if B is O2. But then 8 equivalents of O2 reacting with A. What solid reacts with O2 to form a red product? Iron maybe? Iron(III) oxide is reddish, I think. But iron usually reacts in a 4:3 ratio with O2 for Fe3O4, but the question says 8 equivalents, which is higher. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe B is chlorine gas. 8 equivalents of Cl2 reacting with A. What solid reacts with a lot of Cl2? Perhaps a metal like aluminum, but that doesn't form a red product. Wait, maybe a transition metal. Another thought: maybe A is a metal and B is sulfur vapor. Or, maybe A is a metal that forms a sulfide when reacted with sulfur.

Wait, looking at the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E is produced from C and D. So C is a product from A and B, and then C reacts with D. Hmm, perhaps C is a metal sulfide, and D is something like H2O or another gas? Or maybe C is a metal oxide.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C reacts with water, it produces two acids. That makes me think that C is a metal sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, reacting with water would produce H2S (which is a weak acid) and maybe another acid. Wait, but FeS plus water would just produce Fe^2+ and HS^- or something. Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal nitride? Like Mg3N2. When it reacts with water, it produces NH3 (which is a weak base, but maybe in this case, it's acting as a weak acid? Not sure.) Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbide, but that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a metal oxide. If C is Na2O, then reacting with water would give NaOH (strong base, but the problem says acids F and G. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. Alternatively, maybe C is something else.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction. 8 equivalents of B with A to form C. Maybe A is Fe metal and B is Cl2. 8 Cl2 would probably form FeCl4, but iron typically forms FeCl2 or FeCl3. Wait, maybe it's something else. Or perhaps A is something that reacts with 8 moles of B per mole of A. Let's think about a reaction where that ratio makes sense.

Another angle: The second reaction is C reacting with D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is something like phosgene or another toxic gas. What's D? D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D + B → H, a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, maybe something like DMSO? Wait, if B is a gas, maybe it's a diatomic gas.

Wait, another thought: D could be carbon monoxide (CO), and B is something like Cl2. CO + Cl2 might not form a solvent. Or perhaps B is O2. Let's think: D + B → H, a solvent. If H is water, then D + O2 → H2O. But that would require D to be H2. But H2 is a gas. Alternatively, if H is something like ethanol (but that would require D and B to form ethanol, which I'm not sure about). Alternatively, perhaps H is something like methanol. Wait, but D and B reacting in 1:1 to make a solvent—maybe D is CO and B is something else.

Wait, perhaps B is O2. Let's say B is O2. Then D could be something that when reacts with O2 in 1:1 ratio gives a solvent. For example, D could be CH3CH2OH (ethanol). But then, O2 plus ethanol wouldn't make a solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is CH3OH, but that's a solvent itself. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another reaction: If H is a common solvent like water. Then D + B → H2O. So B would be O2, and D would be H2. Then D is H2. But in the first reaction, A reacts with 8 equivalents of B (O2) to form C. So A is a metal that reacts with O2 to form a metal oxide. For example, Fe reacting with O2 in a high ratio? But iron typically forms FeO, Fe3O4, or Fe2O3.

Wait, the reaction between A (solid) and 8 equivalents of B (O2) gives C. So stoichiometry-wise, maybe it's a reaction like 2A + 8B → 2C + ...? But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possible products when C reacts with water. It produces A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, for example, if C is a sulfide, reacting with water would produce the corresponding acid. But if C is a sulfide like FeS, reacting with water might give H2S (weak acid) and Fe(OH)2. But that doesn't fit because F is a strong acid. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitride. For example, Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Another possibility: Maybe C is a metal carbide, like SiC. Reacting with water would produce CO2 (weak acid, maybe) and a strong base like NaOH if A is sodium. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is Na2O, then reacting with water would give NaOH. But that's a base, not an acid. Hmm, maybe C is a different kind of oxide.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite? Let's think, if C is Na2SO3, then reaction with water might not do much. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfate. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the products F and G. F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. The only strong acid among the common ones is HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, HClO4, etc. The weak acids would be like acetic acid, H3PO4 (which is weak compared to strong acids), or H2S perhaps.

So when C reacts with water, it produces A (the original solid) plus F and G. So, perhaps the reaction is something like C + H2O → A + F + G.

Looking for a compound that when reacted with water gives two acids. Maybe a sulfide: if C is a sulfide, like FeS, then FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. But Fe(OH)2 is a base, and H2S is a weak acid. But in this case, F is a strong acid, so perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Wait, another thought: What if C is a nitride? Like Mg3N2. Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, if C is a carbide, like CaC2. CaC2 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 + C2H2 (which is acetylene, not an acid). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed oxide. For example, if C is Na2O2 (sodium peroxide). Then, Na2O2 + H2O → 2NaOH + O2↑. But that gives a base and O2, not acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something like CaO (quicklime). CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2. Again, a base.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the reactions again.

Looking at the first reaction: solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → bright red C.

What's a reaction where a solid reacts with 8 moles of a gas to form a red product? Maybe a metal reacting with chlorine gas. For example, aluminum and Cl2: 2Al + 3Cl2 → 2AlCl3. That's a 3:2 ratio, not 8 equivalents. Maybe another metal.

Wait, what if A is sulfur and B is O2? Sulfur burning in O2 gives SO2 or SO3. But that's not red; SO3 is colorless.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps A is copper metal, and B is Cl2. Copper reacts with Cl2 to form CuCl2. But CuCl2 is blue, not red.

Alternatively, maybe A is iron and B is Cl2. Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3, which is yellowish, not red.

Wait, perhaps the product is iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3·nH2O, which is reddish. But the reaction of iron with O2 usually forms FeO or Fe3O4 depending on conditions, not Fe2O3 in the presence of excess O2. Let's see, Fe + O2 → Fe3O4 (which is black), not red. Hmm.

Wait, another product that's bright red could be mercury(II) oxide, HgO, which is red. But mercury isn't a common solid in such reactions. Not sure.

Alternatively, could C be a sulfide? Sulfur is bright yellow, so perhaps not. Wait, when metals react with sulfur, they form sulfides. For example, FeS is black, not red.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps C is a transition metal complex. For example, a chromium complex. Chromium(III) oxide is green, though. Alternatively, maybe it's a nickel compound.

Alternatively, maybe the product isn't a metal compound but something else. For instance, when a metal reacts under certain conditions with a lot of Cl2, forming a higher chloro compound. For example, 2Al + 8Cl2 → 2AlCl4? But I'm not sure about that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a sulfide when reacted with sulfur (B is S8). So, A is Fe, B is S. Fe + S → FeS, which is black. Not red.

Alternatively, maybe B is another diatomic gas, like F2. Then A could be metal reacting with F2 to form MF2 or MF3, but I'm not sure about the colors.

Wait, maybe I should think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E could be something like hydrogen fluoride gas (but that's produced from acids), or maybe something like phosgene (but I don't think C would be a metal oxide in that case).

Alternatively, E could be a highly toxic gas like Cl2, but that's B. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is something like COCl2 (phosgene), but how would that form from C and D? Maybe D is CO and C is something chlorinating.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloride and D is something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, E could be a cyanide compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the last part: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So H is a solvent made from D and B. Common solvents made from reactions of gases—maybe H is H2O? Because B could be O2 and D is H2. Then O2 + H2 → H2O (with a catalyst). So D is H2, B is O2. That makes sense because H2 and O2 can react to form H2O (but that's under specific conditions, like combustion).

If that's the case, then D is H2. So D is hydrogen gas. Then, in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of H2 to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Wait, what reaction would that be? C plus H2 produces E. If C is a metal oxide, maybe it's a reduction reaction. But E is extremely hazardous. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrile oxide or something else.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonyl compound. For example, if C is COCl2 (phosgene), but I'm not sure how that would react with H2.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. Let me think: if C is a sulfide like FeS, reacting with H2 might not do much. Or maybe it's a reaction where H2 acts as a reducing agent.

Wait, another angle: C is a metal oxide. Let's say C is Fe3O4. Then, reacting with H2 (D) could be a reduction reaction. Fe3O4 + H2 → Fe and water. But that would form Fe and H2O, but E is extremely hazardous. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a diatomic molecule. No, but C is a product of A and B, which are a solid and gas.

Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, if C is H2O2, but then reacting with H2 wouldn't do much. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride. So, C is FeCl3. Then, reacting with H2 would be FeCl3 + H2 → FeCl2 + HCl. But E would be HCl, which is a gas but not extremely hazardous in small amounts. But the question says E is extremely hazardous, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe C is a thiocyanate or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if D is H2 and B is O2, then H is H2O. So, in the first reaction, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C. What's a reaction where a solid (A) reacts with O2 in 8:1 ratio? Maybe it's the formation of Fe3O4? Let me check the stoichiometry.

Fe + O2 → Fe3O4. The reaction is 3 Fe + 2 O2 → Fe3O4. So, it's a 3:2 ratio. But the problem states 8 equivalents of B (O2) per A. Hmm, not matching.

Another reaction: Perhaps A is magnesium, and B is O2. Mg burns in O2 to form MgO. The reaction is 2 Mg + O2 → 2 MgO. So, 1:1 ratio. Not 8:1.

Wait, maybe A is a metal that forms a higher oxide when reacted with excess O2. For example, some metals form different oxides based on the amount of O2. But I'm not sure which metal would react in an 8:1 ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a compound that reacts with O2 to form a compound with a high O content.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal and B is Cl2. Let's say 8 Cl2 reacts with one mole of A. So, for example, Al + Cl2 → AlCl3. The stoichiometry is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. That's a 3:2 ratio, not 8:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is a non-metal. For example, sulfur? But sulfur reacting with Cl2? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a higher chloro compound. For example, if A is Mn, perhaps it forms MnCl4 or something. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the third reaction again. C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, C is something that when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid and a weak acid.

One possibility is that C is a sulfite, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. Wait, if C is Mg3N2, then Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not acid, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Another possibility: What if C is a carbonate? Like Na2CO3. Then, Na2CO3 + H2O → 2NaOH + CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid), and NaOH is a strong base. But the problem states F and G are acids, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, could C be a sulfide? Let's say C is FeS. Then, FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. Fe(OH)2 is a base, and H2S is a weak acid. But F is a strong acid, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a halide. For example, CaF2 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 and HF. HF is a weak acid, but Ca(OH)2 is a base. So F would be HF (weak acid), but the problem says F is a strong acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a metal hydroxide. No, because when you add water to a hydroxide, you just get more hydroxide.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2 reacts with H2O to form NaOH and O2. O2 is a gas, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbide. For example, SiC reacts with H2O to produce CH4 and a metal hydroxide. CH4 is a neutral gas, not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride oxide or something else, but I'm not finding a match.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonamide or something else, but that's probably too complicated.

Wait, another angle: If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, then perhaps the reaction is something like C + H2O → A + HCl (strong acid) + H2S (weak acid). So C would be a chloride sulfide, like CuS or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chloride and a sulfide combination, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed oxide. For example, if A is Fe and B is O2, forming FeO (which is black, not red). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe another chromium compound is red. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the possible E's molecular symmetry.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

But E is extremely hazardous. So E is likely a highly toxic gas. Common ones include Cl2 (D∞h symmetry), CO (D∞h), SO2 (C2v), NO2 (C2v), phosgene (D∞h), etc.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures:

Cl2: Diatomic, D∞h symmetry.

CO: Diatomic, D∞h.

SO2: V-shaped, has a C2v symmetry.

NO2: V-shaped, C2v.

Phosgene (COCl2): has a planar structure with a C2v symmetry.

Wait, if E is SO2, its symmetry group is C2v.

If E is Cl2, symmetry is D∞h.

So, perhaps E is SO2 or Cl2. But let's see.

If E is SO2, then what would C and D be?

In the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E (SO2).

If E is SO2, D would be something that when reacted with C gives SO2.

Wait, D is a gas that reacts with B (O2?) in a 1:1 ratio to form H (a solvent). If H is H2O, then D is H2.

So, D is H2, B is O2.

Then, in the second reaction: C + 2 H2 → SO2.

But what would C be? If C is SO3, but SO3 plus H2 would produce SO2 and H2O. So, reaction could be: 2 SO3 + 2 H2 → 2 SO2 + 2 H2O. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

But wait, earlier in the first reaction, A (solid) reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C. If C is SO3, then A could be S. S + O2 → SO3? But the reaction of S with O2 is 2S + 3O2 → 2SO3. That's a 3:2 ratio. Not 8:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is something else. Let's see, if C is SO2, then the first reaction would be A + 8 B → C (SO2). So, A is S, B is O2. The reaction would be 2 S + 3 O2 → 2 SO3. No, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe C is SO3. Then, the first reaction would be A + 8 B → SO3. Let's say B is O2. Then, the reaction might be 4Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3, but that's 3:4 ratio. Not 8:1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try different approach.

Looking at the options for E's symmetry group, the choices are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If the correct E is something like O2 (D∞h) or O3 (C2v), but O3 isn't a product of the given reactions.

Wait, earlier I thought E could be SO2. SO2 has a bent structure with a bond angle around 120 degrees. Its point group is C2v because it has a two-fold axis perpendicular to the molecule and a mirror plane.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2, which is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry.

Another possibility: E is O3, but O3 has C2v symmetry.

Wait, but how does that relate to the reactions?

In the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E. If D is H2 and E is H2O, but E is extremely hazardous—H2O isn't. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps E is a different compound, like phosgene (COCl2), which has a planar structure with a central carbon, so its symmetry is D∞h? Or C2v?

Phosgene has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So, it has a planar structure with a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane (along the C-O bond?), and mirror planes. So, its point group is D∞h? No, wait, D∞h would require an infinite number of symmetry planes, which isn't the case. Wait, no, D∞h is for linear molecules like O2, CO, etc. Phosgene is a planar molecule but not linear, so its point group is D2h or maybe C2v. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe E is HCl gas, but HCl is diatomic, so D∞h symmetry.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the possible E's based on the reactions.

If E is Cl2, then D is H2, which reacts with B (O2) to form H2O. So, in the second reaction, C reacts with H2 to produce Cl2. How would that happen? That would require C to be a chloride that upon reaction with H2 produces HCl and Cl2. Maybe like the decomposition of HClO (which is a strong acid), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate or some other compound.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is A (a metal) reacting with Cl2 gas to form a metal chloride. For example, 2Al + 3Cl2 → 2AlCl3. But that's a 3:2 ratio, not 8:1.

Hmm, maybe the first reaction is something else. Let's think about the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, when C reacts with water, it produces solid A, a strong acid, and a weak acid. So perhaps C is a salt that upon hydrolysis releases these acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitro compound. For example, if C is sodium nitrate (NaNO3), then reacting with water wouldn't produce acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonate ester, but that seems too complex.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a metal bisulfide. For example, CuS. Reacting with water might not do much. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal hydride. For example, NaH. Reacting with water produces NaOH and H2. But that's a base and a gas, not acids.

Wait, if F and G are acids, perhaps C is a carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). Then, Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid), and NaOH is a base. But the problem states F and G are acids, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a sulfonic acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that when reacted with water produces a strong acid and another acid. Wait, that doesn't make sense because metal oxides usually produce bases when reacted with water.

Wait, maybe I should consider that C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is KCN, then KCN + H2O → K(OH)CN + HCN. HCN is a weak acid, but the other product is a hydroxide, which would be a base. So F would be HCN (weak acid) and G would be a base, which doesn't match.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible E again.

If E is SO2, then its point group is C2v. If E is Cl2, then D∞h.

The options given are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Now, if E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)Cl), its structure is planar with a central carbon, so the point group is D2h or C2v. Wait, phosgene has a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane (since the two Cl atoms are symmetric), and mirror planes. So the point group would be D∞h? No, because D∞h requires a linear molecule with an infinite number of symmetry planes. Phosgene is planar but not linear, so its point group is D2h.

But the options don't include D2h, so perhaps E is something else.

Alternatively, if E is something like O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure with a central O atom, its point group is C2v. Ozone has a V shape, with a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and two mirror planes, leading to a C2v symmetry.

So if E is O3, then the symmetry group is C2v. But would O3 fit into the reaction?

Let me think. If E is O3, then in the second reaction, C reacts with D (which is H2) to produce O3? But I don't see how that would happen. Alternatively, perhaps E is O3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: What is the product E? It's produced by C and D in a 2:1 ratio. If C is a peroxide, like H2O2, and D is something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is NO2, which is a brown gas. NO2 has a bent structure, so its point group is C2v.

So, if E is NO2, then the symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

But does that fit with the reactions?

Let me try to think of the reactions leading to E as NO2.

So, D is H2 (since D + B → H2O, which is a solvent). So, D is H2, B is O2.

In the second reaction, C + 2 H2 → NO2.

What would C be? Perhaps C is nitric oxide (NO). But NO reacting with H2 would produce N2 and H2O, not NO2.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something else that when reacted with H2 produces NO2. Maybe C is a nitrate or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitride, and reacting with H2 produces NH3 and water. But that doesn't lead to NO2.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the first reaction again.

If B is O2, D is H2, and H is H2O. Then, the first reaction is A + 8 O2 → C.

What's a reaction where a solid reacts with 8 equivalents of O2? Maybe a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, maybe A is vanadium metal. Vanadium can form V2O5, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Another thought: Maybe A is a metal that forms a superoxide. For example, K reacts with O2 to form KO2. The reaction is 2K + O2 → 2KO2. That's a 1:1 ratio, but the problem says 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that reacts with O2 in a high ratio, like 8:1. I'm not sure of any such reaction.

Wait, maybe the product C is FeO4^2- or something with higher oxygen content. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a non-metal. Let's say A is sulfur. S + O2 → SO2 or SO3. But the ratios don't fit 8 equivalents.

Wait, another angle: The reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of B produces a bright red C. What if B is Cl2 and A is a metal that forms a high chloro compound?

For example, A is Fe, and B is Cl2. 8 moles of Cl2 reacting with 1 mole of Fe would give FeCl4? But I don't think FeCl4 is stable; Fe typically forms FeCl2 and FeCl3. The reaction is Fe + 2Cl2 → FeCl3 (in Cl2 gas), which is a 2:1 ratio. Not 8:1.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a chlorate. For example, Na reacts with Cl2 to form NaCl. But that's a 1:1 ratio.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the possible E's symmetry again.

The options are:

A) C2

B) D4h

C) D∞h

D) C2v

If E is Cl2, symmetry is D∞h (option C). If E is O3, symmetry is C2v (option D). If E is SO2, symmetry is C2v (option D). If E is NO2, symmetry is C2v.

So, options D and C are possibilities.

But I need to figure out what E is.

Wait, in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E. D is H2 (since D + B → H2O, where B is O2).

So, C + 2 H2 → E.

If E is H2O, but that's not extremely hazardous. So perhaps E is O3, which is a toxic gas.

So, C + 2 H2 → O3.

But how would that happen? Ozone is formed from O2 and UV light, not H2.

Alternatively, perhaps C is O2, and D is H2. O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. But that's not E being O3.

Wait, perhaps C is O3 itself. But that doesn't make sense because C is a product of A and B.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of E as HCl gas, which is diatomic (D∞h symmetry). How would that form?

If E is HCl, then in the second reaction, C + 2 H2 → 2 HCl. But how would that happen? Perhaps C is a chloride that when reacted with H2 produces HCl. For example, if C is CH3Cl (methyl chloride), but that's not likely.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chloro compound that upon reaction with H2 produces HCl and something else. Not sure.

Wait, another idea: Maybe E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)Cl), which has a planar structure with a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane and mirror planes, giving C2v symmetry. So, the symmetry group would be C2v (option D).

But how would C react with H2 to produce phosgene? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something else entirely.

Wait, maybe E is a dimer like Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry (option C). So, if E is Cl2, then the symmetry group is D∞h.

But how would that form? In the second reaction, C + 2 H2 → Cl2. That doesn't seem likely.

Alternatively, perhaps C is ClO2, which is a highly toxic gas. ClO2 has a bent structure, so its point group is C2v.

So, if E is ClO2, then its symmetry is C2v.

But how would that form from C and H2? Not sure.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to summarize what I know:

- C reacts with H2O to produce A (original solid), a strong acid F, and a weak acid G.

- D is H2 because D + O2 → H2O.

- B is O2 because D + B → H2O.

So, in the first reaction: A reacts with 8 O2 to form C.

If A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide, perhaps C is a metal oxide that upon hydrolysis gives strong and weak acids.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a peroxide when reacted with excess O2. For example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2). So, the reaction would be 2 Na + O2 → 2 NaO2? Wait, sodium peroxide forms when Na reacts with O2 in a high concentration. The reaction is 2 Na + O2 → Na2O2. That's a 1:1 ratio, but the problem states 8 equivalents. Hmm.

But if A is Na, and 8 O2 react, then perhaps the product is NaO2 (sodium peroxide). When Na2O2 reacts with water, it produces NaOH and O2. So, 2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑. But in the problem, the product is A (Na), F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So that doesn't fit because NaOH is a base, not an acid.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, another thought: If C is a sulfide, then when it reacts with water, it produces H2S (weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide, which is a base. But the problem says F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride, and when it reacts with water, it produces NH3 (weak base) and a metal hydroxide. But that's not producing acids.

I'm stuck on this. Let me think about the possible E again. If E is Cl2, symmetry is D∞h (option C). If E is something like HCN, but that's linear, so D∞h. But HCN isn't extremely hazardous in the same way as others.

Wait, another possibility: E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)Cl), which has a planar structure with a C2 axis. So, its point group is D2h, but since that's not an option, perhaps it's C2v.

Alternatively, maybe E is O3 (ozone), which has a C2v symmetry. Ozone is a toxic gas, so that fits.

So, if E is O3, then the symmetry group is C2v (option D).

But then, how does that fit into the reactions?

In the second reaction, C reacts with 2 H2 → O3. That doesn't make much sense. Ozone is formed from O2 and UV light, not from H2.

Wait, maybe C is O2, and D is H2. Then, O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. But that doesn't produce O3.

Hmm.

I think I'm not going to figure this out easily, but based on the options, the most likely E is either Cl2 (D∞h) or SO2 (C2v). 

Cl2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, which is option C. SO2 is bent with C2v symmetry, option D.

Given that E is extremely hazardous, Cl2 is a strong candidate. So, the symmetry group would be D∞h, option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - The bright red color suggests C could be a transition metal compound or a sulfide. However, no definitive identification of A or B is made from this reaction alone.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product.  
   - E is highly toxic, narrowing possibilities to gases like Cl₂, SO₂, NO₂, or phosgene. These gases have distinct molecular symmetries.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A, producing two acids: F (strong acid) and G (weak acid).  
   - This suggests C could be a sulfide, nitride, or other compound that hydrolyzes to yield acids. However, the exact identity of C remains unclear.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.  
   - If H is water, D is likely H₂ and B is O₂, as H₂ and O₂ can react to form H₂O under specific conditions.

5. **Symmetry Analysis of E**:  
   - If E is Cl₂, it is a diatomic molecule with **D∞h** symmetry.  
   - If E is SO₂ or NO₂, both are bent molecules with **C2v** symmetry.  
   - Phosgene (COCl₂) is planar but not linear, with **C2v** symmetry.  
   - Ozone (O₃) is a bent molecule with **C2v** symmetry.

6. **Conclusion**:  
   - Given the options and the properties of E, Cl₂ (D∞h symmetry) and SO₂/NO₂ (C2v symmetry) are the most plausible candidates. Since Cl₂ is a highly hazardous gas and matches the description of E, its symmetry group **D∞h** is the most likely answer.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the reactions and what each substance might be.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, I'm thinking about what reacts in such a way. 8 equivalents suggest maybe a ratio of 1:8 in the reaction. Like, for every mole of A, 8 moles of B are used. Bright red product—could that be something like sulfur? Or maybe a transition metal complex. Wait, another thought: when metals react with something to form colored products, maybe it's a metal sulfide or oxide.

Wait, another angle: when something reacts with excess gas, maybe B is a diatomic gas like O2 or Cl2. Let's think, for example, if B is O2. But then 8 equivalents of O2 reacting with A. What solid reacts with O2 to form a red product? Iron maybe? Iron(III) oxide is reddish, I think. But iron usually reacts in a 4:3 ratio with O2 for Fe3O4, but the question says 8 equivalents, which is higher. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe B is chlorine gas. 8 equivalents of Cl2 reacting with A. What solid reacts with a lot of Cl2? Perhaps a metal like aluminum, but that doesn't form a red product. Wait, maybe a transition metal. Another thought: maybe A is a metal and B is sulfur vapor. Or, maybe A is a metal that forms a sulfide when reacted with sulfur.

Wait, looking at the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E is produced from C and D. So C is a product from A and B, and then C reacts with D. Hmm, perhaps C is a metal sulfide, and D is something like H2O or another gas? Or maybe C is a metal oxide.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C reacts with water, it produces two acids. That makes me think that C is a metal sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, reacting with water would produce H2S (which is a weak acid) and maybe another acid. Wait, but FeS plus water would just produce Fe^2+ and HS^- or something. Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal nitride? Like Mg3N2. When it reacts with water, it produces NH3 (which is a weak base, but maybe in this case, it's acting as a weak acid? Not sure.) Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbide, but that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a metal oxide. If C is Na2O, then reacting with water would give NaOH (strong base, but the problem says acids F and G. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. Alternatively, maybe C is something else.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction. 8 equivalents of B with A to form C. Maybe A is Fe metal and B is Cl2. 8 Cl2 would probably form FeCl4, but iron typically forms FeCl2 or FeCl3. Wait, maybe it's something else. Or perhaps A is something that reacts with 8 moles of B per mole of A. Let's think about a reaction where that ratio makes sense.

Another angle: The second reaction is C reacting with D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is something like phosgene or another toxic gas. What's D? D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D + B → H, a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, maybe something like DMSO? Wait, if B is a gas, maybe it's a diatomic gas.

Wait, another thought: D could be carbon monoxide (CO), and B is something like Cl2. CO + Cl2 might not form a solvent. Or perhaps B is O2. Let's think: D + B → H, a solvent. If H is water, then D + O2 → H2O. But that would require D to be H2. But H2 is a gas. Alternatively, if H is something like ethanol (but that would require D and B to form ethanol, which I'm not sure about). Alternatively, perhaps H is something like methanol. Wait, but D and B reacting in 1:1 to make a solvent—maybe D is CO and B is something else.

Wait, perhaps B is O2. Let's say B is O2. Then D could be something that when reacts with O2 in 1:1 ratio gives a solvent. For example, D could be CH3CH2OH (ethanol). But then, O2 plus ethanol wouldn't make a solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is CH3OH, but that's a solvent itself. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another reaction: If H is a common solvent like water. Then D + B → H2O. So B would be O2, and D would be H2. Then D is H2. But in the first reaction, A reacts with 8 equivalents of B (O2) to form C. So A is a metal that reacts with O2 to form a metal oxide. For example, Fe reacting with O2 in a high ratio? But iron typically forms FeO, Fe3O4, or Fe2O3.

Wait, the reaction between A (solid) and 8 equivalents of B (O2) gives C. So stoichiometry-wise, maybe it's a reaction like 2A + 8B → 2C + ...? But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possible products when C reacts with water. It produces A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, for example, if C is a sulfide, reacting with water would produce the corresponding acid. But if C is a sulfide like FeS, reacting with water might give H2S (weak acid) and Fe(OH)2. But that doesn't fit because F is a strong acid. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitride. For example, Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Another possibility: Maybe C is a metal carbide, like SiC. Reacting with water would produce CO2 (weak acid, maybe) and a strong base like NaOH if A is sodium. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is Na2O, then reacting with water would give NaOH. But that's a base, not an acid. Hmm, maybe C is a different kind of oxide.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite? Let's think, if C is Na2SO3, then reaction with water might not do much. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfate. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the products F and G. F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. The only strong acid among the common ones is HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, HClO4, etc. The weak acids would be like acetic acid, H3PO4 (which is weak compared to strong acids), or H2S perhaps.

So when C reacts with water, it produces A (the original solid) plus F and G. So, perhaps the reaction is something like C + H2O → A + F + G.

Looking for a compound that when reacted with water gives two acids. Maybe a sulfide: if C is a sulfide, like FeS, then FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. But Fe(OH)2 is a base, and H2S is a weak acid. But in this case, F is a strong acid, so perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Wait, another thought: What if C is a nitride? Like Mg3N2. Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, if C is a carbide, like CaC2. CaC2 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 + C2H2 (which is acetylene, not an acid). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed oxide. For example, if C is Na2O2 (sodium peroxide). Then, Na2O2 + H2O → 2NaOH + O2↑. But that gives a base and O2, not acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something like CaO (quicklime). CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2. Again, a base.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the reactions again.

Looking at the first reaction: solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → bright red C.

What's a reaction where a solid reacts with 8 moles of a gas to form a red product? Maybe a metal reacting with chlorine gas. For example, aluminum and Cl2: 2Al + 3Cl2 → 2AlCl3. That's a 3:2 ratio, not 8 equivalents. Maybe another metal.

Wait, what if A is sulfur and B is O2? Sulfur burning in O2 gives SO2 or SO3. But that's not red; SO3 is colorless.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps A is copper metal, and B is Cl2. Copper reacts with Cl2 to form CuCl2. But CuCl2 is blue, not red.

Alternatively, maybe A is iron and B is Cl2. Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3, which is yellowish, not red.

Wait, perhaps the product is iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3·nH2O, which is reddish. But the reaction of iron with O2 usually forms FeO or Fe3O4 depending on conditions, not Fe2O3 in the presence of excess O2. Let's see, Fe + O2 → Fe3O4 (which is black), not red. Hmm.

Wait, another product that's bright red could be mercury(II) oxide, HgO, which is red. But mercury isn't a common solid in such reactions. Not sure.

Alternatively, could C be a sulfide? Sulfur is bright yellow, so perhaps not. Wait, when metals react with sulfur, they form sulfides. For example, FeS is black, not red.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps C is a transition metal complex. For example, a chromium complex. Chromium(III) oxide is green, though. Alternatively, maybe it's a nickel compound.

Alternatively, maybe the product isn't a metal compound but something else. For instance, when a metal reacts under certain conditions with a lot of Cl2, forming a higher chloro compound. For example, 2Al + 8Cl2 → 2AlCl4? But I'm not sure about that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a sulfide when reacted with sulfur (B is S8). So, A is Fe, B is S. Fe + S → FeS, which is black. Not red.

Alternatively, maybe B is another diatomic gas, like F2. Then A could be metal reacting with F2 to form MF2 or MF3, but I'm not sure about the colors.

Wait, maybe I should think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E could be something like hydrogen fluoride gas (but that's produced from acids), or maybe something like phosgene (but I don't think C would be a metal oxide in that case).

Alternatively, E could be a highly toxic gas like Cl2, but that's B. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is something like COCl2 (phosgene), but how would that form from C and D? Maybe D is CO and C is something chlorinating.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloride and D is something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, E could be a cyanide compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the last part: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So H is a solvent made from D and B. Common solvents made from reactions of gases—maybe H is H2O? Because B could be O2 and D is H2. Then O2 + H2 → H2O (with a catalyst). So D is H2, B is O2. That makes sense because H2 and O2 can react to form H2O (but that's under specific conditions, like combustion).

If that's the case, then D is H2. So D is hydrogen gas. Then, in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of H2 to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Wait, what reaction would that be? C plus H2 produces E. If C is a metal oxide, maybe it's a reduction reaction. But E is extremely hazardous. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrile oxide or something else.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonyl compound. For example, if C is COCl2 (phosgene), but I'm not sure how that would react with H2.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. Let me think: if C is a sulfide like FeS, reacting with H2 might not do much. Or maybe it's a reaction where H2 acts as a reducing agent.

Wait, another angle: C is a metal oxide. Let's say C is Fe3O4. Then, reacting with H2 (D) could be a reduction reaction. Fe3O4 + H2 → Fe and water. But that would form Fe and H2O, but E is extremely hazardous. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a diatomic molecule. No, but C is a product of A and B, which are a solid and gas.

Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, if C is H2O2, but then reacting with H2 wouldn't do much. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride. So, C is FeCl3. Then, reacting with H2 would be FeCl3 + H2 → FeCl2 + HCl. But E would be HCl, which is a gas but not extremely hazardous in small amounts. But the question says E is extremely hazardous, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe C is a thiocyanate or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if D is H2 and B is O2, then H is H2O. So, in the first reaction, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C. What's a reaction where a solid (A) reacts with O2 in 8:1 ratio? Maybe it's the formation of Fe3O4? Let me check the stoichiometry.

Fe + O2 → Fe3O4. The reaction is 3 Fe + 2 O2 → Fe3O4. So, it's a 3:2 ratio. But the problem states 8 equivalents of B (O2) per A. Hmm, not matching.

Another reaction: Perhaps A is magnesium, and B is O2. Mg burns in O2 to form MgO. The reaction is 2 Mg + O2 → 2 MgO. So, 1:1 ratio. Not 8:1.

Wait, maybe A is a metal that forms a higher oxide when reacted with excess O2. For example, some metals form different oxides based on the amount of O2. But I'm not sure which metal would react in an 8:1 ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a compound that reacts with O2 to form a compound with a high O content.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal and B is Cl2. Let's say 8 Cl2 reacts with one mole of A. So, for example, Al + Cl2 → AlCl3. The stoichiometry is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. That's a 3:2 ratio, not 8:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is a non-metal. For example, sulfur? But sulfur reacting with Cl2? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a higher chloro compound. For example, if A is Mn, perhaps it forms MnCl4 or something. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the third reaction again. C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, C is something that when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid and a weak acid.

One possibility is that C is a sulfite, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. Wait, if C is Mg3N2, then Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not acid, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Another possibility: What if C is a carbonate? Like Na2CO3. Then, Na2CO3 + H2O → 2NaOH + CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid), and NaOH is a strong base. But the problem states F and G are acids, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, could C be a sulfide? Let's say C is FeS. Then, FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. Fe(OH)2 is a base, and H2S is a weak acid. But F is a strong acid, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a halide. For example, CaF2 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 and HF. HF is a weak acid, but Ca(OH)2 is a base. So F would be HF (weak acid), but the problem says F is a strong acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a metal hydroxide. No, because when you add water to a hydroxide, you just get more hydroxide.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2 reacts with H2O to form NaOH and O2. O2 is a gas, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbide. For example, SiC reacts with H2O to produce CH4 and a metal hydroxide. CH4 is a neutral gas, not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride oxide or something else, but I'm not finding a match.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonamide or something else, but that's probably too complicated.

Wait, another angle: If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, then perhaps the reaction is something like C + H2O → A + HCl (strong acid) + H2S (weak acid). So C would be a chloride sulfide, like CuS or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chloride and a sulfide combination, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed oxide. For example, if A is Fe and B is O2, forming FeO (which is black, not red). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe another chromium compound is red. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the possible E's molecular symmetry.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

But E is extremely hazardous. So E is likely a highly toxic gas. Common ones include Cl2 (D∞h symmetry), CO (D∞h), SO2 (C2v), NO2 (C2v), phosgene (D∞h), etc.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures:

Cl2: Diatomic, D∞h symmetry.

CO: Diatomic, D∞h.

SO2: V-shaped, has a C2v symmetry.

NO2: V-shaped, C2v.

Phosgene (COCl2): has a planar structure with a C2v symmetry.

Wait, if E is SO2, its symmetry group is C2v.

If E is Cl2, symmetry is D∞h.

So, perhaps E is SO2 or Cl2. But let's see.

If E is SO2, then what would C and D be?

In the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E (SO2).

If E is SO2, D would be something that when reacted with C gives SO2.

Wait, D is a gas that reacts with B (O2?) in a 1:1 ratio to form H (a solvent). If H is H2O, then D is H2.

So, D is H2, B is O2.

Then, in the second reaction: C + 2 H2 → SO2.

But what would C be? If C is SO3, but SO3 plus H2 would produce SO2 and H2O. So, reaction could be: 2 SO3 + 2 H2 → 2 SO2 + 2 H2O. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

But wait, earlier in the first reaction, A (solid) reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C. If C is SO3, then A could be S. S + O2 → SO3? But the reaction of S with O2 is 2S + 3O2 → 2SO3. That's a 3:2 ratio. Not 8:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is something else. Let's see, if C is SO2, then the first reaction would be A + 8 B → C (SO2). So, A is S, B is O2. The reaction would be 2 S + 3 O2 → 2 SO3. No, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe C is SO3. Then, the first reaction would be A + 8 B → SO3. Let's say B is O2. Then, the reaction might be 4Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3, but that's 3:4 ratio. Not 8:1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try different approach.

Looking at the options for E's symmetry group, the choices are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If the correct E is something like O2 (D∞h) or O3 (C2v), but O3 isn't a product of the given reactions.

Wait, earlier I thought E could be SO2. SO2 has a bent structure with a bond angle around 120 degrees. Its point group is C2v because it has a two-fold axis perpendicular to the molecule and a mirror plane.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2, which is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry.

Another possibility: E is O3, but O3 has C2v symmetry.

Wait, but how does that relate to the reactions?

In the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E. If D is H2 and E is H2O, but E is extremely hazardous—H2O isn't. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps E is a different compound, like phosgene (COCl2), which has a planar structure with a central carbon, so its symmetry is D∞h? Or C2v?

Phosgene has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So, it has a planar structure with a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane (along the C-O bond?), and mirror planes. So, its point group is D∞h? No, wait, D∞h would require an infinite number of symmetry planes, which isn't the case. Wait, no, D∞h is for linear molecules like O2, CO, etc. Phosgene is a planar molecule but not linear, so its point group is D2h or maybe C2v. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe E is HCl gas, but HCl is diatomic, so D∞h symmetry.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the possible E's based on the reactions.

If E is Cl2, then D is H2, which reacts with B (O2) to form H2O. So, in the second reaction, C reacts with H2 to produce Cl2. How would that happen? That would require C to be a chloride that upon reaction with H2 produces HCl and Cl2. Maybe like the decomposition of HClO (which is a strong acid), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate or some other compound.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is A (a metal) reacting with Cl2 gas to form a metal chloride. For example, 2Al + 3Cl2 → 2AlCl3. But that's a 3:2 ratio, not 8:1.

Hmm, maybe the first reaction is something else. Let's think about the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, when C reacts with water, it produces solid A, a strong acid, and a weak acid. So perhaps C is a salt that upon hydrolysis releases these acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitro compound. For example, if C is sodium nitrate (NaNO3), then reacting with water wouldn't produce acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonate ester, but that seems too complex.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a metal bisulfide. For example, CuS. Reacting with water might not do much. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal hydride. For example, NaH. Reacting with water produces NaOH and H2. But that's a base and a gas, not acids.

Wait, if F and G are acids, perhaps C is a carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). Then, Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid), and NaOH is a base. But the problem states F and G are acids, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a sulfonic acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that when reacted with water produces a strong acid and another acid. Wait, that doesn't make sense because metal oxides usually produce bases when reacted with water.

Wait, maybe I should consider that C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is KCN, then KCN + H2O → K(OH)CN + HCN. HCN is a weak acid, but the other product is a hydroxide, which would be a base. So F would be HCN (weak acid) and G would be a base, which doesn't match.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible E again.

If E is SO2, then its point group is C2v. If E is Cl2, then D∞h.

The options given are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Now, if E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)Cl), its structure is planar with a central carbon, so the point group is D2h or C2v. Wait, phosgene has a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane (since the two Cl atoms are symmetric), and mirror planes. So the point group would be D∞h? No, because D∞h requires a linear molecule with an infinite number of symmetry planes. Phosgene is planar but not linear, so its point group is D2h.

But the options don't include D2h, so perhaps E is something else.

Alternatively, if E is something like O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure with a central O atom, its point group is C2v. Ozone has a V shape, with a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and two mirror planes, leading to a C2v symmetry.

So if E is O3, then the symmetry group is C2v. But would O3 fit into the reaction?

Let me think. If E is O3, then in the second reaction, C reacts with D (which is H2) to produce O3? But I don't see how that would happen. Alternatively, perhaps E is O3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: What is the product E? It's produced by C and D in a 2:1 ratio. If C is a peroxide, like H2O2, and D is something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is NO2, which is a brown gas. NO2 has a bent structure, so its point group is C2v.

So, if E is NO2, then the symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

But does that fit with the reactions?

Let me try to think of the reactions leading to E as NO2.

So, D is H2 (since D + B → H2O, which is a solvent). So, D is H2, B is O2.

In the second reaction, C + 2 H2 → NO2.

What would C be? Perhaps C is nitric oxide (NO). But NO reacting with H2 would produce N2 and H2O, not NO2.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something else that when reacted with H2 produces NO2. Maybe C is a nitrate or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitride, and reacting with H2 produces NH3 and water. But that doesn't lead to NO2.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the first reaction again.

If B is O2, D is H2, and H is H2O. Then, the first reaction is A + 8 O2 → C.

What's a reaction where a solid reacts with 8 equivalents of O2? Maybe a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, maybe A is vanadium metal. Vanadium can form V2O5, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Another thought: Maybe A is a metal that forms a superoxide. For example, K reacts with O2 to form KO2. The reaction is 2K + O2 → 2KO2. That's a 1:1 ratio, but the problem says 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that reacts with O2 in a high ratio, like 8:1. I'm not sure of any such reaction.

Wait, maybe the product C is FeO4^2- or something with higher oxygen content. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a non-metal. Let's say A is sulfur. S + O2 → SO2 or SO3. But the ratios don't fit 8 equivalents.

Wait, another angle: The reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of B produces a bright red C. What if B is Cl2 and A is a metal that forms a high chloro compound?

For example, A is Fe, and B is Cl2. 8 moles of Cl2 reacting with 1 mole of Fe would give FeCl4? But I don't think FeCl4 is stable; Fe typically forms FeCl2 and FeCl3. The reaction is Fe + 2Cl2 → FeCl3 (in Cl2 gas), which is a 2:1 ratio. Not 8:1.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a chlorate. For example, Na reacts with Cl2 to form NaCl. But that's a 1:1 ratio.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the possible E's symmetry again.

The options are:

A) C2

B) D4h

C) D∞h

D) C2v

If E is Cl2, symmetry is D∞h (option C). If E is O3, symmetry is C2v (option D). If E is SO2, symmetry is C2v (option D). If E is NO2, symmetry is C2v.

So, options D and C are possibilities.

But I need to figure out what E is.

Wait, in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E. D is H2 (since D + B → H2O, where B is O2).

So, C + 2 H2 → E.

If E is H2O, but that's not extremely hazardous. So perhaps E is O3, which is a toxic gas.

So, C + 2 H2 → O3.

But how would that happen? Ozone is formed from O2 and UV light, not H2.

Alternatively, perhaps C is O2, and D is H2. O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. But that's not E being O3.

Wait, perhaps C is O3 itself. But that doesn't make sense because C is a product of A and B.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of E as HCl gas, which is diatomic (D∞h symmetry). How would that form?

If E is HCl, then in the second reaction, C + 2 H2 → 2 HCl. But how would that happen? Perhaps C is a chloride that when reacted with H2 produces HCl. For example, if C is CH3Cl (methyl chloride), but that's not likely.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chloro compound that upon reaction with H2 produces HCl and something else. Not sure.

Wait, another idea: Maybe E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)Cl), which has a planar structure with a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane and mirror planes, giving C2v symmetry. So, the symmetry group would be C2v (option D).

But how would C react with H2 to produce phosgene? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something else entirely.

Wait, maybe E is a dimer like Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry (option C). So, if E is Cl2, then the symmetry group is D∞h.

But how would that form? In the second reaction, C + 2 H2 → Cl2. That doesn't seem likely.

Alternatively, perhaps C is ClO2, which is a highly toxic gas. ClO2 has a bent structure, so its point group is C2v.

So, if E is ClO2, then its symmetry is C2v.

But how would that form from C and H2? Not sure.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to summarize what I know:

- C reacts with H2O to produce A (original solid), a strong acid F, and a weak acid G.

- D is H2 because D + O2 → H2O.

- B is O2 because D + B → H2O.

So, in the first reaction: A reacts with 8 O2 to form C.

If A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide, perhaps C is a metal oxide that upon hydrolysis gives strong and weak acids.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a peroxide when reacted with excess O2. For example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2). So, the reaction would be 2 Na + O2 → 2 NaO2? Wait, sodium peroxide forms when Na reacts with O2 in a high concentration. The reaction is 2 Na + O2 → Na2O2. That's a 1:1 ratio, but the problem states 8 equivalents. Hmm.

But if A is Na, and 8 O2 react, then perhaps the product is NaO2 (sodium peroxide). When Na2O2 reacts with water, it produces NaOH and O2. So, 2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑. But in the problem, the product is A (Na), F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So that doesn't fit because NaOH is a base, not an acid.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, another thought: If C is a sulfide, then when it reacts with water, it produces H2S (weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide, which is a base. But the problem says F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride, and when it reacts with water, it produces NH3 (weak base) and a metal hydroxide. But that's not producing acids.

I'm stuck on this. Let me think about the possible E again. If E is Cl2, symmetry is D∞h (option C). If E is something like HCN, but that's linear, so D∞h. But HCN isn't extremely hazardous in the same way as others.

Wait, another possibility: E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)Cl), which has a planar structure with a C2 axis. So, its point group is D2h, but since that's not an option, perhaps it's C2v.

Alternatively, maybe E is O3 (ozone), which has a C2v symmetry. Ozone is a toxic gas, so that fits.

So, if E is O3, then the symmetry group is C2v (option D).

But then, how does that fit into the reactions?

In the second reaction, C reacts with 2 H2 → O3. That doesn't make much sense. Ozone is formed from O2 and UV light, not from H2.

Wait, maybe C is O2, and D is H2. Then, O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. But that doesn't produce O3.

Hmm.

I think I'm not going to figure this out easily, but based on the options, the most likely E is either Cl2 (D∞h) or SO2 (C2v). 

Cl2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, which is option C. SO2 is bent with C2v symmetry, option D.

Given that E is extremely hazardous, Cl2 is a strong candidate. So, the symmetry group would be D∞h, option C.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - The bright red color suggests C could be a transition metal compound or a sulfide. However, no definitive identification of A or B is made from this reaction alone.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product.  
   - E is highly toxic, narrowing possibilities to gases like Cl₂, SO₂, NO₂, or phosgene. These gases have distinct molecular symmetries.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A, producing two acids: F (strong acid) and G (weak acid).  
   - This suggests C could be a sulfide, nitride, or other compound that hydrolyzes to yield acids. However, the exact identity of C remains unclear.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.  
   - If H is water, D is likely H₂ and B is O₂, as H₂ and O₂ can react to form H₂O under specific conditions.

5. **Symmetry Analysis of E**:  
   - If E is Cl₂, it is a diatomic molecule with **D∞h** symmetry.  
   - If E is SO₂ or NO₂, both are bent molecules with **C2v** symmetry.  
   - Phosgene (COCl₂) is planar but not linear, with **C2v** symmetry.  
   - Ozone (O₃) is a bent molecule with **C2v** symmetry.

6. **Conclusion**:  
   - Given the options and the properties of E, Cl₂ (D∞h symmetry) and SO₂/NO₂ (C2v symmetry) are the most plausible candidates. Since Cl₂ is a highly hazardous gas and matches the description of E, its symmetry group **D∞h** is the most likely answer.

Answer: C
