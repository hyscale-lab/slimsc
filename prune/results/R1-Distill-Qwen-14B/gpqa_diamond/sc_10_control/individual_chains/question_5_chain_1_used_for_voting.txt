Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector for the operator P, but wait, what's P? Oh right, P is a vector operator, so the operator along direction n would be the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction unit vector n.

Oh, right, because for angular momentum operators, the operator along an arbitrary direction is given by P · n, where n is a unit vector. So n is in the x-z plane, which means it can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, since it's in x-z plane, φ is zero? Or wait, no. Wait, no, for a direction in the x-z plane, the angle φ is 0 or 180? Or maybe I'm mixing spherical coordinates. Let me think. The x-z plane implies that the direction vector has y-component zero. So n would be (sinθ cos0, 0, sinθ sin0) ? Wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then φ is 0 or π, but probably 0 for simplicity. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), wait, no, wait: No, wait, unit vectors. Let me think again. The unit vector in the x direction is (1,0,0), in z it's (0,0,1). So a general direction in x-z plane would have components (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x² + n_z² =1. So n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. That makes sense.

So the operator P along n would be P · n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because the direction is in x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero, so P_y doesn't contribute.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So what's the operator P? It's the dot product of the vector components with the direction vector n. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Each P component is given. Let me write them out.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, the operator along n is:

P = n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] 

Which simplifies to:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because when you add the matrices: the (1,1) element is n_z * (1) (from P_z) plus n_x * (1) (from P_x?), wait wait no, let's compute it step by step.

Wait, P_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by n_x (ħ/2), the matrix is [[0, n_x ħ/2],[n_x ħ/2, 0]].

Similarly, P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so multiplied by n_z (ħ/2) gives [[n_z ħ/2, 0],[0, -n_z ħ/2]].

Adding these together, the P operator is:

[[n_z ħ/2, n_x ħ/2],
 [n_x ħ/2, -n_z ħ/2 ] ]

So that's the matrix for P.

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So, the matrix equation is:

( P - (ħ/2) I ) |ψ> = 0 

Let me write the matrix P minus (ħ/2) times the identity matrix.

So, the matrix becomes:

[ [n_z ħ/2 - ħ/2, n_x ħ/2 ],
  [n_x ħ/2, -n_z ħ/2 - ħ/2 ] ]

Factor ħ/2 from each element:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z -1, n_x ],
           [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ]

So the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z-1, n_x],
          [n_x, -n_z-1] ] 

 multiplied by [a, b]^T equals zero vector.

Since (ħ/2) is a scalar, we can ignore it (as it's non-zero) and focus on the matrix:

[ [n_z -1, n_x ],
  [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ]

The determinant of this matrix must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

So determinant D is (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2 = 0.

Compute D:

D = (-n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1 ) - n_x^2 

Wait, wait. Let's compute (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = -n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1 = -n_z^2 +1.

So D = (-n_z^2 +1) - n_x^2 = 0.

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1 (because n is a unit vector), let's see:

(-n_z^2 +1) = 1 - n_z^2.

So D = (1 - n_z^2) - (1 - n_z^2) )? Wait, no, because n_x² is 1 - n_z^2.

Wait, because n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, so n_x^2=1 - n_z^2.

So D = (1 - n_z^2) - (1 - n_z^2 ) = 0.

Hmm, so the determinant is zero, which makes sense because we're looking for eigenvectors.

So, the eigen equation reduces to the first row, since the determinant is zero.

So, the equation from the first row is:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0.

So, (n_z -1) a = -n_x b.

Let me express a in terms of b.

a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] * b.

But it's better to represent the eigen vector in terms of a ratio. Let me set b=1 for simplicity, then a = -n_x/(n_z -1).

Wait, but let me double-check. The first equation is (n_z-1)a + n_x b =0.

So, (n_z -1) a = -n_x b.

So, a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Let me rearrange this:

a = [n_x / (1 - n_z) ] b.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [n_x, 1 - n_z ].

Wait, because if a = [n_x/(1-n_z)] b, then the vector is [n_x/(1-n_z), 1 ] multiplied by b.

But wait, I set b=1, so the vector is (n_x/(1-n_z), 1). But perhaps it's better to write it in terms of a parameter. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to parameterize the state.

Alternatively, I can write the eigenvector as a two-component vector [a, b]. So the eigenvector can be written as a multiple of [n_x, (1 - n_z)].

Wait, because from the equation, (n_z -1)a +n_x b=0 → (1 - n_z) a = n_x b → a = (n_x/(1-n_z)) b.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [n_x, 1-n_z].

Wait, but let me test with a specific case, like when the direction is along z (n_x=0, n_z=1). Then, the eigenvector should be [0, (1-1)] → [0,0], which can't be right. Oh, wait, that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no. If direction is along z, then n_x=0, n_z=1.

Then, the matrix P is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]].

The eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The eigenvectors are [1,0] for +ħ/2, and [0,1] for -ħ/2.

So, according to our earlier expression, when n_x=0 and n_z=1, the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 would be [0, 1-1]= [0,0], which is not correct. So something's wrong here.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the eigen equation approach.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider the eigen equation for the operator P.

Wait, the operator P is P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

Wait, but since n lies in the x-z plane, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), and is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² =1.

So, the operator P can be written as P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

The eigenvalue is ħ/2. So, P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

We can write |ψ> as a two-component spinor [a, b]^T.

So, let's write the matrix for P.

P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So, P |ψ> = (ħ/2) [ [n_z a + n_x b], [n_x a - n_z b] ].

This equals (ħ/2) [a, b]^T.

So, the equations are:

n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0.

n_x a -n_z b = b → n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0.

So, two equations:

1. (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0.

2. n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0.

These are two equations in two variables a and b.

Let me write them:

Equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0.

Equation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

We can solve this system. Let's assume that a and b are not both zero.

Let me write equation 1 as: a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b.

Substituting this into equation 2:

n_x [ (-n_x/(n_z -1)) b ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

Factor out b:

[ -n_x^2/(n_z-1) + (-n_z -1) ] b = 0.

Since b isn't necessarily zero, the term inside must be zero.

So,

-n_x^2/(n_z-1) - (n_z +1) ) =0.

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1) to eliminate denominator:

- n_x^2 - (n_z +1)(n_z -1) ) =0.

Which simplifies to:

- n_x^2 - (n_z^2 -1) )=0.

But n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, so n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2.

Substituting:

- (1 - n_z^2) - (n_z^2 -1 ) =0.

Wait,

- (1 - n_z^2) → -1 +n_z^2.

- (n_z^2 -1) → -n_z^2 +1.

Adding them together: (-1 + n_z^2) + (-n_z^2 +1 ) = 0.

So, it equals zero, which holds true. Therefore, the equations are consistent, and the eigenvector can be found.

So, going back to a in terms of b:

a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b.

But wait, when n_z approaches 1, the denominator approaches zero.

Wait, but when n_z =1, direction is along +z. Then, the operator P would be P_z, which has eigenstates [1,0] and [0,1]. So the eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to [1,0].

But according to our expression, when n_z=1, denominator is 0, which suggests that a approaches infinity unless n_x=0.

Wait, but when n_z=1, n_x=0, so the expression becomes a =0/(0) which is undefined. So that suggests that our approach may have an issue when n_z is 1.

But perhaps, in that case, the eigenvector is correctly [1,0], so perhaps we should consider another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to parameterize the eigenvector in terms of an angle.

Wait, let me consider that the eigenstate is a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field along n, which is in x-z plane. The eigenstate with +ħ/2 spin would be aligned along n.

The general eigenvector for spin in direction n is given by:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓>,

but since our direction is in x-z plane, φ is 0 or π? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, the general spin state is expressed as cosθ/2 for the up component, and e^{iφ} sinθ/2 for the down component. But in our case, the direction is in x-z plane, which implies that φ=0. Because the direction is in x-z plane, so the projection on y is zero, so φ is zero. So, the spinor becomes:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓>,

since e^{i*0} is 1.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the Bloch sphere. For a state aligned along the z-axis, θ=0, so |↑> is cos(0/2)|↑> + e^{i0} sin(0/2)|↓> → 1|↑> + 0|↓>, which is correct.

If θ=90 degrees (along x), then |+> would be cos(45)|↑> + sin(45)|↓> → (1/√2)( |↑> + |↓> ). Which makes sense because the spin along x with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is ( |↑> + |↓> ) /√2.

Wait, but in our problem, the direction is in x-z plane. So the general eigenvector would be cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓>, where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

But let me check the given options.

Looking at the options:

Option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ). That doesn't look like it's scaled by 1/2, but perhaps it's presented differently. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that matches our derived expression. Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied with cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but I'm not sure where those factors come from.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the eigenvector has to be normalized. So the components [a, b] must satisfy |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

In our earlier approach, the eigenvector was proportional to [n_x, 1 -n_z], but when n_z=1, that gives [0,0], which is not possible. So perhaps that approach is not the correct way, and instead, using the general spin state along n is better.

Let me think again. The eigenvector for spin in direction n is given by:

|+> = e^{-iφ/2} cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ/2} sin(θ/2) |↓>

But since our direction is in x-z plane, φ is zero. So the expression simplifies to cos(θ/2)|↑> + sin(θ/2)|↓>.

Which would correspond to components (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches this. But wait, let me look again.

Option C's components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). But does this account for any normalization?

Because the norm would be cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) =1, so it's already normalized.

So that's our eigenvector. So the correct option is option C.

Wait, but let's check the other options. Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors. Where would those come from?

Hmm, perhaps I missed some scaling factor. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the direction vector has a specific relation to the eigenvector components.

Wait, another approach: since the operator P is along direction n, and the eigenstate is |+>, the components of the state vector correspond to the direction in the Bloch sphere. So the state |+> is along n, so in terms of the Bloch vector, the state is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) ), which is option B. But option B has phi, but in our case phi is zero because n is in x-z plane. So option B would then reduce to (cos(theta), sin(theta)), but that's not matching our previous result. But wait, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me think about the operator and the eigenvectors.

Wait, the operator P is the spin operator, and its eigenstates are spin-up and spin-down along n. So for eigenvalue +ħ/2, the eigenvector is |+> which is indeed (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)) ), as I thought earlier. But in our case, phi=0 because n is in x-z plane, so the state becomes (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) ), which is option C.

But wait, in the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is what we have, so the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

### Key Steps:
1. **Operator along $\vec{n}$**: The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, since the y-component of $\vec{n}$ is zero. Substituting the given components of $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   n_z & n_x \\
   n_x & -n_z
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**: The eigenvalue equation is $(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I) | \psi \rangle = 0$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2} I$ from the operator matrix, we get:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I = \frac{\hbar}{2}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   n_z - 1 & n_x \\
   n_x & -n_z - 1
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Eigenvector Condition**: For non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the matrix must be zero. Computing the determinant:
   \[
   \text{det} = (n_z - 1)(-n_z - 1) - n_x^2 = -n_z^2 + 1 - n_x^2 = 0.
   \]
   Using $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$ (since $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector), the determinant condition is satisfied.

4. **Eigenvector Components**: From the eigenvalue equation, the eigenvector components satisfy:
   \[
   (n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0.
   \]
   Solving these equations, the eigenvector is proportional to:
   \[
   | \psi \rangle = \cos(\theta/2) | \uparrow \rangle + \sin(\theta/2) | \downarrow \rangle,
   \]
   where $| \uparrow \rangle = [1, 0]^T$ and $| \downarrow \rangle = [0, 1]^T$. This corresponds to the components $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.

5. **Normalization**: The eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$: This does not match the derived eigenvector components and introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$: This represents a general spin state but includes $\phi$, which is zero for directions in the x-z plane. However, the components do not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$: This matches the derived eigenvector components and is normalized.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$: This introduces incorrect normalization factors and unnecessary scaling by $\hbar$.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector corresponds to **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector for the operator P, but wait, what's P? Oh right, P is a vector operator, so the operator along direction n would be the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction unit vector n.

Oh, right, because for angular momentum operators, the operator along an arbitrary direction is given by P · n, where n is a unit vector. So n is in the x-z plane, which means it can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, since it's in x-z plane, φ is zero? Or wait, no. Wait, no, for a direction in the x-z plane, the angle φ is 0 or 180? Or maybe I'm mixing spherical coordinates. Let me think. The x-z plane implies that the direction vector has y-component zero. So n would be (sinθ cos0, 0, sinθ sin0) ? Wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then φ is 0 or π, but probably 0 for simplicity. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), wait, no, wait: No, wait, unit vectors. Let me think again. The unit vector in the x direction is (1,0,0), in z it's (0,0,1). So a general direction in x-z plane would have components (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x² + n_z² =1. So n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. That makes sense.

So the operator P along n would be P · n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because the direction is in x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero, so P_y doesn't contribute.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So what's the operator P? It's the dot product of the vector components with the direction vector n. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Each P component is given. Let me write them out.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, the operator along n is:

P = n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] 

Which simplifies to:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because when you add the matrices: the (1,1) element is n_z * (1) (from P_z) plus n_x * (1) (from P_x?), wait wait no, let's compute it step by step.

Wait, P_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by n_x (ħ/2), the matrix is [[0, n_x ħ/2],[n_x ħ/2, 0]].

Similarly, P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so multiplied by n_z (ħ/2) gives [[n_z ħ/2, 0],[0, -n_z ħ/2]].

Adding these together, the P operator is:

[[n_z ħ/2, n_x ħ/2],
 [n_x ħ/2, -n_z ħ/2 ] ]

So that's the matrix for P.

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So, the matrix equation is:

( P - (ħ/2) I ) |ψ> = 0 

Let me write the matrix P minus (ħ/2) times the identity matrix.

So, the matrix becomes:

[ [n_z ħ/2 - ħ/2, n_x ħ/2 ],
  [n_x ħ/2, -n_z ħ/2 - ħ/2 ] ]

Factor ħ/2 from each element:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z -1, n_x ],
           [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ]

So the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z-1, n_x],
          [n_x, -n_z-1] ] 

 multiplied by [a, b]^T equals zero vector.

Since (ħ/2) is a scalar, we can ignore it (as it's non-zero) and focus on the matrix:

[ [n_z -1, n_x ],
  [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ]

The determinant of this matrix must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

So determinant D is (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2 = 0.

Compute D:

D = (-n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1 ) - n_x^2 

Wait, wait. Let's compute (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = -n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1 = -n_z^2 +1.

So D = (-n_z^2 +1) - n_x^2 = 0.

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1 (because n is a unit vector), let's see:

(-n_z^2 +1) = 1 - n_z^2.

So D = (1 - n_z^2) - (1 - n_z^2) )? Wait, no, because n_x² is 1 - n_z^2.

Wait, because n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, so n_x^2=1 - n_z^2.

So D = (1 - n_z^2) - (1 - n_z^2 ) = 0.

Hmm, so the determinant is zero, which makes sense because we're looking for eigenvectors.

So, the eigen equation reduces to the first row, since the determinant is zero.

So, the equation from the first row is:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0.

So, (n_z -1) a = -n_x b.

Let me express a in terms of b.

a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] * b.

But it's better to represent the eigen vector in terms of a ratio. Let me set b=1 for simplicity, then a = -n_x/(n_z -1).

Wait, but let me double-check. The first equation is (n_z-1)a + n_x b =0.

So, (n_z -1) a = -n_x b.

So, a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Let me rearrange this:

a = [n_x / (1 - n_z) ] b.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [n_x, 1 - n_z ].

Wait, because if a = [n_x/(1-n_z)] b, then the vector is [n_x/(1-n_z), 1 ] multiplied by b.

But wait, I set b=1, so the vector is (n_x/(1-n_z), 1). But perhaps it's better to write it in terms of a parameter. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to parameterize the state.

Alternatively, I can write the eigenvector as a two-component vector [a, b]. So the eigenvector can be written as a multiple of [n_x, (1 - n_z)].

Wait, because from the equation, (n_z -1)a +n_x b=0 → (1 - n_z) a = n_x b → a = (n_x/(1-n_z)) b.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [n_x, 1-n_z].

Wait, but let me test with a specific case, like when the direction is along z (n_x=0, n_z=1). Then, the eigenvector should be [0, (1-1)] → [0,0], which can't be right. Oh, wait, that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no. If direction is along z, then n_x=0, n_z=1.

Then, the matrix P is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]].

The eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The eigenvectors are [1,0] for +ħ/2, and [0,1] for -ħ/2.

So, according to our earlier expression, when n_x=0 and n_z=1, the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 would be [0, 1-1]= [0,0], which is not correct. So something's wrong here.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the eigen equation approach.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider the eigen equation for the operator P.

Wait, the operator P is P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

Wait, but since n lies in the x-z plane, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), and is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² =1.

So, the operator P can be written as P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

The eigenvalue is ħ/2. So, P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

We can write |ψ> as a two-component spinor [a, b]^T.

So, let's write the matrix for P.

P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So, P |ψ> = (ħ/2) [ [n_z a + n_x b], [n_x a - n_z b] ].

This equals (ħ/2) [a, b]^T.

So, the equations are:

n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0.

n_x a -n_z b = b → n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0.

So, two equations:

1. (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0.

2. n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0.

These are two equations in two variables a and b.

Let me write them:

Equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0.

Equation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

We can solve this system. Let's assume that a and b are not both zero.

Let me write equation 1 as: a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b.

Substituting this into equation 2:

n_x [ (-n_x/(n_z -1)) b ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

Factor out b:

[ -n_x^2/(n_z-1) + (-n_z -1) ] b = 0.

Since b isn't necessarily zero, the term inside must be zero.

So,

-n_x^2/(n_z-1) - (n_z +1) ) =0.

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1) to eliminate denominator:

- n_x^2 - (n_z +1)(n_z -1) ) =0.

Which simplifies to:

- n_x^2 - (n_z^2 -1) )=0.

But n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, so n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2.

Substituting:

- (1 - n_z^2) - (n_z^2 -1 ) =0.

Wait,

- (1 - n_z^2) → -1 +n_z^2.

- (n_z^2 -1) → -n_z^2 +1.

Adding them together: (-1 + n_z^2) + (-n_z^2 +1 ) = 0.

So, it equals zero, which holds true. Therefore, the equations are consistent, and the eigenvector can be found.

So, going back to a in terms of b:

a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b.

But wait, when n_z approaches 1, the denominator approaches zero.

Wait, but when n_z =1, direction is along +z. Then, the operator P would be P_z, which has eigenstates [1,0] and [0,1]. So the eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to [1,0].

But according to our expression, when n_z=1, denominator is 0, which suggests that a approaches infinity unless n_x=0.

Wait, but when n_z=1, n_x=0, so the expression becomes a =0/(0) which is undefined. So that suggests that our approach may have an issue when n_z is 1.

But perhaps, in that case, the eigenvector is correctly [1,0], so perhaps we should consider another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to parameterize the eigenvector in terms of an angle.

Wait, let me consider that the eigenstate is a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field along n, which is in x-z plane. The eigenstate with +ħ/2 spin would be aligned along n.

The general eigenvector for spin in direction n is given by:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓>,

but since our direction is in x-z plane, φ is 0 or π? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, the general spin state is expressed as cosθ/2 for the up component, and e^{iφ} sinθ/2 for the down component. But in our case, the direction is in x-z plane, which implies that φ=0. Because the direction is in x-z plane, so the projection on y is zero, so φ is zero. So, the spinor becomes:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓>,

since e^{i*0} is 1.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the Bloch sphere. For a state aligned along the z-axis, θ=0, so |↑> is cos(0/2)|↑> + e^{i0} sin(0/2)|↓> → 1|↑> + 0|↓>, which is correct.

If θ=90 degrees (along x), then |+> would be cos(45)|↑> + sin(45)|↓> → (1/√2)( |↑> + |↓> ). Which makes sense because the spin along x with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is ( |↑> + |↓> ) /√2.

Wait, but in our problem, the direction is in x-z plane. So the general eigenvector would be cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓>, where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

But let me check the given options.

Looking at the options:

Option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ). That doesn't look like it's scaled by 1/2, but perhaps it's presented differently. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that matches our derived expression. Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied with cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but I'm not sure where those factors come from.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the eigenvector has to be normalized. So the components [a, b] must satisfy |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

In our earlier approach, the eigenvector was proportional to [n_x, 1 -n_z], but when n_z=1, that gives [0,0], which is not possible. So perhaps that approach is not the correct way, and instead, using the general spin state along n is better.

Let me think again. The eigenvector for spin in direction n is given by:

|+> = e^{-iφ/2} cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ/2} sin(θ/2) |↓>

But since our direction is in x-z plane, φ is zero. So the expression simplifies to cos(θ/2)|↑> + sin(θ/2)|↓>.

Which would correspond to components (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches this. But wait, let me look again.

Option C's components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). But does this account for any normalization?

Because the norm would be cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) =1, so it's already normalized.

So that's our eigenvector. So the correct option is option C.

Wait, but let's check the other options. Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors. Where would those come from?

Hmm, perhaps I missed some scaling factor. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the direction vector has a specific relation to the eigenvector components.

Wait, another approach: since the operator P is along direction n, and the eigenstate is |+>, the components of the state vector correspond to the direction in the Bloch sphere. So the state |+> is along n, so in terms of the Bloch vector, the state is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) ), which is option B. But option B has phi, but in our case phi is zero because n is in x-z plane. So option B would then reduce to (cos(theta), sin(theta)), but that's not matching our previous result. But wait, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me think about the operator and the eigenvectors.

Wait, the operator P is the spin operator, and its eigenstates are spin-up and spin-down along n. So for eigenvalue +ħ/2, the eigenvector is |+> which is indeed (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)) ), as I thought earlier. But in our case, phi=0 because n is in x-z plane, so the state becomes (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) ), which is option C.

But wait, in the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is what we have, so the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

### Key Steps:
1. **Operator along $\vec{n}$**: The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, since the y-component of $\vec{n}$ is zero. Substituting the given components of $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   n_z & n_x \\
   n_x & -n_z
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**: The eigenvalue equation is $(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I) | \psi \rangle = 0$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2} I$ from the operator matrix, we get:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I = \frac{\hbar}{2}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   n_z - 1 & n_x \\
   n_x & -n_z - 1
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Eigenvector Condition**: For non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the matrix must be zero. Computing the determinant:
   \[
   \text{det} = (n_z - 1)(-n_z - 1) - n_x^2 = -n_z^2 + 1 - n_x^2 = 0.
   \]
   Using $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$ (since $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector), the determinant condition is satisfied.

4. **Eigenvector Components**: From the eigenvalue equation, the eigenvector components satisfy:
   \[
   (n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0.
   \]
   Solving these equations, the eigenvector is proportional to:
   \[
   | \psi \rangle = \cos(\theta/2) | \uparrow \rangle + \sin(\theta/2) | \downarrow \rangle,
   \]
   where $| \uparrow \rangle = [1, 0]^T$ and $| \downarrow \rangle = [0, 1]^T$. This corresponds to the components $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.

5. **Normalization**: The eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$: This does not match the derived eigenvector components and introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$: This represents a general spin state but includes $\phi$, which is zero for directions in the x-z plane. However, the components do not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$: This matches the derived eigenvector components and is normalized.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$: This introduces incorrect normalization factors and unnecessary scaling by $\hbar$.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector corresponds to **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.
