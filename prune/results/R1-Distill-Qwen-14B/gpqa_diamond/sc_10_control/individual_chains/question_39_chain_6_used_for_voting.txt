Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measured the particles, none were found at x < 1 or x > 3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. We need to find the value of 'a' from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that the wave function must be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. Since the wave function is given, I should set up the integral from x=1 to x=3.

Wait, but the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the absolute square would be the square of the modulus of this complex number. Let me think about how to compute that.

The wave function ψ(x) = A - Bi, where A is a real part and B is the imaginary part. So the modulus squared is |ψ|² = (A)^2 + (B)^2. Because when you have a complex number a + ib, the modulus squared is a² + b².

In this case, A is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B is 0.5. So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

The normalization condition is ∫|ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 = 1.

So let's write that as ∫[ (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

I can split this integral into two parts:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let me compute each part separately.

First integral: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3 gives ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

Adding them together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 is about 0.7213.

Therefore, a² ≈ 0.7213, so a is the square root of that. Let me calculate sqrt(0.7213). Hmm, sqrt(0.72) is about 0.8485, so around 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So I think the answer is B.

But wait, let me double-check my steps. Did I make any mistakes?

The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The absolute square is correct. The integration limits are from 1 to 3 because the particles are found only there. So I did the integrals correctly. Yes, the first integral is a² times ln(2), and the second is 0.5.

So yes, a² is 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.7213, so a is approximately 0.85. Option B seems correct.

To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1
\]

Splitting the integral:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 1
\]

The first integral evaluates to:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

The second integral evaluates to:

\[
0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Adding the two results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option B.

The wave function ψ(x) = A - Bi, where A is a real part and B is the imaginary part. So the modulus squared is |ψ|² = (A)^2 + (B)^2. Because when you have a complex number a + ib, the modulus squared is a² + b².

In this case, A is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B is 0.5. So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

The normalization condition is ∫|ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 = 1.

So let's write that as ∫[ (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

I can split this integral into two parts:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Second integral: 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

Adding them together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 is about 0.7213.

Therefore, a² ≈ 0.7213, so a is the square root of that. Let me calculate sqrt(0.7213). Hmm, sqrt(0.72) is about 0.8485, so around 0.85.

To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[

\]

Splitting the integral:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 1
\]

The first integral evaluates to:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

The second integral evaluates to:

\[
0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Adding the two results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option B.
