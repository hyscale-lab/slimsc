Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about uncertainty in the energy of an electron based on its uncertain position. Hmm, I remember something about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle from my studies. 

So the problem says the electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy, ΔE, and choose the correct option among A to D. 

First, I think I should recall the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. From what I remember, it states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, but sometimes it's written as ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2 or even approximately ħ. I'll have to be careful about the exact expression.

So, the idea is that if there's an uncertainty in position (Δx), there's a corresponding minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp). Once I find Δp, I can relate that to the uncertainty in energy ΔE. But how?

I think the relationship between momentum and energy might come into play here. For a non-relativistic particle, the kinetic energy E is given by E = p²/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So if I can find Δp, I can find ΔE by taking the derivative or using some uncertainty relation. Wait, but the uncertainty in energy might be linked directly to the uncertainty in momentum.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time? No, the question is about position and momentum leading to energy uncertainty. Hmm.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate Δp using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
2. Find the relationship between Δp and ΔE.
3. Plug in the numbers to find ΔE.

Starting with step 1: Heisenberg's principle says Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So rearranging for Δp, it's at least ħ/(2Δx). Let me note down the constants I'll need.

Constants:
- Planck's constant (h) is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s.
- The reduced Planck's constant ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718 x 10^-34 J·s.
- The mass of the electron (m) is about 9.10938356 x 10^-31 kg.
- The speed given is v = 2e8 m/s.

Wait, but wait. The speed is given. Maybe I can calculate the momentum p from that. Oh wait, but for the uncertainty, I think I need to use the uncertainty principle to find Δp, not the actual p. Because the question is about the uncertainty in energy, which comes from the uncertainty in momentum. 

So, back to step 1. Let's compute Δp. 

Δp = ħ / (2Δx)
Wait, but sometimes it's approximated as ħ/(Δx), ignoring the 2. I'm not sure which to use here. The problem says to estimate, so maybe the 2 can be ignored for an approximate calculation.

So, taking Δx as 0.1 nm. Oh wait, nanometer is 1e-9 meters. So 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters.

So, substituting:

Δp ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s / (2 * 1e-10 m) 
Wait but wait, wait. Wait, 0.1 nm is 0.1e-9 meters, which is 1e-10 meters. So Δx = 1e-10 m.

So calculating:

Δp ≈ (1.0546e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) )
Let me compute the denominator: 2 * 1e-10 = 2e-10.

So, 1.0546e-34 / 2e-10 = (1.0546 / 2) * 1e-24 = approximately 0.5273e-24 = 5.273e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, but sometimes the formula is written as Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx), so maybe I should just use that. Let me do both and see how it affects the result.

Wait, if I use Δp = ħ/(2Δx), then with Δx = 1e-10 m, it's 1.05e-34 / (2e-10) = 5.25e-25 kg m/s. If I ignore the 2, it's about 1.05e-24 kg m/s. Hmm, a factor of 2 difference. But since the question asks for an estimate, perhaps the exact factor isn't crucial, and the order of magnitude is what matters.

Now, step 2: Find ΔE. Well, since the electron's kinetic energy is given by E = p²/(2m), perhaps the uncertainty in E, ΔE, is related to the uncertainty in p, Δp.

But how? The uncertainty in E would be the derivative of E with respect to p, multiplied by Δp? Or is there a more direct way?

Wait, E = p²/(2m). So, if p is uncertain by Δp, then the uncertainty in E, ΔE, can be approximated by the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by Δp. So:

ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp.

dE/dp is (2p)/(2m) ) = p/m.

So, ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, I don't have the exact value of p, only the uncertainty in p. Hmm, that's a problem. Because I have Δp, but I might not have p itself. Alternatively, maybe I can express ΔE in terms of Δp in a different way.

Wait, but perhaps I can consider that the uncertainty in energy is approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). Because E = p²/(2m), so the variance in E would be (Δp)^2 * (dE/dp)^2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach is to note that if we have Δp, then the corresponding ΔE is (Δp)^2/(2m). 

Wait, let me think again. Let me model E as a function of p: E = p²/(2m). So, the change in E (ΔE) for a change in p (Δp) would be approximately 2p/(2m) * Δp = (p)/(m) * Δp.

But that requires knowing p, which is the actual momentum. But I don't have that, only Δp. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't the best.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the standard deviation in E, which would be the derivative multiplied by the standard deviation in p. But without knowing p, that's tricky. Wait, but maybe in this problem, since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty in energy, perhaps it's tied directly to the uncertainty in momentum via the same Heisenberg principle, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the energy-time uncertainty principle. But that's not applicable here since the question is about position uncertainty leading to momentum uncertainty, which then leads to energy uncertainty. So perhaps the approach I took earlier is better.

Wait, another approach: since the electron has a momentum p that's approximately m*v (non-relativistic), then p = m*v = 9.109e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = let's calculate that.

p = 9.109e-31 * 2e8 = 1.8218e-22 kg m/s.

Then, using E = p²/(2m), the kinetic energy would be ( (1.8218e-22)^2 ) / (2 * 9.109e-31 )

Let me compute that:

(1.8218e-22)^2 = approx (3.32e-44) [since 1.8^2 is about 3.24]

Divide by (2 *9.109e-31) which is about 1.8218e-30.

So E ≈ 3.32e-44 / 1.8218e-30 = approx 1.82e-14 J.

Wait, but that's the actual energy. But we need the uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, but if E is the average, then the uncertainty in E would be (Δp)^2/(2m), because E depends quadratically on p. Let me see: the variance in E would be (dE/dp)^2 * (Δp)^2.

So, dE/dp is (p)/(m), as before. Therefore, (dE/dp)^2 = p²/(m²).

So, variance in E is (p²/m²) * (Δp)^2.

But then, the standard deviation (ΔE) is sqrt( (p²/m²) * (Δp)^2 ) ) = (p/m) * Δp.

Wait, but that brings us back to the same problem: we have p, the actual momentum. But for the minimum uncertainty, perhaps the worst case is when p is zero, which would make ΔE zero. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since the energy is given by E = p²/(2m), the uncertainty in E can be approximated using the uncertainty in p. Let's write E in terms of p and then compute the uncertainty.

E = p²/(2m)
So, taking the differential, dE = (2p)/(2m) dp = (p/m) dp.

So, the uncertainty in E is (p/m) * Δp.

But again, since I don't have p, but I've calculated p as 1.8e-22 kg m/s, I can use that to compute ΔE.

So, with p = 1.82e-22 kg m/s, m =9.1e-31 kg, and Δp = 5.27e-25 kg m/s.

So, (p/m) = (1.82e-22) / (9.1e-31) ) = approx 2e8 (since 1.8e-22 / 9e-31 is (1.8/9) * 1e9 → 0.2 * 1e9 = 2e8).

So, (p/m) = 2e8 s/m.

Then, ΔE = (2e8) * (5.27e-25) = 1.054e-16 J.

Wait, that's 1.05e-16 J, which is 1e-16 J, which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations to see if I made any mistakes.

First, p = m v = 9.1e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 1.82e-22 kg m/s. Correct.

Then, Δp is approx 5.27e-25 kg m/s (from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle). Correct.

Then, (p/m) = (1.82e-22) / (9.1e-31) → 1.82 /9.1 is about 0.2, times 1e9 → 0.2e9 → 2e8. Correct.

Multiply (p/m) by Δp: 2e8 * 5.27e-25 → 2 *5.27 =10.54, and exponents 1e8 *1e-25 =1e-17.

So 10.54e-17 J. Which is about 1.05e-16 J. So ~1e-16 J. So option D is 1e-16 J.

Wait, but earlier I considered whether the uncertainty principle should have the 2 in the denominator. Let me see: if I had taken Δp = ħ/(2Δx), then Δp would be 1.05e-34 / (2*1e-10) = about 5.25e-25 kg m/s, which is what I used.

If I had used Δp = ħ/(Δx), which would ignore the 2, then Δp would be about 1.05e-24 kg m/s. Then, (p/m) = 2e8, so 2e8 *1.05e-24 = 2.1e-16 J, which is still about 1e-16 J, so same order of magnitude. So the answer would still be D.

But wait, wait. Another approach: perhaps the energy uncertainty is directly related to the uncertainty in momentum via ΔE ≈ Δp²/(2m). Because E = p²/(2m), so ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m).

Let me compute that.

(Δp)^2 = (5.27e-25)^2 = approx 2.78e-49.

Divide by (2m) = 2 *9.1e-31 = 1.82e-30.

So ΔE ≈ 2.78e-49 / 1.82e-30 = approx 1.53e-19 J.

Wait, that's 1e-19 J, which is option C. Oh, that's conflicting with my previous result.

Wait, now I'm confused. Which approach is correct? Because this gives a different answer.

Hmm. Let's think about the mathematics. E is p squared over 2m. So, if p has an uncertainty Δp, then the uncertainty in E would be the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by Δp, which is (dE/dp) * Δp.

Which is (p/m) * Δp, as I did earlier. But that approach used the actual p, which might not be correct because the uncertainty is in p, not the actual p itself.

Wait, but maybe the correct approach is to compute the relative uncertainty. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the energy uncertainty as (Δp)^2/(2m), treating E as a function of p and taking the variance.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m). So let's compute that.

Δp is 5.27e-25 kg m/s.

So, (5.27e-25)^2 = 2.77e-49.

Divide by (2m) = 2 *9.1e-31 = 1.82e-30.

So, 2.77e-49 / 1.82e-30 ≈ 1.524e-19 J.

That's about 1.5e-19 J, which is option C.

But earlier I had another approach leading to option D. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I got confused between the actual momentum and the uncertainty. Let me think again.

Heisenberg's principle gives the minimum uncertainty in p, which is Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). So that gives the Δp. Then, since E depends on p^2, the uncertainty in E, ΔE, is given by the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by Δp. That is, ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp.

But E = p²/(2m), so dE/dp = p/m.

So, ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, here I'm using the average value of p, which is m v. But the uncertainty in E would then involve the average p and the uncertainty in p. However, I'm not sure if this is the correct way to model it. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the variance.

The variance in E is (dE/dp)^2 * (Δp)^2. So, (ΔE)^2 = (p^2/m^2) * (Δp)^2.

So, ΔE = (p/m) * Δp.

Which brings us back to the same calculation as before. But in that case, using p = m v, which is 1.8e-22 kg m/s, m is 9.1e-31 kg,

So, (p/m) = (1.8e-22) / (9.1e-31) ≈ 2e8 s/m.

Multiply by Δp: 2e8 *5.27e-25 = 1.05e-16 J, which is option D.

But another approach using the variance method gives me 1.5e-19 J, which is option C. So which is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, since they only ask for the minimum uncertainty in energy, it's appropriate to use the formula ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m). Because E is proportional to p², so the uncertainty in E would be (Δp)^2/(2m).

Let me recalculate that.

Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = 1.05e-34 / (2*1e-10) = 5.25e-25 kg m/s.

(Δp)^2 = (5.25e-25)^2 = 2.756e-49.

Divide by (2m) = 1.82e-30.

So ΔE = 2.756e-49 / 1.82e-30 ≈ 1.516e-19 J.

Which is approximately 1.5e-19 J, so option C.

Hmm, but earlier when I used the derivative approach, I got a much larger value. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem more carefully. The question is about the uncertainty in energy due to the uncertainty in position. The minimal uncertainty in energy would be the minimal possible value based on the Heisenberg principle.

An alternative approach is to think about the kinetic energy and its uncertainty. The kinetic energy is E = p²/(2m), so the uncertainty in E can be written as ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m). Wait, but that would be the case if the uncertainty in p is small compared to p itself. Because then, the relative uncertainty in E would be approximately twice the relative uncertainty in p.

But perhaps the correct approach is to use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for energy and time, but that's a different approach.

Wait, another thought: the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle between energy and time is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. But in this problem, we don't have a time uncertainty. So perhaps that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for similar problems or standard approaches.

I recall that the minimum uncertainty in energy can be found using the uncertainty in momentum. Since E = p²/(2m), the change in E would be (p + Δp)^2/(2m) - p²/(2m) = (2p Δp + (Δp)^2)/(2m).

But the minimum uncertainty would correspond to the case where this is minimized, which I think occurs when p is as small as possible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the minimum uncertainty in E is given by the derivative approach.

Wait, another approach: The variance in E is given by ⟨E²⟩ - ⟨E⟩². Since E = p²/(2m), ⟨E²⟩ = ⟨p^4⟩/(4m²).

But ⟨p^4⟩ can be expressed in terms of (⟨p²⟩)^2 and terms involving Δp. But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should just stick with the approach that gives an order of magnitude close to one of the options.

But given the two methods I tried earlier, one gives me 1e-16 J (option D) and the other 1e-19 J (option C). Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me recheck the calculation.

First approach: ΔE = (p/m) * Δp.

p = m v = 9.1e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 1.82e-22 kg m/s.

Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = 1.05e-34 / (2e-10) )= 5.25e-25 kg m/s.

(p/m) = (1.82e-22) / (9.1e-31) ) = (1.82 /9.1 ) * 1e9 = approximately 0.2 *1e9 = 2e8.

So, (p/m) * Δp = 2e8 * 5.25e-25 = 1.05e-16 J.

What about the second approach: ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m).

(5.25e-25)^2 = 2.756e-49.

Divide by (2m) = 1.82e-30.

2.756e-49 / 1.82e-30 = 1.516e-19 J.

But which formula is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the standard uncertainty formula. For a function f(x) = x², the uncertainty in f is given by the square root of ( (df/dx)^2 (Δx)^2 ) ), which is |df/dx| * Δx. So, in this case, E = p²/(2m), so dE/dp = p/m. So ΔE = (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, this uses the actual value of p, which might not be appropriate because we're dealing with uncertainties. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the derivative multiplied by the relative uncertainty in p.

Wait, the relative uncertainty in E would be approximately (dE/dp) * (Δp / p) ) = (p/m) * (Δp / p) ) = Δp / m.

Wait, that would make ΔE = E * (Δp/m).

But E is p²/(2m), so ΔE = (p²/(2m)) * (Δp/m) ) = p² Δp / (2 m²).

Hmm, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way to find the uncertainty in E is to compute the root mean square deviation, which would involve (Δp)^2/(2m).

But without knowing the exact statistical distribution, it's a bit tricky. However, in most basic problems like this, the approach taken is to use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to find Δp, then relate that to ΔE using E = p²/(2m), considering the uncertainty in p.

Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to use ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m). Because in this case, the energy depends quadratically on p, so the uncertainty in E would scale with the square of the uncertainty in p.

So, using that approach, I get ΔE ≈ 1.5e-19 J, which is option C.

But wait, another consideration: the electron's speed is given. So, perhaps we can compute the momentum p, and then find the relative uncertainty in p, and then find the relative uncertainty in E, and then find ΔE.

The actual momentum p is m v = 9.1e-31 * 2e8 = 1.82e-22 kg m/s.

The uncertainty in p is Δp = 5.25e-25 kg m/s.

So, relative uncertainty in p is Δp / p = (5.25e-25)/(1.82e-22) ) ≈ 0.02885, or about 2.885%.

Then, the relative uncertainty in E would be approximately twice the relative uncertainty in p, since E is proportional to p squared. So relative ΔE is approximately 2 * 2.885% = 5.77%.

So, the absolute ΔE would be 5.77% of E.

Earlier, I calculated E as 1.82e-14 J.

So, ΔE ≈ 0.0577 * 1.82e-14 = approx 1.05e-15 J.

Wait, that's 1e-15 J, which isn't among the options. Hmm, this approach gives a different answer again.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to find a different way. Perhaps I can look up a similar problem or formula.

Wait, I found a formula in my notes: the uncertainty in energy is given by ΔE ≈ ħ * (v)/(Δx), but I'm not entirely sure where that comes from.

Wait, let's go back to the beginning. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2.

So, Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx).

Then, since E = p²/(2m), the uncertainty in E, ΔE, is approximately (Δp)^2/(2m).

So, substituting:

ΔE ≈ ( (ħ/(2Δx)) )² / (2m) )

Let me compute this.

ħ = 1.05e-34 J·s.

Δx = 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m.

So,

ΔE ≈ ( (1.05e-34 / (2 *1e-10) )^2 ) / (2 *9.1e-31 )

Compute the numerator first:

(1.05e-34 / 2e-10 ) = (1.05e-34 ) / (2e-10 ) = (1.05 /2 ) * 1e-24 = 0.525e-24 = 5.25e-25.

Square that: (5.25e-25)^2 = 2.756e-49.

Divide by denominator 2*9.1e-31 = 1.82e-30.

So, ΔE = 2.756e-49 / 1.82e-30 ≈ 1.516e-19 J.

So that's about 1.5e-19 J, which is option C.

So, I think this approach is correct. Therefore, the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait another moment: in some derivations, the formula is ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m), which we've used. So, the answer should be around 1e-19 J, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron traveling with speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and an uncertainty in position \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between momentum and energy.

### Step 1: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states:
\[
\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]
where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.0546 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Rearranging for \( \Delta p \), we get:
\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
\]
Substituting \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \):
\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{1.0546 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 5.273 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Relating Momentum Uncertainty to Energy Uncertainty
The kinetic energy of the electron is given by:
\[
E = \frac{p^2}{2m},
\]
where \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \). The uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) can be approximated as:
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m}.
\]
Substituting \( \Delta p = 5.273 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \) and \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \):
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(5.273 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculation
First, calculate \( (\Delta p)^2 \):
\[
(\Delta p)^2 = (5.273 \times 10^{-25})^2 \approx 2.78 \times 10^{-49}.
\]
Next, calculate the denominator:
\[
2m = 2 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \approx 1.822 \times 10^{-30}.
\]
Finally, divide:
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{2.78 \times 10^{-49}}{1.822 \times 10^{-30}} \approx 1.53 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 4: Final Answer
The minimum uncertainty in the energy is approximately \( 1.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option **C**.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about uncertainty in the energy of an electron based on its uncertain position. Hmm, I remember something about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle from my studies. 

So the problem says the electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy, ΔE, and choose the correct option among A to D. 

First, I think I should recall the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. From what I remember, it states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, but sometimes it's written as ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2 or even approximately ħ. I'll have to be careful about the exact expression.

So, the idea is that if there's an uncertainty in position (Δx), there's a corresponding minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp). Once I find Δp, I can relate that to the uncertainty in energy ΔE. But how?

I think the relationship between momentum and energy might come into play here. For a non-relativistic particle, the kinetic energy E is given by E = p²/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So if I can find Δp, I can find ΔE by taking the derivative or using some uncertainty relation. Wait, but the uncertainty in energy might be linked directly to the uncertainty in momentum.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time? No, the question is about position and momentum leading to energy uncertainty. Hmm.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate Δp using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
2. Find the relationship between Δp and ΔE.
3. Plug in the numbers to find ΔE.

Starting with step 1: Heisenberg's principle says Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So rearranging for Δp, it's at least ħ/(2Δx). Let me note down the constants I'll need.

Constants:
- Planck's constant (h) is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s.
- The reduced Planck's constant ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718 x 10^-34 J·s.
- The mass of the electron (m) is about 9.10938356 x 10^-31 kg.
- The speed given is v = 2e8 m/s.

Wait, but wait. The speed is given. Maybe I can calculate the momentum p from that. Oh wait, but for the uncertainty, I think I need to use the uncertainty principle to find Δp, not the actual p. Because the question is about the uncertainty in energy, which comes from the uncertainty in momentum. 

So, back to step 1. Let's compute Δp. 

Δp = ħ / (2Δx)
Wait, but sometimes it's approximated as ħ/(Δx), ignoring the 2. I'm not sure which to use here. The problem says to estimate, so maybe the 2 can be ignored for an approximate calculation.

So, taking Δx as 0.1 nm. Oh wait, nanometer is 1e-9 meters. So 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters.

So, substituting:

Δp ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s / (2 * 1e-10 m) 
Wait but wait, wait. Wait, 0.1 nm is 0.1e-9 meters, which is 1e-10 meters. So Δx = 1e-10 m.

So calculating:

Δp ≈ (1.0546e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) )
Let me compute the denominator: 2 * 1e-10 = 2e-10.

So, 1.0546e-34 / 2e-10 = (1.0546 / 2) * 1e-24 = approximately 0.5273e-24 = 5.273e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, but sometimes the formula is written as Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx), so maybe I should just use that. Let me do both and see how it affects the result.

Wait, if I use Δp = ħ/(2Δx), then with Δx = 1e-10 m, it's 1.05e-34 / (2e-10) = 5.25e-25 kg m/s. If I ignore the 2, it's about 1.05e-24 kg m/s. Hmm, a factor of 2 difference. But since the question asks for an estimate, perhaps the exact factor isn't crucial, and the order of magnitude is what matters.

Now, step 2: Find ΔE. Well, since the electron's kinetic energy is given by E = p²/(2m), perhaps the uncertainty in E, ΔE, is related to the uncertainty in p, Δp.

But how? The uncertainty in E would be the derivative of E with respect to p, multiplied by Δp? Or is there a more direct way?

Wait, E = p²/(2m). So, if p is uncertain by Δp, then the uncertainty in E, ΔE, can be approximated by the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by Δp. So:

ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp.

dE/dp is (2p)/(2m) ) = p/m.

So, ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, I don't have the exact value of p, only the uncertainty in p. Hmm, that's a problem. Because I have Δp, but I might not have p itself. Alternatively, maybe I can express ΔE in terms of Δp in a different way.

Wait, but perhaps I can consider that the uncertainty in energy is approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). Because E = p²/(2m), so the variance in E would be (Δp)^2 * (dE/dp)^2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach is to note that if we have Δp, then the corresponding ΔE is (Δp)^2/(2m). 

Wait, let me think again. Let me model E as a function of p: E = p²/(2m). So, the change in E (ΔE) for a change in p (Δp) would be approximately 2p/(2m) * Δp = (p)/(m) * Δp.

But that requires knowing p, which is the actual momentum. But I don't have that, only Δp. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't the best.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the standard deviation in E, which would be the derivative multiplied by the standard deviation in p. But without knowing p, that's tricky. Wait, but maybe in this problem, since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty in energy, perhaps it's tied directly to the uncertainty in momentum via the same Heisenberg principle, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the energy-time uncertainty principle. But that's not applicable here since the question is about position uncertainty leading to momentum uncertainty, which then leads to energy uncertainty. So perhaps the approach I took earlier is better.

Wait, another approach: since the electron has a momentum p that's approximately m*v (non-relativistic), then p = m*v = 9.109e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = let's calculate that.

p = 9.109e-31 * 2e8 = 1.8218e-22 kg m/s.

Then, using E = p²/(2m), the kinetic energy would be ( (1.8218e-22)^2 ) / (2 * 9.109e-31 )

Let me compute that:

(1.8218e-22)^2 = approx (3.32e-44) [since 1.8^2 is about 3.24]

Divide by (2 *9.109e-31) which is about 1.8218e-30.

So E ≈ 3.32e-44 / 1.8218e-30 = approx 1.82e-14 J.

Wait, but that's the actual energy. But we need the uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, but if E is the average, then the uncertainty in E would be (Δp)^2/(2m), because E depends quadratically on p. Let me see: the variance in E would be (dE/dp)^2 * (Δp)^2.

So, dE/dp is (p)/(m), as before. Therefore, (dE/dp)^2 = p²/(m²).

So, variance in E is (p²/m²) * (Δp)^2.

But then, the standard deviation (ΔE) is sqrt( (p²/m²) * (Δp)^2 ) ) = (p/m) * Δp.

Wait, but that brings us back to the same problem: we have p, the actual momentum. But for the minimum uncertainty, perhaps the worst case is when p is zero, which would make ΔE zero. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since the energy is given by E = p²/(2m), the uncertainty in E can be approximated using the uncertainty in p. Let's write E in terms of p and then compute the uncertainty.

E = p²/(2m)
So, taking the differential, dE = (2p)/(2m) dp = (p/m) dp.

So, the uncertainty in E is (p/m) * Δp.

But again, since I don't have p, but I've calculated p as 1.8e-22 kg m/s, I can use that to compute ΔE.

So, with p = 1.82e-22 kg m/s, m =9.1e-31 kg, and Δp = 5.27e-25 kg m/s.

So, (p/m) = (1.82e-22) / (9.1e-31) ) = approx 2e8 (since 1.8e-22 / 9e-31 is (1.8/9) * 1e9 → 0.2 * 1e9 = 2e8).

So, (p/m) = 2e8 s/m.

Then, ΔE = (2e8) * (5.27e-25) = 1.054e-16 J.

Wait, that's 1.05e-16 J, which is 1e-16 J, which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations to see if I made any mistakes.

First, p = m v = 9.1e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 1.82e-22 kg m/s. Correct.

Then, Δp is approx 5.27e-25 kg m/s (from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle). Correct.

Then, (p/m) = (1.82e-22) / (9.1e-31) → 1.82 /9.1 is about 0.2, times 1e9 → 0.2e9 → 2e8. Correct.

Multiply (p/m) by Δp: 2e8 * 5.27e-25 → 2 *5.27 =10.54, and exponents 1e8 *1e-25 =1e-17.

So 10.54e-17 J. Which is about 1.05e-16 J. So ~1e-16 J. So option D is 1e-16 J.

Wait, but earlier I considered whether the uncertainty principle should have the 2 in the denominator. Let me see: if I had taken Δp = ħ/(2Δx), then Δp would be 1.05e-34 / (2*1e-10) = about 5.25e-25 kg m/s, which is what I used.

If I had used Δp = ħ/(Δx), which would ignore the 2, then Δp would be about 1.05e-24 kg m/s. Then, (p/m) = 2e8, so 2e8 *1.05e-24 = 2.1e-16 J, which is still about 1e-16 J, so same order of magnitude. So the answer would still be D.

But wait, wait. Another approach: perhaps the energy uncertainty is directly related to the uncertainty in momentum via ΔE ≈ Δp²/(2m). Because E = p²/(2m), so ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m).

Let me compute that.

(Δp)^2 = (5.27e-25)^2 = approx 2.78e-49.

Divide by (2m) = 2 *9.1e-31 = 1.82e-30.

So ΔE ≈ 2.78e-49 / 1.82e-30 = approx 1.53e-19 J.

Wait, that's 1e-19 J, which is option C. Oh, that's conflicting with my previous result.

Wait, now I'm confused. Which approach is correct? Because this gives a different answer.

Hmm. Let's think about the mathematics. E is p squared over 2m. So, if p has an uncertainty Δp, then the uncertainty in E would be the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by Δp, which is (dE/dp) * Δp.

Which is (p/m) * Δp, as I did earlier. But that approach used the actual p, which might not be correct because the uncertainty is in p, not the actual p itself.

Wait, but maybe the correct approach is to compute the relative uncertainty. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the energy uncertainty as (Δp)^2/(2m), treating E as a function of p and taking the variance.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m). So let's compute that.

Δp is 5.27e-25 kg m/s.

So, (5.27e-25)^2 = 2.77e-49.

Divide by (2m) = 2 *9.1e-31 = 1.82e-30.

So, 2.77e-49 / 1.82e-30 ≈ 1.524e-19 J.

That's about 1.5e-19 J, which is option C.

But earlier I had another approach leading to option D. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I got confused between the actual momentum and the uncertainty. Let me think again.

Heisenberg's principle gives the minimum uncertainty in p, which is Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). So that gives the Δp. Then, since E depends on p^2, the uncertainty in E, ΔE, is given by the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by Δp. That is, ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp.

But E = p²/(2m), so dE/dp = p/m.

So, ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, here I'm using the average value of p, which is m v. But the uncertainty in E would then involve the average p and the uncertainty in p. However, I'm not sure if this is the correct way to model it. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the variance.

The variance in E is (dE/dp)^2 * (Δp)^2. So, (ΔE)^2 = (p^2/m^2) * (Δp)^2.

So, ΔE = (p/m) * Δp.

Which brings us back to the same calculation as before. But in that case, using p = m v, which is 1.8e-22 kg m/s, m is 9.1e-31 kg,

So, (p/m) = (1.8e-22) / (9.1e-31) ≈ 2e8 s/m.

Multiply by Δp: 2e8 *5.27e-25 = 1.05e-16 J, which is option D.

But another approach using the variance method gives me 1.5e-19 J, which is option C. So which is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, since they only ask for the minimum uncertainty in energy, it's appropriate to use the formula ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m). Because E is proportional to p², so the uncertainty in E would be (Δp)^2/(2m).

Let me recalculate that.

Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = 1.05e-34 / (2*1e-10) = 5.25e-25 kg m/s.

(Δp)^2 = (5.25e-25)^2 = 2.756e-49.

Divide by (2m) = 1.82e-30.

So ΔE = 2.756e-49 / 1.82e-30 ≈ 1.516e-19 J.

Which is approximately 1.5e-19 J, so option C.

Hmm, but earlier when I used the derivative approach, I got a much larger value. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem more carefully. The question is about the uncertainty in energy due to the uncertainty in position. The minimal uncertainty in energy would be the minimal possible value based on the Heisenberg principle.

An alternative approach is to think about the kinetic energy and its uncertainty. The kinetic energy is E = p²/(2m), so the uncertainty in E can be written as ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m). Wait, but that would be the case if the uncertainty in p is small compared to p itself. Because then, the relative uncertainty in E would be approximately twice the relative uncertainty in p.

But perhaps the correct approach is to use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for energy and time, but that's a different approach.

Wait, another thought: the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle between energy and time is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. But in this problem, we don't have a time uncertainty. So perhaps that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for similar problems or standard approaches.

I recall that the minimum uncertainty in energy can be found using the uncertainty in momentum. Since E = p²/(2m), the change in E would be (p + Δp)^2/(2m) - p²/(2m) = (2p Δp + (Δp)^2)/(2m).

But the minimum uncertainty would correspond to the case where this is minimized, which I think occurs when p is as small as possible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the minimum uncertainty in E is given by the derivative approach.

Wait, another approach: The variance in E is given by ⟨E²⟩ - ⟨E⟩². Since E = p²/(2m), ⟨E²⟩ = ⟨p^4⟩/(4m²).

But ⟨p^4⟩ can be expressed in terms of (⟨p²⟩)^2 and terms involving Δp. But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should just stick with the approach that gives an order of magnitude close to one of the options.

But given the two methods I tried earlier, one gives me 1e-16 J (option D) and the other 1e-19 J (option C). Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me recheck the calculation.

First approach: ΔE = (p/m) * Δp.

p = m v = 9.1e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 1.82e-22 kg m/s.

Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = 1.05e-34 / (2e-10) )= 5.25e-25 kg m/s.

(p/m) = (1.82e-22) / (9.1e-31) ) = (1.82 /9.1 ) * 1e9 = approximately 0.2 *1e9 = 2e8.

So, (p/m) * Δp = 2e8 * 5.25e-25 = 1.05e-16 J.

What about the second approach: ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m).

(5.25e-25)^2 = 2.756e-49.

Divide by (2m) = 1.82e-30.

2.756e-49 / 1.82e-30 = 1.516e-19 J.

But which formula is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the standard uncertainty formula. For a function f(x) = x², the uncertainty in f is given by the square root of ( (df/dx)^2 (Δx)^2 ) ), which is |df/dx| * Δx. So, in this case, E = p²/(2m), so dE/dp = p/m. So ΔE = (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, this uses the actual value of p, which might not be appropriate because we're dealing with uncertainties. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the derivative multiplied by the relative uncertainty in p.

Wait, the relative uncertainty in E would be approximately (dE/dp) * (Δp / p) ) = (p/m) * (Δp / p) ) = Δp / m.

Wait, that would make ΔE = E * (Δp/m).

But E is p²/(2m), so ΔE = (p²/(2m)) * (Δp/m) ) = p² Δp / (2 m²).

Hmm, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way to find the uncertainty in E is to compute the root mean square deviation, which would involve (Δp)^2/(2m).

But without knowing the exact statistical distribution, it's a bit tricky. However, in most basic problems like this, the approach taken is to use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to find Δp, then relate that to ΔE using E = p²/(2m), considering the uncertainty in p.

Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to use ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m). Because in this case, the energy depends quadratically on p, so the uncertainty in E would scale with the square of the uncertainty in p.

So, using that approach, I get ΔE ≈ 1.5e-19 J, which is option C.

But wait, another consideration: the electron's speed is given. So, perhaps we can compute the momentum p, and then find the relative uncertainty in p, and then find the relative uncertainty in E, and then find ΔE.

The actual momentum p is m v = 9.1e-31 * 2e8 = 1.82e-22 kg m/s.

The uncertainty in p is Δp = 5.25e-25 kg m/s.

So, relative uncertainty in p is Δp / p = (5.25e-25)/(1.82e-22) ) ≈ 0.02885, or about 2.885%.

Then, the relative uncertainty in E would be approximately twice the relative uncertainty in p, since E is proportional to p squared. So relative ΔE is approximately 2 * 2.885% = 5.77%.

So, the absolute ΔE would be 5.77% of E.

Earlier, I calculated E as 1.82e-14 J.

So, ΔE ≈ 0.0577 * 1.82e-14 = approx 1.05e-15 J.

Wait, that's 1e-15 J, which isn't among the options. Hmm, this approach gives a different answer again.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to find a different way. Perhaps I can look up a similar problem or formula.

Wait, I found a formula in my notes: the uncertainty in energy is given by ΔE ≈ ħ * (v)/(Δx), but I'm not entirely sure where that comes from.

Wait, let's go back to the beginning. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2.

So, Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx).

Then, since E = p²/(2m), the uncertainty in E, ΔE, is approximately (Δp)^2/(2m).

So, substituting:

ΔE ≈ ( (ħ/(2Δx)) )² / (2m) )

Let me compute this.

ħ = 1.05e-34 J·s.

Δx = 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m.

So,

ΔE ≈ ( (1.05e-34 / (2 *1e-10) )^2 ) / (2 *9.1e-31 )

Compute the numerator first:

(1.05e-34 / 2e-10 ) = (1.05e-34 ) / (2e-10 ) = (1.05 /2 ) * 1e-24 = 0.525e-24 = 5.25e-25.

Square that: (5.25e-25)^2 = 2.756e-49.

Divide by denominator 2*9.1e-31 = 1.82e-30.

So, ΔE = 2.756e-49 / 1.82e-30 ≈ 1.516e-19 J.

So that's about 1.5e-19 J, which is option C.

So, I think this approach is correct. Therefore, the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait another moment: in some derivations, the formula is ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m), which we've used. So, the answer should be around 1e-19 J, which is option C.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron traveling with speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and an uncertainty in position \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between momentum and energy.

### Step 1: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states:
\[
\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]
where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.0546 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Rearranging for \( \Delta p \), we get:
\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
\]
Substituting \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \):
\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{1.0546 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 5.273 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Relating Momentum Uncertainty to Energy Uncertainty
The kinetic energy of the electron is given by:
\[
E = \frac{p^2}{2m},
\]
where \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \). The uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) can be approximated as:
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m}.
\]
Substituting \( \Delta p = 5.273 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \) and \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \):
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(5.273 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculation
First, calculate \( (\Delta p)^2 \):
\[
(\Delta p)^2 = (5.273 \times 10^{-25})^2 \approx 2.78 \times 10^{-49}.
\]
Next, calculate the denominator:
\[
2m = 2 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \approx 1.822 \times 10^{-30}.
\]
Finally, divide:
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{2.78 \times 10^{-49}}{1.822 \times 10^{-30}} \approx 1.53 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 4: Final Answer
The minimum uncertainty in the energy is approximately \( 1.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option **C**.

ANSWER: C
