Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the power radiated in different directions and the dependence on wavelength. 

Alright, the setup is an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis.

The question is asking two things: first, what fraction of the maximum power A is radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and second, what the possible form of f is in terms of lambda.

I remember that for a dipole radiator, the power pattern is a function of theta. The radiation from a dipole is maximum at theta = 90 degrees, and it falls off as you move towards theta = 0 or 180. The power pattern usually looks like a cosine squared term or something similar.

Wait, the power per unit solid angle for an oscillating dipole is proportional to (sin^2 theta) or maybe (cos^2 theta). Let me think. Oh right, the radiation pattern for a dipole is given by the formula P proportional to (sin theta)^2, but wait, no—I think it's actually (sin theta)^2, but when you integrate over solid angle, you have to consider the sin theta term from the spherical coordinates.

Wait, no, the radiation pattern for a dipole in the far zone is given by the formula:

dP/dOmega proportional to ( (1)/(r^2) ) * ( (2 p sin theta) / (lambda c) )^2 * sin theta d(theta) d(phi)

Wait, maybe I should recall the exact expression. The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by the formula:

P = ( ( ( ( p^2 omega^2 sin^2 theta ) ) / ( 6 pi epsilon_0 c^3 ) ) )

But wait, that's the power per unit solid angle? Or is that the total power? Hmm, probably the total, because integrating over all solid angles would give the total power.

Wait, no, the total power radiated by a dipole is (p^2 omega^4)/(12 pi epsilon_0 c^3), I think. So the power per unit solid angle would be that divided by 4 pi (since solid angle is 4 pi steradians), but that's not the case because the direction is considered. 

Alternatively, the power per unit solid angle (dP) is proportional to sin^2 theta, because the radiation pattern for a dipole is maximum at theta = 90 degrees (sin theta = 1), and zero at theta = 0 and 180 degrees.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The dipole's radiation is such that the electric field in the far zone is proportional to (sin theta) * e^{i(kr - omega t)}, so the intensity (which is power per unit area per unit solid angle) depends on the square of the electric field. So the intensity should be proportional to sin^2 theta.

So dP = (something) * sin^2 theta dOmega. Since dOmega is sin theta dtheta dphi, the total power would be integral of dP over all theta and phi. But here, the question is about the radiated power per unit solid angle, so that should be f(theta) = sin^2 theta.

Wait, but the problem states that function f is a function of lambda and theta. So f is the power per unit solid angle, which depends on theta and lambda. But why lambda?

Because the wavelength lambda is related to the frequency. The function might also depend on the radiation resistance or something else. Wait, the power in the radiation zone also depends on the square of the amplitude of the oscillation, but for this problem, the maximum power is given as A, so perhaps the dependence on lambda comes into play through the radiation pattern.

Wait, no, the function f is the power per unit solid angle, so it's a function of theta and lambda. For a dipole radiator, the intensity is inversely proportional to lambda^4 because intensity goes as (E)^2, and E goes as (p sin theta)/(lambda r), so E^2 is p^2 sin^2 theta / (lambda² r²). Then, intensity (power per unit area) is E^2 c, so it's proportional to p² sin² theta / (lambda^2 r²) * c. But wait, when considering the power per unit solid angle, I think that's dP = (E^2 c) * sin theta dtheta dphi, so that would be proportional to (1/lambda^2) * sin^3 theta.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, another approach: The power radiated by a dipole is given by P = ( (p^2 omega^4 ) / (12 pi epsilon_0 c^3) ). Now, we can express p in terms of charge and displacement. But more importantly, the function f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle. So f(theta) = (dP/dOmega) = (P) / (4 pi) ) * sin^2 theta. Because the total power is P, and the maximum occurs when sin^2 theta is maximum, which is 1 at theta = 90. At any other angle, the power fraction is (sin^2 theta max) / (sin^2 theta at that angle). Wait, no, wait. The maximum power per unit solid angle is sin^2 theta maximum, which is 1, so the maximum f(theta) is (P/(4 pi)) * 1. So at theta=30 degrees, the fraction is (sin^2 30) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Wait, but the question is: what fraction of A is radiated at theta=30 degrees? So the maximum power is A, so the fraction at 30 degrees is (f(30)/f(max)).

Wait, let me clarify. The function f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle. At each direction, the power is f(theta) dOmega. The maximum f(theta) occurs at theta where f(theta) is maximum. So the maximum power per unit solid angle is when sin^2 theta is maximum, which is 1 (theta=90), but that's the direction where the power is highest.

Wait, but the problem states that the maximum power radiated is A. So the maximum of f(theta) is A/(4 pi)? Or wait, no, because A is the maximum power. Wait, the maximum power occurs when the function f(theta) is maximum, which is when sin^2 theta is 1. So the maximum of dP/dOmega is A. So when you integrate over all solid angles, you get the total power. But wait, that can't be, because the integral of dP/dOmega over all solid angles would give the total power, which would be the sum over all angles. So if A is the maximum dP/dOmega, then the total power would be the integral of f(theta) dOmega, which would be the sum over all directions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently.

The function f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle. So the total power emitted is the integral of f(theta) over all solid angles. The maximum value of f(theta) is A, so that's the maximum power per unit solid angle.

So, for a dipole, f(theta) is proportional to sin^2 theta. So the maximum occurs at theta=90 degrees, where f(theta)=A. At theta=30 degrees, sin theta=1/2, so sin^2 theta is 1/4. Therefore, the fraction of A at theta=30 degrees is (1/4) * A.

Wait, but wait. The function f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle, and the maximum is A. So when theta=90, f(theta)=A. At theta=30, f(theta)=A * (sin^2 30)/(sin^2 90) ) = A * (1/4)/(1) ) = A/4.

But but, the question is asking for the fraction of the maximum power that is radiated at theta=30. So if A is the maximum, then at theta=30, the power per unit solid angle is A/4. But since the solid angle is a function of direction, the total power in a particular direction is f(theta) multiplied by the solid angle element. No, wait, the f(theta) is per unit solid angle. So the power in a small solid angle dOmega around theta=30 is f(theta) dOmega. So the fraction of A that is radiated at theta=30 is f(30) dOmega / A.

Wait, no. A is the maximum power per unit solid angle. So the maximum power per unit solid angle is A. So for any other angle, the power per unit solid angle is f(theta)=A * (sin^2 theta)/(sin^2 90) )= A * sin^2 theta. So at theta=30, f(theta)= A/4.

But wait, the question's first part is: the fraction of A that will be radiated at theta=30. So since f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle, the total power in that direction would depend on the solid angle. Wait, no, wait—no, because the power per unit solid angle at theta=30 is A/4. So the power radiated in a certain solid angle dOmega is (A/4) * dOmega. So the maximum is A * dOmega', where dOmega' is the solid angle that gives the maximum. But this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum power is when theta=90, and the fraction at theta=30 is (sin^2 30)/(sin^2 90) ) = (1/4)/1 = 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4.

Now, the second part is about the form of f. What's the dependence on lambda?

In the dipole radiation, the intensity (power per unit area) is proportional to (1/lambda^4) because the electric field strength E is proportional to (p sin theta)/(lambda r), and intensity is proportional to E^2 c. So E^2 is proportional to p^2 sin^2 theta / lambda^2 r^2, and multiplied by c gives p^2 sin^2 theta c/(lambda^2 r^2). But since we are in the radiation zone, r is large, but the function f is per unit solid angle, which is per steradian, which is a dimensionless quantity.

Wait, but the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So f(theta) should have units of power per steradian. Let me think about the dimensions. Power is energy per time, so [f] = [P/(solid angle)] = [W sr^{-1}].

Considering the dipole formula, the power P for a dipole is (p^2 omega^4)/(12 pi epsilon_0 c^3). So the power per unit solid angle is P/(4 pi) (since 4 pi is the total solid angle), but that's just a constant factor.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the dependence on lambda. Since in dipole radiation, the intensity (which is power per unit area per unit solid angle) is proportional to (1/lambda^4). So the power per unit solid angle would be proportional to (1/lambda^4) multiplied by sin^2 theta.

Wait, but no, the intensity is power per unit area, which is (E^2 c)/ (something). Alternatively, the power per unit solid angle would be the intensity multiplied by the area per solid angle, which is r^2 for a sphere of radius r. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, the power is P = ∫ (dP/dOmega) dOmega. So each dP is (dP/dOmega) dOmega. So if f(theta) = dP/dOmega, then the dependence of f on lambda would be important.

Wait, for a dipole, the electric field in the far zone is E ∝ (p sin theta)/(lambda r). So the intensity (power per unit area) is proportional to E² c, which is (p² sin² theta)/(lambda² r²) ) * c.

But the power per unit solid angle is (intensity) multiplied by the area per unit solid angle. The area on a sphere for a given solid angle is r² dOmega. So the power per unit solid angle is (intensity) * r² dOmega / dOmega = intensity * r². Wait, that doesn't make sense because the intensity is already power per area, so power per unit solid angle would be intensity multiplied by the area per solid angle, which is r² dOmega. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the Poynting vector. The power passing through a unit area perpendicular to the direction of propagation is S, the intensity. The power through a ring at angle theta would be S multiplied by the area of the ring, which is 2 pi r^2 sin theta dtheta. So the power per unit solid angle (dP/dOmega) would be S multiplied by r^2 sin theta dtheta * (dphi) ) / (sin theta dtheta dphi) ) = S r^2.

But that's probably not the right approach. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the power per unit solid angle. The Poynting vector magnitude is S = (E × H), and in the far zone, it's proportional to (1/r^2). So the power per unit solid angle (dP/dOmega) would be S multiplied by the area per solid angle, which is r² dOmega. So since S is proportional to 1/r², then dP/dOmega is proportional to (1/r²) * r² = 1. Wait, but that can't be right because I know the intensity varies with theta.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up concepts. Let me try another approach. The dipole's radiated power pattern is given by P(theta) proportional to sin² theta. So the function f(theta) is proportional to sin² theta. But the question is, how does f depend on lambda?

From the dipole radiation formulas, the power radiated is proportional to (omega^4 p^2)/(c^3). So the total power is proportional to 1/lambda^4, since omega = 2 pi c / lambda. So omega^4 is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

But the function f is the power per unit solid angle, which is the total power (proportional to 1/lambda^4) multiplied by the angular component.

Wait, so f(theta) would be (1/lambda^4) multiplied by sin^2 theta, but only for a dipole. So the form of f would be proportional to sin^2 theta / lambda^4.

But looking at the options, the function f's dependence on lambda is either lambda^-4, lambda^-3, etc. So the function f includes the lambda dependence. So for each theta, f(theta) is proportional to (1/lambda^4) multiplied by sin^2 theta. So the function f would go as lambda^-4.

So the two parts of the question: the fraction at theta=30 is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to lambda^-4. 

Looking at the options:

Option C says 1/4 and lambda^-4. So the answer should be option C.

The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution in the shape of a spheroid, with symmetry along the z-axis, radiating at a wavelength $\lambda$. The radiated power per unit solid angle is a function $f(\lambda, \theta)$, and the maximum power radiated is $A$. The goal is to determine the fraction of $A$ radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ and the form of $f(\lambda, \theta)$.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Radiation Pattern and Power Fraction**:  
   For a dipole radiator, the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to $\sin^2 \theta$. The maximum power per unit solid angle occurs at $\theta = 90^\circ$, where $\sin^2 \theta = 1$. At $\theta = 30^\circ$, $\sin^2 \theta = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$. Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power $A$ radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is $1/4$.

2. **Dependence of $f$ on $\lambda$**:  
   The total power radiated by a dipole is proportional to $\omega^4 / \lambda^4$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency. Since the power per unit solid angle $f(\lambda, \theta)$ includes this dependence on $\lambda$, and also depends on $\sin^2 \theta$, the function $f(\lambda, \theta)$ is proportional to $\lambda^{-4} \sin^2 \theta$. Thus, the power per unit solid angle decreases as $\lambda^{-4}$.

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   From the analysis, the fraction of $A$ radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is $1/4$, and the function $f(\lambda, \theta)$ is proportional to $\lambda^{-4}$. This matches **Option C**.

### Conclusion:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is $1/4$, and the function $f(\lambda, \theta)$ scales as $\lambda^{-4}$.

Wait, no, the radiation pattern for a dipole in the far zone is given by the formula:

dP/dOmega proportional to ( (1)/(r^2) ) * ( (2 p sin theta) / (lambda c) )^2 * sin theta d(theta) d(phi)

Wait, maybe I should recall the exact expression. The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by the formula:

P = ( ( ( ( p^2 omega^2 sin^2 theta ) ) / ( 6 pi epsilon_0 c^3 ) ) )

But wait, that's the power per unit solid angle? Or is that the total power? Hmm, probably the total, because integrating over all solid angles would give the total power.

For a dipole radiator, the intensity is inversely proportional to lambda^4 because intensity goes as (E)^2, and E goes as (p sin theta)/(lambda r), so E^2 is p^2 sin^2 theta / (lambda² r²). Then, intensity (power per unit area) is E^2 c, so it's proportional to p² sin² theta / (lambda^2 r²) * c. But wait, when considering the power per unit solid angle, I think that's dP = (E^2 c) * sin theta dtheta dphi, so that would be proportional to (1/lambda^2) * sin^3 theta.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, another approach: The power radiated by a dipole is given by P = ( (p^2 omega^4 ) / (12 pi epsilon_0 c^3) ). Now, we can express p in terms of charge and displacement. But more importantly, the function f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle. So f(theta) = (dP/dOmega) = (P) / (4 pi) ) * sin^2 theta. Because the total power is P, and the maximum occurs when sin^2 theta is maximum, which is 1 at theta = 90. At any other angle, the power fraction is (sin^2 theta max) / (sin^2 theta at that angle). Wait, no, wait. The maximum power per unit solid angle is sin^2 theta maximum, which is 1, so the maximum f(theta) is (P/(4 pi)) * 1. So at theta=30 degrees, the fraction is (sin^2 30) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Wait, but the question is: what fraction of A is radiated at theta=30 degrees? So the maximum power is A, so the fraction at 30 degrees is (f(30)/f(max)).

Wait, let me clarify. The function f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle. At each direction, the power is f(theta) dOmega. The maximum f(theta) occurs at theta where f(theta) is maximum. So the maximum power per unit solid angle is when sin^2 theta is maximum, which is 1 (theta=90), but that's the direction where the power is highest.

Wait, but the problem states that the maximum power radiated is A. So the maximum of f(theta) is A/(4 pi)? Or wait, no, because A is the maximum power. Wait, the maximum power occurs when the function f(theta) is maximum, which is when sin^2 theta is 1. So the maximum of dP/dOmega is A. So when you integrate over all solid angles, you get the total power. But wait, that can't be, because the integral of dP/dOmega over all solid angles would give the total power, which would be the sum over all angles. So if A is the maximum dP/dOmega, then the total power would be the integral of f(theta) dOmega, which would be the sum over all directions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently.

The function f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle. So the total power emitted is the integral of f(theta) over all solid angles. The maximum value of f(theta) is A, so that's the maximum power per unit solid angle.

So, for a dipole, f(theta) is proportional to sin^2 theta. So the maximum occurs at theta=90 degrees, where f(theta)=A. At theta=30 degrees, sin theta=1/2, so sin^2 theta is 1/4. Therefore, the fraction of A at theta=30 degrees is (1/4) * A.

Wait, but wait. The function f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle, and the maximum is A. So when theta=90, f(theta)=A. At theta=30, f(theta)=A * (sin^2 30)/(sin^2 90) ) = A * (1/4)/(1) ) = A/4.

So since f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle, the total power in that direction would depend on the solid angle. Wait, no, wait—no, because the power per unit solid angle at theta=30 is A/4. So the power radiated in a certain solid angle dOmega is (A/4) * dOmega. So the maximum is A * dOmega', where dOmega' is the solid angle that gives the maximum. But this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum power is when theta=90, and the fraction at theta=30 is (sin^2 30)/(sin^2 90) ) = (1/4)/1 = 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4.

Now, the second part is about the form of f. What's the dependence on lambda?

In the dipole radiation, the intensity (power per unit area) is proportional to (1/lambda^4) because the electric field strength E is proportional to (p sin theta)/(lambda r), and intensity is proportional to E^2 c. So E^2 is proportional to p^2 sin^2 theta / lambda^2 r^2, and multiplied by c gives p^2 sin^2 theta c/(lambda^2 r^2). But since we are in the radiation zone, r is large, but the function f is per unit solid angle, which is per steradian, which is a dimensionless quantity.

Wait, but the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So f(theta) should have units of power per steradian. Let me think about the dimensions. Power is energy per time, so [f] = [P/(solid angle)] = [W sr^{-1}].

Considering the dipole formula, the power P for a dipole is (p^2 omega^4)/(12 pi epsilon_0 c^3). So the power per unit solid angle is P/(4 pi) (since 4 pi is the total solid angle), but that's just a constant factor.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the dependence on lambda. Since in dipole radiation, the intensity (which is power per unit area per unit solid angle) is proportional to (1/lambda^4). So the power per unit solid angle would be proportional to (1/lambda^4) multiplied by sin^2 theta.

Wait, but no, the intensity is power per unit area, which is (E^2 c)/ (something). Alternatively, the power per unit solid angle would be the intensity multiplied by the area per solid angle, which is r^2 for a sphere of radius r. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, the power is P = ∫ (dP/dOmega) dOmega. So each dP is (dP/dOmega) dOmega. So if f(theta) = dP/dOmega, then the dependence of f on lambda would be important.

Wait, for a dipole, the electric field in the far zone is E ∝ (p sin theta)/(lambda r). So the intensity (power per unit area) is proportional to E² c, which is (p² sin² theta)/(lambda² r²) ) * c.

But the power per unit solid angle is (intensity) multiplied by the area per unit solid angle. The area on a sphere for a given solid angle is r² dOmega. So the power per unit solid angle is (intensity) * r² dOmega / dOmega = intensity * r². Wait, that doesn't make sense because the intensity is already power per area, so power per unit solid angle would be intensity multiplied by the area per solid angle, which is r² dOmega. Wait, I'm getting confused.

The power through a ring at angle theta would be S multiplied by the area of the ring, which is 2 pi r^2 sin theta dtheta. So the power per unit solid angle (dP/dOmega) would be S multiplied by r^2 sin theta dtheta * (dphi) ) / (sin theta dtheta dphi) ) = S r^2.

But that's probably not the right approach. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the power per unit solid angle. The Poynting vector magnitude is S = (E × H), and in the far zone, it's proportional to (1/r^2). So the power per unit solid angle (dP/dOmega) would be S multiplied by the area per solid angle, which is r² dOmega. So since S is proportional to 1/r², then dP/dOmega is proportional to (1/r²) * r² = 1. Wait, but that can't be right because I know the intensity varies with theta.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up concepts. Let me try another approach. The dipole's radiated power pattern is given by P(theta) proportional to sin² theta. So the function f(theta) is proportional to sin² theta. But the question is, how does f depend on lambda?

From the dipole radiation formulas, the power radiated is proportional to (omega^4 p^2)/(c^3). So the total power is proportional to 1/lambda^4, since omega = 2 pi c / lambda. So omega^4 is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

But the function f is the power per unit solid angle, which is the total power (proportional to 1/lambda^4) multiplied by the angular component.

Wait, so f(theta) would be (1/lambda^4) multiplied by sin^2 theta, but only for a dipole. So the form of f would be proportional to sin^2 theta / lambda^4.

But looking at the options, the function f's dependence on lambda is either lambda^-4, lambda^-3, etc. So the function f includes the lambda dependence. So for each theta, f(theta) is proportional to (1/lambda^4) multiplied by sin^2 theta. So the function f would go as lambda^-4.

So the two parts of the question: the fraction at theta=30 is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to lambda^-4. 

Looking at the options:

Option C says 1/4 and lambda^-4. So the answer should be option C.
