Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, which is SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators, but it has to respect certain symmetries.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what's the deal with each symmetry here. Let's think one by one.

Lorentz Symmetry: Well, the Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory. SMEFT is an effective theory that should maintain Lorentz symmetry because it's built from the SM. So any operator in SMEFT must transform in a way that's consistent with Lorentz. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected. So option 1 is correct.

Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it's usually built in a way that respects Poincare. But wait, does every operator in SMEFT have to respect Poincare? I think the effective theory is Poincare-invariant, so operators should respect it as well. So option 2 might be correct.

Wait, but wait. In SMEFT, the operators are typically constructed to be renormalizable? No, wait, SMEFT is non-renormalizable and includes higher-dimensional terms. But regardless, the theory as a whole is Poincare invariant. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, another thought. Sometimes, when you have higher-dimensional operators, perhaps they could involve terms that break Poincare? No, because the effective theory is supposed to be Lorentz and Poincare invariant. So I think 1 and 2 are both required.

CP symmetry: Now, the Standard Model is not CP symmetric. For example, there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So the SMEFT can include operators that violate CP because the SM itself does. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not required to be respected by all operators. So 3 is out.

CPT symmetry: The Standard Model is CPT symmetric. So the effective theory should also be CPT symmetric. Therefore, all operators must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

Wait, but wait again. Some theories may not respect CPT if they have certain terms. But SMEFT is an effective theory built upon the SM, which is CPT preserving. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT. So 4 is a must.

So putting it together: which symmetries are required for all operators?

1. Lorentz: Yes

2. Poincare: Yes

3. CP: No

4. CPT: Yes

So the required are 1, 2, and 4. So looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4 which is correct. 

Wait, but wait another point. Poincare symmetry includes translations, which are part of the symmetry. So does every operator in SMEFT respect translation symmetry? Well, I think all the operators are local, so they should respect translation invariance. So that's part of Poincare symmetry, so 2 is correct.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. Looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model that incorporates higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect certain symmetries, which are dictated by the structure of the Standard Model and the principles of effective field theory.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. This makes option 1 correct.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it is typically constructed to respect Poincaré symmetry. All operators in SMEFT must respect translation invariance, as they are local operators. Thus, Poincaré symmetry is also required, making option 2 correct.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model itself is not CP-symmetric due to phenomena like CP violation in the CKM matrix. Consequently, SMEFT operators do not need to respect CP symmetry. Therefore, option 3 is incorrect.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model is CPT-symmetric, and SMEFT, being an effective theory built upon the Standard Model, must also respect CPT symmetry. Thus, option 4 is correct.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) 1,2,4**
