Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these buffer solution and ion concentration questions. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says that we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, which I think is just standard conditions, so that's fine.

Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but wait, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. Since we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, this is probably a buffer solution. KH2PO4 is the acid (it can donate a proton), and Na2HPO4 is the conjugate base. So the buffer is between H2PO4^- (the acid) and HPO4^2- (the conjugate base), right? But wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-.

Wait, the phosphate ion PO4^3- is the deprotonated form. But in a buffer solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because the pH is usually around there. So how do we get PO4^3-? Well, maybe some of the HPO4^2- will deprotonate further, but that depends on the pH of the solution.

So first, I think I need to find the pH of the buffer solution. Because once I know the pH, I can determine how much HPO4^2- is deprotonated into PO4^3-.

Wait, but the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So to find the pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). The relevant pKa here is Ka2, because H2PO4^- donates a proton to become HPO4^2-.

Ka2 for H3PO4 is given as 6.2e-8. So pKa2 would be -log(6.2e-8). Let me calculate that. Log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 0.79 -7 is 7.21? Wait, no. Wait, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8. So the log is log(6.2) + log(1e-8). Log(6.2)=0.792, so 0.792 + (-8) = -7.208. So pKa2 is 7.208. So that's the pKa for the H2PO4^- / HPO4^2- system.

Now, I need to find the concentrations of the acid (H2PO4^-) and the base (HPO4^2-). Since the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, the amounts of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can be determined from their moles.

So let's calculate the moles of each.

First, the molar masses are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = approximately 0.00734 moles. Let me compute it more exactly: 1 divided by 136.09 is about 0.00734 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = about 0.00561 moles. Let me compute that: 1/177.99 is approximately 0.00561 mol.

So moles of H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) = 0.00734 mol. Moles of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4) = 0.00561 mol.

Wait, but wait a second. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-. Similarly, Na2HPO4 (the anhydrous form) dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. But the formula given is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is the same as the anhydrous, but with two water molecules. So the moles of HPO4^2- are the same as moles of the compound used, which is 0.00561 mol.

So now, the volume is 0.2 L. So concentrations in the solution would be:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, 0.00734 divided by 0.2 is 0.0367 M. Hmm, and 0.00561 / 0.2 is 0.02805 M. So now, plug these into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) = 7.208 + log(0.02805 / 0.0367).

Let me compute the ratio: 0.02805 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.765. So log(0.765) is about -0.115. So pH ≈7.208 -0.115 =7.093.

Wait, but wait, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO4^2-, and the acid is H2PO4^-.

So pH is around 7.093.

Now, the next step is to find the concentration of PO4^3- in this solution.

PO4^3- is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-. The deprotonation reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

This reaction is governed by Ka3, which is given as 1.8e-12. So the pKa3 is -log(1.8e-12). Let me compute that. Log(1.8)=0.2553, so 0.2553 -12 = -11.7447; so pKa3 is 11.7447.

Wait, but wait, the pH of the solution is about 7.09, which is lower than pKa3 (11.74). So the solution is acidic relative to pKa3. That means that the deprotonation to PO4^3- will be minimal. Because when pH < pKa, the acid form (HPO4^2-) is favored, and the conjugate base (PO4^3-) is not.

So the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the expression:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]: [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

We need [HPO4^2-] in solution, which we calculated as 0.02805 M, but wait, wait: in the buffer solution, some of the HPO4^2- will deprotonate to PO4^3-, but because the pH is much lower than pKa3, the amount of PO4^3- will be very small compared to HPO4^2-.

Wait, but let's think about it again. The concentration of HPO4^2- is what's present in the solution, but some of it will react:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

At pH 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3 of 11.74, the H+ concentration is about 1e-7.2 (since pH is 7.09). Let me compute [H+]: 1e-7.09 ≈ 8.3e-8 M.

So putting into the equation:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12,

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M,

[H+] = 8.3e-8.

So:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.3e-8).

Let me compute the numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = approx 5.049e-14.

Then, divide by 8.3e-8: 5.049e-14 / 8.3e-8 = approximately 6.08e-7 M.

Wait, wait, but that's about 6.08e-7 M. But looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate more accurately.

First, compute [HPO4^2-] = 1.00 g Na2HPO4·2H2O divided by 177.99 g/mol. So 1 / 177.99 is about 0.00561 mol. Since the volume is 0.2 L, the concentration is 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.

[H+] is 1e-pH. pH is 7.093, so [H+] is 1e-7.093.

Compute 1e-7.093: 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093). 10^(-7)=1e-7. 10^(-0.093) is about 0.87. So 1e-7 * 0.87 = 8.7e-8 M.

Wait, maybe I should use a calculator. Let me compute 10^-7.093 more accurately.

But perhaps I can use exact values. Let me think.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can use the exact Henderson equation to compute the pH more precisely.

Wait, let me recompute the pH.

The moles of H2PO4^- is 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that: 136.09 is approximately 136.09.

1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.0073365 mol.

Moles of HPO4^2- is 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.0056124 mol.

Concentration [H2PO4^-] = 0.0073365 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.0056124 / 0.2 = 0.02806 M.

So the ratio [base]/[acid] is 0.02806 / 0.03668 ≈ 0.7654.

pH = pKa2 + log(0.7654).

pKa2 is 7.208.

Log(0.7654) ≈ -0.114.

So pH is 7.208 -0.114 =7.094.

So [H+] is 10^(-7.094) ≈ 8.37e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute 10^(-7.094):

7.094 = 7 + 0.094.

10^7 = 1e7, so 10^(-7) is 1e-7.

10^(-0.094) is approximately 10^(-0.09) is about 0.8123, and 0.094 is a bit more.

Wait, 10^(-0.094) ≈ 0.8123 * (since 0.094 is a bit more than 0.09, perhaps 0.81? Let me think: 10^0.09 is about 1.23, so 10^(-0.09) is 1/1.23≈0.813.

But if I compute more accurately, perhaps using log tables or a calculator, but I'll approximate it as 0.812.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.812 ≈ 8.12e-8 M.

Now, back to [PO4^3-].

Ka3 = 1.8e-12 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

Rearranged, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+].

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 =1.8e-12,

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02806,

[H+] =8.12e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806 ) / 8.12e-8.

Let me compute the numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 ≈ 5.0508e-14.

Divide that by 8.12e-8:

5.0508e-14 / 8.12e-8 = approx 6.217e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.22e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So is that the answer?

Wait, but wait a second. I'm being a bit hasty here. Let me double-check all the steps.

Wait, the initial moles: KH2PO4 is 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol = approximately 0.0073365 mol. Correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol = approx 0.0056124 mol. Correct.

Volume is 0.2 L, so concentrations are 0.03668 M and 0.02806 M. Correct.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]).

pKa2 is 7.208. Ratio 0.02806 / 0.03668 = 0.7654.

Log(0.7654) ≈ -0.114. So pH is 7.094. Correct.

[H+] is 1e-7.094 ≈ 8.12e-8. Correct.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / 8.12e-8.

Let me compute that again:

Numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Denominator: 8.12e-8.

So 5.0508e-14 / 8.12e-8 = (5.0508 / 8.12) * 1e-6.

5.0508 /8.12 ≈ 0.6217. So 0.6217e-6 = 6.217e-7 M.

So that comes to about 6.22e-7 M, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7).

But wait, perhaps there are some other factors to consider. For example, the solution's total volume may include the water from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, but I think the problem states the solution's volume is 200 cm³, so that's given and we don't need to adjust for that.

Wait, another thought: when Na2HPO4·2H2O dissolves, it contributes some water, but the problem says the total volume is 200 cm³, so the actual volume is already accounted for.

Another point: The problem asks for orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-, and in this case, it's the concentration from the HPO4^2- deprotonating. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but let me check if any other sources of PO4^3- are present. For example, the KH2PO4 dissociates into H2PO4^-, which can further lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, but under the pH of 7.09, which is lower than pKa2 (7.208), H2PO4^- would tend to donate a proton, but the solution's pH is close to pKa2, so both forms are present in significant amounts. But for PO4^3-, it's from HPO4^2- losing another proton, which is governed by Ka3, which is very small, so the concentration is minimal.

So the calculation seems correct.

Looking back at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is the closest to our calculated 6.22e-7 M.

But wait, another point: when I calculated the ratio, I used the concentrations as 0.02806 and 0.03668. That's correct because those are the concentrations in the buffer solution.

So yeah, the answer should be option A.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each compound, and the volume is 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The relevant dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are Ka₁ = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹². The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each compound
- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol} \)
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00561 \, \text{mol} \)

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations in the solution
- \([ \text{H₂PO₄⁻} ] = \frac{0.00734 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.0367 \, \text{M}\)
- \([ \text{HPO₄²⁻} ] = \frac{0.00561 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.02805 \, \text{M}\)

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with \( \text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208 \). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log \left( \frac{0.02805}{0.0367} \right)
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.208 - 0.115 = 7.093
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻
PO₄³⁻ is formed when HPO₄²⁻ loses a proton, governed by \( \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). The relationship is:

\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

Rearranging for \([ \text{PO₄³⁻} ]\):

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]

The \([\text{H}^+]\) is calculated from the pH:

\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.3 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.3 \times 10^{-8}}
\]

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.05 \times 10^{-14}}{8.3 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.08 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.08 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option A (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these buffer solution and ion concentration questions. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says that we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, which I think is just standard conditions, so that's fine.

Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but wait, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. Since we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, this is probably a buffer solution. KH2PO4 is the acid (it can donate a proton), and Na2HPO4 is the conjugate base. So the buffer is between H2PO4^- (the acid) and HPO4^2- (the conjugate base), right? But wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-.

Wait, the phosphate ion PO4^3- is the deprotonated form. But in a buffer solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because the pH is usually around there. So how do we get PO4^3-? Well, maybe some of the HPO4^2- will deprotonate further, but that depends on the pH of the solution.

So first, I think I need to find the pH of the buffer solution. Because once I know the pH, I can determine how much HPO4^2- is deprotonated into PO4^3-.

Wait, but the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So to find the pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). The relevant pKa here is Ka2, because H2PO4^- donates a proton to become HPO4^2-.

Ka2 for H3PO4 is given as 6.2e-8. So pKa2 would be -log(6.2e-8). Let me calculate that. Log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 0.79 -7 is 7.21? Wait, no. Wait, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8. So the log is log(6.2) + log(1e-8). Log(6.2)=0.792, so 0.792 + (-8) = -7.208. So pKa2 is 7.208. So that's the pKa for the H2PO4^- / HPO4^2- system.

Now, I need to find the concentrations of the acid (H2PO4^-) and the base (HPO4^2-). Since the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, the amounts of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can be determined from their moles.

So let's calculate the moles of each.

First, the molar masses are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = approximately 0.00734 moles. Let me compute it more exactly: 1 divided by 136.09 is about 0.00734 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = about 0.00561 moles. Let me compute that: 1/177.99 is approximately 0.00561 mol.

So moles of H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) = 0.00734 mol. Moles of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4) = 0.00561 mol.

Wait, but wait a second. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-. Similarly, Na2HPO4 (the anhydrous form) dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. But the formula given is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is the same as the anhydrous, but with two water molecules. So the moles of HPO4^2- are the same as moles of the compound used, which is 0.00561 mol.

So now, the volume is 0.2 L. So concentrations in the solution would be:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, 0.00734 divided by 0.2 is 0.0367 M. Hmm, and 0.00561 / 0.2 is 0.02805 M. So now, plug these into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) = 7.208 + log(0.02805 / 0.0367).

Let me compute the ratio: 0.02805 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.765. So log(0.765) is about -0.115. So pH ≈7.208 -0.115 =7.093.

Wait, but wait, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO4^2-, and the acid is H2PO4^-.

So pH is around 7.093.

Now, the next step is to find the concentration of PO4^3- in this solution.

PO4^3- is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-. The deprotonation reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

This reaction is governed by Ka3, which is given as 1.8e-12. So the pKa3 is -log(1.8e-12). Let me compute that. Log(1.8)=0.2553, so 0.2553 -12 = -11.7447; so pKa3 is 11.7447.

Wait, but wait, the pH of the solution is about 7.09, which is lower than pKa3 (11.74). So the solution is acidic relative to pKa3. That means that the deprotonation to PO4^3- will be minimal. Because when pH < pKa, the acid form (HPO4^2-) is favored, and the conjugate base (PO4^3-) is not.

So the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the expression:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]: [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

We need [HPO4^2-] in solution, which we calculated as 0.02805 M, but wait, wait: in the buffer solution, some of the HPO4^2- will deprotonate to PO4^3-, but because the pH is much lower than pKa3, the amount of PO4^3- will be very small compared to HPO4^2-.

Wait, but let's think about it again. The concentration of HPO4^2- is what's present in the solution, but some of it will react:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

At pH 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3 of 11.74, the H+ concentration is about 1e-7.2 (since pH is 7.09). Let me compute [H+]: 1e-7.09 ≈ 8.3e-8 M.

So putting into the equation:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12,

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M,

[H+] = 8.3e-8.

So:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.3e-8).

Let me compute the numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = approx 5.049e-14.

Then, divide by 8.3e-8: 5.049e-14 / 8.3e-8 = approximately 6.08e-7 M.

Wait, wait, but that's about 6.08e-7 M. But looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate more accurately.

First, compute [HPO4^2-] = 1.00 g Na2HPO4·2H2O divided by 177.99 g/mol. So 1 / 177.99 is about 0.00561 mol. Since the volume is 0.2 L, the concentration is 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.

[H+] is 1e-pH. pH is 7.093, so [H+] is 1e-7.093.

Compute 1e-7.093: 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093). 10^(-7)=1e-7. 10^(-0.093) is about 0.87. So 1e-7 * 0.87 = 8.7e-8 M.

Wait, maybe I should use a calculator. Let me compute 10^-7.093 more accurately.

But perhaps I can use exact values. Let me think.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can use the exact Henderson equation to compute the pH more precisely.

Wait, let me recompute the pH.

The moles of H2PO4^- is 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that: 136.09 is approximately 136.09.

1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.0073365 mol.

Moles of HPO4^2- is 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.0056124 mol.

Concentration [H2PO4^-] = 0.0073365 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.0056124 / 0.2 = 0.02806 M.

So the ratio [base]/[acid] is 0.02806 / 0.03668 ≈ 0.7654.

pH = pKa2 + log(0.7654).

pKa2 is 7.208.

Log(0.7654) ≈ -0.114.

So pH is 7.208 -0.114 =7.094.

So [H+] is 10^(-7.094) ≈ 8.37e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute 10^(-7.094):

7.094 = 7 + 0.094.

10^7 = 1e7, so 10^(-7) is 1e-7.

10^(-0.094) is approximately 10^(-0.09) is about 0.8123, and 0.094 is a bit more.

Wait, 10^(-0.094) ≈ 0.8123 * (since 0.094 is a bit more than 0.09, perhaps 0.81? Let me think: 10^0.09 is about 1.23, so 10^(-0.09) is 1/1.23≈0.813.

But if I compute more accurately, perhaps using log tables or a calculator, but I'll approximate it as 0.812.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.812 ≈ 8.12e-8 M.

Now, back to [PO4^3-].

Ka3 = 1.8e-12 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

Rearranged, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+].

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 =1.8e-12,

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02806,

[H+] =8.12e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806 ) / 8.12e-8.

Let me compute the numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 ≈ 5.0508e-14.

Divide that by 8.12e-8:

5.0508e-14 / 8.12e-8 = approx 6.217e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.22e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So is that the answer?

Wait, but wait a second. I'm being a bit hasty here. Let me double-check all the steps.

Wait, the initial moles: KH2PO4 is 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol = approximately 0.0073365 mol. Correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol = approx 0.0056124 mol. Correct.

Volume is 0.2 L, so concentrations are 0.03668 M and 0.02806 M. Correct.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]).

pKa2 is 7.208. Ratio 0.02806 / 0.03668 = 0.7654.

Log(0.7654) ≈ -0.114. So pH is 7.094. Correct.

[H+] is 1e-7.094 ≈ 8.12e-8. Correct.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / 8.12e-8.

Let me compute that again:

Numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Denominator: 8.12e-8.

So 5.0508e-14 / 8.12e-8 = (5.0508 / 8.12) * 1e-6.

5.0508 /8.12 ≈ 0.6217. So 0.6217e-6 = 6.217e-7 M.

So that comes to about 6.22e-7 M, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7).

But wait, perhaps there are some other factors to consider. For example, the solution's total volume may include the water from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, but I think the problem states the solution's volume is 200 cm³, so that's given and we don't need to adjust for that.

Wait, another thought: when Na2HPO4·2H2O dissolves, it contributes some water, but the problem says the total volume is 200 cm³, so the actual volume is already accounted for.

Another point: The problem asks for orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-, and in this case, it's the concentration from the HPO4^2- deprotonating. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but let me check if any other sources of PO4^3- are present. For example, the KH2PO4 dissociates into H2PO4^-, which can further lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, but under the pH of 7.09, which is lower than pKa2 (7.208), H2PO4^- would tend to donate a proton, but the solution's pH is close to pKa2, so both forms are present in significant amounts. But for PO4^3-, it's from HPO4^2- losing another proton, which is governed by Ka3, which is very small, so the concentration is minimal.

So the calculation seems correct.

Looking back at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is the closest to our calculated 6.22e-7 M.

But wait, another point: when I calculated the ratio, I used the concentrations as 0.02806 and 0.03668. That's correct because those are the concentrations in the buffer solution.

So yeah, the answer should be option A.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each compound, and the volume is 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The relevant dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are Ka₁ = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹². The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each compound
- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol} \)
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00561 \, \text{mol} \)

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations in the solution
- \([ \text{H₂PO₄⁻} ] = \frac{0.00734 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.0367 \, \text{M}\)
- \([ \text{HPO₄²⁻} ] = \frac{0.00561 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.02805 \, \text{M}\)

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with \( \text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208 \). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log \left( \frac{0.02805}{0.0367} \right)
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.208 - 0.115 = 7.093
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻
PO₄³⁻ is formed when HPO₄²⁻ loses a proton, governed by \( \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). The relationship is:

\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

Rearranging for \([ \text{PO₄³⁻} ]\):

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]

The \([\text{H}^+]\) is calculated from the pH:

\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.3 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.3 \times 10^{-8}}
\]

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.05 \times 10^{-14}}{8.3 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.08 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.08 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option A (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).
