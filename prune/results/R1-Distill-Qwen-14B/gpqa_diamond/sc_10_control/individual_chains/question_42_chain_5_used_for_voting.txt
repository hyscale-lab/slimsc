Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about exoplanets and their orbital periods. The question gives me some ratios of equilibrium temperatures and masses between three planets, and I need to find the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's. All right, let's break this down.

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star. The formula I think is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4), but wait, actually, the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's temperature, the planet's distance, and the albedo. But in this problem, the albedo is the same for all three planets, so that part cancels out when taking ratios.

The problem states that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. Similarly, T2/T3 is 2.3. So T1/T3 would be (T1/T2) * (T2/T3) )? Wait, no, because T1/T2 is 1.4, and T2/T3 is 2.3, so T1/T3 = T1/T2 * T2/T3 = 1.4 * 2.3. Let me calculate that. 1.4 times 2 is 2.8, and 0.3 times 1.4 is 0.42, so total 3.22. So T1 is about 3.22 times T3? Wait, no, because if T1 is hotter than T2, and T2 is hotter than T3, then T1 must be hotter than T3. So T1/T3 = 3.22, which implies T1 is 3.22 times T3. So T3 is lower than T1 by a factor of about 3.22.

Wait, but equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. Because the formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Since the albedo is the same, and assuming the star's properties are the same for all planets, the equilibrium temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse of the semi-major axis ratio. So T1/T3 = sqrt( a3/a1 )? Or is it sqrt( a1/a3 ) because if the planet is farther (a larger a), it has a lower temperature. So if T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), then T1 / T3 = (a3/a1) ^ (-1/2) = sqrt( a1/a3 ). So inverting that, a3/a1 = (T1/T3)^2. Because if T1 is higher, the planet is closer.

So T1/T3 is approximately 3.22, so (T1/T3)^2 ≈ (3.22)^2 ≈ 10.36. So a3 / a1 = 10.36, meaning the semi-major axis of Planet3 is about 10.36 times that of Planet1. Therefore, the distance of Planet3 is more than an order of magnitude larger than Planet1's.

Now, the orbital period depends on the semi-major axis according to Kepler's third law. The formula is P^2 = (4π²/GM) * a^3. So P is proportional to a^(3/2), assuming the mass of the star is much larger than the planet masses. Wait, but the problem gives mass ratios between planets. Oh, but Kepler's law is for the orbital period of a planet around a star, and the mass of the planet is negligible compared to the star. So when I'm comparing the periods of these planets, the star's mass is constant, so P is proportional to a^(3/2).

Wait, but all three planets are orbiting the same star, right? So each planet's period depends on its semi-major axis. So P1 is the period of Planet1, P3 is the period of Planet3. So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2). From earlier, a3/a1 is about 10.36. So (10.36)^(3/2) is equal to sqrt(10.36^3). Let me compute that.

Wait, 10.36 is the a3/a1 ratio. So let's compute 10.36^(3/2). Alternatively, sqrt(10.36^3). Let me approximate this.

First, 10^3 is 1000. So 10^3 = 1000. 10.36 is about 10.36, so 10.36^3 is approximately (10)^3 + 3*(10)^2*(0.36) + 3*(10)*(0.36)^2 + (0.36)^3. Let's compute that:

10^3 = 1000
3*(10)^2 *0.36 = 3*100 *0.36= 300 *0.36=108
3*(10)*(0.36)^2=30*(0.1296)=3.888
(0.36)^3=0.046656
Adding them up: 1000 + 108 = 1108, +3.888≈1111.888, +0.046656≈1111.934656.

So 10.36^3 ≈ 1111.935. Then the square root of that is sqrt(1111.935). Let me think: 33^2 is 1089, 34^2 is 1156. So sqrt(1111.935) is between 33 and 34. Let's compute 33^2=1089, 33.3^2= (33 +0.3)^2= 33^2 +2*33*0.3 + 0.3^2 = 1089 + 19.8 + 0.09=1108.89. Hmm, but 33.3^2=1108.89. The number we have is 1111.935. So let's see, 33.3^2=1108.89, so the difference is 1111.935 - 1108.89 = 3.045. So let's say 33.3 + x, where x is small. So (33.3 +x)^2 = 1108.89 + 2*33.3*x +x² = 1111.935. We can ignore x² for small x. So 2*33.3 *x ≈3.045. So x≈3.045/(66.6)≈0.04575. So approximate sqrt is 33.3 +0.04575≈33.345. So approx 33.35. So 10.36^(3/2) ≈ 33.35.

So P3/P1 is approximately 33.35. So the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.35 times that of Planet1. Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I forget that the masses come into play somewhere? Because the question gives mass ratios between the planets. Oh, but Kepler's law for each planet depends on the mass of the star, not the planet. Since all planets are orbiting the same star, the star's mass is the same for all. So the planet's mass doesn't affect the orbital period in the Keplerian approximation, as the planet's mass is negligible. So the mass ratios given in the problem (mass of Planet1 vs Planet2, etc.) don't affect the calculation of the orbital periods. So I can ignore those. So the answer is determined solely by the distance ratios, which come from the temperature ratios.

So the factor is approximately 33.4, which is option D.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant physical principles.

### Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature Ratios
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its semi-major axis, assuming the same star and albedo. The problem provides the following temperature ratios:
- \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \)
- \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \)

From these, we calculate:
\[
T_1 / T_3 = (T_1 / T_2) \cdot (T_2 / T_3) = 1.4 \cdot 2.3 = 3.22
\]

Since \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \), the ratio of semi-major axes is:
\[
\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \left(\frac{T_1}{T_3}\right)^2 = (3.22)^2 \approx 10.36
\]

Thus, Planet3's semi-major axis is approximately 10.36 times that of Planet1.

### Step 2: Orbital Period Ratios
Kepler's Third Law states that the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to \( a^{3/2} \), assuming the same star. Therefore:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \( a_3 / a_1 = 10.36 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.36)^{3/2}
\]

To compute \( (10.36)^{3/2} \), we first calculate \( 10.36^3 \):
\[
10.36^3 \approx 1111.935
\]

Then, take the square root:
\[
\sqrt{1111.935} \approx 33.35
\]

Thus, \( P_3 / P_1 \approx 33.35 \), meaning the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.35 times that of Planet1.

### Step 3: Final Answer
The mass ratios provided in the problem are irrelevant to the calculation of orbital periods, as Kepler's law depends only on the semi-major axis and the mass of the star (which is constant for all three planets).

From the options, the closest value to \( 33.35 \) is **Option D (~33.4)**.

Wait, no, because T1/T2 is 1.4, and T2/T3 is 2.3, so T1/T3 = T1/T2 * T2/T3 = 1.4 * 2.3. Let me calculate that. 1.4 times 2 is 2.8, and 0.3 times 1.4 is 0.42, so total 3.22. So T1 is about 3.22 times T3? Wait, no, because if T1 is hotter than T2, and T2 is hotter than T3, then T1 must be hotter than T3. So T1/T3 = 3.22, which implies T1 is 3.22 times T3.

So T1/T3 is approximately 3.22, so (T1/T3)^2 ≈ (3.22)^2 ≈ 10.36. So a3 / a1 = 10.36, meaning the semi-major axis of Planet3 is about 10.36 times that of Planet1. Therefore, the distance of Planet3 is more than an order of magnitude larger than Planet1's.

Wait, 10.36 is the a3/a1 ratio. So let's compute 10.36^(3/2). Alternatively, sqrt(10.36^3). Let me approximate this.

First, 10^3 is 1000. So 10^3 = 1000. 10.36 is about 10.36, so 10.36^3 is approximately (10)^3 + 3*(10)^2*(0.36) + 3*(10)*(0.36)^2 + (0.36)^3. Let's compute that:

10^3 = 1000
3*(10)^2 *0.36 = 3*100 *0.36= 300 *0.36=108
3*(10)*(0.36)^2=30*(0.1296)=3.888
(0.36)^3=0.046656
Adding them up: 1000 + 108 = 1108, +3.888≈1111.888, +0.046656≈1111.934656.

So 10.36^3 ≈ 1111.935. Then the square root of that is sqrt(1111.935). Let me think: 33^2 is 1089, 34^2 is 1156. So sqrt(1111.935) is between 33 and 34. Let's compute 33^2=1089, 33.3^2= (33 +0.3)^2= 33^2 +2*33*0.3 + 0.3^2 = 1089 + 19.8 + 0.09=1108.89. Hmm, but 33.3^2=1108.89. The number we have is 1111.935. So let's see, 33.3^2=1108.89, so the difference is 1111.935 - 1108.89 = 3.045. So let's say 33.3 + x, where x is small. So (33.3 +x)^2 = 1108.89 + 2*33.3*x +x² = 1111.935. We can ignore x² for small x. So 2*33.3 *x ≈3.045. So x≈3.045/(66.6)≈0.04575. So approximate sqrt is 33.3 +0.04575≈33.345. So approx 33.35. So 10.36^(3/2) ≈ 33.35.

So P3/P1 is approximately 33.35. So the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.35 times that of Planet1. Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I forget that the masses come into play somewhere? Because the question gives mass ratios between the planets.

### Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature Ratios
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its semi-major axis, assuming the same star and albedo. The problem provides the following temperature ratios:
- \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \)
- \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \)

From these, we calculate:
\[
T_1 / T_3 = (T_1 / T_2) \cdot (T_2 / T_3) = 1.4 \cdot 2.3 = 3.22
\]

Since \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \), the ratio of semi-major axes is:
\[
\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \left(\frac{T_1}{T_3}\right)^2 = (3.22)^2 \approx 10.36
\]

Thus, Planet3's semi-major axis is approximately 10.36 times that of Planet1.

### Step 2: Orbital Period Ratios
Kepler's Third Law states that the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to \( a^{3/2} \), assuming the same star. Therefore:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \( a_3 / a_1 = 10.36 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.36)^{3/2}
\]

To compute \( (10.36)^{3/2} \), we first calculate \( 10.36^3 \):
\[
10.36^3 \approx 1111.935
\]

Then, take the square root:
\[
\sqrt{1111.935} \approx 33.35
\]

Thus, \( P_3 / P_1 \approx 33.35 \), meaning the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.35 times that of Planet1.

### Step 3: Final Answer
The mass ratios provided in the problem are irrelevant to the calculation of orbital periods, as Kepler's law depends only on the semi-major axis and the mass of the star (which is constant for all three planets).

From the options, the closest value to \( 33.35 \) is **Option D (~33.4)**.
