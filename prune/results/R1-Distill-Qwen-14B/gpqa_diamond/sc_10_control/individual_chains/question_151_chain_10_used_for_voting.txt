Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain value for an observable. Alright, let's read the problem again.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, no, wait, actually, looking again, it's a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a vector in three dimensions. Then, the observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write down what P looks like.

The first row of P is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. The second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]. The third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, okay. So P is a Hermitian matrix because it's an observable, right? Because observables must be Hermitian to have real eigenvalues, which are the possible measurement outcomes.

The problem asks for the probability that the measurement of P yields 0. So, I need to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P on the given state.

Wait, but to find the probability, I think we need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P. Because the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude, which is the inner product of the state vector with the corresponding eigenvector.

But wait, P is the matrix of the observable. So, first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Because the eigenvalues are the possible results of the measurement. So, perhaps 0 is one of the eigenvalues, and the corresponding eigenvector's inner product with the state vector will give the amplitude, and then the probability is the square of that.

But maybe there's another approach. Oh right, alternatively, since the state is given, we can compute the expectation value of P. Wait, no, the question is about the probability of getting 0, not the expectation. So we need to find the eigenvalues and see if 0 is one of them, and then find the eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P is diagonal in some basis, but given its structure, I'm not sure. Let me think about how to find the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λI) = 0.

But I might not have to compute the eigenvalues directly. Wait, what's the structure of P? Let me see:

P looks like this:

Row 1: 0          1/sqrt(2)    0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2)  0           1/sqrt(2)
Row3: 0          1/sqrt(2)    0

Hmm, so it's symmetric, which makes sense because it's Hermitian. Looking at the matrix, perhaps it's a type of Pauli matrix but in three dimensions. Alternatively, maybe I can find eigenvectors by inspection.

Let me try to find the eigenvalues. Let me write the matrix:

P = [[0, a, 0],
     [a, 0, a],
     [0, a, 0]]

where a = 1/sqrt(2).

So, to find the eigenvalues, compute the determinant of (P - λ I) = 0.

The matrix becomes:

[-λ, a, 0]
[a, -λ, a]
[0, a, -λ]

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - a*a ] - a * [a*(-λ) - a*0 ] + 0 * something.

So expanding the determinant:

The determinant is:

-λ [ (λ² - a²) ] - a [ -a λ ] + 0.

Wait, let me compute it step by step. The determinant for a 3x3 matrix:

For row 1, the elements are -λ, a, 0.

So expanding along the first row:

-λ * det( [ [ -λ, a ], [a, -λ ] ] ) - a * det( [ [a, a ], [0, -λ] ] ) + 0 * det(...)

Wait, no. The minor for each element is the determinant of the submatrix when the row and column are excluded.

So for the first term (i=1, j=1), the minor is the submatrix:

[ [ -λ, a ],
  [ a, -λ ] ]

Determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - a*a = λ² - a².

Multiply by (-λ) and by (-1)^(1+1)=1. So term1: (-λ) * (λ² - a²) * 1.

Second term (i=1, j=2): element is a. The minor is submatrix when row 1 and column 2 are removed.

Which is:

Row 2 and 3, column 1 and 3.

So the minor matrix is:

[ [ a, a ],
  [ 0, -λ ] ]

Determinant is a*(-λ) - a*0 = -a λ.

Multiply by a * (-1)^(1+2) = (-1)^3 = -1.

So term2: a * (-a λ) * (-1) ? Wait, let me be careful.

The expansion is sum_{j=1 to 3} [ M[1,j] * (-1)^(1+j) * det(minor) ]

So for j=1: element is -λ, (-1)^(1+1)=1, determinant is λ² -a².

j=2: element a, (-1)^(1+2)= -1, minor determinant is (a*(-λ) - a*0) = -a λ.

j=3: element 0, so term is zero.

So the determinant is:

(-λ)(λ² - a²) * 1 + a*(-a λ)*(-1) + 0.

Wait, let's compute each part:

First term: (-λ)(λ² - a²) * 1 → (-λ)(λ² - a²) = -λ^3 + λ a².

Second term: a * (-a λ) * (-1) → a * (-aλ) * (-1) = a^2 λ.

So determinant = (-λ^3 + λ a²) + a^2 λ = -λ^3 + 2 λ a².

Set determinant to zero: -λ^3 + 2λ a² =0.

Factor λ: λ (-λ² + 2 a² ) =0.

So solutions: λ=0, and (-λ² + 2a²)=0 → λ²=2 a² → λ=±a*√2.

But a is 1/sqrt(2), so a*sqrt(2)= (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) )=1.

So eigenvalues are λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

Ah, so 0 is an eigenvalue. So the possible outcomes include 0. So the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0.

Now, I need to find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

So for P - 0 I = P, so we have (P) |v> =0.

So the system is:

0 x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0 z = 0 → (1) (1/sqrt(2)) y =0 → y=0.

Second equation: (1/sqrt(2)) x + 0 y + (1/sqrt(2)) z =0 → (1/sqrt(2)) (x + z) )=0 → x + z=0 → x= -z.

Third equation: 0 x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0 z =0 → same as first equation, y=0.

So the eigenvectors must satisfy y=0 and x= -z.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (x, 0, -x) = x (1,0,-1). So any scalar multiple of (1,0,-1) is an eigenvector for λ=0.

Wait, but wait, let me check: Let me plug in the vector (1,0,-1) into the equation P v = λ v. Since λ is zero, P v should be zero.

Compute P v:

P is the matrix:

Row 1: 0, a, 0 → [0*1 + a*0 +0*(-1)] = 0.

Row 2: a, 0, a → a*1 + 0*0 +a*(-1) → a (1 -1 )=0.

Row3: 0, a,0 → 0*1 + a*0 +0*(-1) =0.

So yes, P v =0 for v=(1,0,-1), which is correct.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, 0, -1).

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are usually normalized. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, the vector (1,0,-1) has length sqrt(1 +0 +1) = sqrt(2). So when normalized, each component is divided by sqrt(2).

So the eigenvector |v0> corresponding to λ=0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, but wait, the given state is (-1, 2, 1). So as a column vector, it's [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Wait, the state vector is given as a column vector. So to compute the amplitude, we compute the inner product of the state vector with the eigenvector |v0>.

But wait, the state vector given is [ -1, 2,1 ]^T, which is a column vector. So the inner product is <v0 | state>, which is the conjugate transpose of v0 multiplied by state.

But in this case, all the entries are real, so it's just the dot product.

So the amplitude is: (1/sqrt(2))* (-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1.

Which is (-1/sqrt(2)) + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) = (-2/sqrt(2)).

Wait, let me compute it:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) → -1/sqrt(2).

Third component: (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 → -1/sqrt(2).

Adding them: (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait: sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so -sqrt(2) squared is 2, but probabilities are the squares of the absolute value.

Wait, but what's the inner product here?

Let me double-check.

The eigenvector is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

The state vector is [-1, 2, 1].

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 *2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) *1.

Which is (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)).

So that's (-2/sqrt(2)).

Simplify: sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2). Because sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)=2, so 2/sqrt(2)=sqrt(2).

So, (-2/sqrt(2)) = -sqrt(2).

So the amplitude is -sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude: | -sqrt(2) |^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Wait, but that can't be right because probabilities cannot exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization. Because the eigenvector [1,0,-1] has a length of sqrt(1 +0 +1) = sqrt(2), so the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

But the state vector given is [-1, 2,1 ].

Wait, but perhaps the state is not normalized. Because if the state is a vector with elements (-1,2,1), its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(1+4+1)= sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized.

Ah! Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, but in this problem, the state is given as (-1,2,1). So perhaps the state is not normalized. That would affect the probabilities because the probabilities are calculated as the square of the amplitude, divided by the norm squared.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think. In quantum mechanics, the state vector must have a norm of 1. Because it's a probability amplitude. So perhaps the given vector is not normalized, and we need to normalize it before proceeding.

Wait, let me think again. Let me compute the norm of the state vector.

The state vector is [-1, 2, 1].

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the state vector is not normalized. So to make it a valid quantum state, it should be divided by sqrt(6).

Wait, but the question is about the probability, so perhaps the state is already normalized, but that's not the case. Because the norm is sqrt(6), not 1. So the state vector is not a unit vector. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are always normalized because the total probability must be 1.

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the state is given and we proceed, regardless of normalization. But that can't be correct. Because probabilities will be incorrectly calculated.

Wait, maybe I should compute everything as per the given state and then normalize.

Wait, perhaps the given state is not normalized, so I should first normalize it.

Because, in quantum mechanics, the state vector is a unit vector, so if the given vector is not, we should normalize it.

So the given vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. Its norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized vector is ( [-1, 2, 1]^T ) / sqrt(6).

So, the state vector |ψ> is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Now, the eigenvector for λ=0 is |v0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the amplitude is <v0 | ψ> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)).

Which is [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

= [ (-1 -1 ) ] / ( sqrt(12) )

= (-2 ) / (2*sqrt(3)) )

= (-1)/sqrt(3) )

So the amplitude is -1/sqrt(3), and the probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/3).

So the probability is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the answer should be C.

To determine the probability of measuring 0 for the observable represented by the matrix \( P \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The matrix \( P \) is given as:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After computation, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). Thus, 0 is one of the eigenvalues, and the corresponding eigenvector must be determined.

### Step 2: Eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector satisfies \( P |v\rangle = 0 \). Solving the system of equations, the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is proportional to:

\[
|v_0\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
-1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Normalizing this vector, we get:

\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
-1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: State Vector Normalization
The given state vector is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The norm of this vector is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state vector is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Amplitude for \( \lambda = 0 \)
The amplitude for measuring \( \lambda = 0 \) is the inner product of the normalized state vector \( |\psi\rangle \) with the normalized eigenvector \( |v_0\rangle \):

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)(-1) + 0(2) + \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)(1).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = -\sqrt{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Probability of Measuring 0
The probability of measuring \( \lambda = 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude:

\[
P(\lambda = 0) = |\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left| -\sqrt{2} \right|^2 = 2.
\]

However, this result exceeds 1, which is not possible for a probability. This discrepancy arises because the state vector \( |\psi\rangle \) was not normalized before computing the amplitude. Correcting for this, the normalized state vector is used, and the probability is recalculated as:

\[
P(\lambda = 0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain value for an observable. Alright, let's read the problem again.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, no, wait, actually, looking again, it's a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a vector in three dimensions. Then, the observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write down what P looks like.

The first row of P is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. The second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]. The third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, okay. So P is a Hermitian matrix because it's an observable, right? Because observables must be Hermitian to have real eigenvalues, which are the possible measurement outcomes.

The problem asks for the probability that the measurement of P yields 0. So, I need to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P on the given state.

Wait, but to find the probability, I think we need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P. Because the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude, which is the inner product of the state vector with the corresponding eigenvector.

But wait, P is the matrix of the observable. So, first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Because the eigenvalues are the possible results of the measurement. So, perhaps 0 is one of the eigenvalues, and the corresponding eigenvector's inner product with the state vector will give the amplitude, and then the probability is the square of that.

But maybe there's another approach. Oh right, alternatively, since the state is given, we can compute the expectation value of P. Wait, no, the question is about the probability of getting 0, not the expectation. So we need to find the eigenvalues and see if 0 is one of them, and then find the eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P is diagonal in some basis, but given its structure, I'm not sure. Let me think about how to find the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λI) = 0.

But I might not have to compute the eigenvalues directly. Wait, what's the structure of P? Let me see:

P looks like this:

Row 1: 0          1/sqrt(2)    0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2)  0           1/sqrt(2)
Row3: 0          1/sqrt(2)    0

Hmm, so it's symmetric, which makes sense because it's Hermitian. Looking at the matrix, perhaps it's a type of Pauli matrix but in three dimensions. Alternatively, maybe I can find eigenvectors by inspection.

Let me try to find the eigenvalues. Let me write the matrix:

P = [[0, a, 0],
     [a, 0, a],
     [0, a, 0]]

where a = 1/sqrt(2).

So, to find the eigenvalues, compute the determinant of (P - λ I) = 0.

The matrix becomes:

[-λ, a, 0]
[a, -λ, a]
[0, a, -λ]

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - a*a ] - a * [a*(-λ) - a*0 ] + 0 * something.

So expanding the determinant:

The determinant is:

-λ [ (λ² - a²) ] - a [ -a λ ] + 0.

Wait, let me compute it step by step. The determinant for a 3x3 matrix:

For row 1, the elements are -λ, a, 0.

So expanding along the first row:

-λ * det( [ [ -λ, a ], [a, -λ ] ] ) - a * det( [ [a, a ], [0, -λ] ] ) + 0 * det(...)

Wait, no. The minor for each element is the determinant of the submatrix when the row and column are excluded.

So for the first term (i=1, j=1), the minor is the submatrix:

[ [ -λ, a ],
  [ a, -λ ] ]

Determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - a*a = λ² - a².

Multiply by (-λ) and by (-1)^(1+1)=1. So term1: (-λ) * (λ² - a²) * 1.

Second term (i=1, j=2): element is a. The minor is submatrix when row 1 and column 2 are removed.

Which is:

Row 2 and 3, column 1 and 3.

So the minor matrix is:

[ [ a, a ],
  [ 0, -λ ] ]

Determinant is a*(-λ) - a*0 = -a λ.

Multiply by a * (-1)^(1+2) = (-1)^3 = -1.

So term2: a * (-a λ) * (-1) ? Wait, let me be careful.

The expansion is sum_{j=1 to 3} [ M[1,j] * (-1)^(1+j) * det(minor) ]

So for j=1: element is -λ, (-1)^(1+1)=1, determinant is λ² -a².

j=2: element a, (-1)^(1+2)= -1, minor determinant is (a*(-λ) - a*0) = -a λ.

j=3: element 0, so term is zero.

So the determinant is:

(-λ)(λ² - a²) * 1 + a*(-a λ)*(-1) + 0.

Wait, let's compute each part:

First term: (-λ)(λ² - a²) * 1 → (-λ)(λ² - a²) = -λ^3 + λ a².

Second term: a * (-a λ) * (-1) → a * (-aλ) * (-1) = a^2 λ.

So determinant = (-λ^3 + λ a²) + a^2 λ = -λ^3 + 2 λ a².

Set determinant to zero: -λ^3 + 2λ a² =0.

Factor λ: λ (-λ² + 2 a² ) =0.

So solutions: λ=0, and (-λ² + 2a²)=0 → λ²=2 a² → λ=±a*√2.

But a is 1/sqrt(2), so a*sqrt(2)= (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) )=1.

So eigenvalues are λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

Ah, so 0 is an eigenvalue. So the possible outcomes include 0. So the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0.

Now, I need to find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

So for P - 0 I = P, so we have (P) |v> =0.

So the system is:

0 x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0 z = 0 → (1) (1/sqrt(2)) y =0 → y=0.

Second equation: (1/sqrt(2)) x + 0 y + (1/sqrt(2)) z =0 → (1/sqrt(2)) (x + z) )=0 → x + z=0 → x= -z.

Third equation: 0 x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0 z =0 → same as first equation, y=0.

So the eigenvectors must satisfy y=0 and x= -z.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (x, 0, -x) = x (1,0,-1). So any scalar multiple of (1,0,-1) is an eigenvector for λ=0.

Wait, but wait, let me check: Let me plug in the vector (1,0,-1) into the equation P v = λ v. Since λ is zero, P v should be zero.

Compute P v:

P is the matrix:

Row 1: 0, a, 0 → [0*1 + a*0 +0*(-1)] = 0.

Row 2: a, 0, a → a*1 + 0*0 +a*(-1) → a (1 -1 )=0.

Row3: 0, a,0 → 0*1 + a*0 +0*(-1) =0.

So yes, P v =0 for v=(1,0,-1), which is correct.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, 0, -1).

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are usually normalized. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, the vector (1,0,-1) has length sqrt(1 +0 +1) = sqrt(2). So when normalized, each component is divided by sqrt(2).

So the eigenvector |v0> corresponding to λ=0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, but wait, the given state is (-1, 2, 1). So as a column vector, it's [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Wait, the state vector is given as a column vector. So to compute the amplitude, we compute the inner product of the state vector with the eigenvector |v0>.

But wait, the state vector given is [ -1, 2,1 ]^T, which is a column vector. So the inner product is <v0 | state>, which is the conjugate transpose of v0 multiplied by state.

But in this case, all the entries are real, so it's just the dot product.

So the amplitude is: (1/sqrt(2))* (-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1.

Which is (-1/sqrt(2)) + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) = (-2/sqrt(2)).

Wait, let me compute it:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) → -1/sqrt(2).

Third component: (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 → -1/sqrt(2).

Adding them: (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait: sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so -sqrt(2) squared is 2, but probabilities are the squares of the absolute value.

Wait, but what's the inner product here?

Let me double-check.

The eigenvector is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

The state vector is [-1, 2, 1].

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 *2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) *1.

Which is (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)).

So that's (-2/sqrt(2)).

Simplify: sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2). Because sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)=2, so 2/sqrt(2)=sqrt(2).

So, (-2/sqrt(2)) = -sqrt(2).

So the amplitude is -sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude: | -sqrt(2) |^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Wait, but that can't be right because probabilities cannot exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization. Because the eigenvector [1,0,-1] has a length of sqrt(1 +0 +1) = sqrt(2), so the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

But the state vector given is [-1, 2,1 ].

Wait, but perhaps the state is not normalized. Because if the state is a vector with elements (-1,2,1), its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(1+4+1)= sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized.

Ah! Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, but in this problem, the state is given as (-1,2,1). So perhaps the state is not normalized. That would affect the probabilities because the probabilities are calculated as the square of the amplitude, divided by the norm squared.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think. In quantum mechanics, the state vector must have a norm of 1. Because it's a probability amplitude. So perhaps the given vector is not normalized, and we need to normalize it before proceeding.

Wait, let me think again. Let me compute the norm of the state vector.

The state vector is [-1, 2, 1].

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the state vector is not normalized. So to make it a valid quantum state, it should be divided by sqrt(6).

Wait, but the question is about the probability, so perhaps the state is already normalized, but that's not the case. Because the norm is sqrt(6), not 1. So the state vector is not a unit vector. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are always normalized because the total probability must be 1.

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the state is given and we proceed, regardless of normalization. But that can't be correct. Because probabilities will be incorrectly calculated.

Wait, maybe I should compute everything as per the given state and then normalize.

Wait, perhaps the given state is not normalized, so I should first normalize it.

Because, in quantum mechanics, the state vector is a unit vector, so if the given vector is not, we should normalize it.

So the given vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. Its norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized vector is ( [-1, 2, 1]^T ) / sqrt(6).

So, the state vector |ψ> is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Now, the eigenvector for λ=0 is |v0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the amplitude is <v0 | ψ> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)).

Which is [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

= [ (-1 -1 ) ] / ( sqrt(12) )

= (-2 ) / (2*sqrt(3)) )

= (-1)/sqrt(3) )

So the amplitude is -1/sqrt(3), and the probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/3).

So the probability is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the answer should be C.


To determine the probability of measuring 0 for the observable represented by the matrix \( P \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The matrix \( P \) is given as:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After computation, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). Thus, 0 is one of the eigenvalues, and the corresponding eigenvector must be determined.

### Step 2: Eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector satisfies \( P |v\rangle = 0 \). Solving the system of equations, the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is proportional to:

\[
|v_0\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
-1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Normalizing this vector, we get:

\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
-1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: State Vector Normalization
The given state vector is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The norm of this vector is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state vector is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Amplitude for \( \lambda = 0 \)
The amplitude for measuring \( \lambda = 0 \) is the inner product of the normalized state vector \( |\psi\rangle \) with the normalized eigenvector \( |v_0\rangle \):

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)(-1) + 0(2) + \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)(1).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = -\sqrt{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Probability of Measuring 0
The probability of measuring \( \lambda = 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude:

\[
P(\lambda = 0) = |\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left| -\sqrt{2} \right|^2 = 2.
\]

However, this result exceeds 1, which is not possible for a probability. This discrepancy arises because the state vector \( |\psi\rangle \) was not normalized before computing the amplitude. Correcting for this, the normalized state vector is used, and the probability is recalculated as:

\[
P(\lambda = 0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
