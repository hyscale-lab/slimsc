Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that doesn't look like a normalized vector. Oh, right, quantum states need to be normalized, so I should probably normalize it first. Let me calculate the norm. The components are -1, 2, 1. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) multiplied by [-1, 2, 1]^T. Okay, that makes sense.

Next, there are two operators, P and Q. The matrix for P looks like this:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And the matrix for Q is diagonal: first row [1, 0, 0], second [0,0,0], third [0,0,-1]. Oh wait, so Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. That might make things easier because diagonal matrices are easier to work with.

The question is asking for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring first P, then Q. Wait, no, the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P". Wait, no, the question says after P is measured, then Q. Oh wait, the question says: what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements? So when P is measured first, and then Q, the outcome is P=0 and Q=-1.

Wait, no, no, the order is measuring P first and then Q. So the process is: first measure P, which gives 0, and then measure Q, which gives -1.

But wait, when you measure a system, the state collapses into an eigenstate of the measured operator. So after measuring P and getting 0, the state will be in the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, measuring Q in that state.

But wait, I think the problem is about sequential measurements. So first, when we measure P, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. Then, after P is measured, the state is projected into the corresponding eigenspace, and then Q is measured on that projected state.

So to find the probability of getting P=0 and then Q=-1, I think we need to compute the probability of P=0 first, then, given that, the probability of Q=-1.

But wait, I should probably approach this step by step.

First, let me find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for operator P.

But wait, looking at matrix P:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

Hmm, maybe it's a symmetric matrix, so it should have orthogonal eigenvectors. Let me think about the eigenvalues.

Wait, another approach: since P is a 3x3 matrix, maybe we can find its eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute P squared. Let me compute P^2:

First row of P: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Second row: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Third row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

So P squared will be:

First element (1,1): (0)(0) + (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) + (0)(0) = 1/2 + 0 +0=1/2.

Element (1,2): (0)(1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (0)(1/sqrt(2))= 0.

Wait, maybe I should compute each element properly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues of P. Let me consider the trace. The trace of P is 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is 0.

The determinant of P? Maybe, but that might be tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can guess the eigenvalues. Let's see. Maybe one of the eigenvalues is 1. Let me try to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue 1.

Suppose (a, b, c) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue λ=1.

Then, P (a, b, c)^T = λ (a, b, c)^T.

So:

Row 1: (0)a + (1/sqrt(2)) b + 0 c = a → (1/sqrt(2)) b = a.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) a + 0 b + (1/sqrt(2)) c = b → (1/sqrt(2))(a + c) = b.

Row 3: 0 a + (1/sqrt(2)) b + 0 c = c → (1/sqrt(2)) b = c.

So from rows 1 and 3, a = (1/sqrt(2)) b, and c = (1/sqrt(2)) b.

Substituting into row 2: (1/sqrt(2))(a + c) = (1/sqrt(2))( [ (1/sqrt(2)) b + (1/sqrt(2)) b ] ) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (2/sqrt(2)) b ) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (sqrt(2)) ) b = (1) b.

But row 2 says (1/sqrt(2))(a + c) = b. So substituting a and c in terms of b, we have (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1/sqrt(2) b ) + (1/sqrt(2) b) ) ) = (1/sqrt(2)) ( 2/sqrt(2) b ) ) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (sqrt(2) ) b ) → equals 1 * b. So equation is b = b. That holds for any b.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (a, b, c) = ( (1/sqrt(2))b, b, (1/sqrt(2))b ). So it's a one-dimensional eigenspace for λ=1, with eigenvector proportional to (1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. Let me express a in terms of b and c in terms of b.

So a = (1/sqrt(2)) b, c = (1/sqrt(2)) b.

So the eigenvector is [ (1/sqrt(2) b ), b, (1/sqrt(2) b ) ] = b * [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2) ].

So the eigenvalue λ=1 has this eigenvector. Now, let's compute the eigenvalue for this eigenvector.

Wait, maybe I can also find other eigenvalues. Let's think about the trace again. The sum of eigenvalues is 0, and the determinant would be the product of eigenvalues.

But perhaps an alternative approach is better. Let's think about the possible eigenvalues of P.

Wait, another idea: since P^2 is a matrix where each element might be computed. Let me compute P squared.

P^2:

Row 1:

(0 * 0) + (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*0 = (1/2)
(0 * 1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) = 0
0*0 + 1/sqrt(2) * (1/sqrt(2)) + 0*0 = 1/2

So row 1 of P^2 is [1/2, 0, 1/2]

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute each element methodically.

P squared is P multiplied by P, so let's compute each element (i,j):

Element (1,1):

Row 1 of P: [0, a, 0], where a = 1/sqrt(2)
Column 1 of P: [0, a, 0]

So (0)(0) + a*a + 0*0 = a² = (1/2).

Element (1,2):

Row 1 of P: [0, a, 0]
Column 2 of P: [a, 0, a]
So 0*a + a*0 + 0*a = 0.

Element (1,3):

Row 1 of P: [0, a, 0]
Column 3 of P: [0, a, 0]

0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = (1/2).

So row 1 of P squared is [1/2, 0, 1/2].

Row 2 of P squared:

Row 2 of P: [a, 0, a]

Column 1:

a*0 + 0*a + a*0 = 0.

Wait, wait, maybe I should compute it more carefully.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of P squared as P multiplied by P. So each element (i,j) is the dot product of row i of P and column j of P.

So for row 2, column 1:

Row 2 of P is [a, 0, a], where a is 1/sqrt(2)
Column 1 of P is [0, a, 0]

Dot product: a*0 + 0*a + a*0 = 0.

Row 2, column 2:

Row 2 of P: [a, 0, a]
Column 2: [a, 0, a]

So a*a + 0*0 + a*a = a² + a² = 2a² = 2*(1/2) = 1.

Row 2, column 3:

Row 2 is [a,0,a]
Column 3: [0, a, 0]

So a*0 + 0*a + a*0 = 0.

So row 2 of P squared is [0, 1, 0].

Row 3 of P squared:

Row 3 of P is [0, a, 0]

Column 1: [0, a, 0]

Dot product: 0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = a²=1/2.

Column 2: [a, 0, a]

0*a + a*0 + 0*a =0.

Column 3: [0, a, 0]

0*0 + a*a +0*0 = a²=1/2.

So row 3 of P squared is [1/2, 0, 1/2].

Putting it all together, P squared is:

[1/2, 0, 1/2]
[0, 1, 0]
[1/2, 0, 1/2]

Hmm, interesting. Now, if I consider that P squared might have some relation to the identity matrix, but perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps if I square P, I get this matrix. Let me see if I can find eigenvalues for P squared.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the eigenvalues of P squared are the squares of the eigenvalues of P. So if we can find the eigenvalues of P squared, we can then take square roots to find the eigenvalues of P.

But perhaps that's more complicated. Let me try to find the eigenvalues of P squared.

The matrix P squared is:

Row 1: [1/2, 0, 1/2]
Row 2: [0, 1, 0]
Row 3: [1/2, 0, 1/2]

Hmm, perhaps the eigenvalues can be found by looking for eigenvectors or by computing the characteristic equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can notice that rows 1 and 3 are the same, so the matrix has some symmetry. Let me see.

Looking for eigenvectors:

First, the second row is [0,1,0], which suggests that the standard basis vector e2 (0,1,0) is an eigenvector, with eigenvalue 1.

Because P squared multiplied by e2 is [0,1,0]^T, which is 1 * e2.

So that's one eigenvalue: 1.

Now, for the other eigenvalues, perhaps we can look for eigenvectors in the subspace orthogonal to e2.

So, let's consider vectors where the second component is zero. Suppose the eigenvector is (a, 0, c).

Then, P squared acting on (a,0,c) is:

Row 1: (1/2 a) + (1/2 c)
Row 2: 0 (since the second component is zero)
Row 3: (1/2 a) + (1/2 c)

So the resulting vector is [ (a + c)/2 , 0, (a + c)/2 ]^T.

For this to be an eigenvector, we must have:

(a + c)/2 = λ a
0 = 0 (so that's fine)
(a + c)/2 = λ c

So from the first and third equations: (a + c)/2 = λ a and (a + c)/2 = λ c.

So λ a = λ c → if λ ≠0, then a = c.

But if a = c, then substituting into (a + c)/2 = λ a:

( a + a )/2 = λ a → (2a)/2 = λ a → a = λ a → if a ≠0, then λ =1.

Wait, but earlier we already have λ=1 as an eigenvalue, so maybe that's the case.

Wait, but wait, if λ=1, then from (a + c)/2 = a → a + c = 2a → c = a. So that's consistent.

So eigenvectors where a = c, and the second component is zero, are in the eigenspace of λ=1.

But wait, wait, earlier when we had P, the eigenvalue for λ=1 had eigenvector [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)]^T, which would have a =1/sqrt(2), c=1/sqrt(2), so a=c. So this makes sense.

But wait, the P squared has eigenvalues 1, and perhaps others.

Wait, let's compute the trace of P squared. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements: 1/2 +1 +1/2 = 2.

The trace is equal to the sum of eigenvalues. We already have one eigenvalue at 1, so the sum of the other two eigenvalues is 1.

But since the matrix is symmetric (P is symmetric, so P squared is also symmetric), the eigenvalues are real.

Another approach: Let's try to find other eigenvectors.

Let me assume an eigenvector of the form (a, b, a), since in row 1 and 3 of P squared, they are symmetric.

So, the vector is (a, b, a). Let's compute P squared acting on this vector.

Row 1: (1/2 a) + 0*b + (1/2 a) = (a + a)/2 = a.
Row 2: 0*a + 1*b + 0*a = b.
Row 3: (1/2 a) + 0*b + (1/2 a) = a.

So the result is (a, b, a), which is the same as the original vector. So this suggests that any vector of the form (a, b, a) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. So eigenvalue 1 has multiplicity 2?

Wait, wait, that can't be right because the trace is 2 and the sum of the eigenvalues from P squared's perspective would be 1 (from e2) plus 1 (from another eigenvector) plus another eigenvalue, which would make the sum 1+1 + x = 2 → x=0.

Wait, let me check. The trace of P squared is 2, so sum of eigenvalues is 2.

We already have two eigenvalues of 1, so the third must be 0.

So the eigenvalues of P squared are 1, 1, and 0.

Wait, but wait, how can that be? Because for a symmetric matrix, the rank is the number of non-zero eigenvalues. The matrix P squared has elements where row 2 is [0,1,0], which affects the rank.

Wait, let me compute the determinant of P squared. If the eigenvalues are 1,1,0, the determinant is 0.

Let me compute the determinant of P squared.

P squared matrix:

Row 1: [1/2, 0, 1/2]
Row 2: [0, 1, 0]
Row 3: [1/2, 0, 1/2]

So determinant:

= 1/2 * (1 * 1/2 - 0 * 0) - 0*(...) + 1/2 * (0 * 0 - 1 * 1/2 )

Wait, expanding along the second row because it has a zero which might make it easier.

The determinant is:

0 * something + 1 * minor - 0 * something.

The minor for the (2,2) element is the determinant of the submatrix:

[1/2, 1/2]
[1/2, 1/2]

Which is (1/2 * 1/2) - (1/2 * 1/2) = 0.

So the determinant is 1 * 0 = 0.

Which makes sense because one of the eigenvalues is zero.

So the eigenvalues of P squared are 1, 1, 0.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of P are the square roots of these, but considering that P is Hermitian (since it's a symmetric matrix), its eigenvalues are real.

So P's eigenvalues are sqrt(1)=1, -1, and 0.

Because when you square them, you get 1, 1, and 0.

So the possible eigenvalues for P are 1, -1, 0.

So when measuring P, the possible outcomes are 1, -1, or 0.

Now, the problem states that we are measuring P first and getting 0. So the state collapses into the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Then, we measure Q, which has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

Wait, but the matrix Q is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: 1, 0, -1.

So the question is, what is the probability of getting P=0 and then Q=-1.

So first, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, because when P is measured and gives 0, the state collapses into that eigenspace.

So let's find the eigenvectors for P with eigenvalue 0.

The eigenvectors satisfy (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the matrix P is:

[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

We can write the equations for P v = 0.

Let me denote the components of v as (x, y, z).

So the equations are:

1. (0)x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0 z = 0 → (1/sqrt(2)) y = 0 → y = 0.

2. (1/sqrt(2)) x + 0 y + (1/sqrt(2)) z = 0 → (x + z)/sqrt(2) = 0 → x + z = 0 → z = -x.

3. 0 x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0 z = 0 → same as equation 1, which gives y=0.

So the eigenvectors for P=0 are vectors where y=0 and z= -x.

So the eigenvectors can be written as [x, 0, -x] = x [1, 0, -1].

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by [1, 0, -1]. But we need to normalize it.

The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so when you measure P and get 0, the state collapses into this eigenvector, up to a scalar multiple.

But wait, the initial state is ( -1, 2, 1 )^T. We need to normalize it first. Oh right, earlier I calculated that the state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So the initial state is |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6).

Now, when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 1, -1, 0. The probabilities are given by the projection of |ψ> onto each eigenspace.

But since the eigenspace for P=0 is one-dimensional, the probability of getting 0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |ψ> and the eigenvector of P=0.

The eigenvector for P=0 is |0> = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

So the inner product <0|ψ> is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * ( (-1) ) + (0) * 2 + ( (-1)/sqrt(2) ) * 1 )

= [ (-1)/sqrt(2) ) + ( -1 * 1 ) / sqrt(2) ]

= [ (-1 -1 ) / sqrt(2) )

= (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, wait, that can't be right because when you take the absolute value squared, it should be a probability between 0 and 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute <0|ψ>.

|0> is [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2)
|ψ> is [-1, 2, 1]/sqrt(6)

So <0|ψ> is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0*2 + ( (-1)/sqrt(2) ) * 1 → 

= [ (-1)/sqrt(2) ) + ( (-1)/sqrt(2) ) ]

= [ (-2)/sqrt(2) ) ] = (-2)/(√2) ) = -√2.

Wait, wait, the absolute value squared is ( (-√2) )^2 = 2. But that can't be because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the normalization. Let me recheck.

The eigenvector for P=0 is (1, 0, -1), which has a norm of sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

The initial state |ψ> is ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6).

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1)/sqrt(6) + 0 * 2/sqrt(6) + ( (-1)/sqrt(2) ) * (1)/sqrt(6 )

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(6)) ) ]

= [ (-2) ] / ( sqrt(12) )

Simplify sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2√3.

So (-2)/(2√3) )= (-1)/√3.

The absolute value squared is ( (-1)/√3 )^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.

So after measuring P=0, the state collapses into the eigenvector |0>, which is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

Now, the next step is to measure Q and get outcome -1. Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The eigenstates of Q are the standard basis vectors.

Because the matrix Q is diagonal, its eigenvectors are the basis vectors e1 = (1,0,0), e2=(0,1,0), e3=(0,0,1).

Eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1 for e1, e2, e3 respectively.

So the state after P=0 is |0> = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

We need to find the probability that measuring Q in this state gives -1, which corresponds to the state e3.

The probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude <e3 | 0>.

So <e3 | 0> is (0, 0, 1) multiplied by (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2) → (0 + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2)) = (-1)/sqrt(2).

The absolute value squared is (1/2).

So the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.

But wait, the overall probability is the product of the two probabilities? No, not exactly. Because the first event (measuring P=0) has a probability of 1/3, and given that, the second event (measuring Q=-1) has a probability of 1/2.

So the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial state is |ψ>, and the process is: measure P, get 0 (prob 1/3), then measure Q, get -1 (prob 1/2). So the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the answer is 1/6.

Looking at the options:

A) 1/2 → No.

B) 1/3 → No.

C) 2/3 → No.

D) 1/6 → Yes.

So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The state of the system is given as a column vector \((-1, 2, 1)^T\), which is not normalized. Its norm is calculated as:

\[
\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \(P\)
The operator \(P\) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \(P\) are found to be \(1, -1, 0\), and the corresponding eigenvectors are:

- For \(P = 1\): \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\),
- For \(P = -1\): \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\),
- For \(P = 0\): \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}\).

The eigenspace for \(P = 0\) is one-dimensional, spanned by the normalized eigenvector:

\[
|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of measuring \(P = 0\)
The probability of measuring \(P = 0\) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \(|\psi\rangle\) and \(|0\rangle\):

\[
\langle 0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle 0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left(-1 + 0 - 1\right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P=0) = |\langle 0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: State after measuring \(P = 0\)
If \(P = 0\) is measured, the state collapses into the eigenspace of \(P = 0\), which is the normalized eigenvector:

\[
|\phi\rangle = |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Probability of measuring \(Q = -1\) after \(P = 0\)
The operator \(Q\) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \(Q\) are \(1, 0, -1\), and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors:

- \(|1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\),
- \(|0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\),
- \(|-1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\).

The probability of measuring \(Q = -1\) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \(|\phi\rangle\) and \(|-1\rangle\):

\[
\langle -1 | \phi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = |\langle -1 | \phi \rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Total probability
The total probability of measuring \(P = 0\) and then \(Q = -1\) is:

\[
P(P=0 \text{ and } Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \(P = 0\) and \(Q = -1\) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}.
\]

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that doesn't look like a normalized vector. Oh, right, quantum states need to be normalized, so I should probably normalize it first. Let me calculate the norm. The components are -1, 2, 1. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) multiplied by [-1, 2, 1]^T. Okay, that makes sense.

Next, there are two operators, P and Q. The matrix for P looks like this:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And the matrix for Q is diagonal: first row [1, 0, 0], second [0,0,0], third [0,0,-1]. Oh wait, so Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. That might make things easier because diagonal matrices are easier to work with.

The question is asking for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring first P, then Q. Wait, no, the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P". Wait, no, the question says after P is measured, then Q. Oh wait, the question says: what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements? So when P is measured first, and then Q, the outcome is P=0 and Q=-1.

Wait, no, no, the order is measuring P first and then Q. So the process is: first measure P, which gives 0, and then measure Q, which gives -1.

But wait, when you measure a system, the state collapses into an eigenstate of the measured operator. So after measuring P and getting 0, the state will be in the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, measuring Q in that state.

But wait, I think the problem is about sequential measurements. So first, when we measure P, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. Then, after P is measured, the state is projected into the corresponding eigenspace, and then Q is measured on that projected state.

So to find the probability of getting P=0 and then Q=-1, I think we need to compute the probability of P=0 first, then, given that, the probability of Q=-1.

But wait, I should probably approach this step by step.

First, let me find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for operator P.

But wait, looking at matrix P:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

Hmm, maybe it's a symmetric matrix, so it should have orthogonal eigenvectors. Let me think about the eigenvalues.

Wait, another approach: since P is a 3x3 matrix, maybe we can find its eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute P squared. Let me compute P^2:

First row of P: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Second row: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Third row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

So P squared will be:

First element (1,1): (0)(0) + (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) + (0)(0) = 1/2 + 0 +0=1/2.

Element (1,2): (0)(1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (0)(1/sqrt(2))= 0.

Wait, maybe I should compute each element properly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues of P. Let me consider the trace. The trace of P is 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is 0.

The determinant of P? Maybe, but that might be tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can guess the eigenvalues. Let's see. Maybe one of the eigenvalues is 1. Let me try to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue 1.

Suppose (a, b, c) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue λ=1.

Then, P (a, b, c)^T = λ (a, b, c)^T.

So:

Row 1: (0)a + (1/sqrt(2)) b + 0 c = a → (1/sqrt(2)) b = a.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) a + 0 b + (1/sqrt(2)) c = b → (1/sqrt(2))(a + c) = b.

Row 3: 0 a + (1/sqrt(2)) b + 0 c = c → (1/sqrt(2)) b = c.

So from rows 1 and 3, a = (1/sqrt(2)) b, and c = (1/sqrt(2)) b.

Substituting into row 2: (1/sqrt(2))(a + c) = (1/sqrt(2))( [ (1/sqrt(2)) b + (1/sqrt(2)) b ] ) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (2/sqrt(2)) b ) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (sqrt(2)) ) b = (1) b.

But row 2 says (1/sqrt(2))(a + c) = b. So substituting a and c in terms of b, we have (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1/sqrt(2) b ) + (1/sqrt(2) b) ) ) = (1/sqrt(2)) ( 2/sqrt(2) b ) ) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (sqrt(2) ) b ) → equals 1 * b. So equation is b = b. That holds for any b.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (a, b, c) = ( (1/sqrt(2))b, b, (1/sqrt(2))b ). So it's a one-dimensional eigenspace for λ=1, with eigenvector proportional to (1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. Let me express a in terms of b and c in terms of b.

So a = (1/sqrt(2)) b, c = (1/sqrt(2)) b.

So the eigenvector is [ (1/sqrt(2) b ), b, (1/sqrt(2) b ) ] = b * [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2) ].

So the eigenvalue λ=1 has this eigenvector. Now, let's compute the eigenvalue for this eigenvector.

Wait, maybe I can also find other eigenvalues. Let's think about the trace again. The sum of eigenvalues is 0, and the determinant would be the product of eigenvalues.

But perhaps an alternative approach is better. Let's think about the possible eigenvalues of P.

Wait, another idea: since P^2 is a matrix where each element might be computed. Let me compute P squared.

P^2:

Row 1:

(0 * 0) + (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*0 = (1/2)
(0 * 1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) = 0
0*0 + 1/sqrt(2) * (1/sqrt(2)) + 0*0 = 1/2

So row 1 of P^2 is [1/2, 0, 1/2]

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute each element methodically.

P squared is P multiplied by P, so let's compute each element (i,j):

Element (1,1):

Row 1 of P: [0, a, 0], where a = 1/sqrt(2)
Column 1 of P: [0, a, 0]

So (0)(0) + a*a + 0*0 = a² = (1/2).

Element (1,2):

Row 1 of P: [0, a, 0]
Column 2 of P: [a, 0, a]
So 0*a + a*0 + 0*a = 0.

Element (1,3):

Row 1 of P: [0, a, 0]
Column 3 of P: [0, a, 0]

0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = (1/2).

So row 1 of P squared is [1/2, 0, 1/2].

Row 2 of P squared:

Row 2 of P: [a, 0, a]

Column 1:

a*0 + 0*a + a*0 = 0.

Wait, wait, maybe I should compute it more carefully.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of P squared as P multiplied by P. So each element (i,j) is the dot product of row i of P and column j of P.

So for row 2, column 1:

Row 2 of P is [a, 0, a], where a is 1/sqrt(2)
Column 1 of P is [0, a, 0]

Dot product: a*0 + 0*a + a*0 = 0.

Row 2, column 2:

Row 2 of P: [a, 0, a]
Column 2: [a, 0, a]

So a*a + 0*0 + a*a = a² + a² = 2a² = 2*(1/2) = 1.

Row 2, column 3:

Row 2 is [a,0,a]
Column 3: [0, a, 0]

So a*0 + 0*a + a*0 = 0.

So row 2 of P squared is [0, 1, 0].

Row 3 of P squared:

Row 3 of P is [0, a, 0]

Column 1: [0, a, 0]

Dot product: 0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = a²=1/2.

Column 2: [a, 0, a]

0*a + a*0 + 0*a =0.

Column 3: [0, a, 0]

0*0 + a*a +0*0 = a²=1/2.

So row 3 of P squared is [1/2, 0, 1/2].

Putting it all together, P squared is:

[1/2, 0, 1/2]
[0, 1, 0]
[1/2, 0, 1/2]

Hmm, interesting. Now, if I consider that P squared might have some relation to the identity matrix, but perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps if I square P, I get this matrix. Let me see if I can find eigenvalues for P squared.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the eigenvalues of P squared are the squares of the eigenvalues of P. So if we can find the eigenvalues of P squared, we can then take square roots to find the eigenvalues of P.

But perhaps that's more complicated. Let me try to find the eigenvalues of P squared.

The matrix P squared is:

Row 1: [1/2, 0, 1/2]
Row 2: [0, 1, 0]
Row 3: [1/2, 0, 1/2]

Hmm, perhaps the eigenvalues can be found by looking for eigenvectors or by computing the characteristic equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can notice that rows 1 and 3 are the same, so the matrix has some symmetry. Let me see.

Looking for eigenvectors:

First, the second row is [0,1,0], which suggests that the standard basis vector e2 (0,1,0) is an eigenvector, with eigenvalue 1.

Because P squared multiplied by e2 is [0,1,0]^T, which is 1 * e2.

So that's one eigenvalue: 1.

Now, for the other eigenvalues, perhaps we can look for eigenvectors in the subspace orthogonal to e2.

So, let's consider vectors where the second component is zero. Suppose the eigenvector is (a, 0, c).

Then, P squared acting on (a,0,c) is:

Row 1: (1/2 a) + (1/2 c)
Row 2: 0 (since the second component is zero)
Row 3: (1/2 a) + (1/2 c)

So the resulting vector is [ (a + c)/2 , 0, (a + c)/2 ]^T.

For this to be an eigenvector, we must have:

(a + c)/2 = λ a
0 = 0 (so that's fine)
(a + c)/2 = λ c

So from the first and third equations: (a + c)/2 = λ a and (a + c)/2 = λ c.

So λ a = λ c → if λ ≠0, then a = c.

But if a = c, then substituting into (a + c)/2 = λ a:

( a + a )/2 = λ a → (2a)/2 = λ a → a = λ a → if a ≠0, then λ =1.

Wait, but earlier we already have λ=1 as an eigenvalue, so maybe that's the case.

Wait, but wait, if λ=1, then from (a + c)/2 = a → a + c = 2a → c = a. So that's consistent.

So eigenvectors where a = c, and the second component is zero, are in the eigenspace of λ=1.

But wait, wait, earlier when we had P, the eigenvalue for λ=1 had eigenvector [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)]^T, which would have a =1/sqrt(2), c=1/sqrt(2), so a=c. So this makes sense.

But wait, the P squared has eigenvalues 1, and perhaps others.

Wait, let's compute the trace of P squared. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements: 1/2 +1 +1/2 = 2.

The trace is equal to the sum of eigenvalues. We already have one eigenvalue at 1, so the sum of the other two eigenvalues is 1.

But since the matrix is symmetric (P is symmetric, so P squared is also symmetric), the eigenvalues are real.

Another approach: Let's try to find other eigenvectors.

Let me assume an eigenvector of the form (a, b, a), since in row 1 and 3 of P squared, they are symmetric.

So, the vector is (a, b, a). Let's compute P squared acting on this vector.

Row 1: (1/2 a) + 0*b + (1/2 a) = (a + a)/2 = a.
Row 2: 0*a + 1*b + 0*a = b.
Row 3: (1/2 a) + 0*b + (1/2 a) = a.

So the result is (a, b, a), which is the same as the original vector. So this suggests that any vector of the form (a, b, a) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. So eigenvalue 1 has multiplicity 2?

Wait, wait, that can't be right because the trace is 2 and the sum of the eigenvalues from P squared's perspective would be 1 (from e2) plus 1 (from another eigenvector) plus another eigenvalue, which would make the sum 1+1 + x = 2 → x=0.

Wait, let me check. The trace of P squared is 2, so sum of eigenvalues is 2.

We already have two eigenvalues of 1, so the third must be 0.

So the eigenvalues of P squared are 1, 1, and 0.

Wait, but wait, how can that be? Because for a symmetric matrix, the rank is the number of non-zero eigenvalues. The matrix P squared has elements where row 2 is [0,1,0], which affects the rank.

Wait, let me compute the determinant of P squared. If the eigenvalues are 1,1,0, the determinant is 0.

Let me compute the determinant of P squared.

P squared matrix:

Row 1: [1/2, 0, 1/2]
Row 2: [0, 1, 0]
Row 3: [1/2, 0, 1/2]

So determinant:

= 1/2 * (1 * 1/2 - 0 * 0) - 0*(...) + 1/2 * (0 * 0 - 1 * 1/2 )

Wait, expanding along the second row because it has a zero which might make it easier.

The determinant is:

0 * something + 1 * minor - 0 * something.

The minor for the (2,2) element is the determinant of the submatrix:

[1/2, 1/2]
[1/2, 1/2]

Which is (1/2 * 1/2) - (1/2 * 1/2) = 0.

So the determinant is 1 * 0 = 0.

Which makes sense because one of the eigenvalues is zero.

So the eigenvalues of P squared are 1, 1, 0.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of P are the square roots of these, but considering that P is Hermitian (since it's a symmetric matrix), its eigenvalues are real.

So P's eigenvalues are sqrt(1)=1, -1, and 0.

Because when you square them, you get 1, 1, and 0.

So the possible eigenvalues for P are 1, -1, 0.

So when measuring P, the possible outcomes are 1, -1, or 0.

Now, the problem states that we are measuring P first and getting 0. So the state collapses into the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Then, we measure Q, which has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

Wait, but the matrix Q is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: 1, 0, -1.

So the question is, what is the probability of getting P=0 and then Q=-1.

So first, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, because when P is measured and gives 0, the state collapses into that eigenspace.

So let's find the eigenvectors for P with eigenvalue 0.

The eigenvectors satisfy (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the matrix P is:

[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

We can write the equations for P v = 0.

Let me denote the components of v as (x, y, z).

So the equations are:

1. (0)x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0 z = 0 → (1/sqrt(2)) y = 0 → y = 0.

2. (1/sqrt(2)) x + 0 y + (1/sqrt(2)) z = 0 → (x + z)/sqrt(2) = 0 → x + z = 0 → z = -x.

3. 0 x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0 z = 0 → same as equation 1, which gives y=0.

So the eigenvectors for P=0 are vectors where y=0 and z= -x.

So the eigenvectors can be written as [x, 0, -x] = x [1, 0, -1].

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by [1, 0, -1]. But we need to normalize it.

The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so when you measure P and get 0, the state collapses into this eigenvector, up to a scalar multiple.

But wait, the initial state is ( -1, 2, 1 )^T. We need to normalize it first. Oh right, earlier I calculated that the state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So the initial state is |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6).

Now, when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 1, -1, 0. The probabilities are given by the projection of |ψ> onto each eigenspace.

But since the eigenspace for P=0 is one-dimensional, the probability of getting 0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |ψ> and the eigenvector of P=0.

The eigenvector for P=0 is |0> = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

So the inner product <0|ψ> is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * ( (-1) ) + (0) * 2 + ( (-1)/sqrt(2) ) * 1 )

= [ (-1)/sqrt(2) ) + ( -1 * 1 ) / sqrt(2) ]

= [ (-1 -1 ) / sqrt(2) )

= (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, wait, that can't be right because when you take the absolute value squared, it should be a probability between 0 and 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute <0|ψ>.

|0> is [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2)
|ψ> is [-1, 2, 1]/sqrt(6)

So <0|ψ> is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0*2 + ( (-1)/sqrt(2) ) * 1 → 

= [ (-1)/sqrt(2) ) + ( (-1)/sqrt(2) ) ]

= [ (-2)/sqrt(2) ) ] = (-2)/(√2) ) = -√2.

Wait, wait, the absolute value squared is ( (-√2) )^2 = 2. But that can't be because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the normalization. Let me recheck.

The eigenvector for P=0 is (1, 0, -1), which has a norm of sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

The initial state |ψ> is ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6).

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1)/sqrt(6) + 0 * 2/sqrt(6) + ( (-1)/sqrt(2) ) * (1)/sqrt(6 )

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(6)) ) ]

= [ (-2) ] / ( sqrt(12) )

Simplify sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2√3.

So (-2)/(2√3) )= (-1)/√3.

The absolute value squared is ( (-1)/√3 )^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.

So after measuring P=0, the state collapses into the eigenvector |0>, which is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

Now, the next step is to measure Q and get outcome -1. Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The eigenstates of Q are the standard basis vectors.

Because the matrix Q is diagonal, its eigenvectors are the basis vectors e1 = (1,0,0), e2=(0,1,0), e3=(0,0,1).

Eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1 for e1, e2, e3 respectively.

So the state after P=0 is |0> = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

We need to find the probability that measuring Q in this state gives -1, which corresponds to the state e3.

The probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude <e3 | 0>.

So <e3 | 0> is (0, 0, 1) multiplied by (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2) → (0 + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2)) = (-1)/sqrt(2).

The absolute value squared is (1/2).

So the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.

But wait, the overall probability is the product of the two probabilities? No, not exactly. Because the first event (measuring P=0) has a probability of 1/3, and given that, the second event (measuring Q=-1) has a probability of 1/2.

So the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial state is |ψ>, and the process is: measure P, get 0 (prob 1/3), then measure Q, get -1 (prob 1/2). So the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the answer is 1/6.

Looking at the options:

A) 1/2 → No.

B) 1/3 → No.

C) 2/3 → No.

D) 1/6 → Yes.

So the correct answer is D.


The state of the system is given as a column vector \((-1, 2, 1)^T\), which is not normalized. Its norm is calculated as:

\[
\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \(P\)
The operator \(P\) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \(P\) are found to be \(1, -1, 0\), and the corresponding eigenvectors are:

- For \(P = 1\): \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\),
- For \(P = -1\): \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\),
- For \(P = 0\): \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}\).

The eigenspace for \(P = 0\) is one-dimensional, spanned by the normalized eigenvector:

\[
|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of measuring \(P = 0\)
The probability of measuring \(P = 0\) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \(|\psi\rangle\) and \(|0\rangle\):

\[
\langle 0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle 0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left(-1 + 0 - 1\right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P=0) = |\langle 0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: State after measuring \(P = 0\)
If \(P = 0\) is measured, the state collapses into the eigenspace of \(P = 0\), which is the normalized eigenvector:

\[
|\phi\rangle = |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Probability of measuring \(Q = -1\) after \(P = 0\)
The operator \(Q\) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \(Q\) are \(1, 0, -1\), and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors:

- \(|1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\),
- \(|0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\),
- \(|-1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\).

The probability of measuring \(Q = -1\) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \(|\phi\rangle\) and \(|-1\rangle\):

\[
\langle -1 | \phi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = |\langle -1 | \phi \rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Total probability
The total probability of measuring \(P = 0\) and then \(Q = -1\) is:

\[
P(P=0 \text{ and } Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \(P = 0\) and \(Q = -1\) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}.
\]

Answer: D
