Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 (which I think is potassium dihydrogen phosphate) and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O (sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate). We're supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-, in this solution at 25°C.

Oh, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given: Ka1 is 7.5x10^-3, Ka2 is 6.2x10^-8, and Ka3 is 1.8x10^-12. I remember that these K values represent the acidity of the different protons in phosphoric acid.

So, first, I think I need to find out the concentrations of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 in the solution. Both are phosphate salts, and when dissolved, they dissociate into ions, which affects the pH and the concentration of PO4^3-.

Let me start by calculating the number of moles for each compound.

Molar mass (Mw) of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / Mw. That would be 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00735 moles.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O, the Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005614 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. Na2HPO4·2H2O. So when it dissolves, does it dissociate into Na+ and HPO4^2-? Let's see: Na2HPO4 → 2Na+ + HPO4^2-.

So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Similarly, KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-.

So the initial solution has H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Now, I think this is a buffer solution because it has a weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, but H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4). So the main species here are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are adjacent in the phosphate ion series.

The pH of the solution will determine which species is more prevalent. Since this is a buffer, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this context, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So first, let's find the pKa for the second dissociation, which is Ka2. Because H2PO4^- is the acid, and it dissociates into HPO4^2- and H+. So the relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)).

Wait, wait, no. pKa is the negative logarithm of Ka. So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that. The log of 6.2 is about 0.79, so log(6.2e-8) is about (0.79 - 8) which is -7.21. So pKa2 is 7.21.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me get that right. pKa is calculated as pKa = -log(Ka). So if Ka is 6.2e-8, then log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So the pKa is 7.2076.

So the pH of the solution will be around this pKa because it's a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Now, I'll use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. The concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution are needed.

Wait, the solution volume is 0.2 liters, so let's compute the concentrations.

Moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 is 0.00735 mol.

Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O is 0.005614 mol.

So their concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00735 / 0.2 = 0.03675 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005614 / 0.2 = 0.02807 M

Wait, but wait. Wait, actually, the Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate completely into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Similarly, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is (0.005614)/(0.00735) ≈ 0.763.

So pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) → pH = 7.2076 + log(0.763).

What's log(0.763)? Well, log(0.763) is the same as log(7.63e-1). Let me think: log(7.63) is about 0.883, so log(0.763)= log(7.63e-1) = 0.883 -1 = -0.117.

So pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.117 ≈ 7.0906.

So the pH is about 7.09.

But wait, does that make sense? Because the solution contains equal amounts of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in terms of moles, but in this case, the moles are not exactly the same. Wait, no, in this problem, the moles of H2PO4^- are about 0.00735 and HPO4^2- are 0.005614. So H2PO4^- is in higher concentration.

Wait, so the pH should be a bit lower than pKa2. Because [base] is less than [acid], so log([base]/[acid]) is negative. So the pH is lower than pKa2, which is correct.

Now, but wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the deprotonated form beyond HPO4^2-. To get PO4^3-, we would need to deprotonate HPO4^2-.

But the solution's pH is about 7.09, which is below the pKa3 of H3PO4, which is Ka3 = 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is about 11.74.

Wait, because pKa3 is -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74.

So at pH 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3, the solution is in a region where HPO4^2- is the dominant species, and the deprotonation to PO4^3- is minimal.

So the concentration of PO4^3- is going to be very low because the solution pH is much lower than pKa3. So I think it's going to be determined by the third dissociation.

Wait, let's think. HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, so the extent of deprotonation is very low.

So perhaps we can model this using the expression for Ka3.

In the solution, [H+] is determined by the pH. We can compute [H+] from pH. pH =7.09 → [H+] = 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

So, the reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka3 is [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-] =1.8e-12.

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We have [HPO4^2-] from earlier, which is 0.02807 M, but wait, that's the initial concentration before any dissociation. But in reality, some of the HPO4^2- will dissociate into PO4^3- and H+.

Wait, but since Ka3 is very small, the degree of dissociation is minimal, so [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02807 M. Because the change would be negligible.

So plugging in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.23e-8) )

Let me compute that.

First, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 ≈ 5.0526e-14.

Denominator: 8.23e-8.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ (5.0526e-14) / (8.23e-8) ≈ 6.14e-7 M.

Wait, but none of the options are exactly that. Let me check the options.

Options are A)6.24e-7, B)5.48e-7, C)2.81e-7, D)3.97e-7.

So 6.14e-7 is close to option A (6.24e-7), but perhaps my calculations have some approximations. Let me go through the exact steps again.

Wait, first let me recalculate the [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] accurately.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007345 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005613 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L.

So [H2PO4^-] = 0.007345 / 0.2 = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

The ratio is 0.028065 / 0.036725 ≈ 0.7638.

So pH = pKa2 + log(0.7638).

pKa2 is 7.2076.

log(0.7638): Let me compute this more accurately.

Log(0.7638) = log(763.8e-3) = log(763.8) - 3.

log(700)=2.8451, log(800)=2.9031.

763.8 is between 700 and 800. Let me approximate.

Compute log(763.8):

Use linear approximation between 700 and 800.

At 700: log(700)=2.8451 (since 10^2.8451 ≈700).

At 800: 2.9031.

So the difference between 700 and 800 is 100, and 763.8 is 63.8 above 700.

So the fraction is 63.8/100 = 0.638.

The difference in log is 2.9031 -2.8451=0.058.

So 0.638 *0.058 ≈0.0369. So log(763.8)=2.8451 +0.0369≈2.8820.

Thus, log(0.7638)=2.8820 -3= -0.118.

So pH=7.2076 -0.118=7.0896, approximately 7.09. So [H+] is 10^-7.09 ≈8.23e-8 M.

Now, for PO4^3- concentration:

Ka3= [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2- ] → [PO4^3- ] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2- ]) / [H+ ]

Plugging the numbers:

Ka3=1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-]=0.028065 M

[H+]=8.23e-8.

So [PO4^3- ] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.23e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.

Divide by denominator: 5.0517e-14 / 8.23e-8 = approx 6.14e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.14e-7. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the division.

Compute 5.0517e-14 / 8.23e-8.

That's 5.0517 /8.23 * 1e-6.

5.0517 /8.23 ≈0.614.

So 0.614e-6 →6.14e-7.

Hmm, but option A is 6.24e-7, which is a bit higher. Did I make a miscalculation somewhere?

Wait, perhaps the initial moles are more precise.

Wait, let's recompute the moles precisely.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol.

136.09 is approximately 136.09 → 1/136.09 = approx 0.007345 mol.

But let me compute it more accurately. 136.09 × 0.007345 → 1.00? Let me just take 1.00/136.09 = 0.007345 mol.

Similarly, 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005614 mol.

Wait, perhaps the way I calculated [H+] is a bit off.

Wait, pH =7.09 → [H+] =10^-7.09.

10^-7 is 1e-7, and 10^-0.09 is about 0.823, since log(0.823) ≈-0.087. Wait, let me compute 10^-0.09 accurately.

Using a calculator approximation: 10^0.09 = approx 1.23 → 10^-0.09 ≈ 0.812.

Wait, but wait, 10^0.09 is e^(0.09 * ln10) ≈e^(0.09*2.302585)≈e^(0.20723)≈1.230 → 10^0.09≈1.230 → 10^-0.09 ≈1/1.230 ≈0.813.

So [H+] = 0.813e-7 → 8.13e-8 M.

Wait, earlier I said 8.23e-8, perhaps a miscalculation there. Let me double-check.

pH=7.09 → [H+]=10^-7.09 =10^(-7 -0.09)=10^-7 *10^-0.09= (1e-7) * 0.813 → 8.13e-8 M.

So [H+]=8.13e-8.

So now, let's recompute [PO4^3-].

(1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.13e-8) = ?

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.

Divide by 8.13e-8: 5.0517e-14 /8.13e-8 = 5.0517/(8.13) * 1e-6.

5.0517/8.13 ≈0.6211.

So 0.6211e-6 →6.211e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.21e-7. So that's closer to option A, which is 6.24e-7.

But wait, let me see if there's another approach. Perhaps considering that HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3-.

But then, perhaps the solution is more accurately modeled by considering all equilibria.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way: perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation, and the HPO4^2- concentration comes from the initial salts plus any produced from the second dissociation.

Wait, but the second dissociation is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+. But since we've already considered this in the buffer calculation, perhaps that's covered.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the total phosphate species, but that's getting more complicated.

Wait, but perhaps the initial assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M is incorrect because some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.

But since Ka3 is so small, the dissociation would be very minimal. So the change would be negligible.

So, sticking with the initial approach, [PO4^3-] ≈6.21e-7 M, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7).

But let me think again: perhaps I should also consider that some of the HPO4^2- comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, the second dissociation is H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+. But in the buffer solution, the HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- concentrations are already determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, so the initial assumption about [HPO4^2-] as 0.028065 M is correct.

I think the calculation is correct, so the answer should be approximately 6.2e-7, which corresponds to option A.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Moles of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
   - Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007345 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005614 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Concentrations in solution**:  
   - Volume = \( 200.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.2 \, \text{L} \).  
   - \([H_2PO_4^-] = \frac{0.007345}{0.2} \approx 0.036725 \, \text{M}\).  
   - \([HPO_4^{2-}] = \frac{0.005614}{0.2} \approx 0.028065 \, \text{M}\).

3. **Buffer solution and pH calculation**:  
   - The solution is a buffer containing \( H_2PO_4^- \) (acid) and \( HPO_4^{2-} \) (base).  
   - Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
     \[
     \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]} \right)
     \]  
     Here, \( K_{a2} = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \), so \( \text{p}K_{a2} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076 \).  
     Substituting the concentrations:  
     \[
     \text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log \left( \frac{0.028065}{0.036725} \right)
     \]  
     \[
     \log \left( \frac{0.028065}{0.036725} \right) \approx \log(0.7638) \approx -0.118
     \]  
     \[
     \text{pH} \approx 7.2076 - 0.118 = 7.0896 \, (\text{approximately } 7.09).
     \]

4. **Concentration of PO₄³⁻**:  
   - The dissociation of \( HPO_4^{2-} \) to \( PO_4^{3-} \) is governed by \( K_{a3} = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \).  
   - The equilibrium expression is:  
     \[
     K_{a3} = \frac{[PO_4^{3-}][H^+]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}
     \]  
     Rearranging:  
     \[
     [PO_4^{3-}] = \frac{K_{a3} \cdot [HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H^+]}
     \]  
     From the pH, \( [H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.09} \approx 8.13 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \).  
     Substituting values:  
     \[
     [PO_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028065)}{8.13 \times 10^{-8}}
     \]  
     \[
     [PO_4^{3-}] \approx \frac{5.0517 \times 10^{-14}}{8.13 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.21 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
     \]

5. **Comparison with options**:  
   The calculated concentration of \( PO_4^{3-} \) (\( 6.21 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)) is closest to option A (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 (which I think is potassium dihydrogen phosphate) and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O (sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate). We're supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-, in this solution at 25°C.

Oh, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given: Ka1 is 7.5x10^-3, Ka2 is 6.2x10^-8, and Ka3 is 1.8x10^-12. I remember that these K values represent the acidity of the different protons in phosphoric acid.

So, first, I think I need to find out the concentrations of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 in the solution. Both are phosphate salts, and when dissolved, they dissociate into ions, which affects the pH and the concentration of PO4^3-.

Let me start by calculating the number of moles for each compound.

Molar mass (Mw) of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / Mw. That would be 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00735 moles.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O, the Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005614 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. Na2HPO4·2H2O. So when it dissolves, does it dissociate into Na+ and HPO4^2-? Let's see: Na2HPO4 → 2Na+ + HPO4^2-.

So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Similarly, KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-.

So the initial solution has H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Now, I think this is a buffer solution because it has a weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, but H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4). So the main species here are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are adjacent in the phosphate ion series.

The pH of the solution will determine which species is more prevalent. Since this is a buffer, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this context, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So first, let's find the pKa for the second dissociation, which is Ka2. Because H2PO4^- is the acid, and it dissociates into HPO4^2- and H+. So the relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)).

Wait, wait, no. pKa is the negative logarithm of Ka. So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that. The log of 6.2 is about 0.79, so log(6.2e-8) is about (0.79 - 8) which is -7.21. So pKa2 is 7.21.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me get that right. pKa is calculated as pKa = -log(Ka). So if Ka is 6.2e-8, then log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So the pKa is 7.2076.

So the pH of the solution will be around this pKa because it's a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Now, I'll use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. The concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution are needed.

Wait, the solution volume is 0.2 liters, so let's compute the concentrations.

Moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 is 0.00735 mol.

Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O is 0.005614 mol.

So their concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00735 / 0.2 = 0.03675 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005614 / 0.2 = 0.02807 M

Wait, but wait. Wait, actually, the Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate completely into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Similarly, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is (0.005614)/(0.00735) ≈ 0.763.

So pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) → pH = 7.2076 + log(0.763).

What's log(0.763)? Well, log(0.763) is the same as log(7.63e-1). Let me think: log(7.63) is about 0.883, so log(0.763)= log(7.63e-1) = 0.883 -1 = -0.117.

So pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.117 ≈ 7.0906.

So the pH is about 7.09.

But wait, does that make sense? Because the solution contains equal amounts of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in terms of moles, but in this case, the moles are not exactly the same. Wait, no, in this problem, the moles of H2PO4^- are about 0.00735 and HPO4^2- are 0.005614. So H2PO4^- is in higher concentration.

Wait, so the pH should be a bit lower than pKa2. Because [base] is less than [acid], so log([base]/[acid]) is negative. So the pH is lower than pKa2, which is correct.

Now, but wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the deprotonated form beyond HPO4^2-. To get PO4^3-, we would need to deprotonate HPO4^2-.

But the solution's pH is about 7.09, which is below the pKa3 of H3PO4, which is Ka3 = 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is about 11.74.

Wait, because pKa3 is -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74.

So at pH 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3, the solution is in a region where HPO4^2- is the dominant species, and the deprotonation to PO4^3- is minimal.

So the concentration of PO4^3- is going to be very low because the solution pH is much lower than pKa3. So I think it's going to be determined by the third dissociation.

Wait, let's think. HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, so the extent of deprotonation is very low.

So perhaps we can model this using the expression for Ka3.

In the solution, [H+] is determined by the pH. We can compute [H+] from pH. pH =7.09 → [H+] = 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

So, the reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka3 is [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-] =1.8e-12.

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We have [HPO4^2-] from earlier, which is 0.02807 M, but wait, that's the initial concentration before any dissociation. But in reality, some of the HPO4^2- will dissociate into PO4^3- and H+.

Wait, but since Ka3 is very small, the degree of dissociation is minimal, so [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02807 M. Because the change would be negligible.

So plugging in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.23e-8) )

Let me compute that.

First, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 ≈ 5.0526e-14.

Denominator: 8.23e-8.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ (5.0526e-14) / (8.23e-8) ≈ 6.14e-7 M.

Wait, but none of the options are exactly that. Let me check the options.

Options are A)6.24e-7, B)5.48e-7, C)2.81e-7, D)3.97e-7.

So 6.14e-7 is close to option A (6.24e-7), but perhaps my calculations have some approximations. Let me go through the exact steps again.

Wait, first let me recalculate the [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] accurately.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007345 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005613 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L.

So [H2PO4^-] = 0.007345 / 0.2 = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

The ratio is 0.028065 / 0.036725 ≈ 0.7638.

So pH = pKa2 + log(0.7638).

pKa2 is 7.2076.

log(0.7638): Let me compute this more accurately.

Log(0.7638) = log(763.8e-3) = log(763.8) - 3.

log(700)=2.8451, log(800)=2.9031.

763.8 is between 700 and 800. Let me approximate.

Compute log(763.8):

Use linear approximation between 700 and 800.

At 700: log(700)=2.8451 (since 10^2.8451 ≈700).

At 800: 2.9031.

So the difference between 700 and 800 is 100, and 763.8 is 63.8 above 700.

So the fraction is 63.8/100 = 0.638.

The difference in log is 2.9031 -2.8451=0.058.

So 0.638 *0.058 ≈0.0369. So log(763.8)=2.8451 +0.0369≈2.8820.

Thus, log(0.7638)=2.8820 -3= -0.118.

So pH=7.2076 -0.118=7.0896, approximately 7.09. So [H+] is 10^-7.09 ≈8.23e-8 M.

Now, for PO4^3- concentration:

Ka3= [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2- ] → [PO4^3- ] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2- ]) / [H+ ]

Plugging the numbers:

Ka3=1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-]=0.028065 M

[H+]=8.23e-8.

So [PO4^3- ] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.23e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.

Divide by denominator: 5.0517e-14 / 8.23e-8 = approx 6.14e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.14e-7. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the division.

Compute 5.0517e-14 / 8.23e-8.

That's 5.0517 /8.23 * 1e-6.

5.0517 /8.23 ≈0.614.

So 0.614e-6 →6.14e-7.

Hmm, but option A is 6.24e-7, which is a bit higher. Did I make a miscalculation somewhere?

Wait, perhaps the initial moles are more precise.

Wait, let's recompute the moles precisely.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol.

136.09 is approximately 136.09 → 1/136.09 = approx 0.007345 mol.

But let me compute it more accurately. 136.09 × 0.007345 → 1.00? Let me just take 1.00/136.09 = 0.007345 mol.

Similarly, 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005614 mol.

Wait, perhaps the way I calculated [H+] is a bit off.

Wait, pH =7.09 → [H+] =10^-7.09.

10^-7 is 1e-7, and 10^-0.09 is about 0.823, since log(0.823) ≈-0.087. Wait, let me compute 10^-0.09 accurately.

Using a calculator approximation: 10^0.09 = approx 1.23 → 10^-0.09 ≈ 0.812.

Wait, but wait, 10^0.09 is e^(0.09 * ln10) ≈e^(0.09*2.302585)≈e^(0.20723)≈1.230 → 10^0.09≈1.230 → 10^-0.09 ≈1/1.230 ≈0.813.

So [H+] = 0.813e-7 → 8.13e-8 M.

Wait, earlier I said 8.23e-8, perhaps a miscalculation there. Let me double-check.

pH=7.09 → [H+]=10^-7.09 =10^(-7 -0.09)=10^-7 *10^-0.09= (1e-7) * 0.813 → 8.13e-8 M.

So [H+]=8.13e-8.

So now, let's recompute [PO4^3-].

(1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.13e-8) = ?

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.

Divide by 8.13e-8: 5.0517e-14 /8.13e-8 = 5.0517/(8.13) * 1e-6.

5.0517/8.13 ≈0.6211.

So 0.6211e-6 →6.211e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.21e-7. So that's closer to option A, which is 6.24e-7.

But wait, let me see if there's another approach. Perhaps considering that HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3-.

But then, perhaps the solution is more accurately modeled by considering all equilibria.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way: perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation, and the HPO4^2- concentration comes from the initial salts plus any produced from the second dissociation.

Wait, but the second dissociation is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+. But since we've already considered this in the buffer calculation, perhaps that's covered.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the total phosphate species, but that's getting more complicated.

Wait, but perhaps the initial assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M is incorrect because some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.

But since Ka3 is so small, the dissociation would be very minimal. So the change would be negligible.

So, sticking with the initial approach, [PO4^3-] ≈6.21e-7 M, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7).

But let me think again: perhaps I should also consider that some of the HPO4^2- comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, the second dissociation is H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+. But in the buffer solution, the HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- concentrations are already determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, so the initial assumption about [HPO4^2-] as 0.028065 M is correct.

I think the calculation is correct, so the answer should be approximately 6.2e-7, which corresponds to option A.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Moles of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
   - Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007345 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005614 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Concentrations in solution**:  
   - Volume = \( 200.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.2 \, \text{L} \).  
   - \([H_2PO_4^-] = \frac{0.007345}{0.2} \approx 0.036725 \, \text{M}\).  
   - \([HPO_4^{2-}] = \frac{0.005614}{0.2} \approx 0.028065 \, \text{M}\).

3. **Buffer solution and pH calculation**:  
   - The solution is a buffer containing \( H_2PO_4^- \) (acid) and \( HPO_4^{2-} \) (base).  
   - Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
     \[
     \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]} \right)
     \]  
     Here, \( K_{a2} = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \), so \( \text{p}K_{a2} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076 \).  
     Substituting the concentrations:  
     \[
     \text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log \left( \frac{0.028065}{0.036725} \right)
     \]  
     \[
     \log \left( \frac{0.028065}{0.036725} \right) \approx \log(0.7638) \approx -0.118
     \]  
     \[
     \text{pH} \approx 7.2076 - 0.118 = 7.0896 \, (\text{approximately } 7.09).
     \]

4. **Concentration of PO₄³⁻**:  
   - The dissociation of \( HPO_4^{2-} \) to \( PO_4^{3-} \) is governed by \( K_{a3} = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \).  
   - The equilibrium expression is:  
     \[
     K_{a3} = \frac{[PO_4^{3-}][H^+]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}
     \]  
     Rearranging:  
     \[
     [PO_4^{3-}] = \frac{K_{a3} \cdot [HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H^+]}
     \]  
     From the pH, \( [H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.09} \approx 8.13 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \).  
     Substituting values:  
     \[
     [PO_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028065)}{8.13 \times 10^{-8}}
     \]  
     \[
     [PO_4^{3-}] \approx \frac{5.0517 \times 10^{-14}}{8.13 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.21 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
     \]

5. **Comparison with options**:  
   The calculated concentration of \( PO_4^{3-} \) (\( 6.21 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)) is closest to option A (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).
