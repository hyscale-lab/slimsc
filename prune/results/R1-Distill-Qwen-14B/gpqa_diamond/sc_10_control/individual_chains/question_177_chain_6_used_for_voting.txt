Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I need to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. 

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh wait, and the mass is also 1.5 times larger. But wait, the question is about luminosity, which I think relates more to radius and temperature, not mass. But maybe mass isn't directly relevant here unless it's affecting temperature somehow. I'll keep that in mind.

The problem mentions that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, they must have the same temperature. So T1 = T2. That's important because when calculating luminosity, temperature plays a big role.

Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both stars are black bodies, this should apply. Oh, wait, but wait: the formula is L proportional to R² T⁴. So since L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth, I can write L1 / L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴).

But since T1 equals T2, the T terms would cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. Since R1 is 1.5 R2, that would make L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the factor is 2.25, which is option A. But wait, I think I'm missing something. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm. Wait, how does radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Oh, redshift! Because when a star moves away, its light is redshifted, and when moving towards us, blueshifted. If they have the same intrinsic peak wavelength, but Star_2 is moving towards or away, their observed wavelengths would differ. But the question states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that must account for any Doppler shift, right?

So what's going on here? Let's think. If Star_2 is moving, its observed wavelength would be different. So to have the same observed λ_max, their intrinsic temperatures must adjust according to their velocities. Because the observed λ_max is the intrinsic λ_max multiplied by the Doppler factor. 

Wait, the Doppler effect for light: when a source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). The formula is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), but wait, I think it's actually λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c), if v is positive when moving away. Or is it the other way around? Wait, when the source is moving away, v is positive, and λ_obs is longer. So the formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c), but wait, that's an approximation for small velocities compared to c. Alternatively, the relativistic formula is sqrt( (1+v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but if v is 700 km/s, which is much less than c (which is about 3e5 km/s), so the approximation might be okay.

So Star_1 has v = 0, so its observed λ is same as emitted. Star_2 has v = 700 km/s, but wait, is that moving towards or away? Because if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ would be shorter (blueshifted), and if moving away, longer (redshifted). Wait, the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So wait, radial velocity usually is positive when moving away. So if Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, that means it's moving away from us. So its observed λ would be longer (redshifted) by a factor of (1 + 700/(3e5)).

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So the intrinsic λ_emit for each star must be such that when multiplied by their Doppler shifts, they result in the same observed λ.

So let me write that down. Let λ_obs be the same for both stars. Then:

For Star_1: λ1_obs = λ1_emit * (1 + v1/c) = λ1_emit * (1 + 0) = λ1_emit.

For Star_2: λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c) = λ2_emit * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5) ) 

Because v1 is zero, so λ1_obs = λ1_emit. And the problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5 )

Wait, but let me compute 700e3 / 3e5. 700,000 / 300,000 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333... So 1 + 2.333 is 3.333. Wait, that can't be right because 700e3 is 7e5, wait wait wait. Wait a second, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. c is about 3e5 km/s, which is 3e8 m/s. Wait, wait, no, 3e5 km/s is 300,000 km/s, which is 3e8 m/s. Oh, but 700 km/s is 0.7e3 km/s, which is 0.002333... times c, because 700 / 300,000 is approximately 0.002333. So 700e3 is 700,000 m/s, which is 7e5 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s. So 7e5 / 3e8 = 0.002333. So 1 + 0.002333 ≈ 1.002333.

Ah, I see, I must have messed up the exponents earlier. So the Doppler factor for Star_2 is approximately 1.002333. So, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * 1.002333.

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, and λ1_emit = λ1_obs. So λ1_emit = λ2_emit * 1.002333.

But from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ1_emit = b / T1, λ2_emit = b / T2.

So, substituting, b/T1 = (b/T2) * 1.002333. So T1 = T2 / 1.002333.

Wait, but wait, so T1 is lower than T2? Because if I have T1 = T2 / 1.002333, that's like 0.9977 * T2.

So the temperatures are not equal. Oh, so my initial thought that T1 equals T2 was wrong because I didn't account for the Doppler shift. Oh, that's a crucial point. So the observed λ_max is the same, but the intrinsic λ_emit differs because of the Doppler shift due to their velocities.

So this means that T1 and T2 are different. So now I can't assume T1 equals T2. Hmm, this complicates things because I thought the temperatures were the same, but they're not.

So now I need to find L1/L2, which is proportional to (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

We know R1 is 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 is 1.5.

For T1, from above, T1 = T2 / 1.002333.

So T1 = T2 * (1 - 0.002333) approximately, since 1/1.002333 ≈ 0.997667.

But let's compute more accurately: 1.002333 is 1.002333, so 1/1.002333 ≈ 0.997666.

So T1 ≈ 0.997666 * T2.

So T1^4 ≈ (0.997666)^4 * T2^4.

Let's compute (0.997666)^4.

Hmm, let me calculate 0.997666^2 first.

0.997666 * 0.997666 ≈ (1 - 0.002334)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002334 + (0.002334)^2 ≈ 0.99273, ignoring the last term as it's negligible.

Then (0.99273)^2 ≈ (approx 0.99273 * 0.99273).

Let me compute 0.99 * 0.99 = 0.9801. 0.99273 is a bit higher. 0.99273^2 = ?

Compute 99273 * 99273, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, approximate.

More accurately, since 0.99273 is close to 0.99, but let's compute 0.99273^2.

(0.99273)^2 = (approx) 0.98555. Let me check: 0.99^2=0.9801, 0.9927^2= (0.99 + 0.0027)^2 = 0.99² + 2*0.99*0.0027 + (0.0027)^2 = 0.9801 + 0.005298 + 0.000007 ≈ 0.985405.

So perhaps 0.9854.

So (0.997666)^4 ≈ (0.997666^2)^2 ≈ (0.99533)^2 ≈ approx 0.9907.

Wait, maybe I should just compute 0.997666^4 directly. Or perhaps use logarithms.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just calculate it accurately.

Wait, let me calculate 0.997666^4 using a calculator approach, but since I don't have a calculator, maybe I can approximate.

Let me compute ln(0.997666) ≈ -0.002336 (since ln(1-x) ≈ -x for small x). So ln(T1/T2) = ln(0.997666) ≈ -0.002336.

So ln(T1^4 / T2^4 ) = 4 * (-0.002336) ≈ -0.009344.

So T1^4 / T2^4 = e^(-0.009344) ≈ 1 - 0.009344 = 0.990656.

Wait, but e^(-x) ≈ 1 -x + x²/2 - ... for small x. So x=0.009344. x² is 0.0000872. So e^-x ≈ 1 - 0.009344 + 0.0000872/2 ≈ 1 -0.009344 + 0.0000436 ≈ 0.99070.

So approximately 0.9907.

So T1^4 ≈ 0.9907 T2^4.

So now, let's plug into the luminosity ratio.

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * ( 0.9907 T2^4 ) / T2^4 )

Simplify: (1.5^2) * 0.9907 = (2.25) * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229.

Approximately 2.23, which is option D. But wait, the options are A) 2.25, B)2.32, C)2.35, D)2.23.

Wait, but earlier I thought the Doppler effect had a negligible impact because 700 km/s is small compared to c. So when I first thought the temperatures were the same, I got 2.25. But considering the Doppler shift, the temperature of Star_1 is a bit lower than Star_2. So the luminosity would be a bit less than 2.25. So 2.23 is option D.

So the correct factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L \propto R^2 T^4
\]

### Step 1: Relating the observed wavelengths
The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Using Wien's law, the intrinsic peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} \propto \frac{1}{T}
\]

For Star_1 and Star_2, the observed wavelengths are related by the Doppler effect due to their radial velocities. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

For Star_1, with \(v_1 = 0\), the observed wavelength is equal to the emitted wavelength:  
\[
\lambda_{1,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{1,\text{emit}}
\]

For Star_2, with \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), the observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{2,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Since \(\lambda_{1,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{obs}}\), we equate the emitted wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{1,\text{emit}} = \lambda_{2,\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Using \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), the Doppler factor is:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{1 + 700/300,000}{1 - 700/300,000}} \approx 1.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
\lambda_{1,\text{emit}} = \lambda_{2,\text{emit}} \times 1.002333
\]

From Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto 1/T\), so:

\[
T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1.002333} \approx 0.997666 \, T_2
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

Given \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\), we substitute:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

Substituting \(R_1/R_2 = 1.5\) and \(T_1/T_2 = 0.997666\):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \times (0.997666)^4
\]

First, calculate \((1.5)^2 = 2.25\). Next, calculate \((0.997666)^4\). Using approximations:

\[
(0.997666)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \times 0.9907 = 2.229 \approx 2.23
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.

But since T1 equals T2, the T terms would cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. Since R1 is 1.5 R2, that would make L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the factor is 2.25, which is option A. But wait, I think I'm missing something. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm. Wait, how does radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Oh, redshift! Because when a star moves away, its light is redshifted, and when moving towards us, blueshifted.

Wait, the Doppler effect for light: when a source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). The formula is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), but wait, I think it's actually λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c), if v is positive when moving away. Or is it the other way around?

Because if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ would be shorter (blueshifted), and if moving away, longer (redshifted). Wait, the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So wait, radial velocity usually is positive when moving away. So if Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, that means it's moving away from us. So its observed λ would be longer (redshifted) by a factor of (1 + 700/(3e5)).

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So the intrinsic λ_emit for each star must be such that when multiplied by their Doppler shifts, they result in the same observed λ.

So let me write that down. Let λ_obs be the same for both stars. Then:

For Star_1: λ1_obs = λ1_emit * (1 + v1/c) = λ1_emit * (1 + 0) = λ1_emit.

For Star_2: λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c) = λ2_emit * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5) ) 

Because v1 is zero, so λ1_obs = λ1_emit. And the problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5 )

Wait, but let me compute 700e3 / 3e5. 700,000 / 300,000 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333... So 1 + 2.333 is 3.333. Wait, that can't be right because 700e3 is 7e5, wait wait wait. Wait a second, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. c is about 3e5 km/s, which is 3e8 m/s. Wait, wait, no, 3e5 km/s is 300,000 km/s, which is 3e8 m/s. Oh, but 700 km/s is 0.7e3 km/s, which is 0.002333... times c, because 700 / 300,000 is approximately 0.002333. So 700e3 is 700,000 m/s, which is 7e5 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s. So 7e5 / 3e8 = 0.002333. So 1 + 0.002333 ≈ 1.002333.

Ah, I see, I must have messed up the exponents earlier. So the Doppler factor for Star_2 is approximately 1.002333. So, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * 1.002333.

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, and λ1_emit = λ1_obs. So λ1_emit = λ2_emit * 1.002333.

But from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ1_emit = b / T1, λ2_emit = b / T2.

So, substituting, b/T1 = (b/T2) * 1.002333. So T1 = T2 / 1.002333.

Wait, but wait, so T1 is lower than T2? Because if I have T1 = T2 / 1.002333, that's like 0.9977 * T2.

So the temperatures are not equal. Oh, so my initial thought that T1 equals T2 was wrong because I didn't account for the Doppler shift. Oh, that's a crucial point. So the observed λ_max is the same, but the intrinsic λ_emit differs because of the Doppler shift due to their velocities.

So this means that T1 and T2 are different. So now I can't assume T1 equals T2. Hmm, this complicates things because I thought the temperatures were the same, but they're not.

So now I need to find L1/L2, which is proportional to (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

We know R1 is 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 is 1.5.

For T1, from above, T1 = T2 / 1.002333.

So T1 = T2 * (1 - 0.002333) approximately, since 1/1.002333 ≈ 0.997667.

But let's compute more accurately: 1.002333 is 1.002333, so 1/1.002333 ≈ 0.997666.

So T1 ≈ 0.997666 * T2.

So T1^4 ≈ (0.997666)^4 * T2^4.

Let's compute (0.997666)^4.

Hmm, let me calculate 0.997666^2 first.

0.997666 * 0.997666 ≈ (1 - 0.002334)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002334 + (0.002334)^2 ≈ 0.99273, ignoring the last term as it's negligible.

Then (0.99273)^2 ≈ (approx 0.99273 * 0.99273).

Let me compute 0.99 * 0.99 = 0.9801. 0.99273 is a bit higher. 0.99273^2 = ?

Compute 99273 * 99273, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, approximate.

More accurately, since 0.99273 is close to 0.99, but let's compute 0.99273^2.

(0.99273)^2 = (approx) 0.98555. Let me check: 0.99^2=0.9801, 0.9927^2= (0.99 + 0.0027)^2 = 0.99² + 2*0.99*0.0027 + (0.0027)^2 = 0.9801 + 0.005298 + 0.000007 ≈ 0.985405.

So perhaps 0.9854.

So (0.997666)^4 ≈ (0.997666^2)^2 ≈ (0.99533)^2 ≈ approx 0.9907.

Wait, maybe I should just compute 0.997666^4 directly. Or perhaps use logarithms.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just calculate it accurately.

Wait, let me calculate 0.997666^4 using a calculator approach, but since I don't have a calculator, maybe I can approximate.

Let me compute ln(0.997666) ≈ -0.002336 (since ln(1-x) ≈ -x for small x). So ln(T1/T2) = ln(0.997666) ≈ -0.002336.

So ln(T1^4 / T2^4 ) = 4 * (-0.002336) ≈ -0.009344.

So T1^4 / T2^4 = e^(-0.009344) ≈ 1 - 0.009344 = 0.990656.

Wait, but e^(-x) ≈ 1 -x + x²/2 - ... for small x. So x=0.009344. x² is 0.0000872. So e^-x ≈ 1 - 0.009344 + 0.0000872/2 ≈ 1 -0.009344 + 0.0000436 ≈ 0.99070.

So approximately 0.9907.

So T1^4 ≈ 0.9907 T2^4.

So now, let's plug into the luminosity ratio.

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * ( 0.9907 T2^4 ) / T2^4 )

Simplify: (1.5^2) * 0.9907 = (2.25) * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229.

Approximately 2.23, which is option D. But wait, the options are A) 2.25, B)2.32, C)2.35, D)2.23.

Wait, but earlier I thought the Doppler effect had a negligible impact because 700 km/s is small compared to c. So when I first thought the temperatures were the same, I got 2.25. But considering the Doppler shift, the temperature of Star_1 is a bit lower than Star_2. So the luminosity would be a bit less than 2.25. So 2.23 is option D.

So the correct factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L \propto R^2 T^4
\]

### Step 1: Relating the observed wavelengths
The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Using Wien's law, the intrinsic peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} \propto \frac{1}{T}
\]

For Star_1 and Star_2, the observed wavelengths are related by the Doppler effect due to their radial velocities. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

For Star_1, with \(v_1 = 0\), the observed wavelength is equal to the emitted wavelength:  
\[
\lambda_{1,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{1,\text{emit}}
\]

For Star_2, with \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), the observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{2,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Since \(\lambda_{1,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{obs}}\), we equate the emitted wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{1,\text{emit}} = \lambda_{2,\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Using \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), the Doppler factor is:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{1 + 700/300,000}{1 - 700/300,000}} \approx 1.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
\lambda_{1,\text{emit}} = \lambda_{2,\text{emit}} \times 1.002333
\]

From Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto 1/T\), so:

\[
T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1.002333} \approx 0.997666 \, T_2
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

Given \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\), we substitute:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

Substituting \(R_1/R_2 = 1.5\) and \(T_1/T_2 = 0.997666\):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \times (0.997666)^4
\]

First, calculate \((1.5)^2 = 2.25\). Next, calculate \((0.997666)^4\). Using approximations:

\[
(0.997666)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \times 0.9907 = 2.229 \approx 2.23
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.
