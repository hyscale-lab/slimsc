Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Parallax, right. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that the distance to a star (d) is inversely proportional to its parallax (plx), like d = 1/plx. Oh wait, but I think the exact formula might be plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So yeah, d = 1/plx, where plx is in arcseconds and d is in parsecs.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Let me parse this. It says how the number of stars per unit plx range changes with plx. So, for example, how many stars are there between plx and plx + dplx as plx increases.

If the stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means their actual density in space is uniform. But wait, parallax depends on distance, so the distribution in terms of parallax isn't uniform. So I need to relate the number of stars in a certain range of plx to their distances.

Let's think about it. If stars are uniformly distributed, then the number of stars in a volume element dV would be proportional to dV. Since the volume depends on the cube of distance, right? Because volume is (4/3)πr³, so it's proportional to r³. So the number of stars in a thin spherical shell between radius r and r + dr would be proportional to r² dr, because the surface area of the shell is 4πr² and the thickness is dr. But wait, we're dealing with parallax, which is inversely related to distance.

Let me get this straight. If I have a thin shell at distance d, the volume element is 4πd² dd, considering dd as a small change in distance. So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to 4πd² dd. But since plx is 1/d, d is 1/plx. So substituting d = 1/plx into this.

So number of stars in a shell would be proportional to (4π (1/plx)^2) * (d(1/plx)/dplx) * dplx. Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me think.

Parallax plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. The volume element in terms of plx would involve how d changes with plx. Let's compute the differential distance dd in terms of plx.

dd = derivative of d with respect to plx times dplx. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = (-1/plx²) dplx. But since plx decreases as d increases, maybe I should consider the absolute value, so |dd| = (1/plx²) dplx.

But wait, the number of stars in a given distance shell (d to d + dd) is N = n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density of stars (number per volume). Since stars are uniformly distributed, n is constant.

Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = (1/plx²) dplx, we get:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx
= n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx range (dplx) would be N/dplx = n *4π (1/plx^4).

But the question is about the number per unit plx range. So dN/dplx = n *4π (1/plx^4). So that suggests the number of stars decreases with plx to the fourth power.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4, which would match this. But wait, another thought: is the dependency really 1/plx^4 or 1/plx^3? Because I might have made a mistake in the substitution.

Let me recheck the substitution. Let me express d in terms of plx: d = 1/plx.

The volume element between d and d + dd is 4πd² dd. So substituting d =1/plx, and dd is (1/plx²) dplx (since dd = - (1/plx²) dplx; but taking absolute value for the number of stars), so dd = (1/plx²) dplx.

So the number of stars in the shell is N = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx = n *4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Dividing both sides by dplx, we get dN/dplx = n *4π (1/plx^4). So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is inversely proportional to plx^4. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but another approach: The number of stars per unit volume is uniform, n. The volume up to distance d is (4/3)π d³. So the number of stars up to distance d is N_total = n * (4/3 π d³). But we're interested in the number per unit plx, so dN/dplx.

Expressing N as a function of plx: since d =1/plx, N(plx) = n * (4/3 π (1/plx)^3).

So dN/dplx is the derivative of N with respect to plx. Let me compute that.

dN/dplx = n * (4/3 π) * derivative of (1/plx^3) with respect to plx.

The derivative of 1/x³ is -3/x^4. So,

dN/dplx = n * (4/3 π) * (-3) * (1/plx^4) ) = n * (4/3 π) * (-3) (1/plx^4) ) = n * (-4 π) (1/plx^4).

The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, N decreases, which makes sense. But the magnitude is 4π n / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) is proportional to the volume element \( 4\pi d^2 \, dd \), where \( dd \) is the thickness of the shell. Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume element becomes \( 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \, dd \).

To express \( dd \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \), we note that \( dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \). Substituting this into the volume element gives:

\[
\text{Number of stars in the shell} \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d\text{plx} \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This indicates that the number of stars decreases with parallax as \( \text{plx}^{-4} \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ \( 1/\text{plx}^4 \)**.

Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = (1/plx²) dplx, we get:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx
= n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx range (dplx) would be N/dplx = n *4π (1/plx^4).

But the question is about the number per unit plx range. So dN/dplx = n *4π (1/plx^4). So that suggests the number of stars decreases with plx to the fourth power.

Dividing both sides by dplx, we get dN/dplx = n *4π (1/plx^4). So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is inversely proportional to plx^4. So the answer would be option A.

dN/dplx = n * (4/3 π) * derivative of (1/plx^3) with respect to plx.

The derivative of 1/x³ is -3/x^4. So,

dN/dplx = n * (4/3 π) * (-3) * (1/plx^4) ) = n * (4/3 π) * (-3) (1/plx^4) ) = n * (-4 π) (1/plx^4).

The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, N decreases, which makes sense. But the magnitude is 4π n / plx^4.
