Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about measuring observables P and Q on a quantum state. I remember that when you measure an observable, you get an eigenvalue with a certain probability, and the state collapses to the corresponding eigenstate.

The state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum states, the vectors are usually column vectors with complex numbers, right? But here they're real. Maybe it's normalized? Let me check: the sum of the squares of the elements is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, wait, that's 6. So the state vector isn't normalized yet. So I guess I need to normalize it first before proceeding.

So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. To normalize, I'll divide each component by sqrt(6), so the normalized state becomes |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6))*[ -1; 2; 1 ].

Next, the operators P and Q are given. Let me write down their matrices.

Operator P has the matrix:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Operator Q has the matrix:
Row 1: 1, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, -1.

So Q is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are 1, 0, and -1. So when measuring Q, the possible outcomes are these eigenvalues.

The question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first and then Q. Wait, no, it's the other way around. The question says, "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P". Oh wait no, wait no: the wording is "measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the first measurement is P, then Q.

Wait no, the sequence is: measure P first, then Q. So the procedure is: measure P, get a certain outcome, then measure Q on the new state.

Wait, but the question specifies getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So we need to find the probability that, after measuring P and getting 0, then measuring Q gives -1.

So I think the process goes like this: first, find the possible outcomes of P and the corresponding probabilities. Then, for each outcome, find the probability that Q gives -1 when measuring the new state.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The general approach for sequential measurements is: when you measure the first observable (P), the state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue of the measurement. Then, when you measure the second observable (Q) on this new state, the probability depends on whether the state is an eigenstate of Q or not.

Wait, but wait: P's matrix might not be diagonal, so we need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider each eigenvalue of P and find the corresponding eigenvectors, then compute the probability of each eigenvalue, and then for each, compute the probability of measuring -1 for Q.

But first, let's find the eigenvalues of P. Hmm, but wait, looking at the matrix for P, it looks a bit sparse. Let me write it out:

P = [ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
       [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
       [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]

Hmm, this matrix might be a bit tricky to diagonalize. Alternatively, perhaps we can spot that it's a symmetric matrix, so it should have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that P is a 3x3 matrix, so maybe it's a spin operator or something else, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure. It seems to have non-zero elements only on the super and subdiagonals and the middle-right position. Wait, perhaps it's a tridiagonal matrix but with some specific structure.

Alternatively, maybe the eigenvalues can be found by noticing that P might have some symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the characteristic equation.

The characteristic equation for P is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So let's compute the determinant:

| -λ      1/sqrt(2)      0       |
|1/sqrt(2)   -λ      1/sqrt(2)|
| 0       1/sqrt(2)   -λ      |

Hmm, computing the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let me proceed.

The determinant is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(0) ) ] + 0 [ ... ] 

Wait, the expansion along the first row.

So the determinant = (-λ) * [ ( -λ * -λ ) - (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] 
               - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ) ]
               + 0 * ... (so the last term is zero).

Simplify each term:

First term: (-λ)[ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: -(1/sqrt(2)) [ (-λ / sqrt(2)) ) ] 
= -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ / sqrt(2))
= (1/sqrt(2)) * (λ / sqrt(2))
= λ/(2)

So the determinant is:

(-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 = 0.

Let me expand this:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + λ/2 = 0.

Wait, (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ/2).

So the determinant expression is:

( -λ^3 + (λ/2) ) + ( λ/2 ) = 0.

So combining terms:

-λ^3 + (λ/2 + λ /2) = -λ^3 + λ = 0.

So, -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0.

Thus, the eigenvalues λ are solutions to λ (1 - λ²) = 0 → λ = 0, or λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, that's interesting. So P has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

Wait, but when you measure P, the possible outcomes are these eigenvalues.

So when someone measures P, they can get 1, 0, or -1.

The question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q.

So first, what is the probability of getting 0 when measuring P?

To find that, we need the eigenvector of P corresponding to λ=0, and then compute the inner product of the state |ψ> with this eigenvector.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the probability by projecting |ψ> onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to λ=0.

Wait, but let's first find the eigenvectors for P.

Let me find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

Starting with λ=0:

We solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

The matrix P is:

[ 0      1/√2      0 ]
[1/√2    0        1/√2]
[0      1/√2      0 ]

So we write the equations:

1. 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.
2. (1/√2) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v1 = -v3.
3. 0 v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → v2=0 (same as eqn 1).

So from equation 1 and 3, v2=0. From equation 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is of the form (v1, 0, v3) where v1 = -v3. Let's take v3 = a, then v1 = -a.

So the eigenvector can be written as a* [ -1; 0; 1 ].

Wait, but let me double-check. If I set a=1, then v1= -1, v2=0, v3=1. So the vector is [ -1, 0, 1 ].

Hmm, but let me check if this is an eigenvector:

P * [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.

Calculating each component:

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1) = 0 → correct, since eigenvalue is 0.

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*1 = (-1 + 1)/√2 = 0 → correct.

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1) = 0 → correct.

So yes, [ -1, 0, 1 ] is an eigenvector for λ=0.

But wait, are there other eigenvectors for λ=0? Let's see. The eigenspace is the solution of P|v>=0, so any linear combination of vectors in that space. Let me see, the solution is v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So any vector [a, 0, -a], where a is a scalar. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by [1, 0, -1 ] or any scalar multiple.

Wait, but wait, in our case, the state is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. So when we measure P and get 0, the state collapses into the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0. So the projection of the state onto the eigenspace of P=0 is the amplitude for the 0 outcome.

So the normalized eigenvector for P=0 is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, but wait, let me normalize it. The length is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.

But wait, let me let u = [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T. Then |u> = (1/sqrt(2)) u.

So the probability of measuring 0 for P is the squared magnitude of the inner product between |ψ> and |u>.

Let me compute the inner product:

⟨u | ψ⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ] * [ -1; 2; 1 ].

So it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1 ] = (1/sqrt(2)) (1 + 0 + 1) )= (2)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

Wait, that's the inner product. But wait, |ψ> is already normalized, right? Because |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Wait, okay, let me compute the inner product more accurately.

The inner product is u† |ψ> = [ -1, 0, 1 ] * (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

So it's (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + (1)(1) ] = (1/sqrt(6)) [1 + 0 +1 ] = 2/sqrt(6).

Then the probability is the square of the absolute value: (2/sqrt(6))^2 = 4/6 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

Wait, that's the probability of getting 0 for P. Hmm, so that's 2/3.

But wait, let me think again. Because the eigenvector is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, and the state is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. So the inner product is ( -1*-1 + 0*2 +1*1 ) = (1 + 0 +1) = 2. Then, since the eigenvector is not normalized, its norm is sqrt(2), so the inner product is 2, and the normalized inner product is 2/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )= 2/sqrt(12) )= sqrt(3)/3. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the normalization.

Wait, let me elaborate. The normalized eigenvector for P=0 is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T divided by its norm, which is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(2). So |u> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1; 0; 1 ].

The state |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1; 2; 1 ].

So the inner product is u† ψ = [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ] * [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, |u> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0,1 ]^T, and |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ) * [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1 ].

Which is (1/sqrt(12)) [ 1 + 0 +1 ] = (2)/sqrt(12) )= sqrt(12)/6 = 2/sqrt(12) = sqrt(12)/6 ?

Wait, sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3), so sqrt(12)/6 is (2√3)/6 = √3/3 ≈ 0.577.

So the inner product is sqrt(3)/3. Then the probability is (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = 3/9 = 1/3.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So earlier I had 2/3, but now I'm getting 1/3.

Hmm, which one is correct? Let me double-check.

The inner product u† |ψ> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ] multiplied by (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].

So each component:

-1/sqrt(2) * (-1)/sqrt(6) = (1)/(sqrt(12))
0 * 2/sqrt(6) =0
1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(6) = (1)/(sqrt(12)).

Summing these gives (1 + 0 +1)/sqrt(12) = 2/sqrt(12) = sqrt(12)/6 = (2 * sqrt(3))/6 = sqrt(3)/3.

So the inner product is sqrt(3)/3, and the probability is (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Wait, but wait, I thought earlier that the eigenspace for P=0 is one-dimensional, so the probability is the square of the projection of |ψ> onto that eigenvector. So that's 1/3.

So if I measure P first and get 0, the state collapses to the eigenvector |u>, normalized.

Then I measure Q on this state |u>.

Wait, so Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, -1.

The eigenvectors of Q are the standard basis vectors, because Q is diagonal. So, the eigenvectors are e1 = [1,0,0], e2 = [0,1,0], e3 = [0,0,1], with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1 respectively.

So when I measure Q after the state |u>, which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

The probability of getting -1 is the square of the amplitude of the component of |u> in the e3 direction.

Because e3 corresponds to Q=-1.

So the amplitude is <e3 | u> = (1/sqrt(2)) * 1.

So the probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of measuring -1 for Q after measuring P=0 is 1/2.

So the joint probability is the product of the probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but wait a second. Because when you measure P and get 0, the state becomes |u>, which is an eigenstate of P=0. Then, when you measure Q on |u>, the state |u> is not an eigenstate of Q, so the probability distribution for Q is determined by projecting |u> onto the eigenstates of Q.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |u> is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T multiplied by 1/sqrt(2).

So when you measure Q, which has eigenstates e1, e2, e3, the probability of outcome q is |⟨e_q | u⟩ |².

So for q=-1, it's ⟨e3 | u> squared.

⟨e3 | u> = (1/sqrt(2)) * 1 (since e3 is [0,0,1], and u's third component is 1/sqrt(2)).

So the probability is (1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2.

Therefore, the probability of getting 0 in P and -1 in Q is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

So the answer should be option D) 1/6.

To solve the problem, we analyze the sequence of measurements of observables \( P \) and \( Q \) on the given quantum state. The state vector is initially \(\vert \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\), which is not normalized. Normalizing it, we get:

\[
\vert \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found by solving \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\), which gives \(\lambda = 0, 1, -1\). For \(\lambda = 0\), the eigenvector is determined by solving \(P \vert v \rangle = 0\), leading to the eigenvector:

\[
\vert u \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the squared magnitude of the projection of \(\vert \psi \rangle\) onto \(\vert u \rangle\). The inner product is:

\[
\langle u \vert \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (1 + 1) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P = 0) = \left\vert \langle u \vert \psi \rangle \right\vert^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: Measuring \( Q \) After \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors \(\vert e_1 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\), \(\vert e_2 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\), and \(\vert e_3 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\).

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \(\vert u \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the squared magnitude of the projection of \(\vert u \rangle\) onto \(\vert e_3 \rangle\):

\[
P(Q = -1) = \left\vert \langle e_3 \vert u \rangle \right\vert^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 1\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 4: Joint Probability
The joint probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is the product of the individual probabilities:

\[
P(P = 0, Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about measuring observables P and Q on a quantum state. I remember that when you measure an observable, you get an eigenvalue with a certain probability, and the state collapses to the corresponding eigenstate.

The state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum states, the vectors are usually column vectors with complex numbers, right? But here they're real. Maybe it's normalized? Let me check: the sum of the squares of the elements is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, wait, that's 6. So the state vector isn't normalized yet. So I guess I need to normalize it first before proceeding.

So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. To normalize, I'll divide each component by sqrt(6), so the normalized state becomes |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6))*[ -1; 2; 1 ].

Next, the operators P and Q are given. Let me write down their matrices.

Operator P has the matrix:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Operator Q has the matrix:
Row 1: 1, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, -1.

So Q is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are 1, 0, and -1. So when measuring Q, the possible outcomes are these eigenvalues.

The question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first and then Q. Wait, no, it's the other way around. The question says, "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P". Oh wait no, wait no: the wording is "measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the first measurement is P, then Q.

Wait no, the sequence is: measure P first, then Q. So the procedure is: measure P, get a certain outcome, then measure Q on the new state.

Wait, but the question specifies getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So we need to find the probability that, after measuring P and getting 0, then measuring Q gives -1.

So I think the process goes like this: first, find the possible outcomes of P and the corresponding probabilities. Then, for each outcome, find the probability that Q gives -1 when measuring the new state.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The general approach for sequential measurements is: when you measure the first observable (P), the state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue of the measurement. Then, when you measure the second observable (Q) on this new state, the probability depends on whether the state is an eigenstate of Q or not.

Wait, but wait: P's matrix might not be diagonal, so we need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider each eigenvalue of P and find the corresponding eigenvectors, then compute the probability of each eigenvalue, and then for each, compute the probability of measuring -1 for Q.

But first, let's find the eigenvalues of P. Hmm, but wait, looking at the matrix for P, it looks a bit sparse. Let me write it out:

P = [ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
       [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
       [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]

Hmm, this matrix might be a bit tricky to diagonalize. Alternatively, perhaps we can spot that it's a symmetric matrix, so it should have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that P is a 3x3 matrix, so maybe it's a spin operator or something else, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure. It seems to have non-zero elements only on the super and subdiagonals and the middle-right position. Wait, perhaps it's a tridiagonal matrix but with some specific structure.

Alternatively, maybe the eigenvalues can be found by noticing that P might have some symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the characteristic equation.

The characteristic equation for P is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So let's compute the determinant:

| -λ      1/sqrt(2)      0       |
|1/sqrt(2)   -λ      1/sqrt(2)|
| 0       1/sqrt(2)   -λ      |

Hmm, computing the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let me proceed.

The determinant is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(0) ) ] + 0 [ ... ] 

Wait, the expansion along the first row.

So the determinant = (-λ) * [ ( -λ * -λ ) - (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] 
               - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ) ]
               + 0 * ... (so the last term is zero).

Simplify each term:

First term: (-λ)[ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: -(1/sqrt(2)) [ (-λ / sqrt(2)) ) ] 
= -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ / sqrt(2))
= (1/sqrt(2)) * (λ / sqrt(2))
= λ/(2)

So the determinant is:

(-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 = 0.

Let me expand this:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + λ/2 = 0.

Wait, (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ/2).

So the determinant expression is:

( -λ^3 + (λ/2) ) + ( λ/2 ) = 0.

So combining terms:

-λ^3 + (λ/2 + λ /2) = -λ^3 + λ = 0.

So, -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0.

Thus, the eigenvalues λ are solutions to λ (1 - λ²) = 0 → λ = 0, or λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, that's interesting. So P has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

Wait, but when you measure P, the possible outcomes are these eigenvalues.

So when someone measures P, they can get 1, 0, or -1.

The question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q.

So first, what is the probability of getting 0 when measuring P?

To find that, we need the eigenvector of P corresponding to λ=0, and then compute the inner product of the state |ψ> with this eigenvector.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the probability by projecting |ψ> onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to λ=0.

Wait, but let's first find the eigenvectors for P.

Let me find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

Starting with λ=0:

We solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

The matrix P is:

[ 0      1/√2      0 ]
[1/√2    0        1/√2]
[0      1/√2      0 ]

So we write the equations:

1. 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.
2. (1/√2) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v1 = -v3.
3. 0 v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → v2=0 (same as eqn 1).

So from equation 1 and 3, v2=0. From equation 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is of the form (v1, 0, v3) where v1 = -v3. Let's take v3 = a, then v1 = -a.

So the eigenvector can be written as a* [ -1; 0; 1 ].

Wait, but let me double-check. If I set a=1, then v1= -1, v2=0, v3=1. So the vector is [ -1, 0, 1 ].

Hmm, but let me check if this is an eigenvector:

P * [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.

Calculating each component:

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1) = 0 → correct, since eigenvalue is 0.

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*1 = (-1 + 1)/√2 = 0 → correct.

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1) = 0 → correct.

So yes, [ -1, 0, 1 ] is an eigenvector for λ=0.

But wait, are there other eigenvectors for λ=0? Let's see. The eigenspace is the solution of P|v>=0, so any linear combination of vectors in that space. Let me see, the solution is v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So any vector [a, 0, -a], where a is a scalar. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by [1, 0, -1 ] or any scalar multiple.

Wait, but wait, in our case, the state is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. So when we measure P and get 0, the state collapses into the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0. So the projection of the state onto the eigenspace of P=0 is the amplitude for the 0 outcome.

So the normalized eigenvector for P=0 is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, but wait, let me normalize it. The length is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.

But wait, let me let u = [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T. Then |u> = (1/sqrt(2)) u.

So the probability of measuring 0 for P is the squared magnitude of the inner product between |ψ> and |u>.

Let me compute the inner product:

⟨u | ψ⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ] * [ -1; 2; 1 ].

So it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1 ] = (1/sqrt(2)) (1 + 0 + 1) )= (2)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

Wait, that's the inner product. But wait, |ψ> is already normalized, right? Because |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Wait, okay, let me compute the inner product more accurately.

The inner product is u† |ψ> = [ -1, 0, 1 ] * (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

So it's (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + (1)(1) ] = (1/sqrt(6)) [1 + 0 +1 ] = 2/sqrt(6).

Then the probability is the square of the absolute value: (2/sqrt(6))^2 = 4/6 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

Wait, that's the probability of getting 0 for P. Hmm, so that's 2/3.

But wait, let me think again. Because the eigenvector is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, and the state is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. So the inner product is ( -1*-1 + 0*2 +1*1 ) = (1 + 0 +1) = 2. Then, since the eigenvector is not normalized, its norm is sqrt(2), so the inner product is 2, and the normalized inner product is 2/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )= 2/sqrt(12) )= sqrt(3)/3. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the normalization.

Wait, let me elaborate. The normalized eigenvector for P=0 is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T divided by its norm, which is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(2). So |u> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1; 0; 1 ].

The state |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1; 2; 1 ].

So the inner product is u† ψ = [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ] * [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, |u> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0,1 ]^T, and |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ) * [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1 ].

Which is (1/sqrt(12)) [ 1 + 0 +1 ] = (2)/sqrt(12) )= sqrt(12)/6 = 2/sqrt(12) = sqrt(12)/6 ?

Wait, sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3), so sqrt(12)/6 is (2√3)/6 = √3/3 ≈ 0.577.

So the inner product is sqrt(3)/3. Then the probability is (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = 3/9 = 1/3.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So earlier I had 2/3, but now I'm getting 1/3.

Hmm, which one is correct? Let me double-check.

The inner product u† |ψ> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ] multiplied by (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].

So each component:

-1/sqrt(2) * (-1)/sqrt(6) = (1)/(sqrt(12))
0 * 2/sqrt(6) =0
1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(6) = (1)/(sqrt(12)).

Summing these gives (1 + 0 +1)/sqrt(12) = 2/sqrt(12) = sqrt(12)/6 = (2 * sqrt(3))/6 = sqrt(3)/3.

So the inner product is sqrt(3)/3, and the probability is (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Wait, but wait, I thought earlier that the eigenspace for P=0 is one-dimensional, so the probability is the square of the projection of |ψ> onto that eigenvector. So that's 1/3.

So if I measure P first and get 0, the state collapses to the eigenvector |u>, normalized.

Then I measure Q on this state |u>.

Wait, so Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, -1.

The eigenvectors of Q are the standard basis vectors, because Q is diagonal. So, the eigenvectors are e1 = [1,0,0], e2 = [0,1,0], e3 = [0,0,1], with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1 respectively.

So when I measure Q after the state |u>, which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

The probability of getting -1 is the square of the amplitude of the component of |u> in the e3 direction.

Because e3 corresponds to Q=-1.

So the amplitude is <e3 | u> = (1/sqrt(2)) * 1.

So the probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of measuring -1 for Q after measuring P=0 is 1/2.

So the joint probability is the product of the probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but wait a second. Because when you measure P and get 0, the state becomes |u>, which is an eigenstate of P=0. Then, when you measure Q on |u>, the state |u> is not an eigenstate of Q, so the probability distribution for Q is determined by projecting |u> onto the eigenstates of Q.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |u> is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T multiplied by 1/sqrt(2).

So when you measure Q, which has eigenstates e1, e2, e3, the probability of outcome q is |⟨e_q | u⟩ |².

So for q=-1, it's ⟨e3 | u> squared.

⟨e3 | u> = (1/sqrt(2)) * 1 (since e3 is [0,0,1], and u's third component is 1/sqrt(2)).

So the probability is (1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2.

Therefore, the probability of getting 0 in P and -1 in Q is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

So the answer should be option D) 1/6.


To solve the problem, we analyze the sequence of measurements of observables \( P \) and \( Q \) on the given quantum state. The state vector is initially \(\vert \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\), which is not normalized. Normalizing it, we get:

\[
\vert \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found by solving \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\), which gives \(\lambda = 0, 1, -1\). For \(\lambda = 0\), the eigenvector is determined by solving \(P \vert v \rangle = 0\), leading to the eigenvector:

\[
\vert u \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the squared magnitude of the projection of \(\vert \psi \rangle\) onto \(\vert u \rangle\). The inner product is:

\[
\langle u \vert \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (1 + 1) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P = 0) = \left\vert \langle u \vert \psi \rangle \right\vert^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: Measuring \( Q \) After \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors \(\vert e_1 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\), \(\vert e_2 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\), and \(\vert e_3 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\).

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \(\vert u \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the squared magnitude of the projection of \(\vert u \rangle\) onto \(\vert e_3 \rangle\):

\[
P(Q = -1) = \left\vert \langle e_3 \vert u \rangle \right\vert^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 1\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 4: Joint Probability
The joint probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is the product of the individual probabilities:

\[
P(P = 0, Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:
