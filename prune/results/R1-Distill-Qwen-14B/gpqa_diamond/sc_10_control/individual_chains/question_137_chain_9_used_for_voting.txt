Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm trying to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, the question is about a proton injected into a synchrocyclotron with negligible kinetic energy at t=0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I think I remember that in cyclotrons, particles move in a magnetic field, and they get accelerated each time they pass through the electric field. The frequency of the applied voltage has to match the particle's cyclotron frequency for effective acceleration. But wait, this is a synchrocyclotron, which I think is a type of cyclotron where the magnetic field isn't constant—it actually changes to keep the cyclotron frequency in sync with the accelerating frequency. So, maybe the magnetic field is adjusted as the proton's energy increases.

Wait, but the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo and they mean two half-cycles? Or does it mean two steps of acceleration? Hmm, maybe I should think about how the energy gain works.

The voltage given is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. So the frequency ν(α) might be a function of the particle's momentum, which in turn depends on its kinetic energy. But since the proton is being accelerated, the frequency of the voltage probably needs to adjust as the proton's speed changes.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about what I know about cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons.

In a cyclotron, a charged particle moves in a circular path under the influence of a magnetic field. The frequency at which the particle revolves is the cyclotron frequency, which is given by f = qB/(2πm), where q is the charge, B is the magnetic field, and m is the mass.

The electric field in the gaps between the dees accelerates the particle each half-period. So, each time the particle passes through the gap, it gains energy. The voltage applied is such that the electric field E is related to the voltage by E = U0/(d), where d is the distance between the dees (but maybe that's not directly needed here).

In a synchrocyclotron, to keep the resonance condition (so that each acceleration step is in phase), the magnetic field isn't constant. As the particle gains energy and its mass effectively increases (since relativistic effects make the mass larger), the magnetic field is adjusted to maintain the cyclotron frequency matching the applied frequency. So the frequency ν(α) in the voltage equation depends on the particle's energy.

But wait, the problem states that the proton undergoes two accelerations. So maybe it only gets accelerated twice? Or does it undergo two full cycles? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of times the voltage completes a cycle, which relates to the time it takes to reach the desired energy.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of energy gained. Each time the proton goes through the potential difference, it gains kinetic energy. But in a cyclotron, each time it passes through the gap, it's accelerated once per half-cycle. So for each full cycle of the voltage, the proton is accelerated twice.

So the energy gain per revolution (each revolution is a full cycle of the voltage) would be 2 * e * U0, where e is the proton charge. But wait, wait, because the voltage is alternating, so the maximum potential difference is U0, but the effective energy gain per pass depends on how the voltage is applied.

Wait, no. The maximum energy gain per pass is e * U0. Because the particle is accelerated each time it crosses the gap. So if the voltage is V, the maximum energy gain possible per cycle is 2eV, because each half-cycle (when the field is in the right direction) gives eV. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, the potential is given as U(t) = U0 cos[...], so the maximum voltage across the gap is U0. So each time the particle crosses the gap, the energy change is e * U0 multiplied by the cosine term. The maximum possible energy gain each time is e*U0, but the actual energy gain depends on the phase when the particle passes through.

But in a synchrocyclotron, the system is designed so that every time the particle passes through the gap, the electric field is in the direction to accelerate it. So each time, the particle gains e * U0. Because the phase is matched, so the maximum is achieved each time.

Wait, but the initial phase is Φ0 = π/4. So at t=0, the voltage is U(0) = U0 cos(Φ0) = U0 cos(π/4) = (U0)(√2/2) ≈ 0.707 * U0. So when the proton first enters the gap, the voltage is at that value. But if the voltage is applied in such a way that the electric field is maximum in the direction of acceleration, perhaps each time the proton passes, it's at the peak of the voltage.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the problem again.

The key points are:

- The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (T ≈ 0), so initially, it's non-relativistic.
- It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV.
Wait, two accelerations? So it gains energy twice? Or two full cycles, meaning two times e U0 each? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the proton makes multiple revolutions, each time being accelerated each time it passes through the gap (twice per revolution), so the number of revolutions times two gives the number of acceleration steps.

Wait, but the problem states that it undergoes two accelerations. So perhaps it's accelerated twice to reach 950 MeV. So each acceleration gives an energy gain of eU0, but considering relativistic effects, maybe?

Wait, but 950 MeV is a huge amount of energy for a proton. Let me compute how much kinetic energy that corresponds to.

The rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV. So 950 MeV is just a bit above that. So it's a highly relativistic particle. But the initial kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is about 938 MeV initially.

Wait, but when the proton gains kinetic energy, its total energy increases. So in the end, the total energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) = m c^2 + K, where K is the kinetic energy. So for K=950 MeV, the total energy is about 950 + 938 = 1888 MeV ≈ 1.888 GeV.

But maybe I don't need to worry about that right now.

So, the problem is about how many times the proton goes around the synchrocyclotron before reaching 950 MeV.

Wait, but to find the number of revolutions, I need to know how much energy is gained per revolution and how much time passes, and how that relates to the number of revolutions.

Wait, but the voltage is time-dependent, which complicates things because the frequency ν(α) is a function of the particle's momentum. So the frequency changes as the proton gains energy.

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Maybe I should look for a formula that relates the number of revolutions to the energy gained.

I remember that the number of revolutions N is given by the total change in the phase of the voltage divided by 2π. Because each revolution corresponds to an increase in phase by 2π.

Wait, because the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(2πν(α) t + Φ0). The phase at time t is 2π ν(α) t + Φ0. So the total phase change after time t is 2π ν(α) t. So the number of revolutions N is the total phase change divided by 2π, which is N = ν(α) t.

But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency ν(α) is a function of the particle's momentum, which changes as it gains energy.

So, the idea is to integrate over time, considering how the frequency ν changes with time as the proton gains energy.

But this sounds complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, perhaps the total number of revolutions is given by the total change in the phase divided by 2π.

The phase at time t is 2π ν(α) t + Φ0.

The total phase change from t=0 to t=T is 2π ν(α) T + Φ0 - Φ0 = 2π ν(α) T.

But since ν(α) is a function of time, integrating could be necessary. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe ν(α) is such that it's in resonance with the particle's motion. So the frequency ν(α) is equal to the cyclotron frequency, which depends on the momentum.

Wait, the cyclotron frequency is f = (q B)/(2 π m), but in a synchrocyclotron, B is adjusted so that f remains equal to the driving frequency ν. So as the particle gains energy, B is varied to keep this condition.

But I'm not sure how to use this.

Wait, another approach: in a cyclotron, the time for each revolution is the period, T = 2π/(q B / (m)). So the period depends on the magnetic field. But in a synchrocyclotron, the B field changes to keep the period synchronized with the voltage's period.

Wait, perhaps the number of revolutions is directly linked to the energy gain.

Wait, but the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. So maybe it's accelerated twice, each time gaining some energy. But to reach 950 MeV, each acceleration would contribute 950/2 = 475 MeV. But that would mean each acceleration gives 475 MeV, which is more than the rest mass energy. That seems odd because the initial energy is very low.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again.

The problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. So, two acceleration steps, each providing some energy. So each acceleration step gives a certain energy.

Wait, but in a cyclotron, each time the proton passes through the gap, it's accelerated once per half-cycle. So each full cycle gives two accelerations. So if the total number of acceleration steps is two, it's a single cycle, giving two accelerations, leading to two energy gains.

Wait, then the total energy is 2 * e * U0, because each acceleration gives eU0.

Wait, but wait, e is the charge of the proton, which is 1.6e-19 coulombs. U0 is 190 kV, which is 190,000 volts.

So the energy per acceleration step is e * U0 = 1.6e-19 C * 190e3 V = 1.6e-19 * 190e3 = approximately 3.04e-14 J. Converting to eV: 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 3.04e-14 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV ≈ 1.9e5 eV, which is 190,000 eV or 190 keV.

Wait, so each acceleration step gives 190 keV. So two acceleration steps would give 380 keV, which is 380 MeV if I'm not mistaken. But the problem says the proton reaches 950 MeV. So two steps would only give 380 MeV. So that doesn't add up. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe each full cycle of the voltage (which is 2π) gives two acceleration steps, so each cycle adds 2 * e * U0.

Wait, let's compute that. Each cycle gives two acceleration steps, each adding e U0. So per cycle, 2 e U0.

So each cycle (one revolution) adds 2 * 190 keV = 380 keV. So to reach 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV, I need N = 950,000 / 380 ≈ 2500 cycles. So 2500 revolutions.

Wait, that would suggest the answer is D) 2500. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Because that's assuming the voltage is applied at maximum every time, and that each cycle adds 380 keV. But wait, 950,000 divided by 380 is 950,000 / 380 = approximately 2500. So that's what D says.

But wait, the initial phase is Φ0 = π/4. So the very first acceleration isn't at maximum. So perhaps the first acceleration is a bit less than U0. So that might affect the total number of revolutions.

Hmm, that complicates things. Because the first acceleration isn't maximum. So perhaps the energy gain per cycle isn't exactly 380 keV, but a bit less. So maybe the number of revolutions is a bit more than 2500.

Looking at the options, the closest higher option is C) 3536 or B) 5300. Wait, but 2500 is an option. So perhaps the initial phase doesn't affect the number of revolutions because it's just a phase shift, and the total phase after all the revolutions is what counts.

Wait, another approach: in a synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions N is given by the total phase change divided by 2π. The phase change is the integral of 2π ν(α) dt from t=0 to t=T, where T is the time when the proton reaches 950 MeV.

But since ν(α) depends on the momentum, which depends on the energy, which is a function of time, this integral might not be straightforward. But perhaps, under certain approximations, we can find a relation.

Wait, in the case of a cyclotron, the frequency of the accelerating voltage must match the cyclotron frequency. So the condition is that ν(α) = (q B(t))/(2 π m) ), but since B(t) is adjusted to keep this equality, the frequency is matched.

The energy of the proton is related to its momentum. For a relativistic particle, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). But perhaps, for a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is adjusted so that the cyclotron frequency remains in resonance with the accelerating frequency.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I can think of the number of revolutions as the total phase change divided by 2π. That is, N = (1/2π) ∫ 2π ν(t) dt from 0 to T = ∫ ν(t) dt.

So N is the integral of ν(t) over time.

But what is ν(t) here? It's the frequency of the accelerating voltage, which is matched to the cyclotron frequency. So for each time t, ν(t) equals the cyclotron frequency at that time.

The cyclotron frequency is ν = (q B(t)) / (2 π m). But in a synchrocyclotron, B(t) is adjusted so that this holds.

The key point is that the cyclotron frequency depends on the magnetic field, which is adjusted as the proton's energy increases.

But how does the magnetic field change? It must change in such a way that the resonance condition is maintained.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions can be found using the formula N = (gamma - 1) / (e U0 / (m c^2)) ), where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The kinetic energy gained by the proton is equal to the number of times it's accelerated multiplied by the energy per acceleration.

Each time the proton passes through the gap (each half-cycle), it gains e U0. But wait, the actual energy gain per pass can be e U0 multiplied by the cosine of the phase, but in resonance conditions, the phase is such that each pass is in phase, leading to maximum energy gain each time.

Wait, so if the proton makes N full revolutions, each revolution corresponds to two acceleration steps (each half-cycle). So total number of acceleration steps is 2N.

Each acceleration step gives e U0, so the total energy gained is 2N e U0.

Wait, but wait, the actual energy gain might not be exactly e U0 each time because of relativistic effects. Because as the proton gains energy, its mass increases, so the same electric field gives less energy than before.

Ah, right, that's the thing. In a cyclotron, the maximum energy that can be imparted is limited because as the particle's speed approaches the speed of light, the relativistic effects make the mass effectively much larger, so the same electric field contributes less energy per acceleration step.

So, considering relativistic effects, the number of revolutions increases because each acceleration step contributes less energy.

Wait, but this complicates the calculation because the energy per step isn't constant.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is non-relativistic, but 950 MeV is way beyond that. So I have to consider relativistic effects.

Wait, another idea: The total energy gained is the sum of all the energy increments from each acceleration step, considering the relativistic gamma factor at each step.

But that seems computationally intensive.

Alternatively, maybe there's an approximation formula that relates the number of revolutions N to the total energy gained, taking into account relativistic effects.

Wait, I think the number of revolutions N is given by the integral of (dE / (e U0)) multiplied by some factor involving the relativistic gamma.

Wait, maybe the formula is N = (gamma - 1) * (m c^2) / (e U0) )

Wait, let's compute that.

gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E_total / (m c^2). The proton's total energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) ≈ K + m c^2, where K is the kinetic energy. But for K = 950 MeV, which is close to m c^2 (938 MeV), gamma is approximately (950 + 938)/938 ≈ 1988/938 ≈ 2.117.

Wait, but wait, 950 MeV is the kinetic energy, K. So the total energy E = K + m c^2 = 950 + 938 = 1888 MeV.

So gamma = E/(m c^2) = 1888 / 938 ≈ 2.012.

Wait, 1888 divided by 938 is approximately 2.012.

So gamma is about 2.012.

So N ≈ (gamma -1) * (m c^2) / (e U0)

Wait, but let's compute the numbers.

Compute (gamma -1) * (m c^2) / (e U0 )

gamma ≈ 2.012 → gamma -1 = 1.012

m c^2 is 938 MeV.

e U0 is e multiplied by U0. e is proton charge, 1.6e-19 C. U0 is 190,000 V.

e U0 = 1.6e-19 C * 190e3 V = 3.04e-14 J.

Convert that to MeV: since 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, 3.04e-14 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = (3.04e-14) / (1.6e-19) ) eV ≈ 1.9e5 eV = 190 keV.

So e U0 = 190 keV.

So (gamma -1) * (m c^2) / (e U0) ) = 1.012 * 938 MeV / 190 keV.

Wait, 938 MeV is 938,000 keV.

So 1.012 * 938000 keV / 190 keV = 1.012 * (938000 / 190) ≈ 1.012 * 4936.84 ≈ 4936.84 *1.012 ≈ 5000.

Hmm, that gives about 5000. But the options don't have exactly 5000; the closest is B) 5300, or C) 3536, or D) 2500.

Wait, but wait, I think I messed up the formula. Let me double-check.

Another approach: the total number of revolutions N is approximately (gamma - 1) * (m c^2) / (e U0) ) * (something...). Or perhaps it's (gamma) * (m c^2) / (e U0).

Wait, maybe the correct formula is N ≈ (gamma) * (m c^2) / (e U0) ) ?

Wait, let's compute that: gamma is ~2.012, m c^2 is 938 MeV.

e U0 is 190 keV = 0.190 MeV.

So N ≈ (2.012) * (938 MeV) / (0.190 MeV) ) ≈ (2.012 * 938) / 0.190 ≈ (1888) / 0.190 ≈ 9936.8.

Hmm, that's way higher than any of the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, maybe it's (gamma - 1) * (m c^2) / (e U0) ), which would be 1.012 * 938 / 0.190 ≈ (947) / 0.190 ≈ 5000.

Hmm, which is close to option B) 5300.

But why isn't it matching exactly? Maybe I made an approximation in gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

The kinetic energy K = 950 MeV.

E = K + m c^2 = 950 + 938 = 1888 MeV.

gamma = E/(m c^2) = 1888 / 938 ≈ 2.012.

So gamma -1 = 1.012.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is N = (gamma) * (m c^2) / (e U0) ), which is 2.012 * 938 / 0.190 ≈ (2.012 * 938) / 0.190 ≈ 1888.136 / 0.190 ≈ 9937. So about 9937. But that's way higher than any option.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is N ≈ (gamma) * (m c^2) / (e U0) ) / 2, since each revolution contributes two steps.

Wait, that would be 9937 / 2 ≈ 4968.5. Which is close to option B) 5300. But not exactly. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (gamma -1) * (m c^2) / (e U0) ), which is 1.012 *938 / 0.190 ≈ 5000.

But the options don't have 5000. The closest is B) 5300. So perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe I should compute without the approximations. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

E = 1888 MeV.

Gamma = E / (m c^2) = 1888 / 938 ≈ 2.0125.

So (gamma -1) = approx 1.0125.

So N = 1.0125 * 938 MeV / 0.190 MeV.

Wait, 938 / 0.190 = 4936.842.

Multiply by 1.0125: 4936.842 *1.0125 ≈ 4936.842 + (4936.842 *0.0125) → 4936.842 + 61.7105 ≈ 5000.

So about 5000. So perhaps the answer is around 5000. But the options don't have that. So maybe my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the formula is N = (E)/(e U0) * (m c^2)/(E) ) ?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is the total phase change divided by 2π. So N = (1/(2π)) ∫ 2π ν(t) dt from 0 to T = ∫ ν(t) dt.

But I'm not sure how to find ν(t) as a function of time.

Wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the condition is that the accelerating voltage's frequency ν equals the particle's cyclotron frequency, which is ν = (q B(t))/(2 π m).

But because B(t) is adjusted to keep ν constant? Or does it vary?

Wait, no, in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field decreases as the proton gains energy to keep the resonance condition. So that ν remains equal to the cyclotron frequency.

Hmm, but I think I'm going into too much depth without remembering the exact formula.

Wait, another thought: The number of revolutions N is given by the integral over time of the cyclotron frequency.

N = ∫ (q B(t))/(2 π m) dt from 0 to T.

But since B(t) is adjusted such that the energy gain is matched to the phase, perhaps there's a relation between B(t) and E(t).

In a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field decreases as the particle's energy increases. The relation between B and E is given by B = (m_e c^2)/(gamma m_p c^2) * B0, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of revolutions is given by N = (gamma -1) * (m c^2)/(e U0).

Wait, using the numbers: gamma -1 ≈ 1.012, m c^2 = 938 MeV, e U0 = 190 keV = 0.190 MeV.

So N = 1.012 * 938 / 0.190 ≈ (947) / 0.190 ≈ 5000.

But the options don't have exactly 5000. The closest is B)5300.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm missing a factor. Because in a synchrocyclotron, each revolution gives two acceleration steps, but each step isn't exactly e U0 because of relativistic effects. So maybe the actual number of revolutions is higher.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is N = (gamma) * (m c^2)/(e U0).

So N = 2.012 * 938 / 0.190 ≈ 9937. That's way higher than any option. So perhaps the initial approach was wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by the total phase change divided by 2π. The phase change is 2π ν(t) T, but I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the number of times the accelerating voltage changes, which is twice the number of revolutions? Or something else.

Alternatively, let me think about the energy gained in each revolution.

In a synchrocyclotron, each time the proton goes around once (one revolution), it's accelerated twice, but the energy gained per acceleration isn't constant because of relativistic effects.

But perhaps in the early stages, when the kinetic energy is small, the energy gain per revolution is roughly 2 * e U0. But as the energy increases, the same voltage gives less energy gain.

So the total energy is the sum of all the energy gains from each acceleration step.

But integrating this would require knowing how the energy gain per step decreases with each step, which is complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem simplifies and assumes that the energy per revolution is constant. That is, each revolution gives 2 * e U0 of energy.

So number of revolutions N = Total energy / (2 e U0).

Total energy is 950 MeV.

e U0 is 190 keV per acceleration step.

Each revolution gives 2 steps, so 380 keV per revolution.

So N = 950,000 keV / 380 keV per revolution ≈ 2500 revolutions.

Which is option D.

But earlier I thought that because of the initial phase, the first acceleration step isn't at maximum, which could lead to a slightly higher number, but perhaps the initial phase doesn't affect the total number of revolutions because it's a phase shift.

Wait, the initial phase is Φ0 = π/4, so at t=0, the voltage is U0 cos(π/4) ≈ 0.707 U0. So the first acceleration step isn't at maximum, so the energy gain is less than 190 keV. Therefore, the total number of revolutions would be a bit higher than 2500.

Looking at the options, option C is 3536, which is higher than 2500. How?

Wait, maybe each revolution gives only one acceleration step because the phase is such that the maximum is at a different point. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial phase leads to a lower energy gain, so you need more revolutions to compensate.

But I'm not sure. Without knowing the exact formula, it's hard to say.

But given the options, and the initial approach leading to 2500, which is option D, I'm leaning towards that.

But wait, another angle: The number of revolutions is determined by the total phase shift divided by 2π. The phase shift comes from the integral of ν(t) over time.

But I'm stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by (gamma) * (m c^2) / (e U0) ), but that gives around 10,000 revolutions, which doesn't match any options.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each acceleration step gives e U0 of energy, and the number of steps is N_steps = 950,000 keV / 190 keV ≈ 5000 steps.

Since each revolution gives two steps, the number of revolutions is 5000 / 2 = 2500.

Which brings us back to option D) 2500.

But earlier, the initial phase would reduce the first step's energy, so perhaps more steps are needed, leading to more revolutions.

But without knowing how much less the first step is, it's hard to adjust the number.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial phase doesn't affect the total number of revolutions because it's a phase shift, and over many steps, the average energy gain per step remains the same.

So perhaps the correct answer is D) 2500.

But wait, another approach: the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. So perhaps it's accelerated twice, giving 2 * 190 keV = 380 keV. But that's way less than 950 MeV. So that can't be.

So perhaps the initial statement about two accelerations is misleading, and the number of accelerations is determined by the energy and voltage.

So, the correct approach is to compute the number of acceleration steps needed to reach 950 MeV, each step giving e U0, and then divide by 2 to get the number of revolutions.

So, number of steps = 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV ≈ 5000 steps.

Number of revolutions = 5000 / 2 ≈ 2500.

So the answer is D) 2500.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a proton injected into a synchrocyclotron with negligible initial kinetic energy, undergoing acceleration to reach a kinetic energy of \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \). The alternating voltage applied is given by \( U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0] \), with \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \). The goal is to determine the number of revolutions the proton makes.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Gain per Revolution**:  
   In a synchrocyclotron, the proton is accelerated twice per revolution (once per half-cycle of the voltage). Each acceleration step provides an energy gain of \( eU_0 \), where \( e \) is the proton's charge and \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \).  
   - The energy gain per step is \( eU_0 = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \times 190 \times 10^3 \, \text{V} = 3.04 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{J} \), which converts to \( 190 \, \text{keV} \).

2. **Total Energy and Number of Steps**:  
   The total kinetic energy to be achieved is \( 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{keV} \).  
   The number of acceleration steps required is:  
   \[
   N_{\text{steps}} = \frac{\text{Total Energy}}{\text{Energy per Step}} = \frac{950,000 \, \text{keV}}{190 \, \text{keV}} \approx 5000 \, \text{steps}.
   \]

3. **Number of Revolutions**:  
   Since each revolution corresponds to two acceleration steps, the number of revolutions is:  
   \[
   N_{\text{revolutions}} = \frac{N_{\text{steps}}}{2} = \frac{5000}{2} = 2500.
   \]

4. **Initial Phase Consideration**:  
   The initial phase \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \) slightly reduces the energy gain in the first acceleration step. However, over many steps, the average energy gain per step remains approximately constant, so the initial phase does not significantly affect the total number of revolutions.

### Conclusion:
The total number of revolutions the proton makes is approximately **2500**, which corresponds to option D.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm trying to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, the question is about a proton injected into a synchrocyclotron with negligible kinetic energy at t=0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I think I remember that in cyclotrons, particles move in a magnetic field, and they get accelerated each time they pass through the electric field. The frequency of the applied voltage has to match the particle's cyclotron frequency for effective acceleration. But wait, this is a synchrocyclotron, which I think is a type of cyclotron where the magnetic field isn't constant—it actually changes to keep the cyclotron frequency in sync with the accelerating frequency. So, maybe the magnetic field is adjusted as the proton's energy increases.

Wait, but the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo and they mean two half-cycles? Or does it mean two steps of acceleration? Hmm, maybe I should think about how the energy gain works.

The voltage given is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. So the frequency ν(α) might be a function of the particle's momentum, which in turn depends on its kinetic energy. But since the proton is being accelerated, the frequency of the voltage probably needs to adjust as the proton's speed changes.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about what I know about cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons.

In a cyclotron, a charged particle moves in a circular path under the influence of a magnetic field. The frequency at which the particle revolves is the cyclotron frequency, which is given by f = qB/(2πm), where q is the charge, B is the magnetic field, and m is the mass.

The electric field in the gaps between the dees accelerates the particle each half-period. So, each time the particle passes through the gap, it gains energy. The voltage applied is such that the electric field E is related to the voltage by E = U0/(d), where d is the distance between the dees (but maybe that's not directly needed here).

In a synchrocyclotron, to keep the resonance condition (so that each acceleration step is in phase), the magnetic field isn't constant. As the particle gains energy and its mass effectively increases (since relativistic effects make the mass larger), the magnetic field is adjusted to maintain the cyclotron frequency matching the applied frequency. So the frequency ν(α) in the voltage equation depends on the particle's energy.

But wait, the problem states that the proton undergoes two accelerations. So maybe it only gets accelerated twice? Or does it undergo two full cycles? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of times the voltage completes a cycle, which relates to the time it takes to reach the desired energy.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of energy gained. Each time the proton goes through the potential difference, it gains kinetic energy. But in a cyclotron, each time it passes through the gap, it's accelerated once per half-cycle. So for each full cycle of the voltage, the proton is accelerated twice.

So the energy gain per revolution (each revolution is a full cycle of the voltage) would be 2 * e * U0, where e is the proton charge. But wait, wait, because the voltage is alternating, so the maximum potential difference is U0, but the effective energy gain per pass depends on how the voltage is applied.

Wait, no. The maximum energy gain per pass is e * U0. Because the particle is accelerated each time it crosses the gap. So if the voltage is V, the maximum energy gain possible per cycle is 2eV, because each half-cycle (when the field is in the right direction) gives eV. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, the potential is given as U(t) = U0 cos[...], so the maximum voltage across the gap is U0. So each time the particle crosses the gap, the energy change is e * U0 multiplied by the cosine term. The maximum possible energy gain each time is e*U0, but the actual energy gain depends on the phase when the particle passes through.

But in a synchrocyclotron, the system is designed so that every time the particle passes through the gap, the electric field is in the direction to accelerate it. So each time, the particle gains e * U0. Because the phase is matched, so the maximum is achieved each time.

Wait, but the initial phase is Φ0 = π/4. So at t=0, the voltage is U(0) = U0 cos(Φ0) = U0 cos(π/4) = (U0)(√2/2) ≈ 0.707 * U0. So when the proton first enters the gap, the voltage is at that value. But if the voltage is applied in such a way that the electric field is maximum in the direction of acceleration, perhaps each time the proton passes, it's at the peak of the voltage.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the problem again.

The key points are:

- The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (T ≈ 0), so initially, it's non-relativistic.
- It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV.
Wait, two accelerations? So it gains energy twice? Or two full cycles, meaning two times e U0 each? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the proton makes multiple revolutions, each time being accelerated each time it passes through the gap (twice per revolution), so the number of revolutions times two gives the number of acceleration steps.

Wait, but the problem states that it undergoes two accelerations. So perhaps it's accelerated twice to reach 950 MeV. So each acceleration gives an energy gain of eU0, but considering relativistic effects, maybe?

Wait, but 950 MeV is a huge amount of energy for a proton. Let me compute how much kinetic energy that corresponds to.

The rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV. So 950 MeV is just a bit above that. So it's a highly relativistic particle. But the initial kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is about 938 MeV initially.

Wait, but when the proton gains kinetic energy, its total energy increases. So in the end, the total energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) = m c^2 + K, where K is the kinetic energy. So for K=950 MeV, the total energy is about 950 + 938 = 1888 MeV ≈ 1.888 GeV.

But maybe I don't need to worry about that right now.

So, the problem is about how many times the proton goes around the synchrocyclotron before reaching 950 MeV.

Wait, but to find the number of revolutions, I need to know how much energy is gained per revolution and how much time passes, and how that relates to the number of revolutions.

Wait, but the voltage is time-dependent, which complicates things because the frequency ν(α) is a function of the particle's momentum. So the frequency changes as the proton gains energy.

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Maybe I should look for a formula that relates the number of revolutions to the energy gained.

I remember that the number of revolutions N is given by the total change in the phase of the voltage divided by 2π. Because each revolution corresponds to an increase in phase by 2π.

Wait, because the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(2πν(α) t + Φ0). The phase at time t is 2π ν(α) t + Φ0. So the total phase change after time t is 2π ν(α) t. So the number of revolutions N is the total phase change divided by 2π, which is N = ν(α) t.

But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency ν(α) is a function of the particle's momentum, which changes as it gains energy.

So, the idea is to integrate over time, considering how the frequency ν changes with time as the proton gains energy.

But this sounds complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, perhaps the total number of revolutions is given by the total change in the phase divided by 2π.

The phase at time t is 2π ν(α) t + Φ0.

The total phase change from t=0 to t=T is 2π ν(α) T + Φ0 - Φ0 = 2π ν(α) T.

But since ν(α) is a function of time, integrating could be necessary. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe ν(α) is such that it's in resonance with the particle's motion. So the frequency ν(α) is equal to the cyclotron frequency, which depends on the momentum.

Wait, the cyclotron frequency is f = (q B)/(2 π m), but in a synchrocyclotron, B is adjusted so that f remains equal to the driving frequency ν. So as the particle gains energy, B is varied to keep this condition.

But I'm not sure how to use this.

Wait, another approach: in a cyclotron, the time for each revolution is the period, T = 2π/(q B / (m)). So the period depends on the magnetic field. But in a synchrocyclotron, the B field changes to keep the period synchronized with the voltage's period.

Wait, perhaps the number of revolutions is directly linked to the energy gain.

Wait, but the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. So maybe it's accelerated twice, each time gaining some energy. But to reach 950 MeV, each acceleration would contribute 950/2 = 475 MeV. But that would mean each acceleration gives 475 MeV, which is more than the rest mass energy. That seems odd because the initial energy is very low.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again.

The problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. So, two acceleration steps, each providing some energy. So each acceleration step gives a certain energy.

Wait, but in a cyclotron, each time the proton passes through the gap, it's accelerated once per half-cycle. So each full cycle gives two accelerations. So if the total number of acceleration steps is two, it's a single cycle, giving two accelerations, leading to two energy gains.

Wait, then the total energy is 2 * e * U0, because each acceleration gives eU0.

Wait, but wait, e is the charge of the proton, which is 1.6e-19 coulombs. U0 is 190 kV, which is 190,000 volts.

So the energy per acceleration step is e * U0 = 1.6e-19 C * 190e3 V = 1.6e-19 * 190e3 = approximately 3.04e-14 J. Converting to eV: 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 3.04e-14 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV ≈ 1.9e5 eV, which is 190,000 eV or 190 keV.

Wait, so each acceleration step gives 190 keV. So two acceleration steps would give 380 keV, which is 380 MeV if I'm not mistaken. But the problem says the proton reaches 950 MeV. So two steps would only give 380 MeV. So that doesn't add up. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe each full cycle of the voltage (which is 2π) gives two acceleration steps, so each cycle adds 2 * e * U0.

Wait, let's compute that. Each cycle gives two acceleration steps, each adding e U0. So per cycle, 2 e U0.

So each cycle (one revolution) adds 2 * 190 keV = 380 keV. So to reach 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV, I need N = 950,000 / 380 ≈ 2500 cycles. So 2500 revolutions.

Wait, that would suggest the answer is D) 2500. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Because that's assuming the voltage is applied at maximum every time, and that each cycle adds 380 keV. But wait, 950,000 divided by 380 is 950,000 / 380 = approximately 2500. So that's what D says.

But wait, the initial phase is Φ0 = π/4. So the very first acceleration isn't at maximum. So perhaps the first acceleration is a bit less than U0. So that might affect the total number of revolutions.

Hmm, that complicates things. Because the first acceleration isn't maximum. So perhaps the energy gain per cycle isn't exactly 380 keV, but a bit less. So maybe the number of revolutions is a bit more than 2500.

Looking at the options, the closest higher option is C) 3536 or B) 5300. Wait, but 2500 is an option. So perhaps the initial phase doesn't affect the number of revolutions because it's just a phase shift, and the total phase after all the revolutions is what counts.

Wait, another approach: in a synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions N is given by the total phase change divided by 2π. The phase change is the integral of 2π ν(α) dt from t=0 to t=T, where T is the time when the proton reaches 950 MeV.

But since ν(α) depends on the momentum, which depends on the energy, which is a function of time, this integral might not be straightforward. But perhaps, under certain approximations, we can find a relation.

Wait, in the case of a cyclotron, the frequency of the accelerating voltage must match the cyclotron frequency. So the condition is that ν(α) = (q B(t))/(2 π m) ), but since B(t) is adjusted to keep this equality, the frequency is matched.

The energy of the proton is related to its momentum. For a relativistic particle, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). But perhaps, for a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is adjusted so that the cyclotron frequency remains in resonance with the accelerating frequency.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I can think of the number of revolutions as the total phase change divided by 2π. That is, N = (1/2π) ∫ 2π ν(t) dt from 0 to T = ∫ ν(t) dt.

So N is the integral of ν(t) over time.

But what is ν(t) here? It's the frequency of the accelerating voltage, which is matched to the cyclotron frequency. So for each time t, ν(t) equals the cyclotron frequency at that time.

The cyclotron frequency is ν = (q B(t)) / (2 π m). But in a synchrocyclotron, B(t) is adjusted so that this holds.

The key point is that the cyclotron frequency depends on the magnetic field, which is adjusted as the proton's energy increases.

But how does the magnetic field change? It must change in such a way that the resonance condition is maintained.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions can be found using the formula N = (gamma - 1) / (e U0 / (m c^2)) ), where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The kinetic energy gained by the proton is equal to the number of times it's accelerated multiplied by the energy per acceleration.

Each time the proton passes through the gap (each half-cycle), it gains e U0. But wait, the actual energy gain per pass can be e U0 multiplied by the cosine of the phase, but in resonance conditions, the phase is such that each pass is in phase, leading to maximum energy gain each time.

Wait, so if the proton makes N full revolutions, each revolution corresponds to two acceleration steps (each half-cycle). So total number of acceleration steps is 2N.

Each acceleration step gives e U0, so the total energy gained is 2N e U0.

Wait, but wait, the actual energy gain might not be exactly e U0 each time because of relativistic effects. Because as the proton gains energy, its mass increases, so the same electric field gives less energy than before.

Ah, right, that's the thing. In a cyclotron, the maximum energy that can be imparted is limited because as the particle's speed approaches the speed of light, the relativistic effects make the mass effectively much larger, so the same electric field contributes less energy per acceleration step.

So, considering relativistic effects, the number of revolutions increases because each acceleration step contributes less energy.

Wait, but this complicates the calculation because the energy per step isn't constant.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is non-relativistic, but 950 MeV is way beyond that. So I have to consider relativistic effects.

Wait, another idea: The total energy gained is the sum of all the energy increments from each acceleration step, considering the relativistic gamma factor at each step.

But that seems computationally intensive.

Alternatively, maybe there's an approximation formula that relates the number of revolutions N to the total energy gained, taking into account relativistic effects.

Wait, I think the number of revolutions N is given by the integral of (dE / (e U0)) multiplied by some factor involving the relativistic gamma.

Wait, maybe the formula is N = (gamma - 1) * (m c^2) / (e U0) )

Wait, let's compute that.

gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E_total / (m c^2). The proton's total energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) ≈ K + m c^2, where K is the kinetic energy. But for K = 950 MeV, which is close to m c^2 (938 MeV), gamma is approximately (950 + 938)/938 ≈ 1988/938 ≈ 2.117.

Wait, but wait, 950 MeV is the kinetic energy, K. So the total energy E = K + m c^2 = 950 + 938 = 1888 MeV.

So gamma = E/(m c^2) = 1888 / 938 ≈ 2.012.

Wait, 1888 divided by 938 is approximately 2.012.

So gamma is about 2.012.

So N ≈ (gamma -1) * (m c^2) / (e U0)

Wait, but let's compute the numbers.

Compute (gamma -1) * (m c^2) / (e U0 )

gamma ≈ 2.012 → gamma -1 = 1.012

m c^2 is 938 MeV.

e U0 is e multiplied by U0. e is proton charge, 1.6e-19 C. U0 is 190,000 V.

e U0 = 1.6e-19 C * 190e3 V = 3.04e-14 J.

Convert that to MeV: since 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, 3.04e-14 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = (3.04e-14) / (1.6e-19) ) eV ≈ 1.9e5 eV = 190 keV.

So e U0 = 190 keV.

So (gamma -1) * (m c^2) / (e U0) ) = 1.012 * 938 MeV / 190 keV.

Wait, 938 MeV is 938,000 keV.

So 1.012 * 938000 keV / 190 keV = 1.012 * (938000 / 190) ≈ 1.012 * 4936.84 ≈ 4936.84 *1.012 ≈ 5000.

Hmm, that gives about 5000. But the options don't have exactly 5000; the closest is B) 5300, or C) 3536, or D) 2500.

Wait, but wait, I think I messed up the formula. Let me double-check.

Another approach: the total number of revolutions N is approximately (gamma - 1) * (m c^2) / (e U0) ) * (something...). Or perhaps it's (gamma) * (m c^2) / (e U0).

Wait, maybe the correct formula is N ≈ (gamma) * (m c^2) / (e U0) ) ?

Wait, let's compute that: gamma is ~2.012, m c^2 is 938 MeV.

e U0 is 190 keV = 0.190 MeV.

So N ≈ (2.012) * (938 MeV) / (0.190 MeV) ) ≈ (2.012 * 938) / 0.190 ≈ (1888) / 0.190 ≈ 9936.8.

Hmm, that's way higher than any of the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, maybe it's (gamma - 1) * (m c^2) / (e U0) ), which would be 1.012 * 938 / 0.190 ≈ (947) / 0.190 ≈ 5000.

Hmm, which is close to option B) 5300.

But why isn't it matching exactly? Maybe I made an approximation in gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

The kinetic energy K = 950 MeV.

E = K + m c^2 = 950 + 938 = 1888 MeV.

gamma = E/(m c^2) = 1888 / 938 ≈ 2.012.

So gamma -1 = 1.012.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is N = (gamma) * (m c^2) / (e U0) ), which is 2.012 * 938 / 0.190 ≈ (2.012 * 938) / 0.190 ≈ 1888.136 / 0.190 ≈ 9937. So about 9937. But that's way higher than any option.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is N ≈ (gamma) * (m c^2) / (e U0) ) / 2, since each revolution contributes two steps.

Wait, that would be 9937 / 2 ≈ 4968.5. Which is close to option B) 5300. But not exactly. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (gamma -1) * (m c^2) / (e U0) ), which is 1.012 *938 / 0.190 ≈ 5000.

But the options don't have 5000. The closest is B) 5300. So perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe I should compute without the approximations. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

E = 1888 MeV.

Gamma = E / (m c^2) = 1888 / 938 ≈ 2.0125.

So (gamma -1) = approx 1.0125.

So N = 1.0125 * 938 MeV / 0.190 MeV.

Wait, 938 / 0.190 = 4936.842.

Multiply by 1.0125: 4936.842 *1.0125 ≈ 4936.842 + (4936.842 *0.0125) → 4936.842 + 61.7105 ≈ 5000.

So about 5000. So perhaps the answer is around 5000. But the options don't have that. So maybe my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the formula is N = (E)/(e U0) * (m c^2)/(E) ) ?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is the total phase change divided by 2π. So N = (1/(2π)) ∫ 2π ν(t) dt from 0 to T = ∫ ν(t) dt.

But I'm not sure how to find ν(t) as a function of time.

Wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the condition is that the accelerating voltage's frequency ν equals the particle's cyclotron frequency, which is ν = (q B(t))/(2 π m).

But because B(t) is adjusted to keep ν constant? Or does it vary?

Wait, no, in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field decreases as the proton gains energy to keep the resonance condition. So that ν remains equal to the cyclotron frequency.

Hmm, but I think I'm going into too much depth without remembering the exact formula.

Wait, another thought: The number of revolutions N is given by the integral over time of the cyclotron frequency.

N = ∫ (q B(t))/(2 π m) dt from 0 to T.

But since B(t) is adjusted such that the energy gain is matched to the phase, perhaps there's a relation between B(t) and E(t).

In a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field decreases as the particle's energy increases. The relation between B and E is given by B = (m_e c^2)/(gamma m_p c^2) * B0, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of revolutions is given by N = (gamma -1) * (m c^2)/(e U0).

Wait, using the numbers: gamma -1 ≈ 1.012, m c^2 = 938 MeV, e U0 = 190 keV = 0.190 MeV.

So N = 1.012 * 938 / 0.190 ≈ (947) / 0.190 ≈ 5000.

But the options don't have exactly 5000. The closest is B)5300.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm missing a factor. Because in a synchrocyclotron, each revolution gives two acceleration steps, but each step isn't exactly e U0 because of relativistic effects. So maybe the actual number of revolutions is higher.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is N = (gamma) * (m c^2)/(e U0).

So N = 2.012 * 938 / 0.190 ≈ 9937. That's way higher than any option. So perhaps the initial approach was wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by the total phase change divided by 2π. The phase change is 2π ν(t) T, but I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the number of times the accelerating voltage changes, which is twice the number of revolutions? Or something else.

Alternatively, let me think about the energy gained in each revolution.

In a synchrocyclotron, each time the proton goes around once (one revolution), it's accelerated twice, but the energy gained per acceleration isn't constant because of relativistic effects.

But perhaps in the early stages, when the kinetic energy is small, the energy gain per revolution is roughly 2 * e U0. But as the energy increases, the same voltage gives less energy gain.

So the total energy is the sum of all the energy gains from each acceleration step.

But integrating this would require knowing how the energy gain per step decreases with each step, which is complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem simplifies and assumes that the energy per revolution is constant. That is, each revolution gives 2 * e U0 of energy.

So number of revolutions N = Total energy / (2 e U0).

Total energy is 950 MeV.

e U0 is 190 keV per acceleration step.

Each revolution gives 2 steps, so 380 keV per revolution.

So N = 950,000 keV / 380 keV per revolution ≈ 2500 revolutions.

Which is option D.

But earlier I thought that because of the initial phase, the first acceleration step isn't at maximum, which could lead to a slightly higher number, but perhaps the initial phase doesn't affect the total number of revolutions because it's a phase shift.

Wait, the initial phase is Φ0 = π/4, so at t=0, the voltage is U0 cos(π/4) ≈ 0.707 U0. So the first acceleration step isn't at maximum, so the energy gain is less than 190 keV. Therefore, the total number of revolutions would be a bit higher than 2500.

Looking at the options, option C is 3536, which is higher than 2500. How?

Wait, maybe each revolution gives only one acceleration step because the phase is such that the maximum is at a different point. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial phase leads to a lower energy gain, so you need more revolutions to compensate.

But I'm not sure. Without knowing the exact formula, it's hard to say.

But given the options, and the initial approach leading to 2500, which is option D, I'm leaning towards that.

But wait, another angle: The number of revolutions is determined by the total phase shift divided by 2π. The phase shift comes from the integral of ν(t) over time.

But I'm stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by (gamma) * (m c^2) / (e U0) ), but that gives around 10,000 revolutions, which doesn't match any options.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each acceleration step gives e U0 of energy, and the number of steps is N_steps = 950,000 keV / 190 keV ≈ 5000 steps.

Since each revolution gives two steps, the number of revolutions is 5000 / 2 = 2500.

Which brings us back to option D) 2500.

But earlier, the initial phase would reduce the first step's energy, so perhaps more steps are needed, leading to more revolutions.

But without knowing how much less the first step is, it's hard to adjust the number.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial phase doesn't affect the total number of revolutions because it's a phase shift, and over many steps, the average energy gain per step remains the same.

So perhaps the correct answer is D) 2500.

But wait, another approach: the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. So perhaps it's accelerated twice, giving 2 * 190 keV = 380 keV. But that's way less than 950 MeV. So that can't be.

So perhaps the initial statement about two accelerations is misleading, and the number of accelerations is determined by the energy and voltage.

So, the correct approach is to compute the number of acceleration steps needed to reach 950 MeV, each step giving e U0, and then divide by 2 to get the number of revolutions.

So, number of steps = 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV ≈ 5000 steps.

Number of revolutions = 5000 / 2 ≈ 2500.

So the answer is D) 2500.


The problem involves a proton injected into a synchrocyclotron with negligible initial kinetic energy, undergoing acceleration to reach a kinetic energy of \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \). The alternating voltage applied is given by \( U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0] \), with \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \). The goal is to determine the number of revolutions the proton makes.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Gain per Revolution**:  
   In a synchrocyclotron, the proton is accelerated twice per revolution (once per half-cycle of the voltage). Each acceleration step provides an energy gain of \( eU_0 \), where \( e \) is the proton's charge and \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \).  
   - The energy gain per step is \( eU_0 = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \times 190 \times 10^3 \, \text{V} = 3.04 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{J} \), which converts to \( 190 \, \text{keV} \).

2. **Total Energy and Number of Steps**:  
   The total kinetic energy to be achieved is \( 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{keV} \).  
   The number of acceleration steps required is:  
   \[
   N_{\text{steps}} = \frac{\text{Total Energy}}{\text{Energy per Step}} = \frac{950,000 \, \text{keV}}{190 \, \text{keV}} \approx 5000 \, \text{steps}.
   \]

3. **Number of Revolutions**:  
   Since each revolution corresponds to two acceleration steps, the number of revolutions is:  
   \[
   N_{\text{revolutions}} = \frac{N_{\text{steps}}}{2} = \frac{5000}{2} = 2500.
   \]

4. **Initial Phase Consideration**:  
   The initial phase \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \) slightly reduces the energy gain in the first acceleration step. However, over many steps, the average energy gain per step remains approximately constant, so the initial phase does not significantly affect the total number of revolutions.

### Conclusion:
The total number of revolutions the proton makes is approximately **2500**, which corresponds to option D.
