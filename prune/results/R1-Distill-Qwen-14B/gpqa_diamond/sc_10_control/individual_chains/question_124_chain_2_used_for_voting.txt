Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about.

The question talks about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. Oh right, the Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), right?

So, the problem says that on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the detector's inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm. So, I think this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls. If a particle decays before it can reach the wall, it won't be detected. So, the fraction that reaches the wall depends on the particle's lifetime as perceived in the lab frame. Oh wait, because of time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime.

Wait, right. Because in the particle's rest frame, it lives for a certain proper time tau, but in the lab frame, it's gamma times tau. So the lifetime is longer from the lab's perspective.

So, the particles need to travel the radius of the detector before they decay. So, the distance is 30 meters. The particles are moving at speed v, which is related to gamma. Wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, so gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), yeah.

So, for a particle to reach the detector wall, the time it takes to travel 30 meters must be less than its lifetime. The proper lifetime is tau, so the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. The time to reach the wall is t = distance / speed = 30 / v. So, for the particle to reach the wall, 30 / v must be less than gamma tau. That's the condition.

Wait, but wait, the decay is a Poisson process. The probability that the particle decays before traveling that distance is given by 1 - exp(-t/(tau_gamma)), where tau_gamma is gamma tau. Because the mean lifetime is gamma tau.

So, the probability that the particle decays before reaching the wall is P = 1 - exp(- (30/v) / (gamma tau) ). So, the probability of surviving (i.e., reaching the wall) is P_survive = exp( -(30/(v gamma tau)) ). 

Alternatively, perhaps the average lifetime is gamma tau, so the mean lifetime is longer. So, the number of particles that decay before reaching the wall is one minus the survival probability.

But in the given scenario, currently, one third reach the wall. So the survival probability is 1/3. So, 1/3 = exp( - (30/(v gamma tau)) ), but wait, wait. Wait, the problem states that one third reach the wall. So, the survival probability is 1/3. So, 1/3 = exp( - t/(tau_lab) ), where t is the time to reach the wall.

Wait, no, tau_lab is gamma tau.

So, 1/3 = exp( - (30/(v * gamma tau)) )

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think in terms of the original scenario and the desired scenario.

In the original scenario, gamma is 20. The survival probability is 1/3.

So, for the original case:

1/3 = exp( - (30/(v gamma tau)) )

But wait, tau is the proper lifetime, which is fixed for the particle. So, when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3.

We need to find the new gamma (let's call it gamma_new) such that the survival probability is 2/3. Because the question wants two-thirds to reach the wall.

So, the equation for the new scenario is 2/3 = exp( - (30/(v_new gamma_new tau)) )

But wait, the velocity v depends on gamma. Because for a given gamma, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). So, higher gamma means higher velocity.

Wait, no. Because for gamma approaching infinity, v approaches c. So, gamma higher means velocity closer to c.

So, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = c * sqrt( (gamma² -1)/gamma² ) ) = c * sqrt(gamma² -1) / gamma.

So, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² )

Alternatively, v can be written as beta c, where beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² )

So, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² )

So, when gamma is 20, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/400) = sqrt(399/400) = sqrt(0.9975) ≈ 0.99875 c.

So, the velocity is very close to the speed of light.

Now, going back to the original scenario, we have:

1/3 = exp( - (30/(v * gamma tau)) )

Take natural log on both sides.

ln(1/3) = - (30)/(v gamma tau )

So, 30/(v gamma tau ) = ln(3)

Wait, wait. Because ln(1/3) is negative. So:

ln(1/3) = - (30)/(v gamma tau )

=> (30 )/(v gamma tau ) = ln(3 )

So, 30/(v gamma tau ) = ln(3 )

We can write this as equation (1): 30 = v gamma tau ln(3 )

Now, in the new scenario, we have 2/3 survival probability:

2/3 = exp( - (30/(v_new gamma_new tau )) )

Take natural log:

ln(2/3) = -30/(v_new gamma_new tau )

Multiply both sides by -1:

- ln(2/3) = 30/(v_new gamma_new tau )

But ln(2/3) is negative, so -ln(2/3) equals ln(3/2). So,

ln(3/2) = 30/(v_new gamma_new tau )

So,

30 = v_new gamma_new tau ln(3/2 )

Now, from equation (1), we have 30 = v gamma tau ln(3 )

So, substituting into the new equation:

v gamma tau ln(3 ) = v_new gamma_new tau ln(3/2 )

Assuming that tau is the same for the same particle (I think the question implies that the particles are the same type, so tau is the same), we can cancel tau from both sides.

So,

v gamma ln(3 ) = v_new gamma_new ln(3/2 )

We can write this as:

v_new = (v gamma ln(3 )) / (gamma_new ln(3/2) )

But wait, v is related to gamma. Since v = beta c, and beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² )

So, v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² ) c

Similarly, v_new = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_new² ) c

So, substituting v and v_new into the equation:

sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² ) c * gamma * ln(3 ) = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_new² ) c * gamma_new * ln(3/2 )

We can cancel c from both sides.

So,

sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² ) * gamma * ln(3 ) = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_new² ) * gamma_new * ln(3/2 )

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Let's try to simplify.

Let me denote:

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots. But before that, maybe rearrange terms.

Let me rearrange:

sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² ) / gamma_new = [ (gamma_new * ln(3/2 )) / (gamma * ln(3) ) ] * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_new² )

Wait, perhaps it's better to square both sides.

So,

[ sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² ) * gamma * ln(3 ) ]^2 = [ sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_new² ) * gamma_new * ln(3/2 ) ]^2

Expand both sides:

(1 - 1/gamma² ) * gamma² * (ln(3 ))^2 = (1 - 1/gamma_new² ) * gamma_new² * (ln(3/2 ))^2

Simplify each side.

Left side: (gamma² - 1 ) * (ln 3 )^2

Right side: (gamma_new² - 1 ) * (gamma_new²) * (ln(3/2 ))^2 

Wait, wait. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, (1 - (1/gamma² )) = (gamma² -1 ) / gamma². So, when multiplied by gamma², it becomes gamma² -1.

Similarly, on the right side, (1 -1/gamma_new² ) * gamma_new² = gamma_new² -1.

So, the equation becomes:

(gamma² -1 ) * (ln 3 )^2 = (gamma_new² -1 ) * gamma_new² * (ln(3/2 ))^2

Wait, no. Because the right side was (1 - 1/gamma_new² ) * gamma_new² * (ln(3/2 ))^2.

Which is (gamma_new² -1 ) * (ln(3/2 ))^2.

Wait, no:

(1 - 1/gamma_new² ) = (gamma_new² -1 ) / gamma_new².

So,

(1 - 1/gamma_new² ) * gamma_new² = (gamma_new² -1 )

So, the right side is (gamma_new² -1 ) * (ln(3/2 ))^2.

So, the equation now is:

(gamma² -1 ) * (ln 3 )^2 = (gamma_new² -1 ) * (ln(3/2 ))^2

Let me write this as:

(gamma² -1 ) / (gamma_new² -1 ) = [ (ln(3/2 ))^2 ] / [ (ln 3 )^2 ]

Compute the right-hand side.

Compute ln(3) ≈ 1.0986, ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So,

(ln(3/2 ))^2 ≈ 0.4055^2 ≈ 0.1644.

(ln 3 )^2 ≈ (1.0986)^2 ≈ 1.2069.

So,

(ln(3/2))^2 / (ln3)^2 ≈ 0.1644 / 1.2069 ≈ 0.1362.

So,

(gamma² -1 ) / (gamma_new² -1 ) ≈ 0.1362.

We can write this as:

gamma_new² -1 ≈ (gamma² -1 ) / 0.1362

We know gamma is 20 in the original scenario.

So,

gamma =20:

gamma² =400.

gamma² -1=399.

So,

gamma_new² -1 ≈ 399 / 0.1362 ≈ ?

Compute 399 / 0.1362.

Hmm, 399 / 0.1362 ≈ let's see.

0.1362 * 2933 ≈ 399? Let me compute 0.1362 * 2933.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 399 / 0.1362.

Well, 1/0.1362 ≈ 7.337.

So, 399 *7.337 ≈ ?

399 *7 = 2793.

399 *0.337 ≈ approx 134.2.

So, total approx 2793 +134.2 = 2927.2.

So, gamma_new² -1 ≈ 2927.2.

So,

gamma_new² ≈ 2927.2 +1 = 2928.2.

gamma_new ≈ sqrt(2928.2 )

Compute sqrt(2928.2 )

I know that 54² is 2916 (since 50²=2500, 55²=3025). So sqrt(2928) is just a bit more than 54.

54² = 2916 → 54² = 2916 → 54^2=2916. So, 2928.2 is 12.2 higher.

So, let's compute 54.2^2: 54^2 + 2*54*0.2 + (0.2)^2 = 2916 + 21.6 + 0.04=2937.64. That's higher than 2928.

Wait, so maybe 54.1^2=?

54.1^2 = (54 +0.1)^2 = 54² + 2*54*0.1 +0.1^2=2916 + 10.8 + 0.01=2926.81.

Ah, 54.1² is 2926.81, which is very close to 2928.2.

So, the difference is 2928.2 - 2926.81 =1.39.

The next increment: 54.1 + x. Let's approximate.

Let me approximate (54.1 + x)^2 ≈ 54.1² + 2*(54.1)*x.

We want 54.1² + 2*(54.1)*x =2928.2.

We have 54.1²=2926.81.

So, 2928.2 - 2926.81=1.39= 2*(54.1)*x → x≈1.39/(108.2)= approx 0.0128.

So, x≈0.0128. So, gamma_new≈54.1 +0.0128≈54.1128.

So, gamma_new≈54.1.

Looking at the options, option A is 54, B is 68, C is 40, D is 28.

So, the answer would be approximately 54.1, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, earlier steps: when I squared both sides, I might have made a mistake. Let me go back.

Wait, the original equation after moving everything to one side:

(gamma² -1 ) * (ln3)^2 = (gamma_new² -1 ) * (ln(3/2))^2.

So, when I compute (ln3)^2/(ln(3/2))^2, I got approximately 1.2069 /0.1644 ≈7.337.

Wait, wait no. Because in the equation, the left side is (gamma²-1) multiplied by (ln3)^2, and the right side is (gamma_new^2-1) multiplied by (ln(3/2))^2.

So, when I take the ratio, (gamma_new^2 -1) = (gamma²-1) * [ (ln3)^2 / (ln(3/2))^2 ]

Wait, no, the equation is (gamma²-1) * (ln3)^2 = (gamma_new^2-1) * (ln(3/2))^2.

So, (gamma_new^2-1) = (gamma² -1) * [ (ln3)^2 / (ln(3/2))^2 ]

Wait, that's correct. So,

(gamma_new² -1 ) = (gamma² -1) * [ (ln3 )^2 / (ln(3/2))^2 ]

Which is (gamma² -1 ) * (7.337) ≈ 399 *7.337 ≈2927. So, gamma_new² is 2928, so gamma_new is approx 54.1.

So, the correct answer is approximately 54, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, the original gamma is 20, leading to 1/3 survival. We are trying to find a higher gamma, because a higher gamma would mean longer lifetime, which would increase the survival probability. Because the survival probability is exp(-30/(v gamma tau)).

Wait, no, because as gamma increases, v increases as well, since beta approaches 1. So, higher gamma means higher velocity.

Wait, let me think: when gamma increases, v approaches c. So, the time t = 30/(v gamma tau) becomes smaller because v increases.

Wait, wait.

Wait, the survival probability is exp( - t/(tau_lab) ), where tau_lab is gamma tau. So, t is the time to reach the wall, which is 30/(v) = 30/(beta c). So, tau_lab is gamma tau.

So, the exponent is [30/(beta c)] / (gamma tau ) ) = (30)/(beta c gamma tau )

Because v = beta c.

So, the exponent is (30) / (beta c gamma tau )

Now, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 ), so beta = sqrt( (gamma^2 -1)/gamma^2 ) ) = sqrt(gamma^2-1)/gamma.

So, beta = sqrt(gamma² -1)/gamma.

So, beta = sqrt( (gamma² -1) ) / gamma.

So, beta c gamma = sqrt(gamma² -1) * c.

So, beta c gamma = c sqrt(gamma² -1 )

So, the exponent becomes:

30 / ( c sqrt(gamma² -1 ) tau )

Wait, but that's getting a bit messy. I'm not sure if this approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps using time dilation and length contraction concepts.

Wait, in the particle's rest frame, the detector has length L = 30 meters * gamma. Because from the particle's frame, the lab is moving, and length is contracted. Wait, no, wait: in the lab frame, the detector has radius 30 meters. In the particle's frame, which is moving at speed v relative to the lab, the length would be L' = L / gamma.

Wait, but perhaps in the particle's frame, the lab is moving, so the distance it needs to travel is contracted.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about it differently.

In the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma tau, and during that time, it can travel a distance d = v gamma tau.

The detector's radius is 30 meters. So, the particle will reach the wall if d >=30 meters. The probability that it decays before reaching the wall is 1 - e^(-30/(v gamma tau)).

Wait, no, because in the lab frame, the mean lifetime is gamma tau. So, the probability of decaying before time t is 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, but the time taken to reach the wall is t = 30/(v).

So, the probability of decaying before reaching the wall is 1 - e^(-30/(v gamma tau)).

So, the survival probability is e^(-30/(v gamma tau)).

Wait, but wait, that seems contradictory. Because if the survival probability is e^(-30/(v gamma tau)), which is P_survive = e^(-distance/(v gamma tau) )

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. Because the decay rate is determined by the lifetime in the lab frame.

Wait, in any case, perhaps it's better to approach the problem using the two scenarios.

In the first scenario:

Gamma1 = 20.

P1 = 1/3 = e^(-30/(v1 Gamma1 tau )).

In the second scenario:

Gamma2 = ?

P2 = 2/3 = e^(-30/(v2 Gamma2 tau )).

We can take the ratio of the two equations.

P2 / P1 = (2/3)/(1/3) )=2 = [ e^(-30/(v2 Gamma2 tau )) ] / [ e^(-30/(v1 Gamma1 tau )) ]

Which simplifies to:

2 = e^{ 30 [ (1/(v1 Gamma1 tau )) - (1/(v2 Gamma2 tau )) ] }

Take ln of both sides:

ln(2) = 30 [ (1/(v1 Gamma1 )) - (1/(v2 Gamma2 )) ] / tau

Because tau is same in both cases, it cancels out.

So,

ln(2) =30 [ (1/(v1 Gamma1 ) - 1/(v2 Gamma2 )) ) ] / tau

Multiply both sides by tau:

tau ln(2) =30 [ (1/(v1 Gamma1 ) - 1/(v2 Gamma2 )) ) ]

But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe it's better to express v in terms of Gamma.

v = beta c = sqrt(1 - (1/Gamma^2 )) c.

So,

1/(v Gamma) = 1/( beta c Gamma )

= 1/( sqrt(1 -1/Gamma^2 ) * c Gamma )

= 1/( c Gamma sqrt( (Gamma^2 -1)/Gamma^2 ) )

= 1/( c Gamma * sqrt(Gamma^2 -1)/Gamma )

= 1/( c sqrt(Gamma^2 -1) )

So, 1/(v Gamma ) = 1/( c sqrt(Gamma^2 -1) )

So, substituting back into the equation.

tau ln(2) =30 [ 1/( c sqrt(Gamma1^2 -1) ) - 1/( c sqrt(Gamma2^2 -1) ) ]

Factor out 1/c:

tau ln(2) = (30/c) [ 1/ sqrt(Gamma1^2 -1 ) - 1/ sqrt(Gamma2^2 -1 ) ]

Hmm, but I don't know tau or c. So, perhaps I should express the difference in terms of Gamma1 and Gamma2.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write:

1/(v Gamma ) = 1/(c sqrt( Gamma^2 -1 ) )

So, the equation becomes:

tau ln(2) =30 [ 1/(c sqrt(20^2 -1 )) - 1/( c sqrt(Gamma2^2 -1 )) ]

But without knowing tau or c, I can't compute this numerically. Hmm. Maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio of 1/(v Gamma ) for the two scenarios.

From the first scenario:

1/(v1 Gamma1 ) = 1/(c sqrt(20^2 -1 )) = 1/(c sqrt(399)).

Similarly, for the second scenario, 1/(v2 Gamma2 ) =1/(c sqrt( Gamma2^2 -1 )).

So, the equation from the ratio is:

ln(2) =30 [ (1/(c sqrt(399)) ) - (1/(c sqrt(Gamma2^2 -1 )) ) ] / tau

But I still don't know tau. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can write the ratio of the two probabilities.

In the first case:

P1=1/3= e^(-30/(v1 Gamma1 tau ))= e^(-30/(c sqrt(399) tau )).

In the second case:

P2=2/3= e^(-30/(v2 Gamma2 tau ))= e^(-30/(c sqrt(Gamma2^2 -1 ) tau )).

Taking the ratio P2/P1:

(2/3)/(1/3) )=2= e^{ [ 30/(c sqrt(399) tau ) - 30/(c sqrt(Gamma2^2 -1 ) tau ) ] }

Take natural log:

ln(2) = [ 30/(c tau ) ] [ 1/sqrt(399) - 1/sqrt(Gamma2^2 -1 ) ]

Hmm, but I still don't have the value of c tau. Maybe I can find it from the first equation.

From the first equation:

ln(1/3) = -30/(c sqrt(399) tau )

So,

30/(c tau sqrt(399) ) = -ln(1/3 )= ln(3 )

So,

30/(c tau ) = ln(3 ) sqrt(399 )

So, plugging this back into the equation from the ratio:

ln(2) = [ ln(3 ) sqrt(399 ) ] [ 1/sqrt(399 ) - 1/sqrt(Gamma2^2 -1 ) ]

Simplify the terms:

ln(2) = ln(3 ) [ 1 - sqrt(399 ) / sqrt( Gamma2^2 -1 ) ]

Let me write this as:

ln(2)/ln(3 ) = 1 - sqrt(399 ) / sqrt( Gamma2^2 -1 )

Let me compute ln(2)/ln(3 ). ln(2)≈0.6931, ln(3 )≈1.0986.

So,

0.6931/1.0986≈0.6309.

So,

0.6309 = 1 - sqrt(399)/sqrt( Gamma2^2 -1 )

Which can be rearranged as:

sqrt(399)/sqrt( Gamma2^2 -1 ) = 1 -0.6309=0.3691.

So,

sqrt( Gamma2^2 -1 ) = sqrt(399 ) / 0.3691.

Compute sqrt(399 )= approx 19.975.

So,

sqrt( Gamma2^2 -1 ) = 19.975 / 0.3691 ≈53.89.

Squaring both sides:

Gamma2^2 -1 ≈ (53.89)^2≈2903.

So,

Gamma2^2≈2904 → Gamma2≈sqrt(2904 )≈53.9.

So, Gamma2≈54.

Which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the survival probability of particles reaching the detector walls, which depends on the Lorentz factor, velocity, and proper lifetime of the particles. The survival probability is given by:

\[
P_{\text{survive}} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{v \gamma \tau}\right),
\]

where:
- \(v\) is the particle's velocity,
- \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor,
- \(\tau\) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \(30 \, \text{m}\) is the radius of the detector.

### Step 1: Relating velocity and Lorentz factor
The velocity \(v\) is related to the Lorentz factor \(\gamma\) by:

\[
v = \beta c = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]

Substituting this into the survival probability equation, the time dilation factor \(\gamma\) modifies the effective lifetime of the particle in the lab frame. The survival probability becomes:

\[
P_{\text{survive}} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \sqrt{\gamma^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma \tau}\right).
\]

### Step 2: Using the given scenarios
In the first scenario, the Lorentz factor is \(\gamma_1 = 20\), and the survival probability is \(P_1 = \frac{1}{3}\). In the second scenario, we are tasked with finding the new Lorentz factor \(\gamma_2\) such that the survival probability is \(P_2 = \frac{2}{3}\).

Taking the ratio of the survival probabilities:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \sqrt{\gamma_2^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_2 \tau}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \sqrt{\gamma_1^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_1 \tau}\right)}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \exp\left(\frac{30}{c \tau} \left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma_1^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_1} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma_2^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_2}\right]\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{30}{c \tau} \left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma_1^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_1} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma_2^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_2}\right].
\]

### Step 3: Solving for \(\gamma_2\)
Using the given values:
- \(P_2 / P_1 = 2\),
- \(\gamma_1 = 20\),
- \(\sqrt{\gamma_1^2 - 1} = \sqrt{399} \approx 19.975\),

we substitute into the equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{30}{c \tau} \left[\frac{1}{19.975 \cdot 20} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma_2^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_2}\right].
\]

From the first scenario, the term \(\frac{30}{c \tau}\) can be expressed in terms of \(\gamma_1\):

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{P_1}\right) = \frac{30}{c \tau} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma_1^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_1}.
\]

Given \(P_1 = \frac{1}{3}\), we find:

\[
\ln(3) = \frac{30}{c \tau} \cdot \frac{1}{19.975 \cdot 20}.
\]

Solving for \(\frac{30}{c \tau}\):

\[
\frac{30}{c \tau} = \ln(3) \cdot 19.975 \cdot 20.
\]

Substituting this back into the equation for \(\ln(2)\):

\[
\ln(2) = \ln(3) \cdot 19.975 \cdot 20 \left[\frac{1}{19.975 \cdot 20} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma_2^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_2}\right].
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\ln(2) = \ln(3) \left[1 - \frac{\sqrt{\gamma_2^2 - 1}}{\gamma_2}\right].
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{\gamma_2^2 - 1}}{\gamma_2} = 1 - \frac{\ln(2)}{\ln(3)}.
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\) and \(\ln(3) \approx 1.0986\), we find:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{\gamma_2^2 - 1}}{\gamma_2} = 1 - 0.6309 = 0.3691.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{\gamma_2^2 - 1}{\gamma_2^2} = 0.3691^2 \approx 0.1362.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\gamma_2^2 - 1 = 0.1362 \cdot \gamma_2^2.
\]

\[
\gamma_2^2 (1 - 0.1362) = 1.
\]

\[
\gamma_2^2 = \frac{1}{0.8638} \approx 1.157.
\]

\[
\gamma_2^2 \approx 2904.

### Step 4: Final Answer
The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls is approximately \(54\), which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about.

The question talks about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. Oh right, the Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), right?

So, the problem says that on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the detector's inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm. So, I think this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls. If a particle decays before it can reach the wall, it won't be detected. So, the fraction that reaches the wall depends on the particle's lifetime as perceived in the lab frame. Oh wait, because of time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime.

Wait, right. Because in the particle's rest frame, it lives for a certain proper time tau, but in the lab frame, it's gamma times tau. So the lifetime is longer from the lab's perspective.

So, the particles need to travel the radius of the detector before they decay. So, the distance is 30 meters. The particles are moving at speed v, which is related to gamma. Wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, so gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), yeah.

So, for a particle to reach the detector wall, the time it takes to travel 30 meters must be less than its lifetime. The proper lifetime is tau, so the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. The time to reach the wall is t = distance / speed = 30 / v. So, for the particle to reach the wall, 30 / v must be less than gamma tau. That's the condition.

Wait, but wait, the decay is a Poisson process. The probability that the particle decays before traveling that distance is given by 1 - exp(-t/(tau_gamma)), where tau_gamma is gamma tau. Because the mean lifetime is gamma tau.

So, the probability that the particle decays before reaching the wall is P = 1 - exp(- (30/v) / (gamma tau) ). So, the probability of surviving (i.e., reaching the wall) is P_survive = exp( -(30/(v gamma tau)) ). 

Alternatively, perhaps the average lifetime is gamma tau, so the mean lifetime is longer. So, the number of particles that decay before reaching the wall is one minus the survival probability.

But in the given scenario, currently, one third reach the wall. So the survival probability is 1/3. So, 1/3 = exp( - (30/(v gamma tau)) ), but wait, wait. Wait, the problem states that one third reach the wall. So, the survival probability is 1/3. So, 1/3 = exp( - t/(tau_lab) ), where t is the time to reach the wall.

Wait, no, tau_lab is gamma tau.

So, 1/3 = exp( - (30/(v * gamma tau)) )

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think in terms of the original scenario and the desired scenario.

In the original scenario, gamma is 20. The survival probability is 1/3.

So, for the original case:

1/3 = exp( - (30/(v gamma tau)) )

But wait, tau is the proper lifetime, which is fixed for the particle. So, when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3.

We need to find the new gamma (let's call it gamma_new) such that the survival probability is 2/3. Because the question wants two-thirds to reach the wall.

So, the equation for the new scenario is 2/3 = exp( - (30/(v_new gamma_new tau)) )

But wait, the velocity v depends on gamma. Because for a given gamma, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). So, higher gamma means higher velocity.

Wait, no. Because for gamma approaching infinity, v approaches c. So, gamma higher means velocity closer to c.

So, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = c * sqrt( (gamma² -1)/gamma² ) ) = c * sqrt(gamma² -1) / gamma.

So, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² )

Alternatively, v can be written as beta c, where beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² )

So, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² )

So, when gamma is 20, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/400) = sqrt(399/400) = sqrt(0.9975) ≈ 0.99875 c.

So, the velocity is very close to the speed of light.

Now, going back to the original scenario, we have:

1/3 = exp( - (30/(v * gamma tau)) )

Take natural log on both sides.

ln(1/3) = - (30)/(v gamma tau )

So, 30/(v gamma tau ) = ln(3)

Wait, wait. Because ln(1/3) is negative. So:

ln(1/3) = - (30)/(v gamma tau )

=> (30 )/(v gamma tau ) = ln(3 )

So, 30/(v gamma tau ) = ln(3 )

We can write this as equation (1): 30 = v gamma tau ln(3 )

Now, in the new scenario, we have 2/3 survival probability:

2/3 = exp( - (30/(v_new gamma_new tau )) )

Take natural log:

ln(2/3) = -30/(v_new gamma_new tau )

Multiply both sides by -1:

- ln(2/3) = 30/(v_new gamma_new tau )

But ln(2/3) is negative, so -ln(2/3) equals ln(3/2). So,

ln(3/2) = 30/(v_new gamma_new tau )

So,

30 = v_new gamma_new tau ln(3/2 )

Now, from equation (1), we have 30 = v gamma tau ln(3 )

So, substituting into the new equation:

v gamma tau ln(3 ) = v_new gamma_new tau ln(3/2 )

Assuming that tau is the same for the same particle (I think the question implies that the particles are the same type, so tau is the same), we can cancel tau from both sides.

So,

v gamma ln(3 ) = v_new gamma_new ln(3/2 )

We can write this as:

v_new = (v gamma ln(3 )) / (gamma_new ln(3/2) )

But wait, v is related to gamma. Since v = beta c, and beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² )

So, v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² ) c

Similarly, v_new = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_new² ) c

So, substituting v and v_new into the equation:

sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² ) c * gamma * ln(3 ) = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_new² ) c * gamma_new * ln(3/2 )

We can cancel c from both sides.

So,

sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² ) * gamma * ln(3 ) = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_new² ) * gamma_new * ln(3/2 )

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Let's try to simplify.

Let me denote:

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots. But before that, maybe rearrange terms.

Let me rearrange:

sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² ) / gamma_new = [ (gamma_new * ln(3/2 )) / (gamma * ln(3) ) ] * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_new² )

Wait, perhaps it's better to square both sides.

So,

[ sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² ) * gamma * ln(3 ) ]^2 = [ sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_new² ) * gamma_new * ln(3/2 ) ]^2

Expand both sides:

(1 - 1/gamma² ) * gamma² * (ln(3 ))^2 = (1 - 1/gamma_new² ) * gamma_new² * (ln(3/2 ))^2

Simplify each side.

Left side: (gamma² - 1 ) * (ln 3 )^2

Right side: (gamma_new² - 1 ) * (gamma_new²) * (ln(3/2 ))^2 

Wait, wait. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, (1 - (1/gamma² )) = (gamma² -1 ) / gamma². So, when multiplied by gamma², it becomes gamma² -1.

Similarly, on the right side, (1 -1/gamma_new² ) * gamma_new² = gamma_new² -1.

So, the equation becomes:

(gamma² -1 ) * (ln 3 )^2 = (gamma_new² -1 ) * gamma_new² * (ln(3/2 ))^2

Wait, no. Because the right side was (1 - 1/gamma_new² ) * gamma_new² * (ln(3/2 ))^2.

Which is (gamma_new² -1 ) * (ln(3/2 ))^2.

Wait, no:

(1 - 1/gamma_new² ) = (gamma_new² -1 ) / gamma_new².

So,

(1 - 1/gamma_new² ) * gamma_new² = (gamma_new² -1 )

So, the right side is (gamma_new² -1 ) * (ln(3/2 ))^2.

So, the equation now is:

(gamma² -1 ) * (ln 3 )^2 = (gamma_new² -1 ) * (ln(3/2 ))^2

Let me write this as:

(gamma² -1 ) / (gamma_new² -1 ) = [ (ln(3/2 ))^2 ] / [ (ln 3 )^2 ]

Compute the right-hand side.

Compute ln(3) ≈ 1.0986, ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So,

(ln(3/2 ))^2 ≈ 0.4055^2 ≈ 0.1644.

(ln 3 )^2 ≈ (1.0986)^2 ≈ 1.2069.

So,

(ln(3/2))^2 / (ln3)^2 ≈ 0.1644 / 1.2069 ≈ 0.1362.

So,

(gamma² -1 ) / (gamma_new² -1 ) ≈ 0.1362.

We can write this as:

gamma_new² -1 ≈ (gamma² -1 ) / 0.1362

We know gamma is 20 in the original scenario.

So,

gamma =20:

gamma² =400.

gamma² -1=399.

So,

gamma_new² -1 ≈ 399 / 0.1362 ≈ ?

Compute 399 / 0.1362.

Hmm, 399 / 0.1362 ≈ let's see.

0.1362 * 2933 ≈ 399? Let me compute 0.1362 * 2933.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 399 / 0.1362.

Well, 1/0.1362 ≈ 7.337.

So, 399 *7.337 ≈ ?

399 *7 = 2793.

399 *0.337 ≈ approx 134.2.

So, total approx 2793 +134.2 = 2927.2.

So, gamma_new² -1 ≈ 2927.2.

So,

gamma_new² ≈ 2927.2 +1 = 2928.2.

gamma_new ≈ sqrt(2928.2 )

Compute sqrt(2928.2 )

I know that 54² is 2916 (since 50²=2500, 55²=3025). So sqrt(2928) is just a bit more than 54.

54² = 2916 → 54² = 2916 → 54^2=2916. So, 2928.2 is 12.2 higher.

So, let's compute 54.2^2: 54^2 + 2*54*0.2 + (0.2)^2 = 2916 + 21.6 + 0.04=2937.64. That's higher than 2928.

Wait, so maybe 54.1^2=?

54.1^2 = (54 +0.1)^2 = 54² + 2*54*0.1 +0.1^2=2916 + 10.8 + 0.01=2926.81.

Ah, 54.1² is 2926.81, which is very close to 2928.2.

So, the difference is 2928.2 - 2926.81 =1.39.

The next increment: 54.1 + x. Let's approximate.

Let me approximate (54.1 + x)^2 ≈ 54.1² + 2*(54.1)*x.

We want 54.1² + 2*(54.1)*x =2928.2.

We have 54.1²=2926.81.

So, 2928.2 - 2926.81=1.39= 2*(54.1)*x → x≈1.39/(108.2)= approx 0.0128.

So, x≈0.0128. So, gamma_new≈54.1 +0.0128≈54.1128.

So, gamma_new≈54.1.

Looking at the options, option A is 54, B is 68, C is 40, D is 28.

So, the answer would be approximately 54.1, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, earlier steps: when I squared both sides, I might have made a mistake. Let me go back.

Wait, the original equation after moving everything to one side:

(gamma² -1 ) * (ln3)^2 = (gamma_new² -1 ) * (ln(3/2))^2.

So, when I compute (ln3)^2/(ln(3/2))^2, I got approximately 1.2069 /0.1644 ≈7.337.

Wait, wait no. Because in the equation, the left side is (gamma²-1) multiplied by (ln3)^2, and the right side is (gamma_new^2-1) multiplied by (ln(3/2))^2.

So, when I take the ratio, (gamma_new^2 -1) = (gamma²-1) * [ (ln3)^2 / (ln(3/2))^2 ]

Wait, no, the equation is (gamma²-1) * (ln3)^2 = (gamma_new^2-1) * (ln(3/2))^2.

So, (gamma_new^2-1) = (gamma² -1) * [ (ln3)^2 / (ln(3/2))^2 ]

Wait, that's correct. So,

(gamma_new² -1 ) = (gamma² -1) * [ (ln3 )^2 / (ln(3/2))^2 ]

Which is (gamma² -1 ) * (7.337) ≈ 399 *7.337 ≈2927. So, gamma_new² is 2928, so gamma_new is approx 54.1.

So, the correct answer is approximately 54, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, the original gamma is 20, leading to 1/3 survival. We are trying to find a higher gamma, because a higher gamma would mean longer lifetime, which would increase the survival probability. Because the survival probability is exp(-30/(v gamma tau)).

Wait, no, because as gamma increases, v increases as well, since beta approaches 1. So, higher gamma means higher velocity.

Wait, let me think: when gamma increases, v approaches c. So, the time t = 30/(v gamma tau) becomes smaller because v increases.

Wait, wait.

Wait, the survival probability is exp( - t/(tau_lab) ), where tau_lab is gamma tau. So, t is the time to reach the wall, which is 30/(v) = 30/(beta c). So, tau_lab is gamma tau.

So, the exponent is [30/(beta c)] / (gamma tau ) ) = (30)/(beta c gamma tau )

Because v = beta c.

So, the exponent is (30) / (beta c gamma tau )

Now, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 ), so beta = sqrt( (gamma^2 -1)/gamma^2 ) ) = sqrt(gamma^2-1)/gamma.

So, beta = sqrt(gamma² -1)/gamma.

So, beta = sqrt( (gamma² -1) ) / gamma.

So, beta c gamma = sqrt(gamma² -1) * c.

So, beta c gamma = c sqrt(gamma² -1 )

So, the exponent becomes:

30 / ( c sqrt(gamma² -1 ) tau )

Wait, but that's getting a bit messy. I'm not sure if this approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps using time dilation and length contraction concepts.

Wait, in the particle's rest frame, the detector has length L = 30 meters * gamma. Because from the particle's frame, the lab is moving, and length is contracted. Wait, no, wait: in the lab frame, the detector has radius 30 meters. In the particle's frame, which is moving at speed v relative to the lab, the length would be L' = L / gamma.

Wait, but perhaps in the particle's frame, the lab is moving, so the distance it needs to travel is contracted.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about it differently.

In the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma tau, and during that time, it can travel a distance d = v gamma tau.

The detector's radius is 30 meters. So, the particle will reach the wall if d >=30 meters. The probability that it decays before reaching the wall is 1 - e^(-30/(v gamma tau)).

Wait, no, because in the lab frame, the mean lifetime is gamma tau. So, the probability of decaying before time t is 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, but the time taken to reach the wall is t = 30/(v).

So, the probability of decaying before reaching the wall is 1 - e^(-30/(v gamma tau)).

So, the survival probability is e^(-30/(v gamma tau)).

Wait, but wait, that seems contradictory. Because if the survival probability is e^(-30/(v gamma tau)), which is P_survive = e^(-distance/(v gamma tau) )

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. Because the decay rate is determined by the lifetime in the lab frame.

Wait, in any case, perhaps it's better to approach the problem using the two scenarios.

In the first scenario:

Gamma1 = 20.

P1 = 1/3 = e^(-30/(v1 Gamma1 tau )).

In the second scenario:

Gamma2 = ?

P2 = 2/3 = e^(-30/(v2 Gamma2 tau )).

We can take the ratio of the two equations.

P2 / P1 = (2/3)/(1/3) )=2 = [ e^(-30/(v2 Gamma2 tau )) ] / [ e^(-30/(v1 Gamma1 tau )) ]

Which simplifies to:

2 = e^{ 30 [ (1/(v1 Gamma1 tau )) - (1/(v2 Gamma2 tau )) ] }

Take ln of both sides:

ln(2) = 30 [ (1/(v1 Gamma1 )) - (1/(v2 Gamma2 )) ] / tau

Because tau is same in both cases, it cancels out.

So,

ln(2) =30 [ (1/(v1 Gamma1 ) - 1/(v2 Gamma2 )) ) ] / tau

Multiply both sides by tau:

tau ln(2) =30 [ (1/(v1 Gamma1 ) - 1/(v2 Gamma2 )) ) ]

But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe it's better to express v in terms of Gamma.

v = beta c = sqrt(1 - (1/Gamma^2 )) c.

So,

1/(v Gamma) = 1/( beta c Gamma )

= 1/( sqrt(1 -1/Gamma^2 ) * c Gamma )

= 1/( c Gamma sqrt( (Gamma^2 -1)/Gamma^2 ) )

= 1/( c Gamma * sqrt(Gamma^2 -1)/Gamma )

= 1/( c sqrt(Gamma^2 -1) )

So, 1/(v Gamma ) = 1/( c sqrt(Gamma^2 -1) )

So, substituting back into the equation.

tau ln(2) =30 [ 1/( c sqrt(Gamma1^2 -1) ) - 1/( c sqrt(Gamma2^2 -1) ) ]

Factor out 1/c:

tau ln(2) = (30/c) [ 1/ sqrt(Gamma1^2 -1 ) - 1/ sqrt(Gamma2^2 -1 ) ]

Hmm, but I don't know tau or c. So, perhaps I should express the difference in terms of Gamma1 and Gamma2.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write:

1/(v Gamma ) = 1/(c sqrt( Gamma^2 -1 ) )

So, the equation becomes:

tau ln(2) =30 [ 1/(c sqrt(20^2 -1 )) - 1/( c sqrt(Gamma2^2 -1 )) ]

But without knowing tau or c, I can't compute this numerically. Hmm. Maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio of 1/(v Gamma ) for the two scenarios.

From the first scenario:

1/(v1 Gamma1 ) = 1/(c sqrt(20^2 -1 )) = 1/(c sqrt(399)).

Similarly, for the second scenario, 1/(v2 Gamma2 ) =1/(c sqrt( Gamma2^2 -1 )).

So, the equation from the ratio is:

ln(2) =30 [ (1/(c sqrt(399)) ) - (1/(c sqrt(Gamma2^2 -1 )) ) ] / tau

But I still don't know tau. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can write the ratio of the two probabilities.

In the first case:

P1=1/3= e^(-30/(v1 Gamma1 tau ))= e^(-30/(c sqrt(399) tau )).

In the second case:

P2=2/3= e^(-30/(v2 Gamma2 tau ))= e^(-30/(c sqrt(Gamma2^2 -1 ) tau )).

Taking the ratio P2/P1:

(2/3)/(1/3) )=2= e^{ [ 30/(c sqrt(399) tau ) - 30/(c sqrt(Gamma2^2 -1 ) tau ) ] }

Take natural log:

ln(2) = [ 30/(c tau ) ] [ 1/sqrt(399) - 1/sqrt(Gamma2^2 -1 ) ]

Hmm, but I still don't have the value of c tau. Maybe I can find it from the first equation.

From the first equation:

ln(1/3) = -30/(c sqrt(399) tau )

So,

30/(c tau sqrt(399) ) = -ln(1/3 )= ln(3 )

So,

30/(c tau ) = ln(3 ) sqrt(399 )

So, plugging this back into the equation from the ratio:

ln(2) = [ ln(3 ) sqrt(399 ) ] [ 1/sqrt(399 ) - 1/sqrt(Gamma2^2 -1 ) ]

Simplify the terms:

ln(2) = ln(3 ) [ 1 - sqrt(399 ) / sqrt( Gamma2^2 -1 ) ]

Let me write this as:

ln(2)/ln(3 ) = 1 - sqrt(399 ) / sqrt( Gamma2^2 -1 )

Let me compute ln(2)/ln(3 ). ln(2)≈0.6931, ln(3 )≈1.0986.

So,

0.6931/1.0986≈0.6309.

So,

0.6309 = 1 - sqrt(399)/sqrt( Gamma2^2 -1 )

Which can be rearranged as:

sqrt(399)/sqrt( Gamma2^2 -1 ) = 1 -0.6309=0.3691.

So,

sqrt( Gamma2^2 -1 ) = sqrt(399 ) / 0.3691.

Compute sqrt(399 )= approx 19.975.

So,

sqrt( Gamma2^2 -1 ) = 19.975 / 0.3691 ≈53.89.

Squaring both sides:

Gamma2^2 -1 ≈ (53.89)^2≈2903.

So,

Gamma2^2≈2904 → Gamma2≈sqrt(2904 )≈53.9.

So, Gamma2≈54.

Which is option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the survival probability of particles reaching the detector walls, which depends on the Lorentz factor, velocity, and proper lifetime of the particles. The survival probability is given by:

\[
P_{\text{survive}} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{v \gamma \tau}\right),
\]

where:
- \(v\) is the particle's velocity,
- \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor,
- \(\tau\) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \(30 \, \text{m}\) is the radius of the detector.

### Step 1: Relating velocity and Lorentz factor
The velocity \(v\) is related to the Lorentz factor \(\gamma\) by:

\[
v = \beta c = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]

Substituting this into the survival probability equation, the time dilation factor \(\gamma\) modifies the effective lifetime of the particle in the lab frame. The survival probability becomes:

\[
P_{\text{survive}} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \sqrt{\gamma^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma \tau}\right).
\]

### Step 2: Using the given scenarios
In the first scenario, the Lorentz factor is \(\gamma_1 = 20\), and the survival probability is \(P_1 = \frac{1}{3}\). In the second scenario, we are tasked with finding the new Lorentz factor \(\gamma_2\) such that the survival probability is \(P_2 = \frac{2}{3}\).

Taking the ratio of the survival probabilities:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \sqrt{\gamma_2^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_2 \tau}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \sqrt{\gamma_1^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_1 \tau}\right)}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \exp\left(\frac{30}{c \tau} \left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma_1^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_1} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma_2^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_2}\right]\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{30}{c \tau} \left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma_1^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_1} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma_2^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_2}\right].
\]

### Step 3: Solving for \(\gamma_2\)
Using the given values:
- \(P_2 / P_1 = 2\),
- \(\gamma_1 = 20\),
- \(\sqrt{\gamma_1^2 - 1} = \sqrt{399} \approx 19.975\),

we substitute into the equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{30}{c \tau} \left[\frac{1}{19.975 \cdot 20} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma_2^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_2}\right].
\]

From the first scenario, the term \(\frac{30}{c \tau}\) can be expressed in terms of \(\gamma_1\):

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{P_1}\right) = \frac{30}{c \tau} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma_1^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_1}.
\]

Given \(P_1 = \frac{1}{3}\), we find:

\[
\ln(3) = \frac{30}{c \tau} \cdot \frac{1}{19.975 \cdot 20}.
\]

Solving for \(\frac{30}{c \tau}\):

\[
\frac{30}{c \tau} = \ln(3) \cdot 19.975 \cdot 20.
\]

Substituting this back into the equation for \(\ln(2)\):

\[
\ln(2) = \ln(3) \cdot 19.975 \cdot 20 \left[\frac{1}{19.975 \cdot 20} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma_2^2 - 1} \cdot \gamma_2}\right].
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\ln(2) = \ln(3) \left[1 - \frac{\sqrt{\gamma_2^2 - 1}}{\gamma_2}\right].
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{\gamma_2^2 - 1}}{\gamma_2} = 1 - \frac{\ln(2)}{\ln(3)}.
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\) and \(\ln(3) \approx 1.0986\), we find:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{\gamma_2^2 - 1}}{\gamma_2} = 1 - 0.6309 = 0.3691.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{\gamma_2^2 - 1}{\gamma_2^2} = 0.3691^2 \approx 0.1362.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\gamma_2^2 - 1 = 0.1362 \cdot \gamma_2^2.
\]

\[
\gamma_2^2 (1 - 0.1362) = 1.
\]

\[
\gamma_2^2 = \frac{1}{0.8638} \approx 1.157.
\]

\[
\gamma_2^2 \approx 2904.
\]

\[
\gamma_2 \approx \sqrt{2904} \approx 53.9.
