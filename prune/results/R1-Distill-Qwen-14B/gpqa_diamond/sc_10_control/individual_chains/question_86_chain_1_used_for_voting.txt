Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct starting materials for two reactions. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that a chemist did two reactions with two different reducing agents. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait, the products are enantiomers of each other because their configurations are R and S. So the reactions are epimerizing the configuration. I remember that reducing agents can affect the stereochemistry of ketones, maybe through some kind of reduction process.

The two reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. Oh right, I think LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is also a reducing agent but perhaps used in different contexts. Oh wait, LiBH4 is typically used for reducing carbonyl groups, like ketones and aldehydes, to alcohols. But BH3 is often used in hydroboration reactions, which are different.

Wait no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, in the context of epoxide reductions? Or maybe in the context of ketals or acetals? Wait, wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic hemiacetal, I think. Wait, pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. So tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be a cyclic ketone, like a cyclic ether with a ketone group.

So, the product is a cyclic hemiacetal? Or a cyclic ketone in a pyran ring. Let me think about the structure. 4-ethyl... so the ethyl is at position 4. And the ketone is at position 2. So the ring is five-membered? No, pyran is six-membered. Wait, no. Wait, pyran is a six-membered ring (like glucose). So the structure would be a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, but wait, the product is (R) and (S) configurations, so it's a chiral center at position 4 maybe. Hmm.

Now, the starting materials for the reactions are compounds A and B. The reactions are:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → R product
B + BH3 + H+ → S product

Wait, or is it that A and B are treated with different reducing agents (LiBH4 and BH3 respectively) to give the R and S products. So, the same starting material would give different products when reduced with different agents, but in this case, A and B are different starting materials.

Wait, no, the problem says that the chemist took two unknown compounds and treated them separately with two different reducing agents. So, each of A and B is a different starting material, each treated with a different reducing agent, leading to the R and S product respectively.

But what's the relationship between A and B? Are they enantiomers, diastereomers, or something else?

I think the key here is understanding how the reducing agents affect the starting material to form the product.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals, and when reduced, they form cyclic alcohols or something else. Or perhaps the starting materials are ketones, and the reduction leads to secondary alcohols. But the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material is an acetal or something else.

Wait, let's think about the products. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl at position 4.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C2
|
C3 - C4 (with ethyl)
|
C5
|
C6 (O connected to C6?)

Wait, perhaps the ring is like O-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6. So the ketone is at C2, and ethyl is at C4.

Now, the product is a cyclic hemiacetal? Or maybe a cyclic ketone. Regardless, the key is that the starting material must be a ketone or something that upon reduction gives this.

Wait, no, the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material is an acetal or a ketal that upon reduction (like cleavage) gives the cyclic ketone? Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters or acids that upon some reaction form the cyclic products. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are epoxides that upon reduction form the cyclic ketones.

Wait, another thought: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used for ketones and aldehydes. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, which are additions to alkenes to form alcohols with anti-Markovnikov orientation. But in some cases, BH3 might be used for ketone reductions, but I'm more familiar with LiAlH4 for that.

Wait, but another possibility is that the starting materials are cyclic acetals or ketals, and the reducing agents are cleaving them.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones), and upon reduction, they form diols which cyclize into the pyranone. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are ketones, and upon reduction with LiBH4 or BH3, they form secondary alcohols. But the product is a ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of an ester or an acid to form an alcohol, then undergoes some kind of cyclization. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and LiBH4 or BH3 reduce them to alcohols, which then form the cyclic product.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think of the product. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is an acyloin or another structure that upon reduction forms that ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a bicyclic compound, and the reduction breaks a ring, forming the six-membered ring.

Wait, another angle: The product is a pyranone, so it's a cyclic ketone. Maybe the starting materials are cyclic hemiacetals that upon reduction form the ketone. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and their reduction leads to the formation of the cyclic ketone via some elimination. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible starting materials given in the options.

The options are all (R) or (S) configurations of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the starting materials are pentanoic acids with substituents.

Looking at option A: A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B is the same. So same starting material but treated with different reagents. But if A and B are same, then their products would be same? But the products are R and S, which are enantiomers. So unless the reagents influence the stereochemistry, but if A and B are same, then perhaps reagents cause different configurations.

Wait, but the problem states that A and B are treated with two different reducing agents, leading to R and S products.

Wait, but what's the structure of the starting material? It's 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So pentanoic acid (five carbons), with substituents at position 3 (ethyl) and position 5 (isobutoxy and oxo group).

So the structure would be:

Carboxylic acid group at C1, then C2, C3 (with ethyl), then C4, and C5 (with isobutoxy and oxo). So it's:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH2CH3) - CH2 - C(O) - O - (isobutoxy?) Wait, maybe I should draw it.

The formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents.

Wait, let me number the chain:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) [ethyl]
4: CH2
5: C(O) (since it's 5-oxo), but then there's also an isobutoxy group at C5.

Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Wait, the 5 position is both an oxo (keto) group and an isobutoxy group. So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-R), where R is isobutoxy. Wait, but wait, that can't be because the oxo and the ether are on the same carbon.

Wait, 5-oxo implies a carbonyl group at C5, and 5-isobutoxy implies an ether group at C5. So the same carbon would have both a carbonyl and an O-isobutyl group. That would make it a cyclic structure? Or is it a ketone with an adjacent ether?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-R), where R is isobutyl.

But that would make the structure a gamma-keto ester or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto acid with an ether group. So when reduced, it forms a cyclic product.

Wait, now, considering the reaction conditions. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

So, the product has a six-membered ring with oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl at position 4.

If the starting material is a gamma-keto acid (like pentanoic acid with a keto group on C5), perhaps the reduction leads to a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar.

Wait, but how would the reduction of a gamma-keto acid lead to a cyclic ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a substituent, and the reduction leads to a diol which cyclizes into the pyranone.

Hmm, not sure. Let's think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration. So perhaps in one case, the reaction is a ketone reduction, and in the other, it's a hydroboration of an alkene.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material is an alkene that, upon hydroboration, forms an alcohol which then cyclizes. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an epoxide, and the reducing agent breaks the epoxide to form the diol, which then cyclizes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals. Let me think about that. If the starting material is a cyclic ketal (like an acetal), and upon treatment with a reducing agent, the ketal is cleaved to form a diol, which then forms the cyclic ketone upon elimination.

Wait, but LiBH4 is not typically used to cleave acetals. Maybe acid is used for that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) that upon reduction form diols, which then form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a lactone (cyclic ester), and when reduced with LiBH4, it becomes a diol. Then, maybe under acidic conditions, the diol cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are alpha-keto esters, and upon reduction, they form secondary alcohols, which then undergo elimination to form ketones in a cyclic structure.

Wait, but I'm not making progress on that front. Let me think differently.

The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one from A + LiBH4, and (S)-4-ethyl from B + BH3. So, the same product but with opposite configurations, depending on the reagent.

Wait, so the configuration of the product depends on the reducing agent. That suggests that the reducing agent is influencing the stereochemistry of the product.

Wait, but in the case of LiBH4 and BH3, when reducing ketones, both would form secondary alcohols, but maybe in different ways, affecting the stereochemistry. But wait, LiBH4 is a hydride source and typically leads to syn addition. Wait, but in ketone reductions, the hydride comes from the less hindered side, so the configuration would depend on the starting material.

Wait, perhaps in the starting material, the configuration is such that when treated with LiBH4 or BH3, the resulting alcohol has R or S configuration, which upon further reaction forms the cyclic product with R or S configuration.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reagents open them in different ways, leading to different configurations.

Wait, but let's think about the starting materials given in the options. They are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acids, either R or S configuration.

So, structure-wise, the starting material is:

CH2-COOH
|
CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-iBu)

Wait, maybe. So, the molecule has a carboxylic acid group on C1, an ethyl group on C3, and on C5, both a ketone (oxo) group and an isobutoxy group.

Hmm, that's a bit unusual. Maybe it's an alpha-keto acid with an ether substituent.

Now, the reduction. Let's think about how LiBH4 and BH3 would react with such a structure.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols. Wait, but the starting material is a carboxylic acid. LiBH4 typically doesn't reduce carboxylic acids; they need stronger agents like LiAlH4 for that.

Wait, but the starting material is a gamma-keto acid. So, maybe the LiBH4 is reducing the ketone group (the 5-oxo) to an alcohol.

So, if the starting material is 5-oxo-pentanoic acid, then reducing the ketone would give a secondary alcohol.

But wait, the product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material's reduction leads to a structure that can cyclize into a ring with a ketone.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material's reduction forms a diol, which then eliminates water to form the ketone.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketal or acetal, and the reagents cleave it.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reagents reduce it. But the starting materials are acids, not esters.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a lactone (cyclic ester), and the reagent reduces it to a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, let's imagine that.

If A is a lactone, LiBH4 would reduce it to a diol. Then, under acidic conditions, the diol could undergo cyclization to form the pyranone.

Wait, but lactones upon reduction with LiBH4 would open to form diols. Then, perhaps the diol undergoes acid-catalyzed cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

But how would the configuration of the diol affect the configuration of the product?

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring with substituents. So maybe the diol after reduction has two -OH groups on adjacent carbons, which can cyclize to form the ring.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diketone, and the reagents affect it in a way to form the cyclic product.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry. The products are R and S configurations, meaning that the starting materials must have the opposite configurations.

In the options, the starting materials are either R or S configurations. For example, option D has A as R and B as S.

So, if A is R and B is S, then when treated with LiBH4 and BH3, they produce R and S products.

But how does the configuration of the starting material affect the configuration of the product?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a chiral ketone, and the reduction leads to an alcohol with the opposite configuration.

Wait, but both LiBH4 and BH3 are used for ketone reductions, but LiBH4 typically gives the same stereochemistry as the starting ketone, or does it?

Wait, no, when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration of the starting ketone doesn't matter because the ketone is planar. The reduction would proceed from both sides, but maybe in a certain way.

Wait, no, when you reduce a ketone with a chiral center nearby, the configuration of the starting material can influence the product's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't a ketone but an ester or another group that, upon reduction, forms an alcohol which then cyclizes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reducing agents affect the ring-opening and re-closing with different stereochemistry.

Wait, this is getting too vague. Let's approach it differently. The options are A to D, each giving different configurations for A and B.

The products are R and S, so the configurations of the starting materials must be opposite or the same to get that.

If the reaction of A with LiBH4 gives R, and the reaction of B with BH3 gives S, then the configuration of the starting material must be such that the reagents cause the product configurations to be R and S.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different. Maybe one is a strong enough reducing agent to affect the configuration.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting materials are epoxides, and the reagents open the epoxide in different ways, leading to R and S configurations.

Wait, but the starting material in the options is a pentanoic acid derivative, not an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto acid, and the reduction leads to a diol, which then forms the cyclic product.

Wait, for example, if the starting material is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Reduction of the ketone (5-oxo) with LiBH4 would give a secondary alcohol at C5. Then, perhaps under acidic conditions, the diol (since there's also the -OH from the acid, but that's on C1) could form a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the 5-oxo group is reduced to an alcohol, and the carboxylic acid is converted into something else. Wait, but LiBH4 doesn't typically reduce carboxylic acids; they require stronger agents like LiAlH4.

Hmm, but in the presence of H+, maybe the carboxylic acid is deprotonated and converted into a carboxylate.

Wait, maybe the LiBH4 is used in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal, which upon reduction with LiBH4 gives the diol, leading to the cyclic product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha,beta-epoxy ketone, and the reagents open the epoxide in different ways.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the product structure again.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring has six members: O at position 1, ketone at position 2, and ethyl at position 4.

So the ring is:

O
||
C2
|
C3
|
C4 (ethyl)
|
C5
|
C6 (which is O connected to C6)

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto acid, and when reduced, the gamma-keto group becomes a diol which cyclizes.

Wait, for example, the starting material is CH2-COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-O-iBu). Then, reduction of the C(O) group would give CH2-COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH(OH)-O-iBu.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to lead directly to the cyclic product. Perhaps further reactions are needed, like cyclization under acidic conditions.

Wait, maybe upon reduction, the gamma-keto acid becomes a diol, which then eliminates water to form a double bond, and then undergoes cyclization to form the ring.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that upon reduction forms the product.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the options. Let's look at option D: A is R, B is S.

So if A is R and B is S, then when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives R product, and when B is treated with BH3, it gives S product.

Assuming that the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product, then perhaps LiBH4 and BH3 are causing the opposite configurations.

Wait, but why would different reagents do that?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reagents lead to the same or opposite configurations in the product.

Wait, but the product is R and S enantiomers, so if the starting materials are enantiomers, perhaps the reagents are causing the product to have opposite configurations.

Wait, but that would mean that the starting materials are enantiomers.

Looking at the options, option D has A as R and B as S. So if A and B are enantiomers, then when treated with different reagents, they might produce the same or opposite configurations.

Wait, but the products are enantiomers as well. So if A is R and B is S, and A produces R and B produces S, that would make sense.

So, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers. So, in option D, A is R and B is S, and when each is treated with their respective reagent, LiBH4 and BH3, they produce the R and S products.

But why would different reagents cause the product to be R or S?

Hmm, perhaps the reagents affect the approach of the hydride, leading to different configurations.

Wait, when LiBH4 reduces a ketone, the hydride adds to the less substituted side, leading to a specific configuration. Alternatively, if the starting material is chiral, the configuration would influence where the hydride attacks.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a chiral ketone. When reduced, the hydride adds from the less hindered side, leading to a specific configuration.

But in the starting materials given, the chiral center is at C3 (since the structure is 3-ethyl), but the ketone is at C5.

Wait, so the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-iBu)

So the chiral center is at C3 (since it has the ethyl group), which is adjacent to C2 and C4.

When the ketone at C5 is reduced, the hydride would add to C5 from either the top or bottom face, depending on the starting configuration.

Wait, but the resulting product's configuration is at C4 (the ethyl position), so maybe the reduction step influences whether the OH adds on one face or the other, leading to R or S configuration.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit lost here. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration (R or S) dictates the configuration of the product upon reduction.

If the starting material is R, then the reduction leads to the R product, and if it's S, then the S product.

So, for A, which is R and treated with LiBH4, the product is R. For B, which is S and treated with BH3, the product is S.

But then, why would the reagent matter? Because LiBH4 and BH3 are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents affect the approach of the hydride, leading to different configurations based on the reagent and the starting material.

Wait, but in either case, perhaps the correct option is D, where A is R and B is S. Because that way, each starting material, when treated with their respective reagent, leads to the correct product configuration.

So putting it all together, the correct answer would be option D: A is R, B is S.

The problem involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The key is to understand how the stereochemistry of the starting materials and the reducing agents influence the stereochemistry of the products.

The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered cyclic ketone with an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry of the product (R or S) depends on the stereochemistry of the starting material and the reducing agent. The starting materials are given as (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which are enantiomers.

When a chiral starting material is reduced, the stereochemistry of the product is influenced by the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent. In this case, the stereochemistry of the product matches that of the starting material when treated with the respective reducing agent. Therefore, for the reaction producing the (R)-product, the starting material must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Similarly, for the reaction producing the (S)-product, the starting material must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Thus, the correct pairing is A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Answer: D

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct starting materials for two reactions. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that a chemist did two reactions with two different reducing agents. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Carboxylic acid group at C1, then C2, C3 (with ethyl), then C4, and C5 (with isobutoxy and oxo). So it's:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH2CH3) - CH2 - C(O) - O - (isobutoxy?) Wait, maybe I should draw it.

The formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents.

Wait, let me number the chain:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) [ethyl]
4: CH2
5: C(O) (since it's 5-oxo), but then there's also an isobutoxy group at C5.

Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Wait, the 5 position is both an oxo (keto) group and an isobutoxy group. So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-R), where R is isobutoxy. Wait, but wait, that can't be because the oxo and the ether are on the same carbon.

Wait, 5-oxo implies a carbonyl group at C5, and 5-isobutoxy implies an ether group at C5. So the same carbon would have both a carbonyl and an O-isobutyl group. That would make it a cyclic structure? Or is it a ketone with an adjacent ether?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-R), where R is isobutyl.

But that would make the structure a gamma-keto ester or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto acid with an ether group. So when reduced, it forms a cyclic product.

Wait, now, considering the reaction conditions. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

So, the product has a six-membered ring with oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl at position 4.

If the starting material is a gamma-keto acid (like pentanoic acid with a keto group on C5), perhaps the reduction leads to a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar.

Wait, but how would the reduction of a gamma-keto acid lead to a cyclic ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a substituent, and the reduction leads to a diol which cyclizes into the pyranone.

Hmm, not sure. Let's think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration. So perhaps in one case, the reaction is a ketone reduction, and in the other, it's a hydroboration of an alkene.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material is an alkene that, upon hydroboration, forms an alcohol which then cyclizes. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an epoxide, and the reducing agent breaks the epoxide to form the diol, which then cyclizes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals. Let me think about that. If the starting material is a cyclic ketal (like an acetal), and upon treatment with a reducing agent, the ketal is cleaved to form a diol, which then forms the cyclic ketone upon elimination.

Wait, but LiBH4 is not typically used to cleave acetals. Maybe acid is used for that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) that upon reduction form diols, which then form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a lactone (cyclic ester), and when reduced with LiBH4, it becomes a diol. Then, maybe under acidic conditions, the diol cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are alpha-keto esters, and upon reduction, they form secondary alcohols, which then undergo elimination to form ketones in a cyclic structure.

Wait, but I'm not making progress on that front. Let me think differently.

The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one from A + LiBH4, and (S)-4-ethyl from B + BH3. So, the same product but with opposite configurations, depending on the reagent.

Wait, so the configuration of the product depends on the reducing agent. That suggests that the reducing agent is influencing the stereochemistry of the product.

Wait, but in the case of LiBH4 and BH3, when reducing ketones, both would form secondary alcohols, but maybe in different ways, affecting the stereochemistry. But wait, LiBH4 is a hydride source and typically leads to syn addition. Wait, but in ketone reductions, the hydride comes from the less hindered side, so the configuration would depend on the starting material.

Wait, perhaps in the starting material, the configuration is such that when treated with LiBH4 or BH3, the resulting alcohol has R or S configuration, which upon further reaction forms the cyclic product with R or S configuration.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reagents open them in different ways, leading to different configurations.

Wait, but let's think about the starting materials given in the options. They are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acids, either R or S configuration.

So, structure-wise, the starting material is:

CH2-COOH
|
CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-iBu)

Wait, maybe. So, the molecule has a carboxylic acid group on C1, an ethyl group on C3, and on C5, both a ketone (oxo) group and an isobutoxy group.

Hmm, that's a bit unusual. Maybe it's an alpha-keto acid with an ether substituent.

Now, the reduction. Let's think about how LiBH4 and BH3 would react with such a structure.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols. Wait, but the starting material is a carboxylic acid. LiBH4 typically doesn't reduce carboxylic acids; they need stronger agents like LiAlH4 for that.

Wait, but the starting material is a gamma-keto acid. So, maybe the LiBH4 is reducing the ketone group (the 5-oxo) to an alcohol.

So, if the starting material is 5-oxo-pentanoic acid, then reducing the ketone would give a secondary alcohol.

But wait, the product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material's reduction leads to a structure that can cyclize into a ring with a ketone.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material's reduction forms a diol, which then eliminates water to form the ketone.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketal or acetal, and the reagents cleave it.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reagents reduce it. But the starting materials are acids, not esters.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a lactone (cyclic ester), and the reagent reduces it to a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, let's imagine that.

If A is a lactone, LiBH4 would reduce it to a diol. Then, under acidic conditions, the diol could undergo cyclization to form the pyranone.

Wait, but lactones upon reduction with LiBH4 would open to form diols. Then, perhaps the diol undergoes acid-catalyzed cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

But how would the configuration of the diol affect the configuration of the product?

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring with substituents. So maybe the diol after reduction has two -OH groups on adjacent carbons, which can cyclize to form the ring.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diketone, and the reagents affect it in a way to form the cyclic product.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry. The products are R and S configurations, meaning that the starting materials must have the opposite configurations.

In the options, the starting materials are either R or S configurations. For example, option D has A as R and B as S.

So, if A is R and B is S, then when treated with LiBH4 and BH3, they produce R and S products.

But how does the configuration of the starting material affect the configuration of the product?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a chiral ketone, and the reduction leads to an alcohol with the opposite configuration.

Wait, but both LiBH4 and BH3 are used for ketone reductions, but LiBH4 typically gives the same stereochemistry as the starting ketone, or does it?

Wait, no, when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration of the starting ketone doesn't matter because the ketone is planar. The reduction would proceed from both sides, but maybe in a certain way.

Wait, no, when you reduce a ketone with a chiral center nearby, the configuration of the starting material can influence the product's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't a ketone but an ester or another group that, upon reduction, forms an alcohol which then cyclizes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reducing agents affect the ring-opening and re-closing with different stereochemistry.

Wait, this is getting too vague. Let's approach it differently. The options are A to D, each giving different configurations for A and B.

The products are R and S, so the configurations of the starting materials must be opposite or the same to get that.

If the reaction of A with LiBH4 gives R, and the reaction of B with BH3 gives S, then the configuration of the starting material must be such that the reagents cause the product configurations to be R and S.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different. Maybe one is a strong enough reducing agent to affect the configuration.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting materials are epoxides, and the reagents open the epoxide in different ways, leading to R and S configurations.

Wait, but the starting material in the options is a pentanoic acid derivative, not an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto acid, and the reduction leads to a diol, which then forms the cyclic product.

Wait, for example, if the starting material is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Reduction of the ketone (5-oxo) with LiBH4 would give a secondary alcohol at C5. Then, perhaps under acidic conditions, the diol (since there's also the -OH from the acid, but that's on C1) could form a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the 5-oxo group is reduced to an alcohol, and the carboxylic acid is converted into something else. Wait, but LiBH4 doesn't typically reduce carboxylic acids; they require stronger agents like LiAlH4.

Hmm, but in the presence of H+, maybe the carboxylic acid is deprotonated and converted into a carboxylate.

Wait, maybe the LiBH4 is used in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal, which upon reduction with LiBH4 gives the diol, leading to the cyclic product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha,beta-epoxy ketone, and the reagents open the epoxide in different ways.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the product structure again.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring has six members: O at position 1, ketone at position 2, and ethyl at position 4.

So the ring is:

O
||
C2
|
C3
|
C4 (ethyl)
|
C5
|
C6 (which is O connected to C6)

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto acid, and when reduced, the gamma-keto group becomes a diol which cyclizes.

Wait, for example, the starting material is CH2-COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-O-iBu). Then, reduction of the C(O) group would give CH2-COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH(OH)-O-iBu.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to lead directly to the cyclic product. Perhaps further reactions are needed, like cyclization under acidic conditions.

Wait, maybe upon reduction, the gamma-keto acid becomes a diol, which then eliminates water to form a double bond, and then undergoes cyclization to form the ring.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that upon reduction forms the product.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the options. Let's look at option D: A is R, B is S.

So if A is R and B is S, then when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives R product, and when B is treated with BH3, it gives S product.

Assuming that the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product, then perhaps LiBH4 and BH3 are causing the opposite configurations.

Wait, but why would different reagents do that?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reagents lead to the same or opposite configurations in the product.

Wait, but the product is R and S enantiomers, so if the starting materials are enantiomers, perhaps the reagents are causing the product to have opposite configurations.

Wait, but that would mean that the starting materials are enantiomers.

Looking at the options, option D has A as R and B as S. So if A and B are enantiomers, then when treated with different reagents, they might produce the same or opposite configurations.

Wait, but the products are enantiomers as well. So if A is R and B is S, and A produces R and B produces S, that would make sense.

So, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers. So, in option D, A is R and B is S, and when each is treated with their respective reagent, LiBH4 and BH3, they produce the R and S products.

But why would different reagents cause the product to be R or S?

Hmm, perhaps the reagents affect the approach of the hydride, leading to different configurations.

Wait, when LiBH4 reduces a ketone, the hydride adds to the less substituted side, leading to a specific configuration. Alternatively, if the starting material is chiral, the configuration would influence where the hydride attacks.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a chiral ketone. When reduced, the hydride adds from the less hindered side, leading to a specific configuration.

But in the starting materials given, the chiral center is at C3 (since the structure is 3-ethyl), but the ketone is at C5.

Wait, so the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-iBu)

So the chiral center is at C3 (since it has the ethyl group), which is adjacent to C2 and C4.

When the ketone at C5 is reduced, the hydride would add to C5 from either the top or bottom face, depending on the starting configuration.

Wait, but the resulting product's configuration is at C4 (the ethyl position), so maybe the reduction step influences whether the OH adds on one face or the other, leading to R or S configuration.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit lost here. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration (R or S) dictates the configuration of the product upon reduction.

If the starting material is R, then the reduction leads to the R product, and if it's S, then the S product.

So, for A, which is R and treated with LiBH4, the product is R. For B, which is S and treated with BH3, the product is S.

But then, why would the reagent matter? Because LiBH4 and BH3 are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents affect the approach of the hydride, leading to different configurations based on the reagent and the starting material.

Wait, but in either case, perhaps the correct option is D, where A is R and B is S. Because that way, each starting material, when treated with their respective reagent, leads to the correct product configuration.

So putting it all together, the correct answer would be option D: A is R, B is S.


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The key is to understand how the stereochemistry of the starting materials and the reducing agents influence the stereochemistry of the products.

The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered cyclic ketone with an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry of the product (R or S) depends on the stereochemistry of the starting material and the reducing agent. The starting materials are given as (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which are enantiomers.

When a chiral starting material is reduced, the stereochemistry of the product is influenced by the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent. In this case, the stereochemistry of the product matches that of the starting material when treated with the respective reducing agent. Therefore, for the reaction producing the (R)-product, the starting material must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Similarly, for the reaction producing the (S)-product, the starting material must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Thus, the correct pairing is A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Answer: D
