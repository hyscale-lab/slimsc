Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what I can figure out.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, what's 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon, a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms in the 1 and 3 positions of the adamantane skeleton.

Heating with KOH (a strong base) suggests an elimination reaction, probably dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromines, maybe we get a di-elimination. Adamantane has a rigid structure, so the elimination would form an allene or perhaps a conjugated diene. Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes. But with two adjacent Br atoms, maybe it forms a cyclopropane? Or perhaps a ring expansion?

Wait, no. When a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, it can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. For vicinal dihalides, two eliminations could occur, but since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, the positions are not adjacent. So the elimination would form a diene? Hmm, but in adamantane, the positions are across the structure. Wait, perhaps it's a ring-opening? Or maybe it's a different kind of elimination.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the possible product. Another possibility is that the two bromines are in a position that allows for a double elimination, but perhaps more likely, each Br leaves, and the structure forms a new double bond. Wait, but with two Brs, maybe it's a di-elimination, forming a conjugated diene or an allene.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a single elimination, producing a mono-ene. Wait, but the product is a solid, and the NMR data might give clues.

The NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. So maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by something else?

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH could undergo a double elimination. Wait, but if each Br is on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the Br atoms are on opposite ends of the adamantane structure. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. So the adjacent bridgeheads would have two Brs. So when KOH is added, maybe each Br leaves, and the two carbons form a double bond, leading to a cyclopropane ring? Or maybe a bridge is formed.

Wait, another thought: when a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent Brs) is treated with a base, it can form an alkene via double elimination. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the Brs are not adjacent. So perhaps each Br undergoes elimination separately, but how?

Wait, maybe each Br is eliminated to form a new structure. But in that case, perhaps the product is a ketone or an alcohol? Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbocation, which then could rearrange or lose another Br.

Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, so perhaps the product is a ketone. So how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH form a ketone?

Wait, maybe the Brs are in positions that when eliminated, a carbonyl group is formed. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism or something else.

Alternatively, thinking about the reaction: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, it's possible that each Br leaves, forming a carbocation which then combines with other parts of the molecule. But given the structure of adamantane, maybe it's more likely that the two Brs are eliminated as Br- and form a double bond. But wait, if two Brs are eliminated, perhaps forming a ketone? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming an allene. But that would give an alkene, not a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates somewhere, leading to a conjugate elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are in a position such that elimination leads to ring contraction or expansion, forming a carbonyl group. For example, perhaps the structure rearranges to form a ketone.

Wait, considering the NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably an -OCH2- group, maybe a methylene next to an oxygen. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative group. The 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) suggests a lot of equivalent CH2 groups, maybe in a ring structure.

Wait, another thought: if the product is a ketone, perhaps it's a diketone. But the 4.79 ppm is more suggestive of an ether or something with an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol? No, because IR shows a carbonyl (C=O), not an alcohol (O-H stretch).

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is strong and probably a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. So how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon treatment with KOH?

Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by an hydroxyl group, but that would lead to a diol. However, diols don't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition or elimination.

Wait, maybe the base induces elimination of HBr twice, leading to formation of a ketone. Wait, but elimination typically forms alkenes, not ketones. Unless it's a pinacol-like elimination, but that usually involves vicinal diols.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen adjacent to a Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. But since there are two Brs, perhaps two eliminations happen, forming a conjugated diene. But the IR doesn't show a peak for C=C, which is usually around 1600-1680 cm-1. The IR here shows 1720, which is more characteristic of a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but with a subsequent rearrangement to form a carbonyl. For example, perhaps the molecule undergoes a migration, leading to a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a substitution reaction where each Br is replaced by an -OH, but that would form a diol. But then, how does the diol convert to a ketone?

Wait, maybe the diol undergoes oxidation, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent, so that might not fit. Unless the conditions are such that elimination occurs, leading to a ketone via some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring with an oxygen attached, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the KOH is causing a ring-opening of the adamantane structure. But adamantane is pretty stable and not easily reactive.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of an epoxide? No, that would require an oxygen, and the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane without any oxygen. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of dehydrohalogenation leading to a ketone via some [n.m] shift. For example, the base abstracts a hydrogen, leading to a bromide leaving and forming a carbocation, which then undergoes a hydride shift to form a more stable carbocation, which then gets deprotonated to form a carbonyl.

But let's think about the structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a rigid structure with two bromines on adjacent bridgeheads. So each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. When KOH is added, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to each Br, leading to their elimination as HBr, forming two double bonds. But wait, bridgehead double bonds are not common due to Bredt's rule. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and the elimination leads to a carbonyl group. But bridgehead carbonyls are also not common. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But the NMR shows only one carbonyl region, so perhaps it's a single ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a geminal diol, but that would have O-H stretches in IR, which aren't mentioned. So probably not.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the NMR data. The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. That's a pretty upfield shift for two protons. Wait, but 4.79 is more downfield than 4 ppm. Wait, what's the typical shift for an -OCH2- group? For example, in an ether like THF, the CH2O is around 3.7 ppm. So 4.79 is higher, maybe an -OCH2- adjacent to an electronegative group.

Wait, but product 1's NMR has a singlet at 4.79 for 2H. Singlet suggests no neighboring protons. So perhaps it's an -OCH2O- group, like in a diether, but that's not likely.

Wait, maybe the 4.79 ppm is a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, such as in a ketone or ester. Or perhaps it's an epoxide, but that's a stretch.

Wait, considering the IR at 1720 cm-1, that suggests a ketone or maybe an ester. If it's a ketone, the NMR would have a singlet for the carbonyl, but the 4.79 ppm might be an adjacent methylene.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is 1,3-adamantanone. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane has four fused cyclohexane rings. If one of the bridgehead carbons is oxidized to a ketone, that would be 1-adamantanone. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps two bridgehead Brs are replaced by ketones? But that would require two oxidation steps, which might not happen under these conditions.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is eliminated to form a double bond, but that would require two eliminations, but how does that lead to a ketone?

Wait, perhaps the base induces elimination of HBr twice, leading to a conjugated diene. But then, where is the carbonyl coming from? Maybe some kind of conjugation or rearrangement leads to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. If KOH performs a substitution, each Br could be replaced by an -OH group, forming a diol. But then, how does a diol have a carbonyl group? Unless it undergoes some kind of oxidation or elimination. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination where each Br is removed, and the two adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. For example, if each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to a carbonyl group. But bridgehead carbonyls are not very common because of the strain.

Wait, maybe the product is a bicyclic ketone. Let me think about the structure. If the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, upon elimination, the two carbons could each lose a Br and form a double bond, but that would lead to a bridgehead double bond, which isn't allowed. So perhaps the molecule undergoes a ring contraction or expansion, leading to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a ring-opening, releasing CO2 or something, but that seems unlikely.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look at the next step to get some clues.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is typically used as a Lewis acid catalyst, often in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or something similar. Or maybe the ketone is reacting in some way.

Wait, but product 1 has a ketone. So maybe product 2 is an enol ether or something. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but I don't think so because the IR doesn't show the epoxide C-O-C peak.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but earlier I thought the IR doesn't support that. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to identify product 1 first.

Given the NMR:

- 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet)
- 2.41-2.23 (10H, multiplet)
- 1.94 (2H, triplet?)

Wait, the triplet at 1.94 ppm could be a CH2 group next to another CH2 group. The 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) suggests a lot of equivalent protons, maybe in a ring structure, like adamantane's structure.

The 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet) suggests two equivalent protons not split by any neighbors. Maybe they're on an oxygen, like an -OCH2O- group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in a ketone, the adjacent CH2 groups would be upfield. But maybe in product 1, the carbonyl is part of an ester or something else.

Wait, another idea: perhaps product 1 is a diepoxide. But then the IR would show the C-O-C peak around 1200-1300 cm-1, which isn't mentioned.

Hmm, perhaps the product is a diketone. Let's say the two bridgehead Brs are replaced by ketones, so 1,3-diketone adamantane. But I'm not sure about the structure.

Wait, but considering the NMR, the singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H) is perplexing. Maybe it's an -OCH2- group, but where? Let's think about possible structures.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a gem-diol. But again, that would have O-H peaks, which aren't described.

Wait, another approach. The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. Let's think about the possible carbonyl-containing compounds.

Option 1: It's a ketone (e.g., 1-adamantanone). Then, the NMR would show the ketone's CH2 groups. But in adamantane, the carbonyl would be in a bridgehead, so perhaps the adjacent CH2 groups.

Alternatively, the structure might have a carbonyl and an oxygenated CH2 group.

Wait, another possibility is that the product is a cyclic ether, but that would require oxygen, which isn't present in the starting materials. So that's not likely.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bridgehead alcohol, but again, the IR doesn't show O-H stretch.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane with a ketone group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a bicyclic ketone.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination forming an allene, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. But I'm not sure about that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diene, but I thought the IR didn't support that.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed assuming that product 1 is a ketone, and think about the next step.

Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So if product 1 is an aromatic compound, product 2 might be a more substituted arene. But product 1 isn't aromatic.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a ketone, and when treated with Al(OR)3, it could undergo some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and Al isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for some kind of rearrangement or addition.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a ketone, and it's treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But ketones are not typically substrates for Friedel-Crafts; usually, it's for alkanes or alkyl halides.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a dienone, and the Al isopropoxide induces a ring expansion or contraction.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone. Let's imagine that product 1 is a bicyclo structure with a ketone. Then, heating with Al isopropoxide might induce a ring-opening or other rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, but that would require O in the molecule, which is absent initially.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a ketone, and product 2 is the same as product 1 but with some functional group change.

Alternatively, product 2 could be an enol ether if product 1 was a ketone and some kind of acetal formation occurred. But without an alcohol, that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is a mono-ketone. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane ketone. Well, cyclopropane rings with ketones are possible, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a tricyclic ketone, and product 2 is a different tricyclic compound.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should look at the next step.

Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3.

Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So product 2 must have a double bond, perhaps a diene, which upon ozonolysis would form carbonyl groups.

So if product 3 is formed from ozonolysis of product 2, then product 2 must have an alkene.

So, product 2 has an alkene, which is cleaved by ozone into carbonyls.

Wait, but wait. Ozonolysis of a diene can give different products depending on the structure. If product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a mono-alkene, ozonolysis would break into a single carbonyl.

But looking at the options for the NMR of product 3, perhaps the most deshielded proton is in a specific coupling environment.

But let's step back.

Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. So product 2 must have a double bond. Let's think about the structure of product 2.

Product 1 is 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH, which gave a carbonyl. Then product 1 treated with Al isopropoxide gives product 2, which has a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. Because enol ethers have double bonds adjacent to oxygen.

Wait, enol ethers are formed when a ketone is treated with a base to form an enolate, which then is protonated to form an enol. But with Al isopropoxide, perhaps a Lewis acid-catalyzed dehydration occurs, leading to an enol ether.

Wait, so if product 1 is a ketone, and then treated with Al isopropoxide (a Lewis acid), it could catalyze the dehydration of the ketone to form an enol ether. Enol ethers have the structure R-O-CH2-CH-O-R or something similar, but more likely, a conjugated enol ether.

Wait, but then product 2 would have a double bond. Ozonolysis of an enol ether would cleave at the double bond. But wait, ozonolysis of an enol ether (which is an allyl ether) would break the double bond and form carbonyl groups.

But in enol ethers, the double bond is conjugated with the oxygen. Ozonolysis of such a structure would give two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but product 3 is the result after ozonolysis. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

But let's think about the NMR of product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding exchangeable ones like OH).

If the ozonolysis breaks a double bond into carbonyl groups, the resulting product might have protons adjacent to carbonyls, which are deshielded.

So let's imagine product 2 is an enol ether, like an allyl ether. For example, structure like O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O, but conjugated. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, for an enol ether, the structure would be something like: R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R, but with a double bond. Or more accurately, R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no. Enol ethers have the structure R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R, but the double bond is between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, the correct structure is R-O-CH2-CH-O-R where the double bond is between the two CH groups. So, for example, a structure like R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? No, wait, that's not right. Enol ethers are typically R-O-CH2-CH-O-R with a double bond between the two CH groups, like O-CH2-CH2-O with the double bond between the CH2 groups. Wait, no, wait—actually, the enol ether structure is R-O-CH2-CH-O-R, with a double bond between the two CH groups. So, it's an ether with an adjacent double bond.

So when ozone is bubbled through product 2, which is an enol ether, the double bond is cleaved, and the product would be two carbonyl compounds attached to the oxygen.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an enol ether would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, perhaps as ketones or aldehydes, depending on the structure.

But in this case, product 3 is formed by ozonolysis followed by addition of dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, and the work-up with dimethylsulfide (a reductive work-up) would prevent the formation of ozonides and lead to the formation of aldehydes or ketones instead of acids or other products.

So, for example, if product 2 is an enol ether like O-CH2-CH2-O with a double bond (actually, it's O-CH2-CH2-O with the double bond between the two CH2 groups?), then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a substituted cyclobutene or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene. Ozonolysis of a diene would form two carbonyl groups. If product 3 is the ozonolysis product of a diene, then the structure would have two carbonyls.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the overall structure.

Let's try to outline the possible structures:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → treated with KOH → product 1 (a ketone)
2. Product 1 → treated with Al isopropoxide → product 2 (an enol ether)
3. Product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3 (two carbonyl groups)

If product 3 has carbonyl groups, then the NMR would show deshielded protons next to carbonyls.

So, in product 3, the most deshielded protons would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. These protons would typically show up downfield, perhaps around 2.1 ppm or higher.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. Let's think about possible structures.

If product 3 has a carbonyl group and adjacent protons, the coupling would depend on the neighboring protons.

For example, if a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl, the protons on the CH2 would couple with each other and possibly with neighboring groups.

Wait, but in the NMR of product 3, what peaks are observed? The question says that the 1H NMR of 3 has a peak for the most deshielded hydrogen, and we need to determine its coupling pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, with two carbonyl groups. The most deshielded proton would be adjacent to a carbonyl, maybe on a CH2 group.

If the CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl, each proton on the CH2 would see each other and possibly neighboring protons. So, for a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each H is split by the two neighboring Hs on the same CH2, leading to a triplet pattern (n+1, where n=2). But wait, that would be a triplet, but perhaps there's more coupling.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, then each proton would couple with the two protons on their own CH2 and the two on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets or a more complex splitting.

Wait, but let's think in terms of the ozonolysis product. Suppose product 2 is a diene, and ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyl groups.

For example, if product 2 is a 1,3-diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, producing a dialdehyde or diketone.

But in this case, perhaps product 2 is a mono-alkene, and ozonolysis breaks it into a single carbonyl group.

Wait, but product 3 is the ozonolysis product, so maybe it's a ketone or aldehyde.

Let me think about the structure of product 2. If product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is a dienone (a ketone with a double bond), then ozonolysis of product 2 would break the double bond into two carbonyls, leading to a diepoxy or something else.

But perhaps product 2 is a conjugated dienone, so ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls.

Wait, another approach: perhaps product 2 is a bridgehead alkene. Ozonolysis would break the bridgehead double bond, but I'm not certain about the product.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a monoene, and ozonolysis would produce a single carbonyl.

But I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should consider the possible structures again.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether (an allyl ether). Ozonolysis of an enol ether would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups, yielding two ketones or aldehydes.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, perhaps as aldehydes.

But aldehydes have protons that are deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm, but the question says to exclude exchangeable protons (like OH or NH), so maybe the most deshielded is a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, but in product 3, after ozonolysis, if product 2 was an enol ether, let's say O-CH2-CH2-O with a double bond between the CH2 groups, then ozonolysis would break the double bond, and each end would form a carbonyl.

So, for example, if product 2 is O-CH2-CH2-O, but with a double bond between the CH2 groups (making it O-CH2-CH2-O but with a double bond, which isn't possible because that would require four bonds on the oxygen. So that's not possible. So perhaps product 2 is an allyl ether, like O-R-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-R, but with a double bond in the middle.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a structure like O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O, but with a double bond between the middle CH2 groups. So, O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O where the double bond is between the two middle CH2 groups. But that's not possible because that would require each CH2 to have a double bond, which would make it a cumulene, which is not stable.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-CH2-O, with the double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it O-CH2-CH2-O but with a double bond between the CH2 groups. But that's a conjugated diene, but then the oxygen would be in the middle.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether with a structure like O-CH2-CH2-O and a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it O-CH2-CH2-O with a double bond. But that's not possible because the double bond would require four bonds on the carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an allyl ether, like O-R-CH2-CH2-CH2-O, but with a double bond between the CH2 groups, making it O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O but with a double bond between the two middle CH2 groups. That would be O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O with a double bond, but that's not a stable structure.

Hmm, maybe it's better to think about product 3's structure. If product 2 is an enol ether, then product 3 would have two carbonyl groups after ozonolysis.

But then, the NMR of product 3 would have protons adjacent to carbonyls. For example, if product 3 is a diketone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyls would be deshielded.

So, each of these CH2 groups next to a carbonyl would have protons that are split by neighboring protons.

If each CH2 is next to a carbonyl and another CH2 group, each proton would see two neighboring protons on the same CH2 and perhaps two on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but if the structure is a CH2-CO group, then each proton on the CH2 would be split by the two others on the same CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

But if adjacent to another CH2 group, perhaps each H would see two on their own CH2 and two on the adjacent, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in a CH2-CO-CH2 structure, each CH2 would have neighboring CH2 groups. So each H on the CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on their own CH2 (giving a triplet) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). So the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that each CH2 is only next to one other CH2, then each H would be a triplet.

But wait, let me think about the coupling. For a CH2 group next to another CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on their own CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So the splitting would be (n+1) for each coupling. So for each H on the CH2, they would couple with two Hs on their own CH2 (giving a triplet) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). The overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But wait, I'm not sure about the structure. Let me try to imagine product 3.

Assuming product 3 is a diketone, with two ketone groups. The structure might be something like O=C-R-R-C=O. If R is a CH2 group, then each CH2 would be adjacent to a carbonyl.

So the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. But wait, that's a four-carbon chain with two ketones at each end. So the central CH2 groups would each have two neighboring Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, where each CH2 is between two carbonyls. So each CH2 group would have protons that are split by their adjacent CH2 group.

So each H on the CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on their own CH2 (triplet) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Therefore, the most deshielded hydrogen (on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl) would have a triplet of triplet coupling pattern.

Looking back at the options:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So the correct answer would be option B: triplet of triplets.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to product 3, whose most deshielded hydrogen's coupling pattern is to be determined. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH**  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C produces product 1. The IR spectrum shows a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the formation of a ketone. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H singlet; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H multiplet; 1.94 ppm, 2H triplet) suggests a ketone structure with specific proton environments.

2. **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Al(isopropoxide)**  
   Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, to form product 2. This step likely involves the formation of an enol ether (an allyl ether) from the ketone, introducing a double bond adjacent to oxygen.

3. **Reaction 3: Product 2 + Ozonolysis**  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming product 3. The work-up with dimethylsulfide ensures a reductive cleavage, yielding carbonyl compounds. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. This CH₂ group is coupled with two hydrogens on its own CH₂ (triplet splitting) and two hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group (another triplet splitting). The combined splitting results in a triplet of triplets.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

Answer: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what I can figure out.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, what's 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon, a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms in the 1 and 3 positions of the adamantane skeleton.

Heating with KOH (a strong base) suggests an elimination reaction, probably dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromines, maybe we get a di-elimination. Adamantane has a rigid structure, so the elimination would form an allene or perhaps a conjugated diene. Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes. But with two adjacent Br atoms, maybe it forms a cyclopropane? Or perhaps a ring expansion?

Wait, no. When a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, it can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. For vicinal dihalides, two eliminations could occur, but since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, the positions are not adjacent. So the elimination would form a diene? Hmm, but in adamantane, the positions are across the structure. Wait, perhaps it's a ring-opening? Or maybe it's a different kind of elimination.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the possible product. Another possibility is that the two bromines are in a position that allows for a double elimination, but perhaps more likely, each Br leaves, and the structure forms a new double bond. Wait, but with two Brs, maybe it's a di-elimination, forming a conjugated diene or an allene.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a single elimination, producing a mono-ene. Wait, but the product is a solid, and the NMR data might give clues.

The NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. So maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by something else?

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH could undergo a double elimination. Wait, but if each Br is on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the Br atoms are on opposite ends of the adamantane structure. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. So the adjacent bridgeheads would have two Brs. So when KOH is added, maybe each Br leaves, and the two carbons form a double bond, leading to a cyclopropane ring? Or maybe a bridge is formed.

Wait, another thought: when a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent Brs) is treated with a base, it can form an alkene via double elimination. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the Brs are not adjacent. So perhaps each Br undergoes elimination separately, but how?

Wait, maybe each Br is eliminated to form a new structure. But in that case, perhaps the product is a ketone or an alcohol? Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbocation, which then could rearrange or lose another Br.

Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, so perhaps the product is a ketone. So how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH form a ketone?

Wait, maybe the Brs are in positions that when eliminated, a carbonyl group is formed. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism or something else.

Alternatively, thinking about the reaction: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, it's possible that each Br leaves, forming a carbocation which then combines with other parts of the molecule. But given the structure of adamantane, maybe it's more likely that the two Brs are eliminated as Br- and form a double bond. But wait, if two Brs are eliminated, perhaps forming a ketone? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming an allene. But that would give an alkene, not a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates somewhere, leading to a conjugate elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are in a position such that elimination leads to ring contraction or expansion, forming a carbonyl group. For example, perhaps the structure rearranges to form a ketone.

Wait, considering the NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably an -OCH2- group, maybe a methylene next to an oxygen. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative group. The 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) suggests a lot of equivalent CH2 groups, maybe in a ring structure.

Wait, another thought: if the product is a ketone, perhaps it's a diketone. But the 4.79 ppm is more suggestive of an ether or something with an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol? No, because IR shows a carbonyl (C=O), not an alcohol (O-H stretch).

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is strong and probably a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. So how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon treatment with KOH?

Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by an hydroxyl group, but that would lead to a diol. However, diols don't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition or elimination.

Wait, maybe the base induces elimination of HBr twice, leading to formation of a ketone. Wait, but elimination typically forms alkenes, not ketones. Unless it's a pinacol-like elimination, but that usually involves vicinal diols.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen adjacent to a Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. But since there are two Brs, perhaps two eliminations happen, forming a conjugated diene. But the IR doesn't show a peak for C=C, which is usually around 1600-1680 cm-1. The IR here shows 1720, which is more characteristic of a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but with a subsequent rearrangement to form a carbonyl. For example, perhaps the molecule undergoes a migration, leading to a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a substitution reaction where each Br is replaced by an -OH, but that would form a diol. But then, how does the diol convert to a ketone?

Wait, maybe the diol undergoes oxidation, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent, so that might not fit. Unless the conditions are such that elimination occurs, leading to a ketone via some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring with an oxygen attached, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the KOH is causing a ring-opening of the adamantane structure. But adamantane is pretty stable and not easily reactive.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of an epoxide? No, that would require an oxygen, and the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane without any oxygen. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of dehydrohalogenation leading to a ketone via some [n.m] shift. For example, the base abstracts a hydrogen, leading to a bromide leaving and forming a carbocation, which then undergoes a hydride shift to form a more stable carbocation, which then gets deprotonated to form a carbonyl.

But let's think about the structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a rigid structure with two bromines on adjacent bridgeheads. So each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. When KOH is added, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to each Br, leading to their elimination as HBr, forming two double bonds. But wait, bridgehead double bonds are not common due to Bredt's rule. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and the elimination leads to a carbonyl group. But bridgehead carbonyls are also not common. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But the NMR shows only one carbonyl region, so perhaps it's a single ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a geminal diol, but that would have O-H stretches in IR, which aren't mentioned. So probably not.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the NMR data. The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. That's a pretty upfield shift for two protons. Wait, but 4.79 is more downfield than 4 ppm. Wait, what's the typical shift for an -OCH2- group? For example, in an ether like THF, the CH2O is around 3.7 ppm. So 4.79 is higher, maybe an -OCH2- adjacent to an electronegative group.

Wait, but product 1's NMR has a singlet at 4.79 for 2H. Singlet suggests no neighboring protons. So perhaps it's an -OCH2O- group, like in a diether, but that's not likely.

Wait, maybe the 4.79 ppm is a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, such as in a ketone or ester. Or perhaps it's an epoxide, but that's a stretch.

Wait, considering the IR at 1720 cm-1, that suggests a ketone or maybe an ester. If it's a ketone, the NMR would have a singlet for the carbonyl, but the 4.79 ppm might be an adjacent methylene.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is 1,3-adamantanone. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane has four fused cyclohexane rings. If one of the bridgehead carbons is oxidized to a ketone, that would be 1-adamantanone. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps two bridgehead Brs are replaced by ketones? But that would require two oxidation steps, which might not happen under these conditions.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is eliminated to form a double bond, but that would require two eliminations, but how does that lead to a ketone?

Wait, perhaps the base induces elimination of HBr twice, leading to a conjugated diene. But then, where is the carbonyl coming from? Maybe some kind of conjugation or rearrangement leads to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. If KOH performs a substitution, each Br could be replaced by an -OH group, forming a diol. But then, how does a diol have a carbonyl group? Unless it undergoes some kind of oxidation or elimination. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination where each Br is removed, and the two adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. For example, if each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to a carbonyl group. But bridgehead carbonyls are not very common because of the strain.

Wait, maybe the product is a bicyclic ketone. Let me think about the structure. If the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, upon elimination, the two carbons could each lose a Br and form a double bond, but that would lead to a bridgehead double bond, which isn't allowed. So perhaps the molecule undergoes a ring contraction or expansion, leading to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a ring-opening, releasing CO2 or something, but that seems unlikely.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look at the next step to get some clues.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is typically used as a Lewis acid catalyst, often in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or something similar. Or maybe the ketone is reacting in some way.

Wait, but product 1 has a ketone. So maybe product 2 is an enol ether or something. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but I don't think so because the IR doesn't show the epoxide C-O-C peak.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but earlier I thought the IR doesn't support that. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to identify product 1 first.

Given the NMR:

- 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet)
- 2.41-2.23 (10H, multiplet)
- 1.94 (2H, triplet?)

Wait, the triplet at 1.94 ppm could be a CH2 group next to another CH2 group. The 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) suggests a lot of equivalent protons, maybe in a ring structure, like adamantane's structure.

The 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet) suggests two equivalent protons not split by any neighbors. Maybe they're on an oxygen, like an -OCH2O- group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in a ketone, the adjacent CH2 groups would be upfield. But maybe in product 1, the carbonyl is part of an ester or something else.

Wait, another idea: perhaps product 1 is a diepoxide. But then the IR would show the C-O-C peak around 1200-1300 cm-1, which isn't mentioned.

Hmm, perhaps the product is a diketone. Let's say the two bridgehead Brs are replaced by ketones, so 1,3-diketone adamantane. But I'm not sure about the structure.

Wait, but considering the NMR, the singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H) is perplexing. Maybe it's an -OCH2- group, but where? Let's think about possible structures.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a gem-diol. But again, that would have O-H peaks, which aren't described.

Wait, another approach. The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. Let's think about the possible carbonyl-containing compounds.

Option 1: It's a ketone (e.g., 1-adamantanone). Then, the NMR would show the ketone's CH2 groups. But in adamantane, the carbonyl would be in a bridgehead, so perhaps the adjacent CH2 groups.

Alternatively, the structure might have a carbonyl and an oxygenated CH2 group.

Wait, another possibility is that the product is a cyclic ether, but that would require oxygen, which isn't present in the starting materials. So that's not likely.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bridgehead alcohol, but again, the IR doesn't show O-H stretch.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane with a ketone group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a bicyclic ketone.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination forming an allene, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. But I'm not sure about that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diene, but I thought the IR didn't support that.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed assuming that product 1 is a ketone, and think about the next step.

Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So if product 1 is an aromatic compound, product 2 might be a more substituted arene. But product 1 isn't aromatic.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a ketone, and when treated with Al(OR)3, it could undergo some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and Al isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for some kind of rearrangement or addition.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a ketone, and it's treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But ketones are not typically substrates for Friedel-Crafts; usually, it's for alkanes or alkyl halides.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a dienone, and the Al isopropoxide induces a ring expansion or contraction.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone. Let's imagine that product 1 is a bicyclo structure with a ketone. Then, heating with Al isopropoxide might induce a ring-opening or other rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, but that would require O in the molecule, which is absent initially.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a ketone, and product 2 is the same as product 1 but with some functional group change.

Alternatively, product 2 could be an enol ether if product 1 was a ketone and some kind of acetal formation occurred. But without an alcohol, that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is a mono-ketone. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane ketone. Well, cyclopropane rings with ketones are possible, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a tricyclic ketone, and product 2 is a different tricyclic compound.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should look at the next step.

Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3.

Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So product 2 must have a double bond, perhaps a diene, which upon ozonolysis would form carbonyl groups.

So if product 3 is formed from ozonolysis of product 2, then product 2 must have an alkene.

So, product 2 has an alkene, which is cleaved by ozone into carbonyls.

Wait, but wait. Ozonolysis of a diene can give different products depending on the structure. If product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a mono-alkene, ozonolysis would break into a single carbonyl.

But looking at the options for the NMR of product 3, perhaps the most deshielded proton is in a specific coupling environment.

But let's step back.

Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. So product 2 must have a double bond. Let's think about the structure of product 2.

Product 1 is 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH, which gave a carbonyl. Then product 1 treated with Al isopropoxide gives product 2, which has a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. Because enol ethers have double bonds adjacent to oxygen.

Wait, enol ethers are formed when a ketone is treated with a base to form an enolate, which then is protonated to form an enol. But with Al isopropoxide, perhaps a Lewis acid-catalyzed dehydration occurs, leading to an enol ether.

Wait, so if product 1 is a ketone, and then treated with Al isopropoxide (a Lewis acid), it could catalyze the dehydration of the ketone to form an enol ether. Enol ethers have the structure R-O-CH2-CH-O-R or something similar, but more likely, a conjugated enol ether.

Wait, but then product 2 would have a double bond. Ozonolysis of an enol ether would cleave at the double bond. But wait, ozonolysis of an enol ether (which is an allyl ether) would break the double bond and form carbonyl groups.

But in enol ethers, the double bond is conjugated with the oxygen. Ozonolysis of such a structure would give two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but product 3 is the result after ozonolysis. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

But let's think about the NMR of product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding exchangeable ones like OH).

If the ozonolysis breaks a double bond into carbonyl groups, the resulting product might have protons adjacent to carbonyls, which are deshielded.

So let's imagine product 2 is an enol ether, like an allyl ether. For example, structure like O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O, but conjugated. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, for an enol ether, the structure would be something like: R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R, but with a double bond. Or more accurately, R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no. Enol ethers have the structure R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R, but the double bond is between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, the correct structure is R-O-CH2-CH-O-R where the double bond is between the two CH groups. So, for example, a structure like R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? No, wait, that's not right. Enol ethers are typically R-O-CH2-CH-O-R with a double bond between the two CH groups, like O-CH2-CH2-O with the double bond between the CH2 groups. Wait, no, wait—actually, the enol ether structure is R-O-CH2-CH-O-R, with a double bond between the two CH groups. So, it's an ether with an adjacent double bond.

So when ozone is bubbled through product 2, which is an enol ether, the double bond is cleaved, and the product would be two carbonyl compounds attached to the oxygen.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an enol ether would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, perhaps as ketones or aldehydes, depending on the structure.

But in this case, product 3 is formed by ozonolysis followed by addition of dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, and the work-up with dimethylsulfide (a reductive work-up) would prevent the formation of ozonides and lead to the formation of aldehydes or ketones instead of acids or other products.

So, for example, if product 2 is an enol ether like O-CH2-CH2-O with a double bond (actually, it's O-CH2-CH2-O with the double bond between the two CH2 groups?), then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a substituted cyclobutene or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene. Ozonolysis of a diene would form two carbonyl groups. If product 3 is the ozonolysis product of a diene, then the structure would have two carbonyls.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the overall structure.

Let's try to outline the possible structures:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → treated with KOH → product 1 (a ketone)
2. Product 1 → treated with Al isopropoxide → product 2 (an enol ether)
3. Product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3 (two carbonyl groups)

If product 3 has carbonyl groups, then the NMR would show deshielded protons next to carbonyls.

So, in product 3, the most deshielded protons would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. These protons would typically show up downfield, perhaps around 2.1 ppm or higher.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. Let's think about possible structures.

If product 3 has a carbonyl group and adjacent protons, the coupling would depend on the neighboring protons.

For example, if a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl, the protons on the CH2 would couple with each other and possibly with neighboring groups.

Wait, but in the NMR of product 3, what peaks are observed? The question says that the 1H NMR of 3 has a peak for the most deshielded hydrogen, and we need to determine its coupling pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, with two carbonyl groups. The most deshielded proton would be adjacent to a carbonyl, maybe on a CH2 group.

If the CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl, each proton on the CH2 would see each other and possibly neighboring protons. So, for a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each H is split by the two neighboring Hs on the same CH2, leading to a triplet pattern (n+1, where n=2). But wait, that would be a triplet, but perhaps there's more coupling.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, then each proton would couple with the two protons on their own CH2 and the two on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets or a more complex splitting.

Wait, but let's think in terms of the ozonolysis product. Suppose product 2 is a diene, and ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyl groups.

For example, if product 2 is a 1,3-diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, producing a dialdehyde or diketone.

But in this case, perhaps product 2 is a mono-alkene, and ozonolysis breaks it into a single carbonyl group.

Wait, but product 3 is the ozonolysis product, so maybe it's a ketone or aldehyde.

Let me think about the structure of product 2. If product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is a dienone (a ketone with a double bond), then ozonolysis of product 2 would break the double bond into two carbonyls, leading to a diepoxy or something else.

But perhaps product 2 is a conjugated dienone, so ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls.

Wait, another approach: perhaps product 2 is a bridgehead alkene. Ozonolysis would break the bridgehead double bond, but I'm not certain about the product.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a monoene, and ozonolysis would produce a single carbonyl.

But I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should consider the possible structures again.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether (an allyl ether). Ozonolysis of an enol ether would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups, yielding two ketones or aldehydes.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, perhaps as aldehydes.

But aldehydes have protons that are deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm, but the question says to exclude exchangeable protons (like OH or NH), so maybe the most deshielded is a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, but in product 3, after ozonolysis, if product 2 was an enol ether, let's say O-CH2-CH2-O with a double bond between the CH2 groups, then ozonolysis would break the double bond, and each end would form a carbonyl.

So, for example, if product 2 is O-CH2-CH2-O, but with a double bond between the CH2 groups (making it O-CH2-CH2-O but with a double bond, which isn't possible because that would require four bonds on the oxygen. So that's not possible. So perhaps product 2 is an allyl ether, like O-R-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-R, but with a double bond in the middle.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a structure like O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O, but with a double bond between the middle CH2 groups. So, O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O where the double bond is between the two middle CH2 groups. But that's not possible because that would require each CH2 to have a double bond, which would make it a cumulene, which is not stable.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-CH2-O, with the double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it O-CH2-CH2-O but with a double bond between the CH2 groups. But that's a conjugated diene, but then the oxygen would be in the middle.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether with a structure like O-CH2-CH2-O and a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it O-CH2-CH2-O with a double bond. But that's not possible because the double bond would require four bonds on the carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an allyl ether, like O-R-CH2-CH2-CH2-O, but with a double bond between the CH2 groups, making it O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O but with a double bond between the two middle CH2 groups. That would be O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O with a double bond, but that's not a stable structure.

Hmm, maybe it's better to think about product 3's structure. If product 2 is an enol ether, then product 3 would have two carbonyl groups after ozonolysis.

But then, the NMR of product 3 would have protons adjacent to carbonyls. For example, if product 3 is a diketone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyls would be deshielded.

So, each of these CH2 groups next to a carbonyl would have protons that are split by neighboring protons.

If each CH2 is next to a carbonyl and another CH2 group, each proton would see two neighboring protons on the same CH2 and perhaps two on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but if the structure is a CH2-CO group, then each proton on the CH2 would be split by the two others on the same CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

But if adjacent to another CH2 group, perhaps each H would see two on their own CH2 and two on the adjacent, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in a CH2-CO-CH2 structure, each CH2 would have neighboring CH2 groups. So each H on the CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on their own CH2 (giving a triplet) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). So the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that each CH2 is only next to one other CH2, then each H would be a triplet.

But wait, let me think about the coupling. For a CH2 group next to another CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on their own CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So the splitting would be (n+1) for each coupling. So for each H on the CH2, they would couple with two Hs on their own CH2 (giving a triplet) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). The overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But wait, I'm not sure about the structure. Let me try to imagine product 3.

Assuming product 3 is a diketone, with two ketone groups. The structure might be something like O=C-R-R-C=O. If R is a CH2 group, then each CH2 would be adjacent to a carbonyl.

So the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. But wait, that's a four-carbon chain with two ketones at each end. So the central CH2 groups would each have two neighboring Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, where each CH2 is between two carbonyls. So each CH2 group would have protons that are split by their adjacent CH2 group.

So each H on the CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on their own CH2 (triplet) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Therefore, the most deshielded hydrogen (on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl) would have a triplet of triplet coupling pattern.

Looking back at the options:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So the correct answer would be option B: triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to product 3, whose most deshielded hydrogen's coupling pattern is to be determined. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH**  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C produces product 1. The IR spectrum shows a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the formation of a ketone. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H singlet; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H multiplet; 1.94 ppm, 2H triplet) suggests a ketone structure with specific proton environments.

2. **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Al(isopropoxide)**  
   Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, to form product 2. This step likely involves the formation of an enol ether (an allyl ether) from the ketone, introducing a double bond adjacent to oxygen.

3. **Reaction 3: Product 2 + Ozonolysis**  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming product 3. The work-up with dimethylsulfide ensures a reductive cleavage, yielding carbonyl compounds. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. This CH₂ group is coupled with two hydrogens on its own CH₂ (triplet splitting) and two hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group (another triplet splitting). The combined splitting results in a triplet of triplets.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.
