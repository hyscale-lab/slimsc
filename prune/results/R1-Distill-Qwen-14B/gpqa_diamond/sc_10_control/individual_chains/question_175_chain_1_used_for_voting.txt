Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ (measured along the z-axis). The maximum power is A. The question is asking for two things: first, what fraction of A is radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and second, what the form of f is.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a fraction and a dependence on λ.

Hmm. So I remember that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the source. Since this is a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating along the z-axis, I think the radiation would have some angular dependence.

Wait, spheroidal symmetry—so it's symmetric around the z-axis. That probably means the radiation isn't isotropic; it's strongest along the axis of symmetry. Like, for a dipole antenna, the radiation is maximum along the axis perpendicular to the dipole, but wait, no, dipole is along the axis. Hmm.

Wait, dipole radiation is maximum perpendicular to the dipole direction. Oh wait, no. Wait, a dipole's radiation pattern is circular around the axis. The power radiated varies with the angle θ, which is the angle from the dipole's axis. The maximum occurs when θ is 90 degrees, right? So the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to sin²θ. Wait, no, wait, dipole radiation intensity is proportional to sin²θ? Or wait, is it?

Wait, no, the power per unit solid angle (the intensity) for a dipole is given by I = (something) * sin²θ. So the maximum occurs at θ = 90 degrees, and it's zero along the axis (θ=0 and θ=180). But wait, what if the charge distribution is oscillating along the z-axis, which is the symmetry axis of the spheroid.

Wait, a spheroid is like a sphere that's squashed or stretched along one axis. So if it's oscillating along z, then the dipole moment would be along z. So the radiation pattern would have maximum intensity perpendicular to the dipole, i.e., at θ=90 degrees.

So the intensity in the radiation zone depends on θ. For a dipole, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to sin²θ. So the maximum is at θ=90. So if the problem is asking about θ=30 degrees, the intensity would be sin²(30) = (1/2)^2=1/4 of the maximum.

Wait, but wait, in dipole radiation, the intensity is maximum at 90 degrees, right? So at θ=90, sinθ=1, so sin²θ=1. At θ=30, sinθ=0.5, so sin²θ=0.25. So the fraction would be 0.25, so 1/4 of the maximum. So the fraction at θ=30 is 1/4.

But wait, the problem says the maximum power is A. So the maximum occurs at θ where? Oh, for a dipole, maximum at 90. So if the maximum is A, then at θ=30, the power is (1/4) A.

Wait, but wait, wait a minute. The power per unit solid angle is function f(λ,θ). So for a dipole, f is proportional to sin²θ. So the maximum would be when sinθ is maximum, which is 1. So the maximum is when θ=90, and the function f at that point is maximum.

So the power at θ=30 is (1/4) of the maximum A. So that's the fraction.

So the first part of the answer is 1/4. Looking at the options, options B and C have 1/4 as the fraction.

Now, the second part is about the dependence on λ. The function f depends on λ and θ. So what's the dependence of radiated power per unit solid angle on λ?

Wait, in radiation from an oscillating charge distribution, the power radiated depends on the acceleration of the charges. The power is given by the Larmor formula. The Larmor formula is P = ( (e² a² )/(6πε₀ c³) ), where a is the acceleration.

But when considering the far field (radiation zone), the fields become the retarded fields, and the power radiated per unit solid angle is given by the radiation intensity. For a dipole, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (sin²θ) * (something with λ).

Wait, what's the dependence on wavelength? The Larmor formula gives the total power radiated. The total power (which is the integral of the intensity over all solid angles) would be proportional to (frequency)^4 or something like that.

Wait, but wait, the radiation from an oscillating dipole. The dipole moment is oscillating sinusoidally with some angular frequency ω. The radiation intensity for a dipole is proportional to (ω^4) * sin²θ. Because, the acceleration a is proportional to ω², so P is proportional to a², which is ω^4. But wait, the function f is per unit solid angle. So f would be proportional to (ω^4) * sin²θ.

But ω is related to the frequency, which is related to the wavelength λ. Since λ = c / f, and f = ω/(2π), so ω = 2π f = 2π c / λ. So ω^4 is proportional to (1/λ^4). So f is proportional to (1/λ^4) * sin²θ.

So the function f would have a dependence of λ^−4.

Looking back at options B and C. Option B says the function is λ^-3. Option C says λ^-4. So the function is proportional to λ^-4.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to λ^-4. So the correct option is C) 1/4, λ^(-4).

The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, radiating at a wavelength \( \lambda \). The power radiated per unit solid angle is a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), and the maximum power is \( A \). The task is to determine the fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the form of \( f \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern**:  
   The charge distribution oscillates along the z-axis, producing dipole radiation. For a dipole, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \), where \( \theta \) is the angle from the z-axis. The maximum intensity occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), and the intensity decreases as \( \theta \) approaches \( 0^\circ \) or \( 180^\circ \).

2. **Fraction of Maximum Power at \( \theta = 30^\circ \)**:  
   At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin^2\theta = \sin^2(30^\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \).

3. **Dependence of \( f \) on \( \lambda \)**:  
   The power radiated per unit solid angle depends on the oscillation frequency of the charge distribution. Using the Larmor formula, the total power radiated is proportional to \( \omega^4 \), where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency. Since \( \omega \propto 1/\lambda \), the dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \). Therefore, \( f \propto \lambda^{-4} \).

### Conclusion:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \), and the function \( f \) depends on \( \lambda \) as \( \lambda^{-4} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
