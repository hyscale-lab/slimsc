Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh wait, but wait, the problem gives me data from the transit and radial velocity methods, so maybe I can use that to find the planets' orbital distances.

The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff of 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 with 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 with 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which probably means the same reflectivity, so that might cancel out in the temperature ratio.

The RV method gives shifts in the star's spectrum due to the Doppler effect from the planet's gravitational pull. The shifts are given as 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. Wait, but how does that relate to the planet's mass and orbital distance?

I remember the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The velocity amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_s), and the orbital period (P) and semi-major axis (a). The formula I think is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/ (P^(1/3)) )... Wait, maybe it's better to approach it with the simplified formula. 

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_s + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) * (2π / P )^(1/3) )

But since the planets have circular orbits, e is 0, so the denominator simplifies. Also, since M_p is much less than M_s, M_s + M_p ≈ M_s.

So K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / M_s )^(1/3) * (2π / (P * c)) )^(1/3) ) ?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is given by Δv/c, where Δv is the velocity. Oh wait, the problem says the shifts are up to 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. So the Doppler shift is (Δλ/λ) = (v/c), where v is the velocity of the star. So the shift is proportional to the velocity.

The RV semi-amplitude K is the star's velocity. So for each planet, K1 is 0.03 Å / 6300 Å = velocity shift divided by the original wavelength. Wait, wait, no. The shift is given as 0.03 Å in the line at 6300 Å. So the fractional shift is Δλ/λ = 0.03 / 6300. So the velocity is v = c * (Δλ/λ). So K1 = c * (0.03 / 6300). Similarly, K2 is c*(0.04/6300).

Wait, but wait, the speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s, but that's a big number. Let me see. The velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit would be K = (M_p sin i) / (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (2π G )^(1/3) / P^(1/3) ), but perhaps it's easier to relate the velocities of the star and planet. 

Wait, the star and planet orbit their mutual center of mass. The star's velocity (K) is (M_p/(M_s + M_p)) * v, where v is the orbital speed of the planet. For M_p << M_s, K ≈ (M_p / M_s) * v. And the planet's velocity v is sqrt( G M_s / a ), where a is the semi-major axis. So K ≈ (M_p / M_s) * sqrt( G M_s / a ) = (M_p) * sqrt( G / (a M_s) )

Alternatively, using Kepler's third law: a^3 = (G (M_s + M_p) P² ) / (4π²). But since M_p is much smaller than M_s, a^3 ≈ (G M_s P² )/(4 π²).

But maybe a better approach is to relate the RV shift K to the planet's mass and orbital period. Since both planets are around the same star, perhaps their periods are different, but the problem doesn't give that. Hmm, but the problem doesn't give the periods. So I need another approach.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_s + M_p) )^(1/3) * (2 π / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ). But for circular orbits, e=0. And M_p << M_s, so M_s + M_p ≈ M_s.

So K ≈ ( (G M_p)^(1/3) ) * (2 π / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * (1/sqrt(M_s^(2/3))) )

Wait, maybe that's getting complicated. Let me look for another approach. Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the distance a. Specifically, K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But since e=0 and M_p << M_s, K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * M_p / M_s^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But without knowing the periods, I'm stuck. Hmm, maybe the transits can help. Because the transit method gives the planet's radius relative to the star. So the transit depth is (R_p / R_s)^2. But the problem doesn't give the transit depth, though. So perhaps I can't get the period that way either.

Wait, but wait. Both planets are detected via transit and RV methods. So their orbital periods must be such that the transits occur periodically. But the problem doesn't give the period, so maybe I have to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shifts can be used to find the ratio of their semi-major axes. Because the shift in wavelength is proportional to the velocity of the star, which relates to the planet's mass and the distance a.

Wait, let me think. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (M_p / M_s )^(1/3) * ( (G (M_s + M_p) P )/(4 π²) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π)/P ) / (c ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me recall the formula for K.

The formula is: K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_s + M_p) )^(1/3) * ( (2π) / (P) )^(1/3) ) / c )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the ratio of K1 and K2.

K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2) * (sin i1 / sin i2) * ( (P2)/(P1) ) ) ]^(1/3) )

But if the inclination angles are the same (which they are, since both transiting), then sin i is the same for both. So K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1) ) ]^(1/3 )

But without knowing the periods, I can't find this ratio. Hmm. This is getting complicated.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the equilibrium temperature formula. The equilibrium temperature T_eq is given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

Wait, no, the exact formula is a bit different. Let me recall. The equilibrium temperature for a planet is T = T_star * ( R_star / (2 a) )^(1/2) * sqrt( (1 - albedo) )

Wait, more accurately, the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ), but I'm not exactly sure about the exponents. Alternatively, T_eq = T_star * ( (R_star/(2 a)) )^(1/2) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Wait, perhaps the more precise formula is T_eq = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ), where A is the planet's albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, the (1-A) term cancels out in the ratio.

So the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 would be sqrt( (R_* / (2 a1) ) / (R_* / (2 a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So I need to find a1 and a2, the semi-major axes of the two planets.

How can I find a1 and a2? Well, from the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis.

The formula for K is K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_s + M_p) )^(1/3) * ( (2π) / (P * c) )^(1/3) )

But without knowing P (the period), it's tricky. Unless I can relate the velocities to the distance a through other means.

Wait, another approach. From the star's perspective, the planet's orbit has the star moving in a circle with radius a_s = (M_p/(M_s + M_p)) a. Since M_p << M_s, a_s ≈ (M_p / M_s) a.

The velocity of the star is v_s = (2 π a_s ) / P = (2 π (M_p a)/(M_s P) )

But from Kepler's third law, the period P is given by P² = (4 π² a³) / (G (M_s + M_p) ) ≈ (4 π² a³) / (G M_s )

So substituting P into the velocity equation, v_s = (2 π (M_p a) / M_s ) ) / ( ( (4 π² a³)/(G M_s) )^(1/2) ) )

Wait, let me compute that. Let's compute v_s:

v_s = (2 π M_p a) / ( M_s * ( (4 π² a³/(G M_s)) )^(1/2) ) )

Simplify the denominator inside the square root: (4π² a³/(G M_s))^(1/2) )= (2 π a^(3/2) )/( sqrt( G M_s ) )

So denominator becomes M_s * ( 2 π a^(3/2) )/( sqrt( G M_s )) )

So v_s = (2 π M_p a ) / ( M_s * (2 π a^(3/2) )/( sqrt(G M_s) )) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (2 π M_p a ) * sqrt(G M_s) ) / ( M_s * 2 π a^(3/2) ) )

The 2 pi cancels. So:

= ( M_p a * sqrt(G M_s) ) / ( M_s * a^(3/2) ) )

= M_p sqrt(G M_s) / ( M_s * sqrt(a) )

= M_p sqrt( G / (M_s a) )

So v_s = K (the RV semi-amplitude) is equal to M_p sqrt( G / ( M_s a ) )

So K = M_p * sqrt( G / (M_s a) )

Solving for a, a = (G M_p )/( M_s K² )

Wait, let's square both sides:

K² = (G M_p )/(M_s a )

=> a = (G M_p )/( M_s K² )

So a is proportional to M_p / K².

So for each planet, a1 and a2 can be written as:

a1 = (G M_p1 )/( M_s K1² )

a2 = (G M_p2 )/( M_s K2² )

Taking the ratio a2/a1:

a2/a1 = ( M_p2 K1² ) / ( M_p1 K2² )

So the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 is sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt( ( M_p2 K1² ) / ( M_p1 K2² ) )

= sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1² / K2²) )

= sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1) ) * ( K1 / K2 )

Because sqrt( (K1²/K2²) ) is K1/K2.

Wait, that's a key relation. So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1) ) * ( K1/K2 )

Wait, no, wait. Wait, a2/a1 = (M_p2 K1²) / (M_p1 K2² )

So sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt( (M_p2 K1²) / (M_p1 K2² ) ) ) = (sqrt(M_p2/M_p1)) * (K1/K2 )

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(M_p2/M_p1) * ( K1 / K2 )

Because the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is sqrt( a2/a1 )

Wait, but earlier I thought the ratio was sqrt(a2/a1), but let me double-check. Because T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R_* / a ), and R_* is same for both planets. So the ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So yes, T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So substituting a2/a1 from above:

a2/a1 = (M_p2 K1²) / (M_p1 K2² )

So T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt( ( M_p2 K1² ) / ( M_p1 K2² ) ) )

= sqrt(M_p2 / M_p1 ) * ( K1 / K2 )

So let's plug in the numbers.

Given:

M_p1 =7 Earth masses

M_p2=5 Earth masses

K1=0.03 Å

K2=0.04 Å

But wait, the actual velocities are calculated from the Doppler shifts. The shift is (Δλ/λ) = (v/c). So v = c * (Δλ/λ)

But for the ratio, the c would cancel out, so K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c, and K2 = (0.04 /6300)*c. So in the ratio, c cancels.

So K1/K2 = (0.03) / (0.04) = 3/4 = 0.75.

But wait, no: K1 is 0.03 Å shift, which is 0.03 / 6300 in terms of fractional wavelength change, and similarly for K2.

So K1 = c * (0.03 / 6300) 

Similarly, K2 = c * (0.04 /6300 )

Therefore, K1/K2 = (0.03)/(0.04) = 3/4 = 0.75.

Now, let's compute sqrt(M_p2 / M_p1) = sqrt(5/7) ≈ sqrt(0.714) ≈ 0.845.

So T_eq1/T_eq2 ratio is 0.845 * 0.75 ≈ 0.63375.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have mixed up the formula. Let's double-check. The ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 ), which is sqrt( (M_p2 K1²) / (M_p1 K2²) )

Which is sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1² / K2²) )

Which is sqrt( (5/7) ) * ( K1/K2 )

Which is sqrt(5/7) * (3/4) ≈ 0.845 * 0.75 ≈ 0.63375.

So the ratio is about 0.633.

Wait, but wait, the question is asking for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which is T1/T2.

As per the calculation, T1/T2 ≈ 0.634. So T1 is about 0.634 * T2.

Looking at the options: option C is ~0.53, which is lower than our calculation. Option A is ~0.98, which is close to 1. Option D is ~1.05.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Because when I derived it, T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R_* / (2a)).

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_*/(2 a1)) / (R_*/(2 a2)) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So the formula is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the RV semi-amplitude formula again.

Another approach. RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_s + M_p) ]^(1/3) * [ 2π / (P * c) ]^(1/3) ) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

But with e=0, it's:

K = [ (G M_p sin i )/( M_s ) ]^(1/3) * [ 2π/(P c) ]^(1/3 )

But Kepler's third law: P² = (4 π² a³) / ( G M_s )

So P = (4 π² a³ / ( G M_s ))^(1/2 )

Substituting P into K:

K = [ (G M_p )/( M_s ) ]^(1/3) * [ 2π / ( ( (4 π² a³/(G M_s)) )^(1/2 ) c ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute the exponent step by step.

Inside the second bracket: [ 2π / ( (4 π² a³/(G M_s ))^(1/2) c ) ]

= [ 2 π ] / [ (sqrt(4 π² a³/(G M_s )) ) * c ]

= [ 2 π ] / [ 2 π a^(3/2) / sqrt( G M_s ) * c ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ 2 π ] * [ sqrt( G M_s ) ] / ( 2 π a^(3/2) c )

The 2 pi cancels, so:

= sqrt( G M_s ) / ( a^(3/2) c )

So now, the entire K expression becomes:

K = [ (G M_p / M_s ) ]^(1/3) * [ sqrt( G M_s ) / ( a^(3/2) c ) ]^(1/3 )

Combine the exponents:

= ( G M_p / M_s )^(1/3) * ( G M_s )^(1/6) ) / ( a^(1/2) c^(1/3) )

Simplify exponents:

G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_s^(-1/3) * G^(1/6) M_s^(1/6) ) / ( a^(1/2) c^(1/3) )

Adding exponents for G: 1/3 +1/6 = 1/2

For M_p: 1/3

For M_s: -1/3 +1/6 = -1/6

So:

= G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_s^(-1/6) / ( a^(1/2) c^(1/3) )

Expressed another way:

= [ G M_p^(2/3) M_s^(-1/3) ) / ( a c ) ]^(1/2) / c^(1/3 ) ?

Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's better to cube both sides.

Wait, perhaps rearranging for a.

We have:

K = [ (G M_p )/( M_s ) ]^(1/3) * [ sqrt( G M_s ) ]^(1/3) / ( a^(1/2) c^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to express a in terms of K.

Let me cube both sides of the K equation:

K^3 = [ (G M_p )/( M_s ) ] * [ sqrt( G M_s ) ] / ( a^(3/2) c )

Because when you cube the right side:

[ (G M_p / M_s )^(1/3) ]^3 = (G M_p / M_s )

[ ( sqrt(G M_s) )^(1/3) ]^3 = (sqrt(G M_s) )

[ (1/(a^(1/2) c^(1/3)) ) ]^3 = 1/(a^(3/2) c )

So K^3 = ( G M_p / M_s ) * sqrt(G M_s ) / ( a^(3/2) c )

Simplify numerator:

G M_p / M_s * sqrt(G M_s ) = G M_p * (G M_s )^(1/2) / M_s

= G^(3/2) M_p M_s^(-1/2)

So K^3 = [ G^(3/2) M_p M_s^(-1/2) ] / ( a^(3/2) c )

Rearranging for a:

a^(3/2) = [ G^(3/2) M_p M_s^(-1/2) ] / ( K^3 c )

Multiply both sides by a^(3/2 ):

a = [ G^(3/2) M_p M_s^(-1/2) / ( K^3 c ) ]^(2/3 )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is:

a^(3/2) = ( G^(3/2) M_p M_s^(-1/2) ) / ( K^3 c )

=> a^(3/2) = [ G^(3/2) M_p M_s^(-1/2) ] / ( K^3 c )

Raise both sides to (2/3):

a = [ ( G^(3/2) M_p M_s^(-1/2) ) / ( K^3 c ) ]^(2/3 )

= G^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) ) * M_p^(2/3) * M_s^(- (1/2)*(2/3) ) ) / ( K^( 3*(2/3) ) c^(2/3) )

Simplify exponents:

G^1 * M_p^(2/3) * M_s^(-1/3) ) / ( K^2 c^(2/3) )

So,

a = ( G M_p^(2/3) M_s^(-1/3) ) / ( K^2 c^(2/3) )

But I'm not sure if this helps. Alternatively, since we need the ratio a2/a1:

a2/a1 = [ (G M_p2^(2/3) M_s^(-1/3) ) / ( K2^2 c^(2/3) ) ] / [ (G M_p1^(2/3) M_s^(-1/3) ) / ( K1^2 c^(2/3) ) ) ]

Simplify:

a2/a1 = ( M_p2^(2/3) / M_p1^(2/3) ) * ( K1^2 / K2^2 )

= ( (M_p2 / M_p1 )^(2/3) ) * ( (K1 / K2 )^2 )

So,

a2/a1 = [ (5/7)^(2/3) ] * [ (3/4) ]^2

Compute each part:

(5/7)^(2/3) ≈ (0.714)^(0.6667) ≈ e^( ln(0.714) * 0.6667 )

ln(0.714)= approx -0.3365

Multiply by 0.6667: ~-0.224

e^(-0.224) ≈ 0.800

(3/4)^2 = 9/16 = 0.5625

So a2/a1 ≈ 0.8 * 0.5625 ≈ 0.45

Then T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1) ≈ sqrt(0.45) ≈ 0.67

Hmm, but earlier I thought it was 0.634. Which is a bit of a discrepancy. Maybe my approximations are off.

Wait, perhaps a more accurate calculation is needed.

Compute (5/7)^(2/3):

5/7 ≈ 0.714286

Take ln(0.714286) ≈ -0.33647

Multiply by 2/3: -0.33647 * 0.6667 ≈ -0.2243

Exponentiate: e^(-0.2243) ≈ 0.798 ≈ 0.8.

(3/4)^2 = 0.5625

So a2/a1 = 0.8 * 0.5625 = 0.45.

sqrt(0.45) ≈ 0.6708.

So the ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 ≈ 0.67.

But the options don't have this. Hmm. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) ~ 0.98

B) ~ 1.30

C) ~ 0.53

D) ~ 1.05

Wait, 0.67 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the Doppler shifts are in the same forbidden line, so the same wavelength. So the actual velocities are v = c * delta_lambda / lambda.

So K1 = c * (0.03 / 6300 )

K2 = c * (0.04 / 6300 )

So K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4.

So that part was correct.

Wait, but in the formula for T_eq ratio, I have T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which is sqrt( ( a2 ) / ( a1 ) )

And a2/a1 = ( M_p2 K1^2 / ( M_p1 K2^2 ) )

So:

a2/a1 = (5 * (3/4)^2 ) / (7 * (1)^2 ) ) = 5 * 9/16 /7 = (45/16) /7 = 45/(112) ≈ 0.4018

So sqrt(0.4018) ≈ 0.634.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.634.

Hmm, but this isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for T_eq.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature is given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

So the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) ) * ( (1-A)/(1-A) )^(1/4 )

So the ratio simplifies to sqrt( a2/a1 )

Which brings me back to the same ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate a1 and a2 separately.

Compute a1:

a1 = (G M_p1 )/( M_s K1^2 )

Similarly, a2 = (G M_p2 )/( M_s K2^2 )

But since G, M_s are the same for both, a2/a1 = ( M_p2 K1^2 ) / ( M_p1 K2^2 )

So M_p2 =5, M_p1=7.

K1 = 0.03, K2=0.04

So,

a2/a1 = (5 * (0.03)^2 ) / (7 * (0.04)^2 )

Calculate the numerator: 5 * 0.0009 = 0.0045

Denominator: 7 * 0.0016 = 0.0112

So a2/a1 = 0.0045 / 0.0112 ≈ 0.4018.

So sqrt(a2/a1) ≈ sqrt(0.4018) ≈ 0.634.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.634.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~0.53, but that's lower than 0.63. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for a.

Wait, earlier when I derived a = (G M_p )/( M_s K^2 )

Wait, let me recheck that.

From K = M_p sqrt( G / ( M_s a ) )

So K^2 = (M_p^2 G )/( M_s a )

Rearranged for a: a = ( M_p^2 G )/( M_s K^2 )

Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Because I think I had a different expression.

Wait, initial formula: K = M_p sqrt( G/(M_s a) )

So K^2 = M_p^2 G/( M_s a )

So a = ( M_p^2 G )/( M_s K^2 )

So a is proportional to M_p^2 / K^2.

Earlier, I thought a was proportional to M_p / K^2, but I think that was my mistake.

So the correct ratio is a2/a1 = (M_p2^2 K1^2 )/( M_p1^2 K2^2 )

Because:

a2 = (M_p2^2 G) / ( M_s K2^2 )

a1 = (M_p1^2 G) / ( M_s K1^2 )

So a2/a1 = (M_p2^2 K1^2 )/( M_p1^2 K2^2 )

So then,

a2/a1 = ( (5^2) * (0.03)^2 ) / ( (7^2) * (0.04)^2 )

Compute numerator: 25 * 0.0009 = 0.0225

Denominator: 49 * 0.0016 = 0.0784

So a2/a1 = 0.0225 / 0.0784 ≈ 0.2865.

Then, T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1 ) ≈ sqrt(0.2865) ≈ 0.535.

Ah! Now that's about 0.535, which matches option C (~0.53).

So where did I go wrong earlier? Oh, I think I forgot to square M_p in the a expression. So I used a proportional to M_p / K² instead of M_p² / K². That mistake changed everything.

So the correct ratio is approximately 0.53, which is option C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the planet's mass \(M_p\), the star's mass \(M_s\), and the semi-major axis \(a\) by:

\[
K = M_p \sqrt{\frac{G}{M_s a}}
\]

Rearranging for \(a\), we get:

\[
a = \frac{M_p^2 G}{M_s K^2}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{M_{p2}^2 K_1^2}{M_{p1}^2 K_2^2}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}, \, M_{p2} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\)
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}, \, K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{(5)^2 (0.03)^2}{(7)^2 (0.04)^2}
\]

First, calculate the numerator and denominator:
- Numerator: \(5^2 \cdot 0.03^2 = 25 \cdot 0.0009 = 0.0225\)
- Denominator: \(7^2 \cdot 0.04^2 = 49 \cdot 0.0016 = 0.0784\)

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{0.0225}{0.0784} \approx 0.2865
\]

Now, compute the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.2865} \approx 0.535
\]

This value is closest to option **C (~0.53)**. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately **0.53**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh wait, but wait, the problem gives me data from the transit and radial velocity methods, so maybe I can use that to find the planets' orbital distances.

The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff of 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 with 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 with 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which probably means the same reflectivity, so that might cancel out in the temperature ratio.

The RV method gives shifts in the star's spectrum due to the Doppler effect from the planet's gravitational pull. The shifts are given as 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. Wait, but how does that relate to the planet's mass and orbital distance?

I remember the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The velocity amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_s), and the orbital period (P) and semi-major axis (a). The formula I think is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/ (P^(1/3)) )... Wait, maybe it's better to approach it with the simplified formula. 

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_s + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) * (2π / P )^(1/3) )

But since the planets have circular orbits, e is 0, so the denominator simplifies. Also, since M_p is much less than M_s, M_s + M_p ≈ M_s.

So K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / M_s )^(1/3) * (2π / (P * c)) )^(1/3) ) ?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is given by Δv/c, where Δv is the velocity. Oh wait, the problem says the shifts are up to 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. So the Doppler shift is (Δλ/λ) = (v/c), where v is the velocity of the star. So the shift is proportional to the velocity.

The RV semi-amplitude K is the star's velocity. So for each planet, K1 is 0.03 Å / 6300 Å = velocity shift divided by the original wavelength. Wait, wait, no. The shift is given as 0.03 Å in the line at 6300 Å. So the fractional shift is Δλ/λ = 0.03 / 6300. So the velocity is v = c * (Δλ/λ). So K1 = c * (0.03 / 6300). Similarly, K2 is c*(0.04/6300).

Wait, but wait, the speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s, but that's a big number. Let me see. The velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit would be K = (M_p sin i) / (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (2π G )^(1/3) / P^(1/3) ), but perhaps it's easier to relate the velocities of the star and planet. 

Wait, the star and planet orbit their mutual center of mass. The star's velocity (K) is (M_p/(M_s + M_p)) * v, where v is the orbital speed of the planet. For M_p << M_s, K ≈ (M_p / M_s) * v. And the planet's velocity v is sqrt( G M_s / a ), where a is the semi-major axis. So K ≈ (M_p / M_s) * sqrt( G M_s / a ) = (M_p) * sqrt( G / (a M_s) )

Alternatively, using Kepler's third law: a^3 = (G (M_s + M_p) P² ) / (4π²). But since M_p is much smaller than M_s, a^3 ≈ (G M_s P² )/(4 π²).

But maybe a better approach is to relate the RV shift K to the planet's mass and orbital period. Since both planets are around the same star, perhaps their periods are different, but the problem doesn't give that. Hmm, but the problem doesn't give the periods. So I need another approach.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_s + M_p) )^(1/3) * (2 π / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ). But for circular orbits, e=0. And M_p << M_s, so M_s + M_p ≈ M_s.

So K ≈ ( (G M_p)^(1/3) ) * (2 π / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * (1/sqrt(M_s^(2/3))) )

Wait, maybe that's getting complicated. Let me look for another approach. Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the distance a. Specifically, K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But since e=0 and M_p << M_s, K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * M_p / M_s^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But without knowing the periods, I'm stuck. Hmm, maybe the transits can help. Because the transit method gives the planet's radius relative to the star. So the transit depth is (R_p / R_s)^2. But the problem doesn't give the transit depth, though. So perhaps I can't get the period that way either.

Wait, but wait. Both planets are detected via transit and RV methods. So their orbital periods must be such that the transits occur periodically. But the problem doesn't give the period, so maybe I have to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shifts can be used to find the ratio of their semi-major axes. Because the shift in wavelength is proportional to the velocity of the star, which relates to the planet's mass and the distance a.

Wait, let me think. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (M_p / M_s )^(1/3) * ( (G (M_s + M_p) P )/(4 π²) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π)/P ) / (c ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me recall the formula for K.

The formula is: K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_s + M_p) )^(1/3) * ( (2π) / (P) )^(1/3) ) / c )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the ratio of K1 and K2.

K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2) * (sin i1 / sin i2) * ( (P2)/(P1) ) ) ]^(1/3) )

But if the inclination angles are the same (which they are, since both transiting), then sin i is the same for both. So K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1) ) ]^(1/3 )

But without knowing the periods, I can't find this ratio. Hmm. This is getting complicated.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the equilibrium temperature formula. The equilibrium temperature T_eq is given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

Wait, no, the exact formula is a bit different. Let me recall. The equilibrium temperature for a planet is T = T_star * ( R_star / (2 a) )^(1/2) * sqrt( (1 - albedo) )

Wait, more accurately, the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ), but I'm not exactly sure about the exponents. Alternatively, T_eq = T_star * ( (R_star/(2 a)) )^(1/2) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Wait, perhaps the more precise formula is T_eq = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ), where A is the planet's albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, the (1-A) term cancels out in the ratio.

So the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 would be sqrt( (R_* / (2 a1) ) / (R_* / (2 a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So I need to find a1 and a2, the semi-major axes of the two planets.

How can I find a1 and a2? Well, from the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis.

The formula for K is K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_s + M_p) )^(1/3) * ( (2π) / (P * c) )^(1/3) )

But without knowing P (the period), it's tricky. Unless I can relate the velocities to the distance a through other means.

Wait, another approach. From the star's perspective, the planet's orbit has the star moving in a circle with radius a_s = (M_p/(M_s + M_p)) a. Since M_p << M_s, a_s ≈ (M_p / M_s) a.

The velocity of the star is v_s = (2 π a_s ) / P = (2 π (M_p a)/(M_s P) )

But from Kepler's third law, the period P is given by P² = (4 π² a³) / (G (M_s + M_p) ) ≈ (4 π² a³) / (G M_s )

So substituting P into the velocity equation, v_s = (2 π (M_p a) / M_s ) ) / ( ( (4 π² a³)/(G M_s) )^(1/2) ) )

Wait, let me compute that. Let's compute v_s:

v_s = (2 π M_p a) / ( M_s * ( (4 π² a³/(G M_s)) )^(1/2) ) )

Simplify the denominator inside the square root: (4π² a³/(G M_s))^(1/2) )= (2 π a^(3/2) )/( sqrt( G M_s ) )

So denominator becomes M_s * ( 2 π a^(3/2) )/( sqrt( G M_s )) )

So v_s = (2 π M_p a ) / ( M_s * (2 π a^(3/2) )/( sqrt(G M_s) )) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (2 π M_p a ) * sqrt(G M_s) ) / ( M_s * 2 π a^(3/2) ) )

The 2 pi cancels. So:

= ( M_p a * sqrt(G M_s) ) / ( M_s * a^(3/2) ) )

= M_p sqrt(G M_s) / ( M_s * sqrt(a) )

= M_p sqrt( G / (M_s a) )

So v_s = K (the RV semi-amplitude) is equal to M_p sqrt( G / ( M_s a ) )

So K = M_p * sqrt( G / (M_s a) )

Solving for a, a = (G M_p )/( M_s K² )

Wait, let's square both sides:

K² = (G M_p )/(M_s a )

=> a = (G M_p )/( M_s K² )

So a is proportional to M_p / K².

So for each planet, a1 and a2 can be written as:

a1 = (G M_p1 )/( M_s K1² )

a2 = (G M_p2 )/( M_s K2² )

Taking the ratio a2/a1:

a2/a1 = ( M_p2 K1² ) / ( M_p1 K2² )

So the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 is sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt( ( M_p2 K1² ) / ( M_p1 K2² ) )

= sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1² / K2²) )

= sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1) ) * ( K1 / K2 )

Because sqrt( (K1²/K2²) ) is K1/K2.

Wait, that's a key relation. So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1) ) * ( K1/K2 )

Wait, no, wait. Wait, a2/a1 = (M_p2 K1²) / (M_p1 K2² )

So sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt( (M_p2 K1²) / (M_p1 K2² ) ) ) = (sqrt(M_p2/M_p1)) * (K1/K2 )

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(M_p2/M_p1) * ( K1 / K2 )

Because the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is sqrt( a2/a1 )

Wait, but earlier I thought the ratio was sqrt(a2/a1), but let me double-check. Because T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R_* / a ), and R_* is same for both planets. So the ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So yes, T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So substituting a2/a1 from above:

a2/a1 = (M_p2 K1²) / (M_p1 K2² )

So T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt( ( M_p2 K1² ) / ( M_p1 K2² ) ) )

= sqrt(M_p2 / M_p1 ) * ( K1 / K2 )

So let's plug in the numbers.

Given:

M_p1 =7 Earth masses

M_p2=5 Earth masses

K1=0.03 Å

K2=0.04 Å

But wait, the actual velocities are calculated from the Doppler shifts. The shift is (Δλ/λ) = (v/c). So v = c * (Δλ/λ)

But for the ratio, the c would cancel out, so K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c, and K2 = (0.04 /6300)*c. So in the ratio, c cancels.

So K1/K2 = (0.03) / (0.04) = 3/4 = 0.75.

But wait, no: K1 is 0.03 Å shift, which is 0.03 / 6300 in terms of fractional wavelength change, and similarly for K2.

So K1 = c * (0.03 / 6300) 

Similarly, K2 = c * (0.04 /6300 )

Therefore, K1/K2 = (0.03)/(0.04) = 3/4 = 0.75.

Now, let's compute sqrt(M_p2 / M_p1) = sqrt(5/7) ≈ sqrt(0.714) ≈ 0.845.

So T_eq1/T_eq2 ratio is 0.845 * 0.75 ≈ 0.63375.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have mixed up the formula. Let's double-check. The ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 ), which is sqrt( (M_p2 K1²) / (M_p1 K2²) )

Which is sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1² / K2²) )

Which is sqrt( (5/7) ) * ( K1/K2 )

Which is sqrt(5/7) * (3/4) ≈ 0.845 * 0.75 ≈ 0.63375.

So the ratio is about 0.633.

Wait, but wait, the question is asking for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which is T1/T2.

As per the calculation, T1/T2 ≈ 0.634. So T1 is about 0.634 * T2.

Looking at the options: option C is ~0.53, which is lower than our calculation. Option A is ~0.98, which is close to 1. Option D is ~1.05.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Because when I derived it, T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R_* / (2a)).

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_*/(2 a1)) / (R_*/(2 a2)) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So the formula is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the RV semi-amplitude formula again.

Another approach. RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_s + M_p) ]^(1/3) * [ 2π / (P * c) ]^(1/3) ) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

But with e=0, it's:

K = [ (G M_p sin i )/( M_s ) ]^(1/3) * [ 2π/(P c) ]^(1/3 )

But Kepler's third law: P² = (4 π² a³) / ( G M_s )

So P = (4 π² a³ / ( G M_s ))^(1/2 )

Substituting P into K:

K = [ (G M_p )/( M_s ) ]^(1/3) * [ 2π / ( ( (4 π² a³/(G M_s)) )^(1/2 ) c ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute the exponent step by step.

Inside the second bracket: [ 2π / ( (4 π² a³/(G M_s ))^(1/2) c ) ]

= [ 2 π ] / [ (sqrt(4 π² a³/(G M_s )) ) * c ]

= [ 2 π ] / [ 2 π a^(3/2) / sqrt( G M_s ) * c ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ 2 π ] * [ sqrt( G M_s ) ] / ( 2 π a^(3/2) c )

The 2 pi cancels, so:

= sqrt( G M_s ) / ( a^(3/2) c )

So now, the entire K expression becomes:

K = [ (G M_p / M_s ) ]^(1/3) * [ sqrt( G M_s ) / ( a^(3/2) c ) ]^(1/3 )

Combine the exponents:

= ( G M_p / M_s )^(1/3) * ( G M_s )^(1/6) ) / ( a^(1/2) c^(1/3) )

Simplify exponents:

G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_s^(-1/3) * G^(1/6) M_s^(1/6) ) / ( a^(1/2) c^(1/3) )

Adding exponents for G: 1/3 +1/6 = 1/2

For M_p: 1/3

For M_s: -1/3 +1/6 = -1/6

So:

= G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_s^(-1/6) / ( a^(1/2) c^(1/3) )

Expressed another way:

= [ G M_p^(2/3) M_s^(-1/3) ) / ( a c ) ]^(1/2) / c^(1/3 ) ?

Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's better to cube both sides.

Wait, perhaps rearranging for a.

We have:

K = [ (G M_p )/( M_s ) ]^(1/3) * [ sqrt( G M_s ) ]^(1/3) / ( a^(1/2) c^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to express a in terms of K.

Let me cube both sides of the K equation:

K^3 = [ (G M_p )/( M_s ) ] * [ sqrt( G M_s ) ] / ( a^(3/2) c )

Because when you cube the right side:

[ (G M_p / M_s )^(1/3) ]^3 = (G M_p / M_s )

[ ( sqrt(G M_s) )^(1/3) ]^3 = (sqrt(G M_s) )

[ (1/(a^(1/2) c^(1/3)) ) ]^3 = 1/(a^(3/2) c )

So K^3 = ( G M_p / M_s ) * sqrt(G M_s ) / ( a^(3/2) c )

Simplify numerator:

G M_p / M_s * sqrt(G M_s ) = G M_p * (G M_s )^(1/2) / M_s

= G^(3/2) M_p M_s^(-1/2)

So K^3 = [ G^(3/2) M_p M_s^(-1/2) ] / ( a^(3/2) c )

Rearranging for a:

a^(3/2) = [ G^(3/2) M_p M_s^(-1/2) ] / ( K^3 c )

Multiply both sides by a^(3/2 ):

a = [ G^(3/2) M_p M_s^(-1/2) / ( K^3 c ) ]^(2/3 )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is:

a^(3/2) = ( G^(3/2) M_p M_s^(-1/2) ) / ( K^3 c )

=> a^(3/2) = [ G^(3/2) M_p M_s^(-1/2) ] / ( K^3 c )

Raise both sides to (2/3):

a = [ ( G^(3/2) M_p M_s^(-1/2) ) / ( K^3 c ) ]^(2/3 )

= G^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) ) * M_p^(2/3) * M_s^(- (1/2)*(2/3) ) ) / ( K^( 3*(2/3) ) c^(2/3) )

Simplify exponents:

G^1 * M_p^(2/3) * M_s^(-1/3) ) / ( K^2 c^(2/3) )

So,

a = ( G M_p^(2/3) M_s^(-1/3) ) / ( K^2 c^(2/3) )

But I'm not sure if this helps. Alternatively, since we need the ratio a2/a1:

a2/a1 = [ (G M_p2^(2/3) M_s^(-1/3) ) / ( K2^2 c^(2/3) ) ] / [ (G M_p1^(2/3) M_s^(-1/3) ) / ( K1^2 c^(2/3) ) ) ]

Simplify:

a2/a1 = ( M_p2^(2/3) / M_p1^(2/3) ) * ( K1^2 / K2^2 )

= ( (M_p2 / M_p1 )^(2/3) ) * ( (K1 / K2 )^2 )

So,

a2/a1 = [ (5/7)^(2/3) ] * [ (3/4) ]^2

Compute each part:

(5/7)^(2/3) ≈ (0.714)^(0.6667) ≈ e^( ln(0.714) * 0.6667 )

ln(0.714)= approx -0.3365

Multiply by 0.6667: ~-0.224

e^(-0.224) ≈ 0.800

(3/4)^2 = 9/16 = 0.5625

So a2/a1 ≈ 0.8 * 0.5625 ≈ 0.45

Then T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1) ≈ sqrt(0.45) ≈ 0.67

Hmm, but earlier I thought it was 0.634. Which is a bit of a discrepancy. Maybe my approximations are off.

Wait, perhaps a more accurate calculation is needed.

Compute (5/7)^(2/3):

5/7 ≈ 0.714286

Take ln(0.714286) ≈ -0.33647

Multiply by 2/3: -0.33647 * 0.6667 ≈ -0.2243

Exponentiate: e^(-0.2243) ≈ 0.798 ≈ 0.8.

(3/4)^2 = 0.5625

So a2/a1 = 0.8 * 0.5625 = 0.45.

sqrt(0.45) ≈ 0.6708.

So the ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 ≈ 0.67.

But the options don't have this. Hmm. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) ~ 0.98

B) ~ 1.30

C) ~ 0.53

D) ~ 1.05

Wait, 0.67 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the Doppler shifts are in the same forbidden line, so the same wavelength. So the actual velocities are v = c * delta_lambda / lambda.

So K1 = c * (0.03 / 6300 )

K2 = c * (0.04 / 6300 )

So K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4.

So that part was correct.

Wait, but in the formula for T_eq ratio, I have T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which is sqrt( ( a2 ) / ( a1 ) )

And a2/a1 = ( M_p2 K1^2 / ( M_p1 K2^2 ) )

So:

a2/a1 = (5 * (3/4)^2 ) / (7 * (1)^2 ) ) = 5 * 9/16 /7 = (45/16) /7 = 45/(112) ≈ 0.4018

So sqrt(0.4018) ≈ 0.634.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.634.

Hmm, but this isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for T_eq.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature is given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

So the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) ) * ( (1-A)/(1-A) )^(1/4 )

So the ratio simplifies to sqrt( a2/a1 )

Which brings me back to the same ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate a1 and a2 separately.

Compute a1:

a1 = (G M_p1 )/( M_s K1^2 )

Similarly, a2 = (G M_p2 )/( M_s K2^2 )

But since G, M_s are the same for both, a2/a1 = ( M_p2 K1^2 ) / ( M_p1 K2^2 )

So M_p2 =5, M_p1=7.

K1 = 0.03, K2=0.04

So,

a2/a1 = (5 * (0.03)^2 ) / (7 * (0.04)^2 )

Calculate the numerator: 5 * 0.0009 = 0.0045

Denominator: 7 * 0.0016 = 0.0112

So a2/a1 = 0.0045 / 0.0112 ≈ 0.4018.

So sqrt(a2/a1) ≈ sqrt(0.4018) ≈ 0.634.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.634.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~0.53, but that's lower than 0.63. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for a.

Wait, earlier when I derived a = (G M_p )/( M_s K^2 )

Wait, let me recheck that.

From K = M_p sqrt( G / ( M_s a ) )

So K^2 = (M_p^2 G )/( M_s a )

Rearranged for a: a = ( M_p^2 G )/( M_s K^2 )

Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Because I think I had a different expression.

Wait, initial formula: K = M_p sqrt( G/(M_s a) )

So K^2 = M_p^2 G/( M_s a )

So a = ( M_p^2 G )/( M_s K^2 )

So a is proportional to M_p^2 / K^2.

Earlier, I thought a was proportional to M_p / K^2, but I think that was my mistake.

So the correct ratio is a2/a1 = (M_p2^2 K1^2 )/( M_p1^2 K2^2 )

Because:

a2 = (M_p2^2 G) / ( M_s K2^2 )

a1 = (M_p1^2 G) / ( M_s K1^2 )

So a2/a1 = (M_p2^2 K1^2 )/( M_p1^2 K2^2 )

So then,

a2/a1 = ( (5^2) * (0.03)^2 ) / ( (7^2) * (0.04)^2 )

Compute numerator: 25 * 0.0009 = 0.0225

Denominator: 49 * 0.0016 = 0.0784

So a2/a1 = 0.0225 / 0.0784 ≈ 0.2865.

Then, T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1 ) ≈ sqrt(0.2865) ≈ 0.535.

Ah! Now that's about 0.535, which matches option C (~0.53).

So where did I go wrong earlier? Oh, I think I forgot to square M_p in the a expression. So I used a proportional to M_p / K² instead of M_p² / K². That mistake changed everything.

So the correct ratio is approximately 0.53, which is option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the planet's mass \(M_p\), the star's mass \(M_s\), and the semi-major axis \(a\) by:

\[
K = M_p \sqrt{\frac{G}{M_s a}}
\]

Rearranging for \(a\), we get:

\[
a = \frac{M_p^2 G}{M_s K^2}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{M_{p2}^2 K_1^2}{M_{p1}^2 K_2^2}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}, \, M_{p2} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\)
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}, \, K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{(5)^2 (0.03)^2}{(7)^2 (0.04)^2}
\]

First, calculate the numerator and denominator:
- Numerator: \(5^2 \cdot 0.03^2 = 25 \cdot 0.0009 = 0.0225\)
- Denominator: \(7^2 \cdot 0.04^2 = 49 \cdot 0.0016 = 0.0784\)

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{0.0225}{0.0784} \approx 0.2865
\]

Now, compute the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.2865} \approx 0.535
\]

This value is closest to option **C (~0.53)**. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately **0.53**.
