Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully and understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z for a given quantum state. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So that's the state vector |ψ⟩.

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the operators P_x, P_y, P_z are expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. Which makes sense because in that basis, P_z is diagonal, and the other operators may not be.

So first, I need to find the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩, which is ψ† P_z ψ. Then find ⟨P_z²⟩, which is ψ† P_z² ψ. Then compute the variance, and take the square root.

Let me write down the matrix P_z first. From the problem statement: P_z matrix has first row (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0, 0, 0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So in matrix form:

P_z = [[ħ, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0,-ħ]]

Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, P_z is diagonal, so computing expectation values should be straightforward.

The state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Wait, but let me confirm the order. The first entry is for the first basis vector, which corresponds to eigenvalue ħ, the second is the middle (eigenvalue 0), and the third is -ħ. So ψ is a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]

Wait, but is it a column vector? Yes, the problem says it's a column vector.

So for ⟨P_z⟩, I compute ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this is simply summing the diagonal elements multiplied by the corresponding |amplitudes| squared.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The expectation value is the sum over i of ψ_i* P_z_ii ψ_i.

So ψ is [a, b, c] = [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]. So each component is ψ_1 = -1/2, ψ_2 = 1/√2, ψ_3 = -1/2.

P_z has diagonal entries: [ħ, 0, -ħ].

So ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ_1* * ħ * ψ_1 + ψ_2* * 0 * ψ_2 + ψ_3* * (-ħ) * ψ_3.

Which simplifies to ħ |ψ_1|² + 0 + (-ħ) |ψ_3|².

Because ψ_2 is multiplied by 0 anyway, it doesn't contribute.

So let's compute |ψ_1|²: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Similarly, |ψ_3|²: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = ħ*(1/4) + 0 + (-ħ)*(1/4) = (ħ/4 - ħ/4 )= 0.

Hmm, interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z squared is the same as (P_z)^2, which is a diagonal matrix with entries (ħ², 0, (−ħ)^2) → (ħ², 0, ħ²).

So the same calculation applies: sum over ψ_i^* (P_z²)_ii ψ_i.

So (P_z²)_11 = ħ², _22=0, _33=ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = ħ² |ψ_1|^2 + 0 + ħ² |ψ_3|^2.

Again, |ψ_1|^2 = 1/4, |ψ_3|^2 = 1/4.

So this is ħ² (1/4 + 1/4 ) = ħ² (1/2).

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (ħ²) * (1/2) = ħ²/2.

Now, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩². Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, the variance is just ⟨P_z²⟩, which is ħ²/2.

So the uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking back at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches.

Wait, but wait—did I compute everything correctly? Let me double-check.

Compute ψ: [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]

Check normalization: sum of squares of absolute values.

|ψ_1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|ψ_2|^2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

|ψ_3|^2 = 1/4.

Total: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1, so it's normalized. Good.

So the calculation seems correct. ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2, so uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with matrix elements:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix}
\hbar & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\hbar
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix}
-1/2 \\
1/\sqrt{2} \\
-1/2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \sum_{i} \psi_i^* P_z^{ii} \psi_i.
\]

Substituting the values:
- $P_z^{11} = \hbar$, $|\psi_1|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$,
- $P_z^{22} = 0$, $|\psi_2|^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$,
- $P_z^{33} = -\hbar$, $|\psi_3|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$.

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \hbar \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + (-\hbar) \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with matrix elements:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix}
\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \hbar^2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \sum_{i} \psi_i^* (P_z^2)^{ii} \psi_i.
\]

Substituting the values:
- $(P_z^2)^{11} = \hbar^2$, $|\psi_1|^2 = 1/4$,
- $(P_z^2)^{22} = 0$, $|\psi_2|^2 = 1/2$,
- $(P_z^2)^{33} = \hbar^2$, $|\psi_3|^2 = 1/4$.

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \hbar^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \hbar^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar / \sqrt{2}$.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully and understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z for a given quantum state. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So that's the state vector |ψ⟩.

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the operators P_x, P_y, P_z are expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. Which makes sense because in that basis, P_z is diagonal, and the other operators may not be.

So first, I need to find the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩, which is ψ† P_z ψ. Then find ⟨P_z²⟩, which is ψ† P_z² ψ. Then compute the variance, and take the square root.

Let me write down the matrix P_z first. From the problem statement: P_z matrix has first row (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0, 0, 0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So in matrix form:

P_z = [[ħ, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0,-ħ]]

Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, P_z is diagonal, so computing expectation values should be straightforward.

The state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Wait, but let me confirm the order. The first entry is for the first basis vector, which corresponds to eigenvalue ħ, the second is the middle (eigenvalue 0), and the third is -ħ. So ψ is a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]

Wait, but is it a column vector? Yes, the problem says it's a column vector.

So for ⟨P_z⟩, I compute ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this is simply summing the diagonal elements multiplied by the corresponding |amplitudes| squared.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The expectation value is the sum over i of ψ_i* P_z_ii ψ_i.

So ψ is [a, b, c] = [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]. So each component is ψ_1 = -1/2, ψ_2 = 1/√2, ψ_3 = -1/2.

P_z has diagonal entries: [ħ, 0, -ħ].

So ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ_1* * ħ * ψ_1 + ψ_2* * 0 * ψ_2 + ψ_3* * (-ħ) * ψ_3.

Which simplifies to ħ |ψ_1|² + 0 + (-ħ) |ψ_3|².

Because ψ_2 is multiplied by 0 anyway, it doesn't contribute.

So let's compute |ψ_1|²: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Similarly, |ψ_3|²: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = ħ*(1/4) + 0 + (-ħ)*(1/4) = (ħ/4 - ħ/4 )= 0.

Hmm, interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z squared is the same as (P_z)^2, which is a diagonal matrix with entries (ħ², 0, (−ħ)^2) → (ħ², 0, ħ²).

So the same calculation applies: sum over ψ_i^* (P_z²)_ii ψ_i.

So (P_z²)_11 = ħ², _22=0, _33=ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = ħ² |ψ_1|^2 + 0 + ħ² |ψ_3|^2.

Again, |ψ_1|^2 = 1/4, |ψ_3|^2 = 1/4.

So this is ħ² (1/4 + 1/4 ) = ħ² (1/2).

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (ħ²) * (1/2) = ħ²/2.

Now, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩². Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, the variance is just ⟨P_z²⟩, which is ħ²/2.

So the uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking back at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches.

Wait, but wait—did I compute everything correctly? Let me double-check.

Compute ψ: [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]

Check normalization: sum of squares of absolute values.

|ψ_1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|ψ_2|^2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

|ψ_3|^2 = 1/4.

Total: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1, so it's normalized. Good.

So the calculation seems correct. ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2, so uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with matrix elements:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix}
\hbar & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\hbar
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix}
-1/2 \\
1/\sqrt{2} \\
-1/2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \sum_{i} \psi_i^* P_z^{ii} \psi_i.
\]

Substituting the values:
- $P_z^{11} = \hbar$, $|\psi_1|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$,
- $P_z^{22} = 0$, $|\psi_2|^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$,
- $P_z^{33} = -\hbar$, $|\psi_3|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$.

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \hbar \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + (-\hbar) \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with matrix elements:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix}
\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \hbar^2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \sum_{i} \psi_i^* (P_z^2)^{ii} \psi_i.
\]

Substituting the values:
- $(P_z^2)^{11} = \hbar^2$, $|\psi_1|^2 = 1/4$,
- $(P_z^2)^{22} = 0$, $|\psi_2|^2 = 1/2$,
- $(P_z^2)^{33} = \hbar^2$, $|\psi_3|^2 = 1/4$.

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \hbar^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \hbar^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar / \sqrt{2}$.
