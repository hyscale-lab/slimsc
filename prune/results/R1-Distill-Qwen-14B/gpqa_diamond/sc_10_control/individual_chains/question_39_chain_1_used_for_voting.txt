Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about the wave function of a particle and finding the normalization constant 'a'. 

Alright, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function should be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. Oh right, because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1.

The problem states that each particle can exist between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is non-zero only in that interval. So I need to integrate the square of the magnitude of the wave function from x=1 to x=3.

Let me write down the wave function. It's ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second. Usually, the wave function is a complex number, but here it's given as the real part plus the imaginary part. So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) * 1 + ( -0.5i ) * 1. So it's a complex function with real and imaginary parts. 

To find the normalization, I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3. The absolute square is (ψ* ψ), where ψ* is the complex conjugate.

So ψ*(x) would be (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. So when I multiply ψ and ψ*, I get:

( a^2 / (1 + x) ) + 0.25  + i * [ -0.5 a / (1 + x) + 0.5 a / (1 + x) ].

Wait, wait, maybe I should calculate it more carefully. Let me expand (A + Bi)(A* - Bi), since ψ is A + Bi where A is real and B is real here. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when I take ψ*, it's a/(sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

So, ψ* ψ = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + [ (-0.5i) ] * [0.5i ] + cross terms. Wait, no, wait, (A + B)(A - B) = A² - B² if B is real. But here, B is imaginary. Let me compute it step by step.

ψ* = (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i
ψ = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i
So ψ*ψ = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 - (0.5i)(0.5i) + ... Wait, let me compute each term.

Wait, ψ*ψ is (a / sqrt(1+x)) * (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) + (a / sqrt(1+x)) * (-0.5i) + (0.5i) * (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) + (0.5i)(-0.5i).

So the first term is a²/(1+x). The second and third terms are each ( -0.5i a ) / sqrt(1+x). Adding them together, they combine into (-0.5i a / sqrt(1+x) ) + (0.5i a / sqrt(1+x)) ) which equals zero because they are negatives. The last term is (0.5i)(-0.5i) = -0.25 i². Since i² is -1, this becomes -0.25*(-1) = 0.25.

So the entire ψ*ψ is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral becomes the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx.

And this should equal 1 because the wave function is normalized.

So let's write that as:

Integral_{1 to 3} [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this into two integrals:

a² * Integral (1/(1+x) dx) from 1 to 3 + 0.25*(3-1) = 1.

Wait, the second term is 0.25 multiplied by (3-1) because the integral of 1 dx from 1 to 3 is (3-1)=2. So 0.25 * 2 is 0.5.

So the first integral: integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3.

So ln(1+3) - ln(1+1) = ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculate that. Let me think about the numerical value.

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is very close. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the math. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So integrating the square of the absolute value, which we correctly computed as a²/(1+x) + 0.25. Then the integral from 1 to 3 is a² ln(2) + 0.5. Set that equal to 1, so a² ln(2)=0.5 → a²=0.5/ln2≈0.7213 → a≈0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So the correct answer is B.

To determine the numerical value of \( a \), we start with the wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The normalization condition requires that the total probability of finding the particle is 1, meaning:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 1
\]

The first integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

The second integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 3 - 1 = 2
\]

Substituting these results back, we get:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to \( a \approx 0.849 \) is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about the wave function of a particle and finding the normalization constant 'a'.

The problem states that each particle can exist between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is non-zero only in that interval. So I need to integrate the square of the magnitude of the wave function from x=1 to x=3.

Let me write down the wave function. It's ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second. Usually, the wave function is a complex number, but here it's given as the real part plus the imaginary part. So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) * 1 + ( -0.5i ) * 1. So it's a complex function with real and imaginary parts. 

To find the normalization, I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3. The absolute square is (ψ* ψ), where ψ* is the complex conjugate.

So ψ*(x) would be (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. So when I multiply ψ and ψ*, I get:

( a^2 / (1 + x) ) + 0.25  + i * [ -0.5 a / (1 + x) + 0.5 a / (1 + x) ].

Wait, wait, maybe I should calculate it more carefully. Let me expand (A + Bi)(A* - Bi), since ψ is A + Bi where A is real and B is real here. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when I take ψ*, it's a/(sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

So, ψ* ψ = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + [ (-0.5i) ] * [0.5i ] + cross terms. Wait, no, wait, (A + B)(A - B) = A² - B² if B is real. But here, B is imaginary. Let me compute it step by step.

ψ* = (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i
ψ = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i
So ψ*ψ = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 - (0.5i)(0.5i) + ... Wait, let me compute each term.

Wait, ψ*ψ is (a / sqrt(1+x)) * (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) + (a / sqrt(1+x)) * (-0.5i) + (0.5i) * (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) + (0.5i)(-0.5i).

So the first term is a²/(1+x). The second and third terms are each ( -0.5i a ) / sqrt(1+x). Adding them together, they combine into (-0.5i a / sqrt(1+x) ) + (0.5i a / sqrt(1+x)) ) which equals zero because they are negatives. The last term is (0.5i)(-0.5i) = -0.25 i². Since i² is -1, this becomes -0.25*(-1) = 0.25.

So the entire ψ*ψ is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral becomes the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx.

And this should equal 1 because the wave function is normalized.

So let's write that as:

Integral_{1 to 3} [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this into two integrals:

a² * Integral (1/(1+x) dx) from 1 to 3 + 0.25*(3-1) = 1.

Wait, the second term is 0.25 multiplied by (3-1) because the integral of 1 dx from 1 to 3 is (3-1)=2. So 0.25 * 2 is 0.5.

So the first integral: integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3.

So ln(1+3) - ln(1+1) = ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculate that. Let me think about the numerical value.

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is very close. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the math. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So integrating the square of the absolute value, which we correctly computed as a²/(1+x) + 0.25. Then the integral from 1 to 3 is a² ln(2) + 0.5. Set that equal to 1, so a² ln(2)=0.5 → a²=0.5/ln2≈0.7213 → a≈0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So the correct answer is B.


To determine the numerical value of \( a \), we start with the wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The normalization condition requires that the total probability of finding the particle is 1, meaning:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 1
\]

The first integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

The second integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 3 - 1 = 2
\]

Substituting these results back, we get:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to \( a \approx 0.849 \) is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
