Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. I think that's propene because propene is C3H6, right? Because propane is C3H8, so propene must be the one with a double bond. So, A is propene.

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. I remember that when alkenes react with bromine (Br2), they undergo addition reactions. Since propene is CH2=CH2CH3, the bromine would add across the double bond. So when Br2 adds, it can either add in a dibromide fashion, like CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, but wait, wait. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond. The addition can be either anti or via cyclic bromonium ion, but the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane. So Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane, or perhaps 1,3-dibromopropane? Wait, no, because propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br across the double bond would give CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, no. Let me think. The structure is CH2=CH2CH3. Adding Br2 would add Br on each carbon of the double bond. So it becomes CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Wait, no, that would be 1,2-dibromopropane. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next reaction: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. That sounds like an elimination reaction, probably dehydrohalogenation. But wait, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When you treat a dibromide with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it typically leads to elimination. But with two adjacent bromines, which one leaves first? Wait, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond again. So, when two adjacent Br atoms are present, the base can cause elimination of HBr twice, but wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination. Let me think. 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH. The first step would be the removal of one Br, but since both adjacent carbons have Br, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide. Vicinal dihalides when treated with a base can undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form an alkene. So, for 1,2-dibromopropane, removing two HBr molecules would form propene again. So Compound C is propene, same as A? Or wait, no—because when you eliminate vicinal dihalide, you'd form the same alkene as the starting material. So C is propene again. Or wait, could it form something else? Hmm, wait, maybe I should think about the structure. When you eliminate one Br, you form a double bond, but you have another Br adjacent. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a single elimination, but that would give a bromoalkene. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think again: the structure of B is CH2BrCHBrCH3. Reacting with alcoholic KOH would cause elimination. The base would abstract a β hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond and releasing HBr. But with two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, the elimination could occur from either of them. So, for example, the base could abstract a hydrogen from the first carbon (CH2Br), leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, and losing HBr. But wait, then the structure would be CH2=CHCH2Br? No, wait, because after elimination, the adjacent Br would be on the same carbon as the double bond. Hmm, maybe it's better to draw the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction proceeds via a different pathway. Wait, maybe the base attacks one of the Brs, leading to the formation of a carbene or a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the first elimination forms a bromoalkene, but then another elimination could happen. Let me think about the possible products. Vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) when treated with strong base like alcoholic KOH usually undergo dehydrohalogenation twice, eliminating both halogens and forming an alkene. So for 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating two HBr molecules would bring us back to propene, which is C3H6. So Compound C is propene again. Or wait, perhaps propene is the same as Compound A. But then, moving on.

Then, Compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube to form Compound D. Hmm, red-hot iron... Oh, that's probably a dehydrogenation reaction. Iron is used as a catalyst for dehydrogenation. For alkenes, passing through hot iron might cause dehydrogenation to form an alkyne. Because propene (C3H6) has one double bond. If we remove two hydrogens, maybe forming propyne (C3H4). So D is propyne, which is HC≡CCH3. Alternatively, is it another process? Wait, maybe it's dehydrohalogenation again? No, because C is propene. So, propene to propyne, that would be dehydrogenation. So D is propyne.

Next, Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Hmm, strong acids. Wait, maybe it's a dihydroxylation or some addition. Alternatively, considering that propyne is an alkyne, treatment with strong acids might lead to hydration. For alkynes, treatment with H2SO4 and HgSO4 (which are strong acids) could lead to the oxymercuration reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydration reaction. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) when treated with H2SO4 and HgSO4 (which is a catalyst) in a hydration reaction would form ketones. So, HC≡CCH3 upon hydration would form (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. So E is acetone.

Then, Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms F. So, E is acetone (propan-2-one). Iron and HCl... wait, what reaction? Oh, maybe the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat to reduce ketones to alkanes. So, acetone would be reduced to propane (CH3CH2CH3). So F is propane.

Next, Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid (HNO2) is typically used in reactions with amines, but wait, F is propane. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.

Wait, steps:

A → B: Propene + Br2 → 1,2-dibromopropane.

B → C: 1,2-dibromopropane + alcoholic KOH → Propene (elimination of two HBr molecules).

C → D: Propene + red-hot Fe → Propyne (dehydrogenation).

D → E: Propyne + two strong acids → Acetone.

E → F: Acetone + Fe and HCl → Propane (Clemmensen reduction).

F → G: Propane + nitrous acid → ?

Wait, but propane doesn't react with nitrous acid. Hmm, that's a problem because I thought F is propane. So where did I go wrong? Maybe my identification of D is incorrect.

Wait, let me check. If D is propyne, then E is acetone. Then F would be propane upon reduction. Propane can't react with nitrous acid. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Alternative approach: Let me re-examine the steps.

A: C3H6 is propene.

B: Propene + Br2 → 1,2-dibromopropane (vicinal dihalide).

C: 1,2-dibromopropane + alcoholic KOH → elimination, perhaps to form another compound. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane has two adjacent Br atoms. When treated with alcoholic KOH, it could undergo elimination to form an alkyne. Wait, elimination of HBr twice would form an alkyne.

Wait, for vicinal dihalide, elimination can form alkynes. So when you have Br on adjacent carbons, like CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, no, correction. 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCHBrCH3. So when treated with alcoholic KOH, could it eliminate two HBr and form an alkyne? So, the structure would be HC≡C-CH3. So, that's propyne, which is D. Wait, but earlier step says C is propene, but then D is propyne. So perhaps C is propene, D is propyne.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the reaction of 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH. Vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromopropane) when treated with a strong base can undergo dehydrohalogenation twice, which would eliminate two HBr and form an alkyne.

So, the reaction would be:

CH2BrCH2BrCH3 + 2 KOH → CH≡CCH3 + 2 H2O + 2 KBr.

Wait, no. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCHBrCH3. So, when each Br is on adjacent carbons. Then, eliminating two HBr would form a triple bond.

So, when you take CH2BrCHBrCH3 and eliminate two HBr, you get CH≡CCH3. So D is propyne.

Then, D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) in the presence of H2SO4 and HgSO4 would undergo hydration to form propan-2-ol (isopropyl alcohol)? Or wait, no, wait. Hydration of alkynes with H2SO4 and HgSO4 typically gives ketones. For propyne (HC≡CCH3), hydration would add an O across the triple bond, leading to (CH3)2CO (acetone). So E is acetone.

Then E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl. Fe in HCl is a condition for Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So acetone (propan-2-one) would reduce to propane (CH3CH2CH3), so F is propane.

Now, F is propane. Reacting with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Hmm, but propane doesn't react with nitrous acid. Nitrous acid is used for diazotization of amines, but if F is propane, which is just an alkane, it won't react. So that step must be wrong. So perhaps I made a mistake in the previous steps.

Let me think again. Maybe my identification of E is incorrect. Another possibility is that D is something else. Let me re-examine the step where D is formed.

C → D: Compound C is propene, reacts with red-hot iron to form D. Another possibility is that the iron is causing a different reaction. Red-hot iron in the presence of an alkene can cause dehydrogenation to form an alkyne. So propene → propyne. So D is propyne. So that part was correct.

Then D → E: Propyne + two strong acids. Wait, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O? Or maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydration reaction. Propyne plus H2O in presence of a catalyst would form ketone, so E would be acetone.

So that part is correct.

Then E → F: Acetone + Fe and HCl → Propane. Correct via Clemmensen.

F is propane. Reacting with nitrous acid (HNO2) doesn't make sense, as propane has no functional groups to react. So G would be nothing, which doesn't make sense. So there must be a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying E. Let me think: another possibility. After D is propyne, reacting with two strong acids. Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O, causing some other reaction. Wait, maybe it's a hydrohalogenation? But propyne is an alkyne, so adding HX across the triple bond. If two strong acids are present, maybe H2SO4 and HCl? So, propyne (HC≡CCH3) reacting with HCl and H2SO4 as catalysts would add HCl. But adding HCl to an alkyne would add across the triple bond, giving CH2Cl-C≡C-CH3. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is for the hydration of the alkyne, but to an aldehyde or something else. Wait, wait, for alkynes, hydration can give either ketones or aldehydes, depending on the conditions. If it's a ketone, then E is acetone. But acetone is a ketone, so in that case, the next step would be Clemmensen to propane.

But I'm stuck on the F to G step. Because F is propane and G is the product of F reacting with nitrous acid, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction sequence is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the identification of Compound B.

Wait, when propene (A) reacts with Br2 in CCl4, the product B is 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. Wait, maybe it undergoes substitution instead of elimination? No, because KOH is a strong base, so elimination is favored.

If B is 1,2-dibromopropane, treatment with alcoholic KOH would more likely form an alkyne. So, C is propyne, not propene.

Wait, that changes things. Let me retrace:

A → B: Propene → 1,2-dibromopropane.

B → C: 1,2-dibromopropane → propyne (via elimination of two HBr).

Then, C (propyne) → D: passed through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm, but propyne is an alkyne; processing with iron might cause something else. Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation again? Or perhaps the red-hot iron is for cracking or something else. Wait, perhaps I got that step wrong. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe the red-hot iron is for dehydrogenation. So, propyne is already an alkyne; processing it further might not change it. Hmm, maybe I got that step wrong.

Wait, the step is: Compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube to form D. What's the role of the iron? Red-hot iron is used in the dehydrogenation of alkenes to form alkynes or in hydrogenation. Wait, but C is propyne, which is an alkyne. So, perhaps this step is unnecessary or maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is for something else, like a catalyst for another reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps are different. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps when propene is treated with Br2 in CCl4, it doesn't add across the double bond but undergoes some other reaction. Wait, no, Br2 adds to double bonds in CCl4. So that part is correct.

Another possibility: perhaps Compound C is not propene but another product. Let me think about the elimination from 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane has Br on adjacent carbons. When treated with alcoholic KOH, it can eliminate twice: losing two HBr molecules to form a triple bond. So, the product would be propyne, which is C (since A is propene, B is 1,2-dibromopropane, C is propyne).

Then, C → D: propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Maybe that's a dehydrohalogenation or something else. Wait, propyne is an alkyne; perhaps it's being hydrogenated? No, because that would require H2 and a catalyst like Pd. Alternatively, red-hot iron might cause something else. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in this step.

Alternatively, maybe the red-hot iron is used for the dehydrogenation of an alkene to form an alkyne. But if C is propyne, which is an alkyne, maybe the next step is different. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the steps wrong. Let me try another approach.

Alternative approach: Let's consider each compound and see what each step does.

A is C3H6 → propene.

Bromination in CCl4 → addition of Br2 across double bond → 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, B → C: 1,2-dibromopropane + alcoholic KOH → elimination of HBr → forms an alkyne, propyne.

Then, C → D: propyne → ???.

Wait, maybe D is the same as C, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe in the presence of red-hot iron, propyne is hydrogenated to propene. But I thought that hydrogenation requires H2 and a catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is causing some other reaction.

Wait, perhaps D is propane. But how?

Another angle: let's proceed to the next steps.

D is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Maybe that's a dehydrogenation, so an alkene becomes an alkyne. But if C is propyne, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps after elimination from B, C is 2-bromopropane. Wait, no, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. So, elimination would give either propene or propyne, but I'm confident it's propyne.

Wait, perhaps I should move forward. So D is propyne? Then D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. As I thought, E is acetone.

Then E → F: acetone is reduced to propane.

F is propane. Then F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Propane can't react with HNO2. So, that's a problem. So, perhaps my earlier identification of E is wrong.

Alternative possibility: Maybe D is not propyne but something else. Suppose that, instead of elimination, the reaction of B with alcoholic KOH leads to substitution, forming a bromoalkene. Wait, but in that case, what would happen?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction of 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH. Maybe it undergoes a single elimination, leading to a bromoalkene. For example, losing one HBr to form CH2=CHCH2Br. Then, that would be compound C. Then, when C is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps the alkene is dehydrogenated to form an alkyne. Let me see.

So: B → C: 1,2-dibromopropane → CH2=CHCH2Br (after losing one HBr). Then, C is CH2=CHCH2Br.

Then, C → D: passed through a red-hot iron tube. Maybe the alkene is dehydrogenated to form an alkyne. So, CH2=CHCH2Br → CH≡CCH2Br? Not sure, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the iron could be a catalyst for another reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing decomposition. But not sure.

I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should look at the options and see if any of the statements must be incorrect.

The options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

D) C is a flammable gas.

Hmm.

Let's try to go through each option.

Option D: C is a flammable gas.

C is the product of B reacting with alcoholic KOH. If B is 1,2-dibromopropane and C is propene or propyne, then propene is a gas, but propyne is also a gas (but not sure). Wait, propene is a gas at room temperature. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) is a gas as well. So C could be a flammable gas, which would make D correct. But I'm not certain.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR.

D is the product after treating C with red-hot iron. If C is propyne, then D would be propyne, which upon further reaction... Wait, no, D is the product after passing through iron. Let me think again. If C is propyne, perhaps D is something else, but I can't figure that out. Alternatively, if D is propyne, then its NMR would show a singlet for the terminal CH3 and a singlet for the CH2 group. Wait, but propyne is HC≡CCH3. The structure is a triple bond between C1 and C2, with C3 as CH3. The protons on C3 (CH3) would be a singlet, and maybe the C2 (no protons) wouldn't show up. So the NMR would have a singlet from the CH3 group. But the question says two singlets. So perhaps D has two sets of equivalent protons, each giving a singlet.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane. If D is propane, its NMR would show a singlet for the three equivalent CH2 groups? Wait, no, propane is CH3CH2CH3. The two CH3 groups are equivalent, so they would be a singlet. The middle CH2 has two H, but they are equivalent as well. Wait, no, all nine H are equivalent in propane? No, wait, the two terminal CH3 groups are equivalent, so their H would be a singlet. The middle CH2's H are in a different environment. Wait, but in propane, all H are equivalent? No, because the two end CH3 groups are attached to CH2, which is symmetric. So each H in the CH3 groups is equivalent, so that would be a singlet. The CH2 group in the center is between two CH3 groups, so its H are all equivalent and would show as a quartet, but wait, wait. Wait, in NMR, each set of equivalent protons is a separate signal. In propane, the two CH3 groups are identical, so their H would resonate at the same chemical shift. So, the NMR would show a singlet integrating for six H (each CH3 has three H, two CH3 groups → 6 H). The CH2 has two H, but in a different environment, so another singlet? No, because CH2 in propane is between two identical groups, so its H would be in a unique environment. Wait, no, in propane, all H are in the same environment because of the molecule's symmetry. So the NMR would show a single singlet for all nine H. So if D is propane, the NMR would show one singlet. But the option says two singlets, so D can't be propane. So perhaps D is not propane.

Wait, going back, perhaps D is propyne. Propyne is HC≡CCH3. The structure has a triple bond between C1 and C2. C3 is CH3. The H on C1 is a terminal alkyne proton. The CH3 on C3 is in a different environment. So the NMR would have two sets of protons: the terminal H (a triplet due to coupling with adjacent protons? Or a singlet?) Wait, the terminal H on a triple bond is a vinylic proton. Typically, in HC≡CCH2X, the H on the sp-hybridized carbon would be a singlet because they're attached to the triple bond. In propyne, the structure is HC≡C-CH3. The H on the triple bond (sp hybrid) is a singlet because it's attached to a triple bond and adjacent to the C≡C-CH3. The CH3 group would have a singlet as well because all three H are equivalent. So the 1H NMR would show two singlets: one from the terminal H (maybe around δ 1.8-2.5 ppm) and another from the CH3 (around δ 0.8 ppm). So two singlets. So option C says D gives two singlets, which would be correct if D is propyne. So option C is correct, not incorrect.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride is FeCl3, which is used in the benzidine test for phenols. If H is a phenol, it would give a red-brown precipitate. Alternatively, if H is a dienophile or something else, but more likely, H is an aromatic compound. Alternatively, perhaps H is a ketone or another functional group. Hmm.

Let's think about the steps again. Let me retrace each compound.

A. C3H6 → Propene.
B. Propene + Br2 → 1,2-dibromopropane.
C. 1,2-dibromopropane + alcoholic KOH → Propyne (since elimination of two HBr to form triple bond).
D. Propyne → passed through red-hot iron. Hmm, perhaps this is the dehydrohalogenation or another elimination. Wait, perhaps another possibility: after propyne is formed, it's passed through red-hot iron, perhaps causing further elimination or reaction. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe this step is the same as before, leading D to be propyne.

E. Propyne + two strong acids → acetone.

F. Acetone + Fe and HCl → Propane.

G. Propane + nitrous acid → no reaction? That can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the identification of E. Let's think again. D is propyne. When propyne reacts with two strong acids, perhaps it's a hydration reaction to form a ketone, which is acetone (propan-2-one). So E is acetone.

Then F is the product of E with Fe and HCl. That's the Clemmensen reduction, reducing ketones to alkanes. So F is propane.

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Propane can't react with HNO2, so that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps.

Wait, maybe the reaction after D is different.

Alternative pathway: After D is propyne, perhaps the next step is catalytic hydrogenation to form propene. So D is propene.

Wait, but that would mean C was propyne, D is propene. Then, D (propene) reacts with two strong acids. Hmm, two strong acids—what reaction? Maybe acid-catalyzed hydration of propene to form propan-2-ol. So E would be propan-2-ol.

Then, E (propan-2-ol) with Fe and HCl. Fe in HCl might be a reducing condition, but propan-2-ol is an alcohol. Maybe it's a rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's for amines. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the mixture is H2SO4 and another acid. Let's think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the step after D is not about propene but about propyne. So, D is propyne. Then, E is formed from propyne with two strong acids. Let's think of another reaction. Maybe the propyne is subjected to oxymercuration, but that usually requires Hg(OAc)2 and water. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation. With two strong acids, maybe H2SO4 and HCl, propyne would undergo hydrohalogenation. Propyne (HC≡C-CH3) with HCl would add HCl across the triple bond. So, after adding HCl, the structure would be HCl-C≡C-CH3? No, wait, the addition would be HCl adding to the triple bond, giving CH2Cl-C≡C-CH3? Or perhaps the triple bond would add two HCl molecules, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction that forms a dihalide.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options again.

Option B: H gives yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride test is for phenols, giving a red-brown precipitate. So H would have to be a phenol. But looking at the steps, I don't see any step introducing an aromatic ring or a phenol group. So perhaps H isn't a phenol, making option B incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a ketone. Ferric chloride doesn't react with ketones. So option B would be incorrect.

Another option: perhaps H is a bromide. But ferric chloride wouldn't react with that either.

Wait, let's see the steps. H is the product of G reacting with NaOH. G is the product of F reacting with nitrous acid.

F is propane. It reacts with nitrous acid. But that doesn't make sense. So probably, I made a mistake in earlier steps. Let me try to see if another pathway exists.

Alternative approach: perhaps the initial bromination is not addition but substitution. But propene doesn't undergo substitution with Br2 in CCl4. So that's unlikely.

Alternative idea: Perhaps the reaction after E is not Clemmensen but another reaction. E is acetone. Reacting with Fe and HCl. Wait, another possibility: the presence of Fe in HCl might lead to some other reaction, but Clemmensen is the standard one for ketones.

I'm stuck. Let's think about the options.

Option D: C is a flammable gas.

If C is propene or propyne, which are both gases, then yes. So option D is correct.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is propane. Propane is used as a fuel, not in dye synthesis. So option A would be incorrect. But if F is something else, like toluene, then it might be used in dye synthesis. Hmm.

But according to the steps I thought, F is propane, which is not used for dye synthesis. So option A would be incorrect.

But earlier steps led to F being propane, which is a problem because it can't react with nitrous acid. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe F isn't propane. Let me think again.

E is acetone. Then E → F: acetone + Fe and HCl → F. If that's the Clemmensen reduction, F is propane. So F is propane.

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. No reaction occurs. So G would be same as F. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H. So H would be same as G, which is propane. But NaOH and propane wouldn't react. So that's impossible.

Therefore, my earlier steps must be wrong.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the initial steps are different. Let me think again.

Another possibility: when propene (A) is brominated, perhaps it undergoes allylic bromination. But in the presence of CCl4, Br2 usually adds across the double bond, not allylic bromination. So that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution. But I don't think Br2 in CCl4 causes substitution in alkenes.

Alternative idea: Perhaps the initial compound is cyclopropane? No, because A is C3H6, which is more likely propene.

Hmm. I'm stuck, but perhaps I should look for the mistake in the options.

The question is asking for the incorrect statement about the products.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. If H is a phenol, it would give a red-brown precipitate, not yellow. Alternatively, if H is something else, like a ketone, which would not react. So option B is incorrect.

So the incorrect statement would be option B or D.

Wait, but what is H? Let's think.

If all steps are correct up to F, then:

G is the product of F (propane) and nitrous acid, which is nothing. Then H is the product of G and NaOH, which is also nothing.

But I think I must have made a mistake in the earlier steps, perhaps in the step where E is formed. Maybe E is not acetone but another compound.

Alternative pathway: When propyne (D) is treated with two strong acids, perhaps it undergoes a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps E is propionaldehyde. How?

Hydration of propyne with H2O and HgSO4 would give ketone. But with different conditions, like excess H2SO4 and heat, maybe it leads to the formation of aldehyde. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps D is not propyne. Let's think again.

If Compound C is propene, then D is formed by passing through red-hot iron. So, propene becomes something else. Wait, propene → D.

Wait, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing hydrogenation. Propene (alkene) would react with H2 and iron to form propane. But in our case, the step is just passing through a red-hot iron tube. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or another reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the iron is causing a reaction with the alkyne.

But without knowing the exact reaction, it's hard to proceed.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to look for which option must be incorrect based on the thought process.

From the options:

Option D says C is a flammable gas. If C is propene or propyne, then yes. So D is correct.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is propyne, yes, two singlets. So C is correct.

Option B: H gives yellow with FeCl3. If H is a phenol, it would give a different color. So B is incorrect.

Option A: F is used for dye synthesis. If F is propane, it's incorrect. But if F is something else, like toluene, then A would be correct.

Wait, but according to earlier steps, F is propane, which isn't used for dye synthesis. So option A would be incorrect.

Wait, but let me think about the steps again.

If F is propane, then G is nothing. So I must have made a mistake. So perhaps the correct pathway is different.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the final steps.

G is the product of F and nitrous acid. If F is something like an amine, then G would be a diazonium salt, which upon treatment with NaOH would form a phenol or other product. But F is supposed to be the product after E (which I thought was acetone) is reduced to propane.

Wait, perhaps E is not acetone. Let me rethink the step where D reacts with two strong acids to form E.

If D is propyne, and the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O, then E is acetone. So that part is correct.

Then F is propane.

But F can't react with nitrous acid. So perhaps the sequence is wrong.

Alternative idea: perhaps after E is formed (acetone), the step with Fe and HCl is not Clemmensen but another reaction. Wait, another reaction for ketones under acidic conditions with Fe. I'm not sure.

Wait, what's the product when acetone (propan-2-one) reacts with Fe and HCl? Clemmensen gives propane. Another possibility: maybe it's the Birch reduction, but that requires ammonia and different conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the Stephen reduction, which reduces ketones to aldehydes using HCl and FeCl3. So, acetone → propanal (CH3CH2CHO).

So E → F: acetone → propanal via Stephen reduction.

Then F is propanal.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2). Aldehydes can undergo the Hantzsch reaction, but with HNO2, perhaps it's the formation of a diazonium salt. Wait, but aldehydes don't form diazonium salts. That's for aromatic amines.

Hmm, another confusion.

Alternatively, perhaps F is propanal, which upon treatment with HNO2 would undergo some reaction, maybe forming an enol or something else. Not sure.

Then, G is the product, and H is the product of G with NaOH.

But I'm getting stuck. Perhaps it's better to consider that the incorrect statement is option B.

So, after all this, I think option B is incorrect. Because H would be something that doesn't react with FeCl3 to give yellow color. For example, if H is a ketone or an alkane, it wouldn't give a color with FeCl3.

The reaction sequence begins with Compound A (C₃H₆), identified as propene, which undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) to form Compound B, 1,2-dibromopropane. When B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it undergoes double dehydrohalogenation to form Compound C, which is propyne (HC≡CCH₃). 

Compound C (propyne) is then passed through a red-hot iron tube, likely causing further dehydrogenation or rearrangement, but the exact nature of Compound D remains unclear. Assuming D is propyne, it reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (likely H₂SO₄ and HgSO₄) to form Compound E, which is acetone (CH₃COCH₃). 

Compound E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl under Clemmensen reduction conditions to form Compound F, which is propane (CH₃CH₂CH₃). However, when F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂), no reaction occurs, as propane lacks functional groups to react with nitrous acid. This creates a contradiction in the sequence.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, this is incorrect because propane is not used for dye synthesis. However, if F were an aromatic compound like toluene, this would be correct. Given the sequence, F is likely propane, making this statement incorrect.

- **Option B**: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. Ferric chloride reacts with phenols to give a red-brown precipitate, not yellow. Since the sequence does not introduce a phenol, this statement is incorrect.

- **Option C**: D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra. If D is propyne (HC≡CCH₃), the terminal alkyne proton and the CH₃ group would appear as two singlets in the NMR spectrum, making this statement correct.

- **Option D**: C is a flammable gas. If C is propyne, it is indeed a flammable gas, making this statement correct.

The incorrect statements are **A** and **B**, but since the question asks for the single incorrect statement, **B** is the best choice because H cannot react with ferric chloride to give a yellow color.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. I think that's propene because propene is C3H6, right? Because propane is C3H8, so propene must be the one with a double bond. So, A is propene.

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. I remember that when alkenes react with bromine (Br2), they undergo addition reactions. Since propene is CH2=CH2CH3, the bromine would add across the double bond. So when Br2 adds, it can either add in a dibromide fashion, like CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, but wait, wait. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond. The addition can be either anti or via cyclic bromonium ion, but the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane. So Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane, or perhaps 1,3-dibromopropane? Wait, no, because propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br across the double bond would give CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, no. Let me think. The structure is CH2=CH2CH3. Adding Br2 would add Br on each carbon of the double bond. So it becomes CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Wait, no, that would be 1,2-dibromopropane. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next reaction: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. That sounds like an elimination reaction, probably dehydrohalogenation. But wait, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When you treat a dibromide with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it typically leads to elimination. But with two adjacent bromines, which one leaves first? Wait, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond again. So, when two adjacent Br atoms are present, the base can cause elimination of HBr twice, but wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination. Let me think. 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH. The first step would be the removal of one Br, but since both adjacent carbons have Br, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide. Vicinal dihalides when treated with a base can undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form an alkene. So, for 1,2-dibromopropane, removing two HBr molecules would form propene again. So Compound C is propene, same as A? Or wait, no—because when you eliminate vicinal dihalide, you'd form the same alkene as the starting material. So C is propene again. Or wait, could it form something else? Hmm, wait, maybe I should think about the structure. When you eliminate one Br, you form a double bond, but you have another Br adjacent. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a single elimination, but that would give a bromoalkene. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think again: the structure of B is CH2BrCHBrCH3. Reacting with alcoholic KOH would cause elimination. The base would abstract a β hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond and releasing HBr. But with two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, the elimination could occur from either of them. So, for example, the base could abstract a hydrogen from the first carbon (CH2Br), leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, and losing HBr. But wait, then the structure would be CH2=CHCH2Br? No, wait, because after elimination, the adjacent Br would be on the same carbon as the double bond. Hmm, maybe it's better to draw the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction proceeds via a different pathway. Wait, maybe the base attacks one of the Brs, leading to the formation of a carbene or a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the first elimination forms a bromoalkene, but then another elimination could happen. Let me think about the possible products. Vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) when treated with strong base like alcoholic KOH usually undergo dehydrohalogenation twice, eliminating both halogens and forming an alkene. So for 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating two HBr molecules would bring us back to propene, which is C3H6. So Compound C is propene again. Or wait, perhaps propene is the same as Compound A. But then, moving on.

Then, Compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube to form Compound D. Hmm, red-hot iron... Oh, that's probably a dehydrogenation reaction. Iron is used as a catalyst for dehydrogenation. For alkenes, passing through hot iron might cause dehydrogenation to form an alkyne. Because propene (C3H6) has one double bond. If we remove two hydrogens, maybe forming propyne (C3H4). So D is propyne, which is HC≡CCH3. Alternatively, is it another process? Wait, maybe it's dehydrohalogenation again? No, because C is propene. So, propene to propyne, that would be dehydrogenation. So D is propyne.

Next, Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Hmm, strong acids. Wait, maybe it's a dihydroxylation or some addition. Alternatively, considering that propyne is an alkyne, treatment with strong acids might lead to hydration. For alkynes, treatment with H2SO4 and HgSO4 (which are strong acids) could lead to the oxymercuration reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydration reaction. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) when treated with H2SO4 and HgSO4 (which is a catalyst) in a hydration reaction would form ketones. So, HC≡CCH3 upon hydration would form (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. So E is acetone.

Then, Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms F. So, E is acetone (propan-2-one). Iron and HCl... wait, what reaction? Oh, maybe the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat to reduce ketones to alkanes. So, acetone would be reduced to propane (CH3CH2CH3). So F is propane.

Next, Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid (HNO2) is typically used in reactions with amines, but wait, F is propane. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.

Wait, steps:

A → B: Propene + Br2 → 1,2-dibromopropane.

B → C: 1,2-dibromopropane + alcoholic KOH → Propene (elimination of two HBr molecules).

C → D: Propene + red-hot Fe → Propyne (dehydrogenation).

D → E: Propyne + two strong acids → Acetone.

E → F: Acetone + Fe and HCl → Propane (Clemmensen reduction).

F → G: Propane + nitrous acid → ?

Wait, but propane doesn't react with nitrous acid. Hmm, that's a problem because I thought F is propane. So where did I go wrong? Maybe my identification of D is incorrect.

Wait, let me check. If D is propyne, then E is acetone. Then F would be propane upon reduction. Propane can't react with nitrous acid. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Alternative approach: Let me re-examine the steps.

A: C3H6 is propene.

B: Propene + Br2 → 1,2-dibromopropane (vicinal dihalide).

C: 1,2-dibromopropane + alcoholic KOH → elimination, perhaps to form another compound. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane has two adjacent Br atoms. When treated with alcoholic KOH, it could undergo elimination to form an alkyne. Wait, elimination of HBr twice would form an alkyne.

Wait, for vicinal dihalide, elimination can form alkynes. So when you have Br on adjacent carbons, like CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, no, correction. 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCHBrCH3. So when treated with alcoholic KOH, could it eliminate two HBr and form an alkyne? So, the structure would be HC≡C-CH3. So, that's propyne, which is D. Wait, but earlier step says C is propene, but then D is propyne. So perhaps C is propene, D is propyne.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the reaction of 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH. Vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromopropane) when treated with a strong base can undergo dehydrohalogenation twice, which would eliminate two HBr and form an alkyne.

So, the reaction would be:

CH2BrCH2BrCH3 + 2 KOH → CH≡CCH3 + 2 H2O + 2 KBr.

Wait, no. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCHBrCH3. So, when each Br is on adjacent carbons. Then, eliminating two HBr would form a triple bond.

So, when you take CH2BrCHBrCH3 and eliminate two HBr, you get CH≡CCH3. So D is propyne.

Then, D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) in the presence of H2SO4 and HgSO4 would undergo hydration to form propan-2-ol (isopropyl alcohol)? Or wait, no, wait. Hydration of alkynes with H2SO4 and HgSO4 typically gives ketones. For propyne (HC≡CCH3), hydration would add an O across the triple bond, leading to (CH3)2CO (acetone). So E is acetone.

Then E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl. Fe in HCl is a condition for Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So acetone (propan-2-one) would reduce to propane (CH3CH2CH3), so F is propane.

Now, F is propane. Reacting with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Hmm, but propane doesn't react with nitrous acid. Nitrous acid is used for diazotization of amines, but if F is propane, which is just an alkane, it won't react. So that step must be wrong. So perhaps I made a mistake in the previous steps.

Let me think again. Maybe my identification of E is incorrect. Another possibility is that D is something else. Let me re-examine the step where D is formed.

C → D: Compound C is propene, reacts with red-hot iron to form D. Another possibility is that the iron is causing a different reaction. Red-hot iron in the presence of an alkene can cause dehydrogenation to form an alkyne. So propene → propyne. So D is propyne. So that part was correct.

Then D → E: Propyne + two strong acids. Wait, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O? Or maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydration reaction. Propyne plus H2O in presence of a catalyst would form ketone, so E would be acetone.

So that part is correct.

Then E → F: Acetone + Fe and HCl → Propane. Correct via Clemmensen.

F is propane. Reacting with nitrous acid (HNO2) doesn't make sense, as propane has no functional groups to react. So G would be nothing, which doesn't make sense. So there must be a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying E. Let me think: another possibility. After D is propyne, reacting with two strong acids. Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O, causing some other reaction. Wait, maybe it's a hydrohalogenation? But propyne is an alkyne, so adding HX across the triple bond. If two strong acids are present, maybe H2SO4 and HCl? So, propyne (HC≡CCH3) reacting with HCl and H2SO4 as catalysts would add HCl. But adding HCl to an alkyne would add across the triple bond, giving CH2Cl-C≡C-CH3. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is for the hydration of the alkyne, but to an aldehyde or something else. Wait, wait, for alkynes, hydration can give either ketones or aldehydes, depending on the conditions. If it's a ketone, then E is acetone. But acetone is a ketone, so in that case, the next step would be Clemmensen to propane.

But I'm stuck on the F to G step. Because F is propane and G is the product of F reacting with nitrous acid, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction sequence is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the identification of Compound B.

Wait, when propene (A) reacts with Br2 in CCl4, the product B is 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. Wait, maybe it undergoes substitution instead of elimination? No, because KOH is a strong base, so elimination is favored.

If B is 1,2-dibromopropane, treatment with alcoholic KOH would more likely form an alkyne. So, C is propyne, not propene.

Wait, that changes things. Let me retrace:

A → B: Propene → 1,2-dibromopropane.

B → C: 1,2-dibromopropane → propyne (via elimination of two HBr).

Then, C (propyne) → D: passed through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm, but propyne is an alkyne; processing with iron might cause something else. Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation again? Or perhaps the red-hot iron is for cracking or something else. Wait, perhaps I got that step wrong. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe the red-hot iron is for dehydrogenation. So, propyne is already an alkyne; processing it further might not change it. Hmm, maybe I got that step wrong.

Wait, the step is: Compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube to form D. What's the role of the iron? Red-hot iron is used in the dehydrogenation of alkenes to form alkynes or in hydrogenation. Wait, but C is propyne, which is an alkyne. So, perhaps this step is unnecessary or maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is for something else, like a catalyst for another reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps are different. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps when propene is treated with Br2 in CCl4, it doesn't add across the double bond but undergoes some other reaction. Wait, no, Br2 adds to double bonds in CCl4. So that part is correct.

Another possibility: perhaps Compound C is not propene but another product. Let me think about the elimination from 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane has Br on adjacent carbons. When treated with alcoholic KOH, it can eliminate twice: losing two HBr molecules to form a triple bond. So, the product would be propyne, which is C (since A is propene, B is 1,2-dibromopropane, C is propyne).

Then, C → D: propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Maybe that's a dehydrohalogenation or something else. Wait, propyne is an alkyne; perhaps it's being hydrogenated? No, because that would require H2 and a catalyst like Pd. Alternatively, red-hot iron might cause something else. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in this step.

Alternatively, maybe the red-hot iron is used for the dehydrogenation of an alkene to form an alkyne. But if C is propyne, which is an alkyne, maybe the next step is different. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the steps wrong. Let me try another approach.

Alternative approach: Let's consider each compound and see what each step does.

A is C3H6 → propene.

Bromination in CCl4 → addition of Br2 across double bond → 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, B → C: 1,2-dibromopropane + alcoholic KOH → elimination of HBr → forms an alkyne, propyne.

Then, C → D: propyne → ???.

Wait, maybe D is the same as C, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe in the presence of red-hot iron, propyne is hydrogenated to propene. But I thought that hydrogenation requires H2 and a catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is causing some other reaction.

Wait, perhaps D is propane. But how?

Another angle: let's proceed to the next steps.

D is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Maybe that's a dehydrogenation, so an alkene becomes an alkyne. But if C is propyne, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps after elimination from B, C is 2-bromopropane. Wait, no, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. So, elimination would give either propene or propyne, but I'm confident it's propyne.

Wait, perhaps I should move forward. So D is propyne? Then D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. As I thought, E is acetone.

Then E → F: acetone is reduced to propane.

F is propane. Then F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Propane can't react with HNO2. So, that's a problem. So, perhaps my earlier identification of E is wrong.

Alternative possibility: Maybe D is not propyne but something else. Suppose that, instead of elimination, the reaction of B with alcoholic KOH leads to substitution, forming a bromoalkene. Wait, but in that case, what would happen?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction of 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH. Maybe it undergoes a single elimination, leading to a bromoalkene. For example, losing one HBr to form CH2=CHCH2Br. Then, that would be compound C. Then, when C is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps the alkene is dehydrogenated to form an alkyne. Let me see.

So: B → C: 1,2-dibromopropane → CH2=CHCH2Br (after losing one HBr). Then, C is CH2=CHCH2Br.

Then, C → D: passed through a red-hot iron tube. Maybe the alkene is dehydrogenated to form an alkyne. So, CH2=CHCH2Br → CH≡CCH2Br? Not sure, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the iron could be a catalyst for another reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing decomposition. But not sure.

I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should look at the options and see if any of the statements must be incorrect.

The options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

D) C is a flammable gas.

Hmm.

Let's try to go through each option.

Option D: C is a flammable gas.

C is the product of B reacting with alcoholic KOH. If B is 1,2-dibromopropane and C is propene or propyne, then propene is a gas, but propyne is also a gas (but not sure). Wait, propene is a gas at room temperature. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) is a gas as well. So C could be a flammable gas, which would make D correct. But I'm not certain.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR.

D is the product after treating C with red-hot iron. If C is propyne, then D would be propyne, which upon further reaction... Wait, no, D is the product after passing through iron. Let me think again. If C is propyne, perhaps D is something else, but I can't figure that out. Alternatively, if D is propyne, then its NMR would show a singlet for the terminal CH3 and a singlet for the CH2 group. Wait, but propyne is HC≡CCH3. The structure is a triple bond between C1 and C2, with C3 as CH3. The protons on C3 (CH3) would be a singlet, and maybe the C2 (no protons) wouldn't show up. So the NMR would have a singlet from the CH3 group. But the question says two singlets. So perhaps D has two sets of equivalent protons, each giving a singlet.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane. If D is propane, its NMR would show a singlet for the three equivalent CH2 groups? Wait, no, propane is CH3CH2CH3. The two CH3 groups are equivalent, so they would be a singlet. The middle CH2 has two H, but they are equivalent as well. Wait, no, all nine H are equivalent in propane? No, wait, the two terminal CH3 groups are equivalent, so their H would be a singlet. The middle CH2's H are in a different environment. Wait, but in propane, all H are equivalent? No, because the two end CH3 groups are attached to CH2, which is symmetric. So each H in the CH3 groups is equivalent, so that would be a singlet. The CH2 group in the center is between two CH3 groups, so its H are all equivalent and would show as a quartet, but wait, wait. Wait, in NMR, each set of equivalent protons is a separate signal. In propane, the two CH3 groups are identical, so their H would resonate at the same chemical shift. So, the NMR would show a singlet integrating for six H (each CH3 has three H, two CH3 groups → 6 H). The CH2 has two H, but in a different environment, so another singlet? No, because CH2 in propane is between two identical groups, so its H would be in a unique environment. Wait, no, in propane, all H are in the same environment because of the molecule's symmetry. So the NMR would show a single singlet for all nine H. So if D is propane, the NMR would show one singlet. But the option says two singlets, so D can't be propane. So perhaps D is not propane.

Wait, going back, perhaps D is propyne. Propyne is HC≡CCH3. The structure has a triple bond between C1 and C2. C3 is CH3. The H on C1 is a terminal alkyne proton. The CH3 on C3 is in a different environment. So the NMR would have two sets of protons: the terminal H (a triplet due to coupling with adjacent protons? Or a singlet?) Wait, the terminal H on a triple bond is a vinylic proton. Typically, in HC≡CCH2X, the H on the sp-hybridized carbon would be a singlet because they're attached to the triple bond. In propyne, the structure is HC≡C-CH3. The H on the triple bond (sp hybrid) is a singlet because it's attached to a triple bond and adjacent to the C≡C-CH3. The CH3 group would have a singlet as well because all three H are equivalent. So the 1H NMR would show two singlets: one from the terminal H (maybe around δ 1.8-2.5 ppm) and another from the CH3 (around δ 0.8 ppm). So two singlets. So option C says D gives two singlets, which would be correct if D is propyne. So option C is correct, not incorrect.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride is FeCl3, which is used in the benzidine test for phenols. If H is a phenol, it would give a red-brown precipitate. Alternatively, if H is a dienophile or something else, but more likely, H is an aromatic compound. Alternatively, perhaps H is a ketone or another functional group. Hmm.

Let's think about the steps again. Let me retrace each compound.

A. C3H6 → Propene.
B. Propene + Br2 → 1,2-dibromopropane.
C. 1,2-dibromopropane + alcoholic KOH → Propyne (since elimination of two HBr to form triple bond).
D. Propyne → passed through red-hot iron. Hmm, perhaps this is the dehydrohalogenation or another elimination. Wait, perhaps another possibility: after propyne is formed, it's passed through red-hot iron, perhaps causing further elimination or reaction. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe this step is the same as before, leading D to be propyne.

E. Propyne + two strong acids → acetone.

F. Acetone + Fe and HCl → Propane.

G. Propane + nitrous acid → no reaction? That can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the identification of E. Let's think again. D is propyne. When propyne reacts with two strong acids, perhaps it's a hydration reaction to form a ketone, which is acetone (propan-2-one). So E is acetone.

Then F is the product of E with Fe and HCl. That's the Clemmensen reduction, reducing ketones to alkanes. So F is propane.

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Propane can't react with HNO2, so that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps.

Wait, maybe the reaction after D is different.

Alternative pathway: After D is propyne, perhaps the next step is catalytic hydrogenation to form propene. So D is propene.

Wait, but that would mean C was propyne, D is propene. Then, D (propene) reacts with two strong acids. Hmm, two strong acids—what reaction? Maybe acid-catalyzed hydration of propene to form propan-2-ol. So E would be propan-2-ol.

Then, E (propan-2-ol) with Fe and HCl. Fe in HCl might be a reducing condition, but propan-2-ol is an alcohol. Maybe it's a rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's for amines. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the mixture is H2SO4 and another acid. Let's think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the step after D is not about propene but about propyne. So, D is propyne. Then, E is formed from propyne with two strong acids. Let's think of another reaction. Maybe the propyne is subjected to oxymercuration, but that usually requires Hg(OAc)2 and water. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation. With two strong acids, maybe H2SO4 and HCl, propyne would undergo hydrohalogenation. Propyne (HC≡C-CH3) with HCl would add HCl across the triple bond. So, after adding HCl, the structure would be HCl-C≡C-CH3? No, wait, the addition would be HCl adding to the triple bond, giving CH2Cl-C≡C-CH3? Or perhaps the triple bond would add two HCl molecules, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction that forms a dihalide.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options again.

Option B: H gives yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride test is for phenols, giving a red-brown precipitate. So H would have to be a phenol. But looking at the steps, I don't see any step introducing an aromatic ring or a phenol group. So perhaps H isn't a phenol, making option B incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a ketone. Ferric chloride doesn't react with ketones. So option B would be incorrect.

Another option: perhaps H is a bromide. But ferric chloride wouldn't react with that either.

Wait, let's see the steps. H is the product of G reacting with NaOH. G is the product of F reacting with nitrous acid.

F is propane. It reacts with nitrous acid. But that doesn't make sense. So probably, I made a mistake in earlier steps. Let me try to see if another pathway exists.

Alternative approach: perhaps the initial bromination is not addition but substitution. But propene doesn't undergo substitution with Br2 in CCl4. So that's unlikely.

Alternative idea: Perhaps the reaction after E is not Clemmensen but another reaction. E is acetone. Reacting with Fe and HCl. Wait, another possibility: the presence of Fe in HCl might lead to some other reaction, but Clemmensen is the standard one for ketones.

I'm stuck. Let's think about the options.

Option D: C is a flammable gas.

If C is propene or propyne, which are both gases, then yes. So option D is correct.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is propane. Propane is used as a fuel, not in dye synthesis. So option A would be incorrect. But if F is something else, like toluene, then it might be used in dye synthesis. Hmm.

But according to the steps I thought, F is propane, which is not used for dye synthesis. So option A would be incorrect.

But earlier steps led to F being propane, which is a problem because it can't react with nitrous acid. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe F isn't propane. Let me think again.

E is acetone. Then E → F: acetone + Fe and HCl → F. If that's the Clemmensen reduction, F is propane. So F is propane.

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. No reaction occurs. So G would be same as F. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H. So H would be same as G, which is propane. But NaOH and propane wouldn't react. So that's impossible.

Therefore, my earlier steps must be wrong.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the initial steps are different. Let me think again.

Another possibility: when propene (A) is brominated, perhaps it undergoes allylic bromination. But in the presence of CCl4, Br2 usually adds across the double bond, not allylic bromination. So that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution. But I don't think Br2 in CCl4 causes substitution in alkenes.

Alternative idea: Perhaps the initial compound is cyclopropane? No, because A is C3H6, which is more likely propene.

Hmm. I'm stuck, but perhaps I should look for the mistake in the options.

The question is asking for the incorrect statement about the products.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. If H is a phenol, it would give a red-brown precipitate, not yellow. Alternatively, if H is something else, like a ketone, which would not react. So option B is incorrect.

So the incorrect statement would be option B or D.

Wait, but what is H? Let's think.

If all steps are correct up to F, then:

G is the product of F (propane) and nitrous acid, which is nothing. Then H is the product of G and NaOH, which is also nothing.

But I think I must have made a mistake in the earlier steps, perhaps in the step where E is formed. Maybe E is not acetone but another compound.

Alternative pathway: When propyne (D) is treated with two strong acids, perhaps it undergoes a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps E is propionaldehyde. How?

Hydration of propyne with H2O and HgSO4 would give ketone. But with different conditions, like excess H2SO4 and heat, maybe it leads to the formation of aldehyde. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps D is not propyne. Let's think again.

If Compound C is propene, then D is formed by passing through red-hot iron. So, propene becomes something else. Wait, propene → D.

Wait, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing hydrogenation. Propene (alkene) would react with H2 and iron to form propane. But in our case, the step is just passing through a red-hot iron tube. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or another reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the iron is causing a reaction with the alkyne.

But without knowing the exact reaction, it's hard to proceed.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to look for which option must be incorrect based on the thought process.

From the options:

Option D says C is a flammable gas. If C is propene or propyne, then yes. So D is correct.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is propyne, yes, two singlets. So C is correct.

Option B: H gives yellow with FeCl3. If H is a phenol, it would give a different color. So B is incorrect.

Option A: F is used for dye synthesis. If F is propane, it's incorrect. But if F is something else, like toluene, then A would be correct.

Wait, but according to earlier steps, F is propane, which isn't used for dye synthesis. So option A would be incorrect.

Wait, but let me think about the steps again.

If F is propane, then G is nothing. So I must have made a mistake. So perhaps the correct pathway is different.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the final steps.

G is the product of F and nitrous acid. If F is something like an amine, then G would be a diazonium salt, which upon treatment with NaOH would form a phenol or other product. But F is supposed to be the product after E (which I thought was acetone) is reduced to propane.

Wait, perhaps E is not acetone. Let me rethink the step where D reacts with two strong acids to form E.

If D is propyne, and the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O, then E is acetone. So that part is correct.

Then F is propane.

But F can't react with nitrous acid. So perhaps the sequence is wrong.

Alternative idea: perhaps after E is formed (acetone), the step with Fe and HCl is not Clemmensen but another reaction. Wait, another reaction for ketones under acidic conditions with Fe. I'm not sure.

Wait, what's the product when acetone (propan-2-one) reacts with Fe and HCl? Clemmensen gives propane. Another possibility: maybe it's the Birch reduction, but that requires ammonia and different conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the Stephen reduction, which reduces ketones to aldehydes using HCl and FeCl3. So, acetone → propanal (CH3CH2CHO).

So E → F: acetone → propanal via Stephen reduction.

Then F is propanal.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2). Aldehydes can undergo the Hantzsch reaction, but with HNO2, perhaps it's the formation of a diazonium salt. Wait, but aldehydes don't form diazonium salts. That's for aromatic amines.

Hmm, another confusion.

Alternatively, perhaps F is propanal, which upon treatment with HNO2 would undergo some reaction, maybe forming an enol or something else. Not sure.

Then, G is the product, and H is the product of G with NaOH.

But I'm getting stuck. Perhaps it's better to consider that the incorrect statement is option B.

So, after all this, I think option B is incorrect. Because H would be something that doesn't react with FeCl3 to give yellow color. For example, if H is a ketone or an alkane, it wouldn't give a color with FeCl3.


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A (C₃H₆), identified as propene, which undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) to form Compound B, 1,2-dibromopropane. When B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it undergoes double dehydrohalogenation to form Compound C, which is propyne (HC≡CCH₃). 

Compound C (propyne) is then passed through a red-hot iron tube, likely causing further dehydrogenation or rearrangement, but the exact nature of Compound D remains unclear. Assuming D is propyne, it reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (likely H₂SO₄ and HgSO₄) to form Compound E, which is acetone (CH₃COCH₃). 

Compound E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl under Clemmensen reduction conditions to form Compound F, which is propane (CH₃CH₂CH₃). However, when F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂), no reaction occurs, as propane lacks functional groups to react with nitrous acid. This creates a contradiction in the sequence.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, this is incorrect because propane is not used for dye synthesis. However, if F were an aromatic compound like toluene, this would be correct. Given the sequence, F is likely propane, making this statement incorrect.

- **Option B**: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. Ferric chloride reacts with phenols to give a red-brown precipitate, not yellow. Since the sequence does not introduce a phenol, this statement is incorrect.

- **Option C**: D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra. If D is propyne (HC≡CCH₃), the terminal alkyne proton and the CH₃ group would appear as two singlets in the NMR spectrum, making this statement correct.

- **Option D**: C is a flammable gas. If C is propyne, it is indeed a flammable gas, making this statement correct.

The incorrect statements are **A** and **B**, but since the question asks for the single incorrect statement, **B** is the best choice because H cannot react with ferric chloride to give a yellow color.

Answer: B
