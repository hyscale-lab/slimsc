--- Reasoning Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma factor times the velocity. Or was it c times gamma times beta times the lifetime? Let me recall. The mean decay length L is given by L = γ β c τ, where τ is the proper lifetime, γ is the Lorentz factor, and β is v/c.

But wait, I don't have τ directly. I think I can find τ using the width Γ. The width Γ is related to the lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which says Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but wait, actually, the relation is Γ = ħ / τ. Or is it Γ = ħ * τ^{-1} ? Because Γ is the decay rate, which is inverse of lifetime. So yes, Γ = ħ / τ → τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait no, wait. The natural line width Γ is given by Γ = ħ / τ, correct. So tau is ħ divided by Γ.

But I need to be careful with units here. Let me list all the steps.

First, compute the lifetime τ. Then, compute the Lorentz factor γ. Then compute beta (β) as v/c. Once I have gamma and beta, compute gamma * beta. Multiply that by c and tau to get the decay length.

But wait, let's think about the units. The production energy E is given as 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV. So I can compute the relativistic gamma factor using E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). But wait, E is the total energy, so that's correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. The energy E of the particle is the total energy, which is γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). But since we’re working in units where c is 1 (GeV units), perhaps? Or maybe I should just compute it with proper unit conversions.

Wait, no, because E is given in GeV, m is in GeV/c², so perhaps I need to handle the units correctly. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute everything in natural units where c=1, and then multiply by c at the end where needed.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime τ.
Γ is given as 320 MeV. Since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ.

But ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

Let me calculate that: 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute that properly. 6.582 divided by 0.32. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32.

32 * 0.2 = 6.4, so 6.4 is 0.32 *20. So 0.32 *20.56875 ≈6.582? Let me check: 20 *0.32=6.4. 0.56875 *0.32=0.18192. So 6.4 +0.18192=6.58192, which is close to 6.582. So yes, approx 20.56875.

So τ = 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582/0.32 = approx 20.56875, and then multiplied by 1e-25, so 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s? Wait no, 20e-25 is 2e-24. So 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24 s. Yes.

Step 2: Compute the Lorentz factor gamma.

E = 8 GeV, m =1.2 GeV/c². So, using E = gamma m c². Since c² is in (GeV)^2/(GeV/c²)^2 → which would be (c²) in GeV² (since GeV/c² * c² = GeV). So, to compute gamma: gamma = E / (m c²) → but wait, because E is already in GeV, and m is in GeV/c². So GeV = (GeV/c²) * c² * gamma. So gamma = E/(m c²) → but c^2 in (GeV^2)/(GeV^2) cancels? Wait, perhaps it's better to compute in terms of units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that E = gamma m c² → so gamma = E/(m c²). But E is given in GeV, m in GeV/c², so let me compute in terms where c=1 (GeV units), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in natural units where c=1, so E = gamma m. Because in natural units, E (GeV) = gamma m (GeV/c²) * c^2 → which, with c=1, E = gamma m.

So in natural units, gamma = E/m.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

But wait, wait, let me double-check. Because E is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So, in units where c is not assumed to be 1, we have gamma = E / (m c²). But since we are working in GeV, and m is given in GeV/c², then E (GeV) / (m (GeV/c²) * c²) → GeV/(GeV) → unitless, which is correct for gamma.

So: E = 8 GeV, m =1.2 GeV/c².

gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) → the c² cancels, so gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... ≈ 6.6667.

Yes, that's correct.

Step 3: Compute beta. Beta is v/c, which is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

gamma^2 is (6.6667)^2 → approx 44.4444.

1/44.4444 is about 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, more accurately: let's compute 6.6667 squared. 6.6667 is 20/3, so (20/3)^2 =400/9≈44.4444.

So 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225.

Wait, 44.4444 * 0.0225 = approx 1. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Taking the square root of 0.9775:

What's sqrt(0.9775)? Let me think. 0.98^2 is 0.9604. 0.989^2 is approximately 0.978. Let me compute 0.988^2: 0.988 * 0.988.

= (1 - 0.012)^2 = 1 - 0.024 + 0.000144 → ≈ 0.976144.

Wait, 0.988 squared is 0.976.

Wait, 0.989^2: 0.989 *0.989 → (0.98 +0.009)^2 → 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.009 + 0.009^2 → 0.9604 + 0.01764 + 0.000081 → 0.9604 +0.017721 = 0.978121.

Hmm, so 0.989^2 ≈0.978121. So if 0.9775 is a bit less than that, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887.

So beta ≈0.9887.

So, gamma * beta = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈6.6667 *0.9887.

Hmm, 6.6667 *0.98 =6.5333, 6.6667 *0.0087= approx 0.058. So total around 6.5333 +0.058=6.5913.

Wait, maybe a more precise calculation: 6.6667 *0.9887.

Compute 6 *0.9887=5.9322, 0.6667 *0.9887 ≈0.6604 → Total≈5.9322 +0.6604=6.5926.

So gamma * beta ≈6.5926.

Now, the mean decay length L is c * gamma * beta * tau.

Wait, tau is the proper lifetime; when we multiply by gamma beta c, we get the length in the lab frame.

So L = c * gamma * beta * tau.

We have c ≈3e8 m/s.

So let me plug in the numbers.

c =3e8 m/s.

gamma * beta =6.5926.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L =3e8 m/s *6.5926 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute the product step by step.

First, multiply 6.5926 by 2.056875e-24.

6.5926 *2.056875 ≈ let me compute:

6 *2.056875=12.34125

0.5926 *2.056875≈ approx 1.219.

So total is 12.34125 +1.219=13.56025.

So 6.5926 *2.056875e-24 ≈13.56025e-24=1.356025e-23.

Now multiply by 3e8 m/s:

3e8 *1.356025e-23 = (3 *1.356025) * 1e-15.

3 *1.356025 ≈4.068075.

So L≈4.068075e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in gamma * beta.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma * beta more accurately.

Let me compute gamma: E/m =8/1.2 =6.6666666667.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma^2 = (6.6666666667)^2=44.4444444444.

1/gamma^2=0.0225.

1-0.0225=0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775)= let me compute it more accurately.

Let me use the calculator method. Let me find the square root of 0.9775.

We can write it as 0.9775 = (0.988)^2? Let me compute 0.988^2.

0.988 *0.988:

= (0.9 +0.088)^2.

= 0.81 + 2*0.9*0.088 + 0.088^2.

= 0.81 + 0.1584 + 0.007744.

= 0.81 +0.1584=0.9684, plus 0.007744 → 0.976144. So 0.988^2=0.976144.

But our target is 0.9775, which is 0.001356 higher.

So let me compute the next decimal place.

Let me compute 0.988 + delta)^2 =0.9775.

So let me approximate delta.

(0.988 + delta)^2 ≈ 0.988^2 +2*0.988*delta =0.976144 + 1.976 delta.

Set this equal to 0.9775.

0.976144 + 1.976 delta =0.9775 → 1.976 delta =0.9775 -0.976144=0.001356.

So delta=0.001356 /1.976≈ 0.000686.

So 0.988 +0.000686=0.988686.

So beta≈0.988686.

So gamma * beta=6.6666666667 *0.988686=?

Compute 6 *0.988686=5.932116.

0.6666666667 *0.988686≈ approx 0.6666666667 *0.988686.

Let me compute 0.6666666667 *0.988686.

= (2/3) *0.988686 ≈ (approx 0.6666666667) *0.988686.

Multiply 0.988686 by 2/3.

= (0.988686 *2)/(3)=1.977372/3≈0.659124.

So total gamma*beta is 5.932116 +0.659124≈6.59124.

Which is about 6.59124.

Now, L= c * gamma beta * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

gamma beta tau is 6.59124 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.59124 *2.056875e-24.

6.59124 *2.056875 → let's compute.

6 *2.056875=12.34125.

0.59124 *2.056875.

Compute 0.5 *2.056875=1.0284375.

0.09124 *2.056875 → approx 0.09124 *2=0.18248; but 2.056875 is 2.056875, so 0.09124 *2.056875 ≈0.09124 *2=0.18248 plus 0.09124 *0.056875.

0.09124 *0.056875 → approx 0.00517.

So total for 0.09124*2.056875 is approx 0.18765.

So 0.59124 *2.056875≈1.0284375 + 0.18765=1.2160875.

So total 6.59124 *2.056875≈12.34125 +1.2160875=13.5573375.

So 13.5573375e-24 s.

Multiply by c=3e8 m/s:

3e8 m/s *13.5573375e-24 s = 3e8 *13.5573375e-24 m.

Which is (3 *13.5573375) * 1e-16 m.

3 *13.5573375 ≈40.6720125.

So L≈40.672e-16 m → 4.0672e-15 m.

Wait, wait, that's 4.0672e-15 meters. Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.02e-15 m.

So this is closest to option B.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma * beta. Let me recheck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma and beta more accurately.

Wait, perhaps using more precise values.

Gamma is exactly E/(m c^2) =8 GeV / (1.2 GeV c^2) → but in units where c=1, gamma=8/1.2=6.6666666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Gamma squared is (6.6666666667)^2 = (20/3)^2=400/9≈44.444444444.

So 1/gamma^2=9/400=0.0225.

1-0.0225=0.9775.

So beta= sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.98871.

Wait, maybe even more accurately.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) precisely.

We can use the Taylor expansion for sqrt(x) around x=0.98^2=0.9604?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use a calculator approach.

But maybe I can compute it using the Newton-Raphson method.

Let me take an initial guess for sqrt(0.9775), say x0=0.988.

Compute x0^2=0.976144.

f(x)=x^2-0.9775=0.976144-0.9775= -0.001356.

f'(x)=2x=1.976.

Next approximation: x1 =x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) → 0.988 - (-0.001356)/(1.976) → 0.988 + 0.000687≈0.988687.

Compute x1^2: (0.988687)^2.

Compute 0.988687 *0.988687.

Well, it's easier to compute as (0.988 +0.000687)^2.

=0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.000687 + (0.000687)^2.

0.988^2=0.976144.

2 *0.988 *0.000687= 0.988 *0.001374= ~0.001355.

(0.000687)^2≈0.000000472.

So x1^2=0.976144 +0.001355 +0.000000472≈0.977499472.

Which is very close to 0.9775. So x1 is about 0.988687, and x1^2 is about 0.977499472, which is very close to 0.9775.

So beta≈0.988687.

So gamma * beta =6.666666667 * 0.988687 → let's compute.

6.666666667 * 0.988687.

6 *0.988687=5.932122.

0.666666667 *0.988687= approx 0.6591246.

Total: 5.932122 +0.6591246=6.5912466.

So gamma * beta≈6.5912466.

Now, tau is (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )= 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

So L= c * gamma * beta * tau.

c=3e8 m/s.

So, L=3e8 m/s *6.5912466 *2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.5912466 *2.056875e-24.

6.5912466 *2.056875 =?

Let me compute 6 *2.056875=12.34125.

0.5912466 *2.056875 → compute 0.5 *2.056875=1.0284375.

0.0912466 *2.056875 → approx 0.0912466 *2=0.1824932, plus 0.0912466 *0.056875.

0.0912466 *0.056875 = approximately 0.00518.

So 0.1824932 +0.00518=0.1876732.

So total for 0.5912466 *2.056875≈1.0284375 +0.1876732=1.2161107.

So total 6.5912466 *2.056875≈12.34125 +1.2161107=13.5573607.

So 13.5573607e-24 s.

Multiply by 3e8 m/s:

3e8 *13.5573607e-24 = (3 *13.5573607) *1e-16.

3*13.5573607=40.6720821.

So L=40.6720821e-16 m → 4.06720821e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.02e-15 m.

Hmm, the calculated value is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B, 4.0655e-15 m.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the tau value.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of tau.

Tau is hbar / Gamma.

hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau=6.582e-25 /0.32 = ?

6.582 /0.32 = let me compute.

0.32 *20 =6.4 → 6.4 is less than 6.582 by 0.182.

0.182 / 0.32 → 0.56875.

So 20.56875.

So tau=20.56875e-25 s →2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, that's correct.

So the steps seem correct, and the result is around 4.067e-15 m, which is closest to option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but in the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the mean decay length.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is L = c * beta * gamma * tau.

Wait, but that's the same as what I did.

Alternative approach: perhaps mean decay length is c * (gamma * beta) * tau.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for hbar.

hbar is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

If I use more precise value, like 6.5823e-25 GeV s.

So tau=6.5823e-25 /0.32 → 6.5823 /0.32=?

6.5823 /0.32 = let's compute.

0.32*20=6.4 → 6.4.

6.5823-6.4=0.1823.

0.1823/0.32=0.5696875.

So 20.5696875 → tau=20.5696875e-25 s=2.05696875e-24 s.

So using more precise tau.

gamma*beta: 6.666666667 *0.988687 ≈6.5912466.

So L=3e8 m/s *6.5912466 *2.05696875e-24 s.

Compute 6.5912466 *2.05696875e-24.

6.5912466 *2.05696875 = ?

Let me compute more accurately:

6.5912466 *2.05696875.

Let me compute 6 *2.05696875=12.3418125.

0.5912466 *2.05696875.

Compute 0.5 *2.05696875=1.028484375.

0.0912466 *2.05696875 → 0.0912466 *2=0.1824932.

0.0912466 *0.05696875= approx 0.0051875.

So 0.1824932 + 0.0051875 ≈0.1876807.

So 0.5912466 *2.05696875≈1.028484375 +0.1876807≈1.216165.

So total 6.5912466 *2.05696875≈12.3418125 +1.216165≈13.5579775.

So 13.5579775e-24 s.

Multiply by 3e8 m/s → 3e8 *13.5579775e-24 m.

3e8 *13.5579775e-24 = (3 *13.5579775 ) *1e-16.

3*13.5579775=40.6739325.

So L=40.6739325e-16 m →4.06739325e-15 m.

So around 4.0674e-15 m.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:4.0655e-15 m.

But wait, perhaps the calculation assumes that the width is given as the total width, but perhaps the decay length formula uses Γ/2, but I don't think so. The width Γ is the total decay width, so tau is ħ/Γ.

Another possibility is that the calculation uses the relation tau= ħ/(2Γ), but I don't think that's the case. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that ΔE Δt ~ ħ/2, but when considering decay widths, Γ is the total width, and τ is ħ/Γ.

Wait, another thought. Decay width is Γ= ħ/tau → tau= ħ/Γ.

Yes, that's the correct relation.

So back to the options. The calculated value is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B:4.0655e-15 m.

But why is option C at 5e-15?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me double-check the units for tau.

tau is in seconds: 2.056875e-24 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So L= c * gamma beta * tau.

So (3e8 m/s) * (6.59124) * (2.056875e-24 s) → units: m.

So 3e8 *6.59124 *2.056875e-24 → 3e8 * (6.59124 *2.056875e-24).

Wait, 6.59124 * 2.056875e-24 =13.5573e-24.

3e8 *13.5573e-24=4.0672e-15 m.

So the calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is option B:4.0655e-15 m.

But wait, another possible mistake: perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, and I should convert it to GeV.

Wait, yes. Γ=320 MeV=0.32 GeV. So that's correct.

Alternative possibility: perhaps the decay length formula uses the total decay width as Γ, but perhaps I should use Γ= full width, which I did.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the mean path is c * tau * beta gamma, which is the same as I did.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is L= c * beta * gamma * tau.

Yes, that's the same as what I did.

I think the calculations are correct, so the answer should be option B.

To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = c \cdot \gamma \cdot \beta \cdot \tau
\]

where:
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity in units of \( c \),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \),

we calculate:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Given:
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \),

we calculate:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity factor \( \beta \) is given by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\gamma^2 = \left( 6.6667 \right)^2 = 44.4444, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 0.0225, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 0.9775,
\]

\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \gamma \cdot \beta \)
\[
\gamma \cdot \beta = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \approx 6.5912.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
Substituting into the formula for \( L \):

\[
L = c \cdot \gamma \cdot \beta \cdot \tau
\]

\[
L = \left( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \right) \cdot \left( 6.5912 \right) \cdot \left( 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \right).
\]

First, calculate \( \gamma \cdot \beta \cdot \tau \):

\[
6.5912 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 13.5573 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

Now, multiply by \( c \):

\[
L = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 13.5573 \times 10^{-24} = 4.0672 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 6: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \( L \approx 4.0672 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B**, \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma factor times the velocity. Or was it c times gamma times beta times the lifetime? Let me recall. The mean decay length L is given by L = γ β c τ, where τ is the proper lifetime, γ is the Lorentz factor, and β is v/c.

But wait, I don't have τ directly. I think I can find τ using the width Γ. The width Γ is related to the lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which says Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but wait, actually, the relation is Γ = ħ / τ. Or is it Γ = ħ * τ^{-1} ? Because Γ is the decay rate, which is inverse of lifetime. So yes, Γ = ħ / τ → τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait no, wait. The natural line width Γ is given by Γ = ħ / τ, correct. So tau is ħ divided by Γ.

But I need to be careful with units here. Let me list all the steps.

First, compute the lifetime τ. Then, compute the Lorentz factor γ. Then compute beta (β) as v/c. Once I have gamma and beta, compute gamma * beta. Multiply that by c and tau to get the decay length.

But wait, let's think about the units. The production energy E is given as 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV. So I can compute the relativistic gamma factor using E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). But wait, E is the total energy, so that's correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. The energy E of the particle is the total energy, which is γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). But since we’re working in units where c is 1 (GeV units), perhaps? Or maybe I should just compute it with proper unit conversions.

Wait, no, because E is given in GeV, m is in GeV/c², so perhaps I need to handle the units correctly. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute everything in natural units where c=1, and then multiply by c at the end where needed.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime τ.
Γ is given as 320 MeV. Since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ.

But ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

Let me calculate that: 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute that properly. 6.582 divided by 0.32. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32.

32 * 0.2 = 6.4, so 6.4 is 0.32 *20. So 0.32 *20.56875 ≈6.582? Let me check: 20 *0.32=6.4. 0.56875 *0.32=0.18192. So 6.4 +0.18192=6.58192, which is close to 6.582. So yes, approx 20.56875.

So τ = 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582/0.32 = approx 20.56875, and then multiplied by 1e-25, so 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s? Wait no, 20e-25 is 2e-24. So 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24 s. Yes.

Step 2: Compute the Lorentz factor gamma.

E = 8 GeV, m =1.2 GeV/c². So, using E = gamma m c². Since c² is in (GeV)^2/(GeV/c²)^2 → which would be (c²) in GeV² (since GeV/c² * c² = GeV). So, to compute gamma: gamma = E / (m c²) → but wait, because E is already in GeV, and m is in GeV/c². So GeV = (GeV/c²) * c² * gamma. So gamma = E/(m c²) → but c^2 in (GeV^2)/(GeV^2) cancels? Wait, perhaps it's better to compute in terms of units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that E = gamma m c² → so gamma = E/(m c²). But E is given in GeV, m in GeV/c², so let me compute in terms where c=1 (GeV units), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in natural units where c=1, so E = gamma m. Because in natural units, E (GeV) = gamma m (GeV/c²) * c^2 → which, with c=1, E = gamma m.

So in natural units, gamma = E/m.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

But wait, wait, let me double-check. Because E is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So, in units where c is not assumed to be 1, we have gamma = E / (m c²). But since we are working in GeV, and m is given in GeV/c², then E (GeV) / (m (GeV/c²) * c²) → GeV/(GeV) → unitless, which is correct for gamma.

So: E = 8 GeV, m =1.2 GeV/c².

gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) → the c² cancels, so gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... ≈ 6.6667.

Yes, that's correct.

Step 3: Compute beta. Beta is v/c, which is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

gamma^2 is (6.6667)^2 → approx 44.4444.

1/44.4444 is about 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, more accurately: let's compute 6.6667 squared. 6.6667 is 20/3, so (20/3)^2 =400/9≈44.4444.

So 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225.

Wait, 44.4444 * 0.0225 = approx 1. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Taking the square root of 0.9775:

What's sqrt(0.9775)? Let me think. 0.98^2 is 0.9604. 0.989^2 is approximately 0.978. Let me compute 0.988^2: 0.988 * 0.988.

= (1 - 0.012)^2 = 1 - 0.024 + 0.000144 → ≈ 0.976144.

Wait, 0.988 squared is 0.976.

Wait, 0.989^2: 0.989 *0.989 → (0.98 +0.009)^2 → 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.009 + 0.009^2 → 0.9604 + 0.01764 + 0.000081 → 0.9604 +0.017721 = 0.978121.

Hmm, so 0.989^2 ≈0.978121. So if 0.9775 is a bit less than that, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887.

So beta ≈0.9887.

So, gamma * beta = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈6.6667 *0.9887.

Hmm, 6.6667 *0.98 =6.5333, 6.6667 *0.0087= approx 0.058. So total around 6.5333 +0.058=6.5913.

Wait, maybe a more precise calculation: 6.6667 *0.9887.

Compute 6 *0.9887=5.9322, 0.6667 *0.9887 ≈0.6604 → Total≈5.9322 +0.6604=6.5926.

So gamma * beta ≈6.5926.

Now, the mean decay length L is c * gamma * beta * tau.

Wait, tau is the proper lifetime; when we multiply by gamma beta c, we get the length in the lab frame.

So L = c * gamma * beta * tau.

We have c ≈3e8 m/s.

So let me plug in the numbers.

c =3e8 m/s.

gamma * beta =6.5926.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L =3e8 m/s *6.5926 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute the product step by step.

First, multiply 6.5926 by 2.056875e-24.

6.5926 *2.056875 ≈ let me compute:

6 *2.056875=12.34125

0.5926 *2.056875≈ approx 1.219.

So total is 12.34125 +1.219=13.56025.

So 6.5926 *2.056875e-24 ≈13.56025e-24=1.356025e-23.

Now multiply by 3e8 m/s:

3e8 *1.356025e-23 = (3 *1.356025) * 1e-15.

3 *1.356025 ≈4.068075.

So L≈4.068075e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in gamma * beta.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma * beta more accurately.

Let me compute gamma: E/m =8/1.2 =6.6666666667.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma^2 = (6.6666666667)^2=44.4444444444.

1/gamma^2=0.0225.

1-0.0225=0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775)= let me compute it more accurately.

Let me use the calculator method. Let me find the square root of 0.9775.

We can write it as 0.9775 = (0.988)^2? Let me compute 0.988^2.

0.988 *0.988:

= (0.9 +0.088)^2.

= 0.81 + 2*0.9*0.088 + 0.088^2.

= 0.81 + 0.1584 + 0.007744.

= 0.81 +0.1584=0.9684, plus 0.007744 → 0.976144. So 0.988^2=0.976144.

But our target is 0.9775, which is 0.001356 higher.

So let me compute the next decimal place.

Let me compute 0.988 + delta)^2 =0.9775.

So let me approximate delta.

(0.988 + delta)^2 ≈ 0.988^2 +2*0.988*delta =0.976144 + 1.976 delta.

Set this equal to 0.9775.

0.976144 + 1.976 delta =0.9775 → 1.976 delta =0.9775 -0.976144=0.001356.

So delta=0.001356 /1.976≈ 0.000686.

So 0.988 +0.000686=0.988686.

So beta≈0.988686.

So gamma * beta=6.6666666667 *0.988686=?

Compute 6 *0.988686=5.932116.

0.6666666667 *0.988686≈ approx 0.6666666667 *0.988686.

Let me compute 0.6666666667 *0.988686.

= (2/3) *0.988686 ≈ (approx 0.6666666667) *0.988686.

Multiply 0.988686 by 2/3.

= (0.988686 *2)/(3)=1.977372/3≈0.659124.

So total gamma*beta is 5.932116 +0.659124≈6.59124.

Which is about 6.59124.

Now, L= c * gamma beta * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

gamma beta tau is 6.59124 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.59124 *2.056875e-24.

6.59124 *2.056875 → let's compute.

6 *2.056875=12.34125.

0.59124 *2.056875.

Compute 0.5 *2.056875=1.0284375.

0.09124 *2.056875 → approx 0.09124 *2=0.18248; but 2.056875 is 2.056875, so 0.09124 *2.056875 ≈0.09124 *2=0.18248 plus 0.09124 *0.056875.

0.09124 *0.056875 → approx 0.00517.

So total for 0.09124*2.056875 is approx 0.18765.

So 0.59124 *2.056875≈1.0284375 + 0.18765=1.2160875.

So total 6.59124 *2.056875≈12.34125 +1.2160875=13.5573375.

So 13.5573375e-24 s.

Multiply by c=3e8 m/s:

3e8 m/s *13.5573375e-24 s = 3e8 *13.5573375e-24 m.

Which is (3 *13.5573375) * 1e-16 m.

3 *13.5573375 ≈40.6720125.

So L≈40.672e-16 m → 4.0672e-15 m.

Wait, wait, that's 4.0672e-15 meters. Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.02e-15 m.

So this is closest to option B.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma * beta. Let me recheck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma and beta more accurately.

Wait, perhaps using more precise values.

Gamma is exactly E/(m c^2) =8 GeV / (1.2 GeV c^2) → but in units where c=1, gamma=8/1.2=6.6666666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Gamma squared is (6.6666666667)^2 = (20/3)^2=400/9≈44.444444444.

So 1/gamma^2=9/400=0.0225.

1-0.0225=0.9775.

So beta= sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.98871.

Wait, maybe even more accurately.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) precisely.

We can use the Taylor expansion for sqrt(x) around x=0.98^2=0.9604?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use a calculator approach.

But maybe I can compute it using the Newton-Raphson method.

Let me take an initial guess for sqrt(0.9775), say x0=0.988.

Compute x0^2=0.976144.

f(x)=x^2-0.9775=0.976144-0.9775= -0.001356.

f'(x)=2x=1.976.

Next approximation: x1 =x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) → 0.988 - (-0.001356)/(1.976) → 0.988 + 0.000687≈0.988687.

Compute x1^2: (0.988687)^2.

Compute 0.988687 *0.988687.

Well, it's easier to compute as (0.988 +0.000687)^2.

=0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.000687 + (0.000687)^2.

0.988^2=0.976144.

2 *0.988 *0.000687= 0.988 *0.001374= ~0.001355.

(0.000687)^2≈0.000000472.

So x1^2=0.976144 +0.001355 +0.000000472≈0.977499472.

Which is very close to 0.9775. So x1 is about 0.988687, and x1^2 is about 0.977499472, which is very close to 0.9775.

So beta≈0.988687.

So gamma * beta =6.666666667 * 0.988687 → let's compute.

6.666666667 * 0.988687.

6 *0.988687=5.932122.

0.666666667 *0.988687= approx 0.6591246.

Total: 5.932122 +0.6591246=6.5912466.

So gamma * beta≈6.5912466.

Now, tau is (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )= 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

So L= c * gamma * beta * tau.

c=3e8 m/s.

So, L=3e8 m/s *6.5912466 *2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.5912466 *2.056875e-24.

6.5912466 *2.056875 =?

Let me compute 6 *2.056875=12.34125.

0.5912466 *2.056875 → compute 0.5 *2.056875=1.0284375.

0.0912466 *2.056875 → approx 0.0912466 *2=0.1824932, plus 0.0912466 *0.056875.

0.0912466 *0.056875 = approximately 0.00518.

So 0.1824932 +0.00518=0.1876732.

So total for 0.5912466 *2.056875≈1.0284375 +0.1876732=1.2161107.

So total 6.5912466 *2.056875≈12.34125 +1.2161107=13.5573607.

So 13.5573607e-24 s.

Multiply by 3e8 m/s:

3e8 *13.5573607e-24 = (3 *13.5573607) *1e-16.

3*13.5573607=40.6720821.

So L=40.6720821e-16 m → 4.06720821e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.02e-15 m.

Hmm, the calculated value is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B, 4.0655e-15 m.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the tau value.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of tau.

Tau is hbar / Gamma.

hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau=6.582e-25 /0.32 = ?

6.582 /0.32 = let me compute.

0.32 *20 =6.4 → 6.4 is less than 6.582 by 0.182.

0.182 / 0.32 → 0.56875.

So 20.56875.

So tau=20.56875e-25 s →2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, that's correct.

So the steps seem correct, and the result is around 4.067e-15 m, which is closest to option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but in the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the mean decay length.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is L = c * beta * gamma * tau.

Wait, but that's the same as what I did.

Alternative approach: perhaps mean decay length is c * (gamma * beta) * tau.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for hbar.

hbar is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

If I use more precise value, like 6.5823e-25 GeV s.

So tau=6.5823e-25 /0.32 → 6.5823 /0.32=?

6.5823 /0.32 = let's compute.

0.32*20=6.4 → 6.4.

6.5823-6.4=0.1823.

0.1823/0.32=0.5696875.

So 20.5696875 → tau=20.5696875e-25 s=2.05696875e-24 s.

So using more precise tau.

gamma*beta: 6.666666667 *0.988687 ≈6.5912466.

So L=3e8 m/s *6.5912466 *2.05696875e-24 s.

Compute 6.5912466 *2.05696875e-24.

6.5912466 *2.05696875 = ?

Let me compute more accurately:

6.5912466 *2.05696875.

Let me compute 6 *2.05696875=12.3418125.

0.5912466 *2.05696875.

Compute 0.5 *2.05696875=1.028484375.

0.0912466 *2.05696875 → 0.0912466 *2=0.1824932.

0.0912466 *0.05696875= approx 0.0051875.

So 0.1824932 + 0.0051875 ≈0.1876807.

So 0.5912466 *2.05696875≈1.028484375 +0.1876807≈1.216165.

So total 6.5912466 *2.05696875≈12.3418125 +1.216165≈13.5579775.

So 13.5579775e-24 s.

Multiply by 3e8 m/s → 3e8 *13.5579775e-24 m.

3e8 *13.5579775e-24 = (3 *13.5579775 ) *1e-16.

3*13.5579775=40.6739325.

So L=40.6739325e-16 m →4.06739325e-15 m.

So around 4.0674e-15 m.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:4.0655e-15 m.

But wait, perhaps the calculation assumes that the width is given as the total width, but perhaps the decay length formula uses Γ/2, but I don't think so. The width Γ is the total decay width, so tau is ħ/Γ.

Another possibility is that the calculation uses the relation tau= ħ/(2Γ), but I don't think that's the case. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that ΔE Δt ~ ħ/2, but when considering decay widths, Γ is the total width, and τ is ħ/Γ.

Wait, another thought. Decay width is Γ= ħ/tau → tau= ħ/Γ.

Yes, that's the correct relation.

So back to the options. The calculated value is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B:4.0655e-15 m.

But why is option C at 5e-15?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me double-check the units for tau.

tau is in seconds: 2.056875e-24 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So L= c * gamma beta * tau.

So (3e8 m/s) * (6.59124) * (2.056875e-24 s) → units: m.

So 3e8 *6.59124 *2.056875e-24 → 3e8 * (6.59124 *2.056875e-24).

Wait, 6.59124 * 2.056875e-24 =13.5573e-24.

3e8 *13.5573e-24=4.0672e-15 m.

So the calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is option B:4.0655e-15 m.

But wait, another possible mistake: perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, and I should convert it to GeV.

Wait, yes. Γ=320 MeV=0.32 GeV. So that's correct.

Alternative possibility: perhaps the decay length formula uses the total decay width as Γ, but perhaps I should use Γ= full width, which I did.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the mean path is c * tau * beta gamma, which is the same as I did.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is L= c * beta * gamma * tau.

Yes, that's the same as what I did.

I think the calculations are correct, so the answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = c \cdot \gamma \cdot \beta \cdot \tau
\]

where:
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity in units of \( c \),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \),

we calculate:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Given:
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \),

we calculate:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity factor \( \beta \) is given by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\gamma^2 = \left( 6.6667 \right)^2 = 44.4444, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 0.0225, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 0.9775,
\]

\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \gamma \cdot \beta \)
\[
\gamma \cdot \beta = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \approx 6.5912.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
Substituting into the formula for \( L \):

\[
L = c \cdot \gamma \cdot \beta \cdot \tau
\]

\[
L = \left( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \right) \cdot \left( 6.5912 \right) \cdot \left( 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \right).
\]

First, calculate \( \gamma \cdot \beta \cdot \tau \):

\[
6.5912 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 13.5573 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

Now, multiply by \( c \):

\[
L = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 13.5573 \times 10^{-24} = 4.0672 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 6: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \( L \approx 4.0672 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B**, \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
