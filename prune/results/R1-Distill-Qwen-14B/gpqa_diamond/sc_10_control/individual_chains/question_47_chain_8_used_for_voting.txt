Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let's see what the data says.

The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X here is halogens, but since the formula doesn't have any, I'll ignore that. So, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2.

So plugging in: (2*9 + 2 - 11 + 1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That's probably a benzene ring (3 from the ring) plus a double bond or something else, maybe an amide or ester group which would contribute another one or two.

Looking at the IR data: Strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches, but maybe O-H? Or maybe they're from amide NH or from an amino group. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Ester carbonyls are around 1720-1740, amides are a bit lower, like 1650-1700. So maybe it's an ester or a ketone? But since there's a carbonyl, and the formula includes an O, ester is a possibility.

Next, the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm triplet (t, 3H). That's likely a methyl group attached to an oxygen, maybe an OCH2CH3 group. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so perhaps it's a CH2 connected to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group. So maybe an ethyl ester.

4.0 ppm broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad singlet with 2H. Could that be an NH2 group? But wait, the IR shows N-H stretches, but if it's a broad peak around 4 ppm, maybe it's an amine adjacent to something else. Wait, but in an amide, the NH is usually around 6-8 ppm. Wait, no, 4 ppm is lower. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group. Or perhaps some other environment. Hmm.

4.5 ppm quartet (q, 2H). Quartet with 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with a neighboring CH2 with two protons. So maybe a CH2CH2 group. Like in an ethyl ester. For example, in ethyl groups, the CH2 next to the oxygen would appear as a quartet. So maybe the 4.5 is the OCH2 in an ethyl ester. Because in ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 splits into a quartet for the OCH2 and triplet for the CH3.

Wait, in the NMR, the triplet is at 1.20 (3H), and the quartet is at 4.5 (2H). That's classic for an ethyl group, where the CH3 is a triplet (coupling with the adjacent CH2), and the CH2 is a quartet.

So perhaps there's an ethyl ester group here. So if the compound is an ester, the structure would be R-O-CO-Ar, where Ar is an aromatic ring.

Looking at the aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Those are two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So that suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents. Wait, but two doublets, each 2H, probably in a para-disubstituted benzene, like p-substituted. Because in para substitution, the two protons on each adjacent carbon are equivalent and split into a doublet. So maybe the substituents are at para positions, and the adjacent Hs are each a doublet.

Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions, the aromatic protons would be as two doublets. Or wait, maybe it's a single substituent that's activating, causing the ring to have two sets of doublets. Wait, no, perhaps it's a disubstituted benzene in the para position. So for example, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 3 (but that's meta), or 1 and 4 (para to each other). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

In a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if it's a single substituent, like in para-methyl benzoate, you'd have two sets of doublets for the aromatic protons. Let me think: for example, if the substituent is at position 4 (para), the aromatic protons would be at positions 2 and 6, each as a doublet. So that fits with the NMR: 7.0 and 8.0 ppm as doublets, each integrating to 2H. So the substituent is at position 4, perhaps.

Wait, but the substituent in the ester would be on the benzene ring. So the ester oxygen would be connected to the benzene. So if the substituent is an ester group (O-CO-OEt?), wait no, that's not right. Let me correct. An ester group is R-O-CO-Ar. Wait, no, the ester is Ar-O-CO-R. Wait, no, the ester is RCOOR', where R is the aryl group. Oh wait, no. Wait, in an ester, the structure is R-O-CO-R', where R is the alkoxy group and R' is the acyl group. So if the benzene is connected to the ester, it would be R-O-CO-Ar where Ar is the benzene ring. So the substituent on the benzene would be an ester group.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide is CONH2 attached to benzene, but if it's substituted, perhaps it's OEt in the meta position. But then the NMR would have different features. Hmm.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide is HCONH2, with the NH2 attached to the 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the structure would be HCO-NH-Ph-OEt, with Ph being the benzene. So the benzene would have an OEt group at position 4 and the formamide NH at position 1? Or maybe it's the substituents in para positions.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate would be CH2CH2COO-, attached to the benzene. So if the benzene has an NH2 group at position 4 and a propionate ester group, but wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate that. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-, so the ester would be OCOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, but the compound would be 4-aminophenyl propionate: structure is NH2-C6H4-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that would be longer. Let me count: benzene (6 C), NH2 (1 N, 2 H), COO (2 O), and then the propyl group (3 C). So molecular formula would be C9H11NO3? Because benzene (6 C), COO (2 O from ester), and propyl (3 C) → total C9. O: 3 (from COO and the ester O) but wait, the formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated. Alternatively, maybe it's a propionate ester without the propyl, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different structure.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O-CO-OEt attached to the benzene at position 4, and an NH2 group at position 1, perhaps. Wait, no, in 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group would be at position 4 and the ester at position 1. Wait, benzene can't have two substituents in the same position. Wait, no, in 4-aminobenzoate, the benzoate ester is at position 1 and the amino group at position 4. So the benzene would have two substituents: at positions 1 (ester) and 4 (NH2). Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OEt-O-CO-C6H4-NH2, but that would require another oxygen. Wait, more accurately, the structure is OCO-OEt attached to the benzene, and NH2 in the para position.

But let's think about the given NMR.

The aromatic protons are at 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H), which suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Each substituent would have an effect on the chemical shift. For example, if there's an electron-withdrawing group (like ester) at position 1, and an electron-donating group (like NH2) at position 4, the ring would have two sets of doublets. The substituents would deactivate the ring, making the neighboring protons deshielded.

In the case of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (option D), the substituents are at positions 1 (ester) and 4 (NH2). The benzene would have protons in positions 2 and 6, which would be adjacent to the ester group, and positions 3 and 5, adjacent to the amino group. But wait, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the protons would be in two pairs of doublets. Let me sketch it out:

Positions:
1: ester (O-CO-OEt)
2: H
3: H
4: NH2
5: H
6: H

Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, actually, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be next to the ester, and positions 3 and 5 next to the amino group. But that would make four protons, but the NMR shows two doublets each of 2H. So maybe the substituents are at positions 1 and 3, but that's meta. No, wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 4, and the other substituent is part of the ester. Wait, maybe the ester is at position 4, and another substituent is at position 1. Or wait, maybe it's a single substituent which is a group that causes the aromatic protons to split into two doublets.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group that's itself para to another group. Wait, maybe it's a single substituent, but it's a para-substituted ring. For example, if the substituent is at position 4, but the ester is attached in such a way that the ring is para-substituted.

Alternatively, let's think about the substituent on the benzene. If the substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-OEt), which is a strong electron-withdrawing group, then the adjacent protons (ortho and para) would be deshielded. In the case of a para-substituted benzene with an ester group, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are a doublet at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let's think about how substituents affect chemical shifts. An electron-withdrawing group like an ester would cause the adjacent protons (ortho and para) to be deshielded, appearing downfield. So if the substituent is at position 1, the ortho protons (2 and 6) would be deshielded, and the para position (4) would have a proton (but that's not the case here because the substituent is at 1 and another at 4). Wait, in the NMR, there are four aromatic protons, so perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 3, making it a meta substitution, but that would lead to more complex splitting. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the benzene is para-substituted with two substituents, each of which has an effect on the adjacent protons. Let's say substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B is at position 4. Then the protons adjacent to substituent A (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear downfield. The protons adjacent to substituent B (positions 3 and 5) would be deshielded as well, but perhaps less so if substituent B is an electron-donating group.

Wait, substituent A is an ester group (like O-CO-OEt), which is electron-withdrawing. Substituent B is an amino group (NH2), which is electron-donating. So the protons next to the ester (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded (higher ppm), and those next to the amino group (positions 3 and 5) would be less deshielded, appearing at lower ppm.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. So perhaps the two protons next to the ester are at 8.0 ppm, and the two next to the amino are at 7.0 ppm. That would make sense. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (para to each other), making the protons at 2 and 6 (which are ortho to substituent A) appear as a doublet at 8.0 ppm, and protons at 3 and 5 (ortho to substituent B) as a doublet at 7.0 ppm.

So the structure would have an ester group at position 1 and an amino group at position 4. That matches option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, where the ester is at position 1 (as benzoate) and the amino group at position 4.

Wait, but ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have the structure O-CO-OEt attached to position 1, and NH2 attached to position 4. So the benzene would have substituents at 1 and 4, which are para to each other.

So looking back at the NMR, the aromatic protons would be at 7.0 (2H, d) and 8.0 (2H, d), which matches this scenario. The higher ppm (8.0) would be the protons ortho to the ester group, while the lower ppm (7.0) would be the protons ortho to the amino group.

Now, let's check the other parts of the NMR.

The 4.5 ppm quartet (q, 2H) is probably the OCH2 group from the ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) would be the CH3 attached to the CH2. That fits with the ethyl group.

The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) is a bit tricky. Broad singlet with 2H. In the case of an amide or an amine, the NH protons usually appear around 6-8 ppm as broad signals. But here it's at 4 ppm, which is more upfield. Could it be the NH2 from the amino group? Wait, in an amine, the NH2 protons are usually around 1-5 ppm, but they can vary. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group from something else.

Wait, in option D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the benzoate ester would have O-CO-OEt, and the amino group is NH2 attached to the benzene.

In the NMR, the amino group's protons would typically be broad, but in this case, the NH2 is on the benzene ring. But in the 1H NMR, the NH2 protons may not show up as a singlet if they're exchanging protons. Wait, but in the NMR given, there's a singlet at 4.0 ppm. Hmm, perhaps that's not the NH2.

Wait, another possibility: in the structure, the NH2 is part of the substituent, but perhaps it's not showing up in the NMR due to exchange broadening or if it's a secondary amine. Alternatively, maybe it's a different group.

Wait, looking at option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a propionate ester (like CH2CH2COO-) attached to the benzene, and an NH2 at position 4. The ester would be OCOCH2CH2CH3. The NMR would have the propyl group as triplet and quartet, but in the data, the ethyl group is present (1.20 triplet and 4.5 quartet), so that would fit with ethyl, not propyl. So option C is likely not correct.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-Ph-OEt. So the benzene has an OEt group at position 4 and the formamide group at position 1. The formamide would have an NH group. The ester group (OEt) is at position 4. The aromatic protons would be ortho and para to substituents.

In this case, the formamide's NH would appear as a broad peak. But in the NMR, there's a broad peak at 4.0 ppm (2H), which doesn't fit with an NH (which is usually higher ppm, around 8 for amides, but exchange can cause it to be broader and appear lower). Alternatively, maybe it's the OCH2 from the ethoxy group. Wait, no, the ethoxy group would be at position 4, so the OCH2 would be adjacent to the ring. The OCH2 in ethoxy would typically appear as a singlet around 4.0 ppm, but that's for the OCH2CH3. Wait, no, the OCH2 in ethoxy would be part of the CH2CH3 group. Let me think: the ethoxy group is OCH2CH3. The CH2 next to the O would be a quartet (coupled with the CH3), and the CH3 would be a triplet. So the OCH2 would appear as a quartet around 4.0-4.3 ppm, but in the given data, there's a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), which is more upfield than usual for an OCH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm singlet is the NH from the formamide. But that doesn't fit, as NH protons are usually around 6-8 ppm and broad.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3. So the substituents are at positions 3 (ethoxy) and 1 (CONH2). The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,4,5,6. But I'm not sure if that would give two doublets each integrating to 2H. The substituents are meta to each other, which might cause the protons to split in a certain way. But I'm not sure if that would result in two doublets. Also, the IR shows N-H stretches, which would be from the amide group.

Wait, benzamide would have an amide group (NH2 attached to the carbonyl), so the IR would show peaks from N-H stretches. The IR shows strong bands at 3420 and 3325, which would fit with amide N-H stretches. But in the NMR, the amide NH protons would appear as a broad peak, perhaps around 6-8 ppm. But in the given NMR, there's a singlet at 4.0 ppm, which doesn't seem to fit. Unless the NH is not in the NMR because it's exchanging and not showing up, but I think that's unlikely.

So perhaps the correct structure is option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let me check the NMR again.

The ethyl ester would have triplet at 1.20 (CH3) and quartet at 4.5 (OCH2). That's present.

The aromatic region: two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, which fits with the substituents at positions 1 and 4 (para). The NH2 group would be on the benzene, but in the NMR, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). Hmm, that doesn't align. Wait, the NH2 group is on the benzene, so its protons would be as a broad peak. But in the provided NMR, there's a singlet at 4.0 ppm, which I thought was NH2, but that would be around 4 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps it's another group.

Wait, maybe the singlet at 4.0 ppm is from a different part of the molecule. Let me think: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have an ester group (OEt) and an amino group (NH2). The amino group's protons are usually broad and might not appear in the NMR due to exchange, but if they're present, they'd appear around 1-5 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is from the OCH2 group, but in an ester, the OCH2 would be part of the ethyl group and would show as a quartet. So perhaps the singlet at 4.0 ppm is from something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the NH2 is not present, or perhaps it's a different structure. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me re-examine the options.

Looking at option D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would have the ester group at position 1 and amino at 4. The molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's calculate that. Benzoate ester is C7H5O2 (benzene ring with O-CO-OEt). The ethyl group is C2H5. But wait, the structure would be O-CO-OEt attached to benzene, plus an NH2 group. So the formula is C7 (from benzene, O, COOEt). Wait, let me count:

Benzoate: C7H5O2 (since benzene is C6H5, then O-CO-OEt adds 3 more carbons (O-CO-O-C2H5), but wait, that's C6 (benzene) + COOEt (3 carbons) → C9? Wait, no: COOEt is O-CO-O-C2H5, which adds 3 carbons. So benzene is 6 C, plus 3 from COOEt → 9 C. Wait, but the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's compute:

Benzoate ester: C6H5COOEt → C6 + 2 (from COO) + 2 (from Et) → C9. So that's 9 C. The amino group is NH2, so the formula would be C9H8NO3? Because the benzoate is C8H7O2 (C6H5COOEt is C6 + COO (2 O) + Et (2 C), but wait, the molecular formula of ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2. So ethyl benzoate is C6H5COOCH2CH3 → C9H10O2.

But in option D, it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the formula would be C9H11NO2.

Wait, let me compute: benzene (C6), COOEt (C3H5O2), and NH2 (C0H2N). So the total would be C6 + C3 = C9, H: (5 from benzene) + (5 from COOEt) + 2 from NH2 = 12. But that can't be right. Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, ethyl benzoate is C6H5COOEt → C9H10O2. But if we have ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure would be C6H4(NH2)COOEt. So the formula would be C9H11NO2. Because:

C6 (benzene) + COOEt (C3H5O2) + NH2 (adds 1 N, 2 H). Wait, the numbers: C6 + 2 (from COO) + 2 (from Et) = C10? No, wait, wait. COOEt is O-CO-O-C2H5. The COO adds 2 O and 2 C (from COO), but the Et is C2H5. So the entire group is O-CO-O-C2H5, which is 3 C (COO has two O and two C from COO?), wait I'm getting a bit confused. Let me count:

Each group:

Benzoate ester: C6H5COOCH2CH3 → C6 (benzene) + COO (2 C) + CH2CH3 (2 C) → 6+2+2=10 C. But wait, that's C9H10O2, right? Because the formula is C9H10O2.

But in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure is C6H4(NH2)COOEt. So the benzene has two substituents: NH2 and COOEt. So the formula would be C9H11NO2.

Because:

C6 (benzene) + C (from COOEt) → C6 + C (from COOEt) is 7? Wait, no. Wait, COOEt is O-CO-O-CH2CH3. So that's 3 carbons (COO is 2 C, CH2CH3 is 2 C?), no, wait, COO has two O and two C. So the COO group is O-C-O, so the carbonyl is one C, the oxygen, and the ester oxygen. So the COOEt group has three carbons: the carbonyl C, the O, and the ethyl group's two C. So COOEt is 3 C. So the benzene (6 C) + COOEt (3 C) = 9 C. The NH2 contributes N and 2 H.

Hydrogen count: Benzene has 5 H (since two substituents, NH2 and COOEt, are para, so 4 H in total?), wait no. Let me think: benzene has 6 H, but with substituents at positions 1 and 4, that's two substituents, so four H remain, in positions 2,3,5,6. But for the formula, it's better to count all H.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me compute: C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2.

Ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2. Adding an amino group (-NH2) would add one N and two H, making it C9H12N O2. But that's not matching. Wait, maybe the substituent is not adding H.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the structure as:

The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4. Position 1: COOCH2CH3 (ester group, which is O-CO-O-Et). Position 4: NH2. So the benzene has 4 substituents? No, wait, two substituents. So the formula would be C6 (benzene) + COOEt (3 C, 5 H) + NH2 (1 N, 2 H). So:

C: 6 + 3 = 9 → correct.

H: Benzene has 4 H (since two substituents, each in para positions, so four H left: 2 in positions 2 and 6, and 2 in 3 and 5). Then the ester group (COOEt) has 5 H (the ethyl group has 5 H: CH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H). Wait, no, the ethyl group is OCH2CH3, which has 2 H on the OCH2 and 3 H on CH3. So the ethyl group contributes 5 H. Then the NH2 has 2 H. So total H: 4 (benzene) + 5 (ethyl) + 2 (NH2) = 11 H. That matches the formula.

So the molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which matches the given data.

Now, looking back at the NMR. The 4.0 ppm singlet (2H) is a bit puzzling, as I thought it was the NH2 group, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's an OCH2 group from something else, but in this structure, the OCH2 is part of the ethyl ester group and would appear as a quartet at 4.5 ppm. So where does the 4.0 ppm peak come from?

Wait, the NH2 group is attached to the benzene. The NH2 protons are usually broad and may not show up as a singlet at 4 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is from another group.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from the NH2 group. But NH2 in amines typically appears around 1-5 ppm as a broad peak. If it's a secondary amine, it's around 3-5 ppm, but in this case, it's a primary amine attached to the benzene. So the NH2 would typically show up as a broad peak, perhaps around 1-5 ppm, but it's not clear. However, in the NMR data, there's a singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), which might not fit with NH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not from the amino group but something else. Maybe it's the OCH2 group from another substituent, but I don't see another substituent in option D.

Wait, perhaps the singlet at 4.0 is from another part of the molecule. Maybe it's an OCH2 group from a different substituent, but in option D, the substituents are COOEt and NH2. So that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again about the options.

Looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-Ph-OEt. So the substituents are formamide (HCONH-) at position 1 and ethoxy at position 4. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Would that give two doublets? Probably not, since the substituents are para.

The formamide's NH would have a peak around 8 ppm, but in the data, the NMR shows a singlet at 4.0 ppm, which doesn't fit.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is CONH2 attached at position 1 and OEt at position 3. The substituents are meta, so the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,4,5,6. Their shifts would depend on the substituents. But would this give two doublets? Maybe not, because the substituents are meta, leading to more complex splitting.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons for option A would be more split, perhaps into triplets or more complex multiplets, depending on the substituents. But the given data shows two doublets, each integrating 2H, suggesting a para-substituted benzene.

So the best fit for the aromatic region is option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which has substituents para to each other, leading to two doublets. 

Now, the 4.0 ppm singlet. Hmm. Maybe it's the NH2 group, but why is it a singlet? Because the two protons are equivalent and not split, perhaps because they're in a symmetric environment. But NH2 protons are usually broad and might not show up as a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from another group.

Wait, perhaps the singlet at 4.0 ppm is from the OCH2 group in a different context, but in option D, the OCH2 is part of the ethyl ester and appears as a quartet at 4.5 ppm. So maybe the 4.0 ppm is not part of the ester but another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is from an NH group. But in option D, the amino group is NH2, which would have two protons. But in the NMR, it's a singlet of 2H. That could fit, but why would the NH2 appear at 4.0 ppm? That's lower than typical for NH2 in amines, which are usually around 1-5 ppm. But perhaps in this case, the NH2 is de-shielded or in a specific environment.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is from the ethyl group's CH2, but that's part of the quartet at 4.5 ppm.

Wait, maybe the singlet is from a different group, like a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, but I don't see such a group in option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from another substituent, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: looking at the integration. The triplet is 3H (CH3), quartet 2H (OCH2), and singlet 2H (unknown). The aromatic protons are 4H (two doublets, 2H each). So the structure must have an ethyl group (from triplet and quartet) and an NH2 group (from IR and possible NMR).

Putting it all together, option D seems to fit the molecular formula, IR, and NMR data except for the 4.0 ppm peak. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is from the amino group's NH2, but that's a stretch because NH2 protons are usually more upfield or downfield depending on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from an OCH2 group, but that's part of the ester and should be a quartet.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the singlet at 4.0 ppm is from a methyl group adjacent to something else. But I don't see that in the options.

Wait, looking at option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would be NH2-C6H4-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C10H13NO3, which doesn't match the given formula (C9H11NO2). So option C is out.

So, given the data, option D seems the best fit despite the confusion regarding the 4.0 ppm peak. Perhaps that peak is from the NH2 group, but more likely, it's from another part of the molecule that I'm not considering. Alternatively, maybe it's an impurity or an error, but in the context of the options, D seems the best fit.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound has the molecular formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂**, which corresponds to **five degrees of unsaturation**. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional unsaturation, likely from a carbonyl group. The IR spectrum shows strong absorption bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**, indicative of N-H stretches, and a strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹**, consistent with a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide. The NMR data provides further clues:

- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating for 3H, characteristic of a CH₃ group in an ethyl group.
- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating for 2H, possibly from an NH₂ group or another environment.
- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating for 2H, typical of the CH₂ group in an ethyl ester.
- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating for 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.

### Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- Structure: Benzamide (CONH₂) with an ethoxy group at position 3.
- The substituents are meta to each other, which would result in more complex splitting of the aromatic protons, inconsistent with the observed two doublets (each integrating for 2H). 
- The IR and NMR data do not strongly support this structure.

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- Structure: Formamide (HCONH₂) with an ethoxy group at position 4.
- The substituents are para to each other, which could produce two doublets for the aromatic protons. However, the formamide NH would typically appear as a broad peak around 8 ppm, which is not observed in the NMR data. Additionally, the ethoxy group would produce a quartet for the CH₂ group, but the NMR shows a singlet at 4.0 ppm, making this option unlikely.

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- Structure: Propionate ester (CH₃CH₂COO-) attached to a benzene ring with an NH₂ group at position 4.
- The molecular formula of this compound would be **C₁₀H₁₃NO₃**, which does not match the given formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂**. This option is eliminated.

#### **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- Structure: Ethyl ester (COOCH₂CH₃) attached to a benzene ring with an NH₂ group at position 4.
- The substituents are para to each other, which explains the two doublets in the aromatic region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm). The ethyl group accounts for the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm could correspond to the NH₂ group, which is often broad and may appear at lower ppm due to exchange effects.
- The molecular formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂** matches this structure, and the IR and NMR data are consistent with this option.

### Conclusion:
The compound is best identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let's see what the data says.

The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X here is halogens, but since the formula doesn't have any, I'll ignore that. So, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2.

So plugging in: (2*9 + 2 - 11 + 1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That's probably a benzene ring (3 from the ring) plus a double bond or something else, maybe an amide or ester group which would contribute another one or two.

Looking at the IR data: Strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches, but maybe O-H? Or maybe they're from amide NH or from an amino group. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Ester carbonyls are around 1720-1740, amides are a bit lower, like 1650-1700. So maybe it's an ester or a ketone? But since there's a carbonyl, and the formula includes an O, ester is a possibility.

Next, the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm triplet (t, 3H). That's likely a methyl group attached to an oxygen, maybe an OCH2CH3 group. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so perhaps it's a CH2 connected to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group. So maybe an ethyl ester.

4.0 ppm broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad singlet with 2H. Could that be an NH2 group? But wait, the IR shows N-H stretches, but if it's a broad peak around 4 ppm, maybe it's an amine adjacent to something else. Wait, but in an amide, the NH is usually around 6-8 ppm. Wait, no, 4 ppm is lower. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group. Or perhaps some other environment. Hmm.

4.5 ppm quartet (q, 2H). Quartet with 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with a neighboring CH2 with two protons. So maybe a CH2CH2 group. Like in an ethyl ester. For example, in ethyl groups, the CH2 next to the oxygen would appear as a quartet. So maybe the 4.5 is the OCH2 in an ethyl ester. Because in ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 splits into a quartet for the OCH2 and triplet for the CH3.

Wait, in the NMR, the triplet is at 1.20 (3H), and the quartet is at 4.5 (2H). That's classic for an ethyl group, where the CH3 is a triplet (coupling with the adjacent CH2), and the CH2 is a quartet.

So perhaps there's an ethyl ester group here. So if the compound is an ester, the structure would be R-O-CO-Ar, where Ar is an aromatic ring.

Looking at the aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Those are two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So that suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents. Wait, but two doublets, each 2H, probably in a para-disubstituted benzene, like p-substituted. Because in para substitution, the two protons on each adjacent carbon are equivalent and split into a doublet. So maybe the substituents are at para positions, and the adjacent Hs are each a doublet.

Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions, the aromatic protons would be as two doublets. Or wait, maybe it's a single substituent that's activating, causing the ring to have two sets of doublets. Wait, no, perhaps it's a disubstituted benzene in the para position. So for example, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 3 (but that's meta), or 1 and 4 (para to each other). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

In a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if it's a single substituent, like in para-methyl benzoate, you'd have two sets of doublets for the aromatic protons. Let me think: for example, if the substituent is at position 4 (para), the aromatic protons would be at positions 2 and 6, each as a doublet. So that fits with the NMR: 7.0 and 8.0 ppm as doublets, each integrating to 2H. So the substituent is at position 4, perhaps.

Wait, but the substituent in the ester would be on the benzene ring. So the ester oxygen would be connected to the benzene. So if the substituent is an ester group (O-CO-OEt?), wait no, that's not right. Let me correct. An ester group is R-O-CO-Ar. Wait, no, the ester is Ar-O-CO-R. Wait, no, the ester is RCOOR', where R is the aryl group. Oh wait, no. Wait, in an ester, the structure is R-O-CO-R', where R is the alkoxy group and R' is the acyl group. So if the benzene is connected to the ester, it would be R-O-CO-Ar where Ar is the benzene ring. So the substituent on the benzene would be an ester group.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide is CONH2 attached to benzene, but if it's substituted, perhaps it's OEt in the meta position. But then the NMR would have different features. Hmm.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide is HCONH2, with the NH2 attached to the 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the structure would be HCO-NH-Ph-OEt, with Ph being the benzene. So the benzene would have an OEt group at position 4 and the formamide NH at position 1? Or maybe it's the substituents in para positions.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate would be CH2CH2COO-, attached to the benzene. So if the benzene has an NH2 group at position 4 and a propionate ester group, but wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate that. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-, so the ester would be OCOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, but the compound would be 4-aminophenyl propionate: structure is NH2-C6H4-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that would be longer. Let me count: benzene (6 C), NH2 (1 N, 2 H), COO (2 O), and then the propyl group (3 C). So molecular formula would be C9H11NO3? Because benzene (6 C), COO (2 O from ester), and propyl (3 C) → total C9. O: 3 (from COO and the ester O) but wait, the formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated. Alternatively, maybe it's a propionate ester without the propyl, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different structure.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O-CO-OEt attached to the benzene at position 4, and an NH2 group at position 1, perhaps. Wait, no, in 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group would be at position 4 and the ester at position 1. Wait, benzene can't have two substituents in the same position. Wait, no, in 4-aminobenzoate, the benzoate ester is at position 1 and the amino group at position 4. So the benzene would have two substituents: at positions 1 (ester) and 4 (NH2). Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OEt-O-CO-C6H4-NH2, but that would require another oxygen. Wait, more accurately, the structure is OCO-OEt attached to the benzene, and NH2 in the para position.

But let's think about the given NMR.

The aromatic protons are at 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H), which suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Each substituent would have an effect on the chemical shift. For example, if there's an electron-withdrawing group (like ester) at position 1, and an electron-donating group (like NH2) at position 4, the ring would have two sets of doublets. The substituents would deactivate the ring, making the neighboring protons deshielded.

In the case of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (option D), the substituents are at positions 1 (ester) and 4 (NH2). The benzene would have protons in positions 2 and 6, which would be adjacent to the ester group, and positions 3 and 5, adjacent to the amino group. But wait, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the protons would be in two pairs of doublets. Let me sketch it out:

Positions:
1: ester (O-CO-OEt)
2: H
3: H
4: NH2
5: H
6: H

Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, actually, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be next to the ester, and positions 3 and 5 next to the amino group. But that would make four protons, but the NMR shows two doublets each of 2H. So maybe the substituents are at positions 1 and 3, but that's meta. No, wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 4, and the other substituent is part of the ester. Wait, maybe the ester is at position 4, and another substituent is at position 1. Or wait, maybe it's a single substituent which is a group that causes the aromatic protons to split into two doublets.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group that's itself para to another group. Wait, maybe it's a single substituent, but it's a para-substituted ring. For example, if the substituent is at position 4, but the ester is attached in such a way that the ring is para-substituted.

Alternatively, let's think about the substituent on the benzene. If the substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-OEt), which is a strong electron-withdrawing group, then the adjacent protons (ortho and para) would be deshielded. In the case of a para-substituted benzene with an ester group, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are a doublet at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let's think about how substituents affect chemical shifts. An electron-withdrawing group like an ester would cause the adjacent protons (ortho and para) to be deshielded, appearing downfield. So if the substituent is at position 1, the ortho protons (2 and 6) would be deshielded, and the para position (4) would have a proton (but that's not the case here because the substituent is at 1 and another at 4). Wait, in the NMR, there are four aromatic protons, so perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 3, making it a meta substitution, but that would lead to more complex splitting. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the benzene is para-substituted with two substituents, each of which has an effect on the adjacent protons. Let's say substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B is at position 4. Then the protons adjacent to substituent A (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear downfield. The protons adjacent to substituent B (positions 3 and 5) would be deshielded as well, but perhaps less so if substituent B is an electron-donating group.

Wait, substituent A is an ester group (like O-CO-OEt), which is electron-withdrawing. Substituent B is an amino group (NH2), which is electron-donating. So the protons next to the ester (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded (higher ppm), and those next to the amino group (positions 3 and 5) would be less deshielded, appearing at lower ppm.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. So perhaps the two protons next to the ester are at 8.0 ppm, and the two next to the amino are at 7.0 ppm. That would make sense. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (para to each other), making the protons at 2 and 6 (which are ortho to substituent A) appear as a doublet at 8.0 ppm, and protons at 3 and 5 (ortho to substituent B) as a doublet at 7.0 ppm.

So the structure would have an ester group at position 1 and an amino group at position 4. That matches option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, where the ester is at position 1 (as benzoate) and the amino group at position 4.

Wait, but ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have the structure O-CO-OEt attached to position 1, and NH2 attached to position 4. So the benzene would have substituents at 1 and 4, which are para to each other.

So looking back at the NMR, the aromatic protons would be at 7.0 (2H, d) and 8.0 (2H, d), which matches this scenario. The higher ppm (8.0) would be the protons ortho to the ester group, while the lower ppm (7.0) would be the protons ortho to the amino group.

Now, let's check the other parts of the NMR.

The 4.5 ppm quartet (q, 2H) is probably the OCH2 group from the ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) would be the CH3 attached to the CH2. That fits with the ethyl group.

The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) is a bit tricky. Broad singlet with 2H. In the case of an amide or an amine, the NH protons usually appear around 6-8 ppm as broad signals. But here it's at 4 ppm, which is more upfield. Could it be the NH2 from the amino group? Wait, in an amine, the NH2 protons are usually around 1-5 ppm, but they can vary. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group from something else.

Wait, in option D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the benzoate ester would have O-CO-OEt, and the amino group is NH2 attached to the benzene.

In the NMR, the amino group's protons would typically be broad, but in this case, the NH2 is on the benzene ring. But in the 1H NMR, the NH2 protons may not show up as a singlet if they're exchanging protons. Wait, but in the NMR given, there's a singlet at 4.0 ppm. Hmm, perhaps that's not the NH2.

Wait, another possibility: in the structure, the NH2 is part of the substituent, but perhaps it's not showing up in the NMR due to exchange broadening or if it's a secondary amine. Alternatively, maybe it's a different group.

Wait, looking at option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a propionate ester (like CH2CH2COO-) attached to the benzene, and an NH2 at position 4. The ester would be OCOCH2CH2CH3. The NMR would have the propyl group as triplet and quartet, but in the data, the ethyl group is present (1.20 triplet and 4.5 quartet), so that would fit with ethyl, not propyl. So option C is likely not correct.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-Ph-OEt. So the benzene has an OEt group at position 4 and the formamide group at position 1. The formamide would have an NH group. The ester group (OEt) is at position 4. The aromatic protons would be ortho and para to substituents.

In this case, the formamide's NH would appear as a broad peak. But in the NMR, there's a broad peak at 4.0 ppm (2H), which doesn't fit with an NH (which is usually higher ppm, around 8 for amides, but exchange can cause it to be broader and appear lower). Alternatively, maybe it's the OCH2 from the ethoxy group. Wait, no, the ethoxy group would be at position 4, so the OCH2 would be adjacent to the ring. The OCH2 in ethoxy would typically appear as a singlet around 4.0 ppm, but that's for the OCH2CH3. Wait, no, the OCH2 in ethoxy would be part of the CH2CH3 group. Let me think: the ethoxy group is OCH2CH3. The CH2 next to the O would be a quartet (coupled with the CH3), and the CH3 would be a triplet. So the OCH2 would appear as a quartet around 4.0-4.3 ppm, but in the given data, there's a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), which is more upfield than usual for an OCH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm singlet is the NH from the formamide. But that doesn't fit, as NH protons are usually around 6-8 ppm and broad.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3. So the substituents are at positions 3 (ethoxy) and 1 (CONH2). The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,4,5,6. But I'm not sure if that would give two doublets each integrating to 2H. The substituents are meta to each other, which might cause the protons to split in a certain way. But I'm not sure if that would result in two doublets. Also, the IR shows N-H stretches, which would be from the amide group.

Wait, benzamide would have an amide group (NH2 attached to the carbonyl), so the IR would show peaks from N-H stretches. The IR shows strong bands at 3420 and 3325, which would fit with amide N-H stretches. But in the NMR, the amide NH protons would appear as a broad peak, perhaps around 6-8 ppm. But in the given NMR, there's a singlet at 4.0 ppm, which doesn't seem to fit. Unless the NH is not in the NMR because it's exchanging and not showing up, but I think that's unlikely.

So perhaps the correct structure is option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let me check the NMR again.

The ethyl ester would have triplet at 1.20 (CH3) and quartet at 4.5 (OCH2). That's present.

The aromatic region: two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, which fits with the substituents at positions 1 and 4 (para). The NH2 group would be on the benzene, but in the NMR, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). Hmm, that doesn't align. Wait, the NH2 group is on the benzene, so its protons would be as a broad peak. But in the provided NMR, there's a singlet at 4.0 ppm, which I thought was NH2, but that would be around 4 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps it's another group.

Wait, maybe the singlet at 4.0 ppm is from a different part of the molecule. Let me think: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have an ester group (OEt) and an amino group (NH2). The amino group's protons are usually broad and might not appear in the NMR due to exchange, but if they're present, they'd appear around 1-5 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is from the OCH2 group, but in an ester, the OCH2 would be part of the ethyl group and would show as a quartet. So perhaps the singlet at 4.0 ppm is from something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the NH2 is not present, or perhaps it's a different structure. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me re-examine the options.

Looking at option D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would have the ester group at position 1 and amino at 4. The molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's calculate that. Benzoate ester is C7H5O2 (benzene ring with O-CO-OEt). The ethyl group is C2H5. But wait, the structure would be O-CO-OEt attached to benzene, plus an NH2 group. So the formula is C7 (from benzene, O, COOEt). Wait, let me count:

Benzoate: C7H5O2 (since benzene is C6H5, then O-CO-OEt adds 3 more carbons (O-CO-O-C2H5), but wait, that's C6 (benzene) + COOEt (3 carbons) → C9? Wait, no: COOEt is O-CO-O-C2H5, which adds 3 carbons. So benzene is 6 C, plus 3 from COOEt → 9 C. Wait, but the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's compute:

Benzoate ester: C6H5COOEt → C6 + 2 (from COO) + 2 (from Et) → C9. So that's 9 C. The amino group is NH2, so the formula would be C9H8NO3? Because the benzoate is C8H7O2 (C6H5COOEt is C6 + COO (2 O) + Et (2 C), but wait, the molecular formula of ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2. So ethyl benzoate is C6H5COOCH2CH3 → C9H10O2.

But in option D, it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the formula would be C9H11NO2.

Wait, let me compute: benzene (C6), COOEt (C3H5O2), and NH2 (C0H2N). So the total would be C6 + C3 = C9, H: (5 from benzene) + (5 from COOEt) + 2 from NH2 = 12. But that can't be right. Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, ethyl benzoate is C6H5COOEt → C9H10O2. But if we have ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure would be C6H4(NH2)COOEt. So the formula would be C9H11NO2. Because:

C6 (benzene) + COOEt (C3H5O2) + NH2 (adds 1 N, 2 H). Wait, the numbers: C6 + 2 (from COO) + 2 (from Et) = C10? No, wait, wait. COOEt is O-CO-O-C2H5. The COO adds 2 O and 2 C (from COO), but the Et is C2H5. So the entire group is O-CO-O-C2H5, which is 3 C (COO has two O and two C from COO?), wait I'm getting a bit confused. Let me count:

Each group:

Benzoate ester: C6H5COOCH2CH3 → C6 (benzene) + COO (2 C) + CH2CH3 (2 C) → 6+2+2=10 C. But wait, that's C9H10O2, right? Because the formula is C9H10O2.

But in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure is C6H4(NH2)COOEt. So the benzene has two substituents: NH2 and COOEt. So the formula would be C9H11NO2.

Because:

C6 (benzene) + C (from COOEt) → C6 + C (from COOEt) is 7? Wait, no. Wait, COOEt is O-CO-O-CH2CH3. So that's 3 carbons (COO is 2 C, CH2CH3 is 2 C?), no, wait, COO has two O and two C. So the COO group is O-C-O, so the carbonyl is one C, the oxygen, and the ester oxygen. So the COOEt group has three carbons: the carbonyl C, the O, and the ethyl group's two C. So COOEt is 3 C. So the benzene (6 C) + COOEt (3 C) = 9 C. The NH2 contributes N and 2 H.

Hydrogen count: Benzene has 5 H (since two substituents, NH2 and COOEt, are para, so 4 H in total?), wait no. Let me think: benzene has 6 H, but with substituents at positions 1 and 4, that's two substituents, so four H remain, in positions 2,3,5,6. But for the formula, it's better to count all H.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me compute: C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2.

Ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2. Adding an amino group (-NH2) would add one N and two H, making it C9H12N O2. But that's not matching. Wait, maybe the substituent is not adding H.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the structure as:

The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4. Position 1: COOCH2CH3 (ester group, which is O-CO-O-Et). Position 4: NH2. So the benzene has 4 substituents? No, wait, two substituents. So the formula would be C6 (benzene) + COOEt (3 C, 5 H) + NH2 (1 N, 2 H). So:

C: 6 + 3 = 9 → correct.

H: Benzene has 4 H (since two substituents, each in para positions, so four H left: 2 in positions 2 and 6, and 2 in 3 and 5). Then the ester group (COOEt) has 5 H (the ethyl group has 5 H: CH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H). Wait, no, the ethyl group is OCH2CH3, which has 2 H on the OCH2 and 3 H on CH3. So the ethyl group contributes 5 H. Then the NH2 has 2 H. So total H: 4 (benzene) + 5 (ethyl) + 2 (NH2) = 11 H. That matches the formula.

So the molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which matches the given data.

Now, looking back at the NMR. The 4.0 ppm singlet (2H) is a bit puzzling, as I thought it was the NH2 group, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's an OCH2 group from something else, but in this structure, the OCH2 is part of the ethyl ester group and would appear as a quartet at 4.5 ppm. So where does the 4.0 ppm peak come from?

Wait, the NH2 group is attached to the benzene. The NH2 protons are usually broad and may not show up as a singlet at 4 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is from another group.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from the NH2 group. But NH2 in amines typically appears around 1-5 ppm as a broad peak. If it's a secondary amine, it's around 3-5 ppm, but in this case, it's a primary amine attached to the benzene. So the NH2 would typically show up as a broad peak, perhaps around 1-5 ppm, but it's not clear. However, in the NMR data, there's a singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), which might not fit with NH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not from the amino group but something else. Maybe it's the OCH2 group from another substituent, but I don't see another substituent in option D.

Wait, perhaps the singlet at 4.0 is from another part of the molecule. Maybe it's an OCH2 group from a different substituent, but in option D, the substituents are COOEt and NH2. So that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again about the options.

Looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-Ph-OEt. So the substituents are formamide (HCONH-) at position 1 and ethoxy at position 4. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Would that give two doublets? Probably not, since the substituents are para.

The formamide's NH would have a peak around 8 ppm, but in the data, the NMR shows a singlet at 4.0 ppm, which doesn't fit.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is CONH2 attached at position 1 and OEt at position 3. The substituents are meta, so the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,4,5,6. Their shifts would depend on the substituents. But would this give two doublets? Maybe not, because the substituents are meta, leading to more complex splitting.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons for option A would be more split, perhaps into triplets or more complex multiplets, depending on the substituents. But the given data shows two doublets, each integrating 2H, suggesting a para-substituted benzene.

So the best fit for the aromatic region is option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which has substituents para to each other, leading to two doublets. 

Now, the 4.0 ppm singlet. Hmm. Maybe it's the NH2 group, but why is it a singlet? Because the two protons are equivalent and not split, perhaps because they're in a symmetric environment. But NH2 protons are usually broad and might not show up as a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from another group.

Wait, perhaps the singlet at 4.0 ppm is from the OCH2 group in a different context, but in option D, the OCH2 is part of the ethyl ester and appears as a quartet at 4.5 ppm. So maybe the 4.0 ppm is not part of the ester but another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is from an NH group. But in option D, the amino group is NH2, which would have two protons. But in the NMR, it's a singlet of 2H. That could fit, but why would the NH2 appear at 4.0 ppm? That's lower than typical for NH2 in amines, which are usually around 1-5 ppm. But perhaps in this case, the NH2 is de-shielded or in a specific environment.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is from the ethyl group's CH2, but that's part of the quartet at 4.5 ppm.

Wait, maybe the singlet is from a different group, like a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, but I don't see such a group in option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from another substituent, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: looking at the integration. The triplet is 3H (CH3), quartet 2H (OCH2), and singlet 2H (unknown). The aromatic protons are 4H (two doublets, 2H each). So the structure must have an ethyl group (from triplet and quartet) and an NH2 group (from IR and possible NMR).

Putting it all together, option D seems to fit the molecular formula, IR, and NMR data except for the 4.0 ppm peak. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is from the amino group's NH2, but that's a stretch because NH2 protons are usually more upfield or downfield depending on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from an OCH2 group, but that's part of the ester and should be a quartet.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the singlet at 4.0 ppm is from a methyl group adjacent to something else. But I don't see that in the options.

Wait, looking at option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would be NH2-C6H4-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C10H13NO3, which doesn't match the given formula (C9H11NO2). So option C is out.

So, given the data, option D seems the best fit despite the confusion regarding the 4.0 ppm peak. Perhaps that peak is from the NH2 group, but more likely, it's from another part of the molecule that I'm not considering. Alternatively, maybe it's an impurity or an error, but in the context of the options, D seems the best fit.


The compound has the molecular formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂**, which corresponds to **five degrees of unsaturation**. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional unsaturation, likely from a carbonyl group. The IR spectrum shows strong absorption bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**, indicative of N-H stretches, and a strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹**, consistent with a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide. The NMR data provides further clues:

- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating for 3H, characteristic of a CH₃ group in an ethyl group.
- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating for 2H, possibly from an NH₂ group or another environment.
- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating for 2H, typical of the CH₂ group in an ethyl ester.
- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating for 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.

### Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- Structure: Benzamide (CONH₂) with an ethoxy group at position 3.
- The substituents are meta to each other, which would result in more complex splitting of the aromatic protons, inconsistent with the observed two doublets (each integrating for 2H). 
- The IR and NMR data do not strongly support this structure.

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- Structure: Formamide (HCONH₂) with an ethoxy group at position 4.
- The substituents are para to each other, which could produce two doublets for the aromatic protons. However, the formamide NH would typically appear as a broad peak around 8 ppm, which is not observed in the NMR data. Additionally, the ethoxy group would produce a quartet for the CH₂ group, but the NMR shows a singlet at 4.0 ppm, making this option unlikely.

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- Structure: Propionate ester (CH₃CH₂COO-) attached to a benzene ring with an NH₂ group at position 4.
- The molecular formula of this compound would be **C₁₀H₁₃NO₃**, which does not match the given formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂**. This option is eliminated.

#### **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- Structure: Ethyl ester (COOCH₂CH₃) attached to a benzene ring with an NH₂ group at position 4.
- The substituents are para to each other, which explains the two doublets in the aromatic region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm). The ethyl group accounts for the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm could correspond to the NH₂ group, which is often broad and may appear at lower ppm due to exchange effects.
- The molecular formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂** matches this structure, and the IR and NMR data are consistent with this option.

### Conclusion:
The compound is best identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.
