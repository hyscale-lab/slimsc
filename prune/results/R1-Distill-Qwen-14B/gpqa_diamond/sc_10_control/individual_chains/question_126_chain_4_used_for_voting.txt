Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of peaks observed in two different HPLC chromatograms after some reactions. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, the problem describes two reactions (Reaction I and II) performed by an organic chemist. The products are then combined and run on two HPLC columns: one normal-phase and another chiral. I need to determine the number of peaks in each case.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH (which I think is Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, right? It's typically used to reduce carbonyl groups. So, hexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. When reduced, the ketone (C=O) becomes a CH2OH group? Wait, no, wait. LAH would reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one (which is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3) would become (CH2)2CH(OH)(CH2)3CH3? Wait, no, wait, the structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one is as follows:

The carbon chain is CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one would be CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, the compound here is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is: CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3 on the fifth carbon? Wait, no, let me get the structure right.

Hexan-3-one has carbonyl at position 3. So the structure is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. But wait, let me count. Carbon 1: CH2-, carbon 2: CH2-, carbon 3: C=O, carbon 4: CH2, carbon 5: CH2, carbon 6: CH3. So, the structure is more like CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. So, in 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the fifth carbon (from the CO) would be a methoxy group. Wait, so it's:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: OCH3
Wait, no, wait. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2C(O)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, the structure would be:

1: CH2CH2CO... no, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3? Let me draw it:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6

So, for 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the structure is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2? Wait, no, because hexan-3-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. So, the 5th carbon is CH2, but if it's 5-methoxy, then the 5th carbon has a methoxy group. So the structure is:

CH2CH2C(O)CH2-OCH3

Wait, but hexan-3-one has 6 carbons. Let me count:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: OCH3 (so that's a substituent on carbon 5)

Wait, that makes the structure: CH2CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? No, because that would be seven carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, hexan-3-one is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: OCH3 (so that's on the 5th carbon)

But wait, that would be only 6 carbons in total.

So, the structure is: CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? Wait, that's 7 carbons. Maybe I'm not getting it right. Let me think differently.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. So, 6 carbons in total. If the 5th carbon has a methoxy group, then the structure is CH2CH2C(O)CH2-OCH3 attached where? Wait, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2)2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3?

No, that would imply that carbon 4 has the OCH3. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2C(O)CH2-OCH2CH3? No, wait, that can't be right. Maybe it's:

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which is:

Positions 1 2 3 4 5 6:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: OCH3

6: CH3?

Wait, but that would make the 5th carbon a CH2-OCH3. No, perhaps I should think of the molecule as:

(CH2)2-C(O)-CH(CH2-OCH3)-CH2?

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's move forward. The important thing is that this compound is a ketone, and when treated with LAH, the ketone group (C=O) is reduced to an alcohol (CH2OH?), but wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent and reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.

Wait, no. LAH would reduce the ketone (C=O) to CH2OH? No, wait, no. LAH reduces carbonyl groups. For a ketone, R2CO, it would become R2CH-OH after acidic workup? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, when LAH is used to reduce a ketone, the product is a secondary alcohol. For example, R2CO → R2CH-OH. So, in this case, the ketone at position 3 would become a secondary alcohol.

So, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. After reduction with LAH and acidic workup, the ketone becomes an alcohol. So, the product of Reaction I would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait—what about the stereochemistry? Because the starting material is (S) configuration, but when the ketone is reduced, the alcohol will have the opposite configuration because of the inversion. Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically leads to a racemic mixture because it's an Sn2 mechanism? Or does it proceed through a different mechanism?

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically provides high stereoselectivity in the reduction of ketones. Wait, no, actually, the reduction of ketones with LAH typically proceeds through a two-step mechanism. The hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon in an Sn2-like fashion, which would invert the configuration. But wait, the starting ketone is (S) configuration at C5? Or is the configuration at C3?

Wait, maybe I should clarify the structure. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the ketone is at C3. The 5th carbon has a methoxy group. So, the configuration (S) would be at which carbon? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the (S) designation is at the 5th carbon, where the methoxy group is.

Wait, but the configuration (S) would be at the 5th carbon, which is a stereogenic center. So, the starting material has a stereogenic center at C5 (with the OCH3 group). When LAH reduces the ketone at C3, the product would be an alcohol at C3, but what about the configuration?

Wait, the ketone at C3 is (R) or (S)? Well, the starting material is (S) at C5. So, the ketone is at C3, which is a carbonyl, so not a stereocenter. Upon reduction, the C3 becomes a CH-OH group, which is a stereocenter. Because the ketone is planar, the addition of hydride (from LAH) can occur from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. Wait, no, LAH is a strong reducing agent, and in such reductions, the hydride attacks from the less hindered side, but without any existing stereocenter, the product would be a racemic mixture. However, since the starting material is enantioenriched (S configuration at C5), perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't affect the configuration at C5. The reduction of C3 (the ketone) would create a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material is (S) at C5, the configuration at C3 would be determined by the reduction. But wait, LAH is a strong enough reducing agent that it can lead to complete reduction, but I think the reduction of ketones with LAH typically gives a racemic mixture because there's no existing stereocenter to influence the attack. Wait, no, wait, in the case of a cyclic ketone, perhaps, but for a straight-chain ketone, the addition would be from either face, so leading to a racemic mixture.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is chiral at C5. Does that influence the reduction at C3? I don't think so because the two carbons (C3 and C5) are distinct and not directly connected. So the reduction at C3 would create a new stereocenter, and since it's a ketone without any existing stereogenic influence, the product would be a racemic mixture. So, after the reaction, we would get two enantiomers from the reduction at C3, but the C5 remains as it was.

Wait, no, the starting material is a single enantiomer at C5. When the ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol, the configuration at C3 would form a new stereocenter. Since the reduction is a two-step process with hydride and then protonation, the attack of the hydride could be either from the top or bottom face. So, if the starting material is a single enantiomer at C5, but the C3 is a planar sp2 center, then the reduction would lead to a 50:50 mixture of the two possible stereoisomers at C3. But wait, the original compound (the starting material) is a single enantiomer, so when you reduce C3, the product would have two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

So, the product of Reaction I would have two stereocenters: C3 and C5. The configuration at C3 would be a racemic mixture, while C5 remains as S. So, that would lead to two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers. But since the reaction is 100% complete, all the starting material is consumed, so the products would be 50% each of the two possible stereoisomers at C3, combined with the original configuration at C5.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The starting material: (S) at C5. Then, upon reduction, the C3 becomes a new stereocenter. So for each molecule, after reduction, we have two possible configurations at C3: R and S. So, each would have a new stereocenter. So, the product would have two stereocenters: C3 and C5. And each product from the reduction would have C5 as S, and C3 as R or S.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer. So, when the ketone is reduced, each molecule could form two possible diastereomers, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would be a racemic mixture for the C3 configuration. Hmm, no. Wait, perhaps the reaction produces a single diastereomer because the existing configuration (S at C5) would influence the approach of the hydride. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction doesn't produce a racemic mixture but instead leads to a single diastereomer because of the existing configuration.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about it another way. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the molecule has a stereocenter at C5, which is S. The ketone is at C3. When we reduce the ketone, the hydride could approach from either face of the planar carbonyl group. Since C5 is chiral, perhaps this creates a more favorable environment for the hydride to approach from a particular face, leading to a specific configuration at C3. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction proceeds with retention or inversion of configuration, but I don't think that's the case. Wait, no, ketones are sp2 hybridized, so the approach would be from either face, leading to racemic mixture.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have a new stereocenter at C3, leading to two possible diastereomers. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer with C3 configuration determined by the approach of the hydride relative to the existing C5 configuration. Or maybe the product is a racemic mixture at C3, but that depends on whether the starting material has any influence on the face of the carbonyl that the hydride approaches.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to a single diastereomer. Or perhaps the reaction results in a racemic mixture for C3, leading to four possible stereoisomers in total (two diastereomers, each with two enantiomers). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the product structure first. The product of Reaction I is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The configuration at C3 would be a new stereocenter, so the product could be either R or S at C3. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer (S) at C5, the product would have two stereocenters: C3 and C5. But whether the configuration at C3 is R or S would determine whether the product is a new compound.

Wait, but the starting material is (S) at C5, and upon reduction, the C3 becomes a new stereocenter which could be R or S. So, each product would have a configuration at C3, and the C5 remains as S. So, the product would have two stereocenters. How many stereoisomers would that produce?

Well, for two stereocenters, there are 2^2 = 4 possible stereoisomers. But in this case, only two are possible because the C3's configuration is determined by the reduction. Wait, no, no. The reduction of the ketone at C3 would produce two possible configurations at C3 (R and S), and the C5 remains S. So, the product would be two stereoisomers: one with C3 R and C5 S, and another with C3 S and C5 S. Wait, no, because the starting material is S at C5, and the reduction doesn't change that.

So, the product would be a racemic mixture at C3, leading to 50% each of the two possible configurations at C3, but keeping C5 as S. So, the product would be two enantiomeric pairs, but wait, since C5 is fixed as S, each C3 configuration would lead to a single stereoisomer.

Wait, no. Let me think: the starting material is (S) at C5. After reduction, we have a new stereocenter at C3. So, each molecule has the configuration at C5 fixed as S, and the configuration at C3 can be R or S. So, each product would be a diastereomer. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have 50% of each configuration at C3, leading to two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers. But wait, no, because the product would have two stereocenters, but the starting material is only a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps I should diagram it:

Starting material: C5 is S, C3 is not a stereocenter (it's a ketone).

After reduction, C3 becomes a stereocenter (R or S), and C5 remains S.

So, each product would have C3 R and C5 S, or C3 S and C5 S.

Wait, but then those are two different stereoisomers. So, two stereoisomers in total. But since the reduction is of a single enantiomer, would the product at C3 be a racemic mixture?

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, and in the reduction of ketones, the product is typically a racemic mixture because the hydride can attack from either face without any preference. So, if the starting material is (S) at C5, and the ketone at C3 is symmetric, the product would be a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers each of which is an enantiomer. So, in total, two stereoisomers, each present as a pair of enantiomers.

But wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. If the starting material is (S) at C5, and the ketone is at C3, when you reduce the ketone, the product would have a new stereocenter at C3. The reaction would proceed with the hydride attacking from either face, so each molecule of the starting material would produce a 50:50 mixture of the two possible configurations at C3. So, the product would be a 50:50 mixture of (R,S) and (S,S) configurations? Or wait, no, the C5 was (S), and the new configuration is at C3.

So, after reduction, the product would have:

- C3 R and C5 S → (R,S)

- C3 S and C5 S → (S,S)

So, two stereoisomers. But since the reaction is done with excess LAH and is 100% complete, the product would be a racemic mixture for each of these? Wait, no, wait. The starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have two stereoisomers, each present as a racemic mixture?

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let's proceed with the assumption that Reaction I produces two stereoisomers: (R,S) and (S,S) at C3 and C5. So, two products.

Now, moving on to Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent, but it's a weaker agent compared to LAH. Pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups: on carbons 2 and 4. The structure is (CH3)COCH2COCH3.

Wait, no, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait, pentane-2,4-dione would have ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4 of a five-carbon chain. So, the structure is CH3-CO-CH2-CO-CH3.

Wait, no, for pentane-2,4-dione, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O? No, wait, the correct structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, two ketone groups on adjacent carbons, making it a diketone.

When treated with NaBH4, which is a strong enough reducing agent for ketones, each ketone group would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. However, since there are two ketone groups, each would be reduced. But wait, NaBH4 typically reduces each ketone group in a diketone, but how?

In pentane-2,4-dione, each ketone is on carbons 2 and 4. So, each would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So, the product would be HOCH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OH. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure after reduction would be HOCH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OH? No, that's four carbons. Wait, the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. Upon reduction, each ketone becomes an alcohol. So, structure becomes CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait, pentane-2,4-dione has the structure O=C-C-O-C-C=O, but I'm not sure. Let me count the carbons properly. Pentane has five carbons. So, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. But wait, that can't be. Oh, wait, no: it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write the structure correctly.

Pentane-2,4-dione: the molecule has five carbons, with ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4. So, the structure is CH2(CO)CH2COCH3? No, wait, no. Let me think of it as:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: C=O

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: C=O

Carbon 5: CH3

Wait, that would be 2,4-pentanedione, which is (CH3)2C(O)CH2COCH3? No, wait, perhaps it's (CH3)C(O)CH2C(O)CH3. So, the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So, when treated with NaBH4, each ketone group (C=O) is reduced to a secondary alcohol. So, the product is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but that's a single compound. But wait, does each ketone reduction lead to any stereochemistry? Because each ketone is in a different environment.

Wait, each ketone in pentane-2,4-dione is identical. Because the molecule is symmetric. So, when both ketones are reduced, the product is a single compound. Because the two ketones are in equivalent positions due to the symmetry of the molecule.

So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a single compound with no stereocenters. Because both OH groups are on the same type of carbon (the 2 and 4 positions), and the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no new stereocenters.

Wait, but wait, wait. When each ketone is reduced, each becomes a secondary alcohol. Let me check: in the starting material, each of the ketones is on a carbon that's attached to two CH2 groups. So, upon reduction, each would become a CH(OH) group. So, each alcohol is on a secondary carbon, but since the molecule is symmetrical, both alcohols are the same. So, the product is a single compound, 2,4-pentanediol, with no stereocenters because the reduction doesn't introduce any new chiral centers.

Wait, but wait: 2,4-pentanediol would have two OH groups on the same type of carbon, but are those carbons chiral? Let's see: carbon 2 is attached to CH3, OH, two CH2 groups (carbon 1 and 3). So, carbon 2 is attached to four different groups: CH3, OH, CH2CH2OH (no, wait, carbon 3 is CH2, which is connected to carbon 4, which is CH(OH) and then CH3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, carbon 2: attached to CH3, OH, CH2 (which is connected to C3), and another CH2 (from C1). Wait, no, C1 is CH3, C2 is CH(OH), connected to C3 (CH2), and C1 (CH3). So, the groups on C2 would be: CH3, OH, CH2CH2OH (no, wait, C3 is CH2, which is connected to C4, which is CH(OH), then connected to CH3. Hmm, perhaps the groups on C2 are CH3, OH, CH2CH2CH3 (no, because C4 is a CH(OH)), perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe I should draw it. The product after reduction is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So, the structure is symmetrical, with OH groups on C2 and C4. Each of these carbons is attached to:

- C2: CH3, OH, CH2 (C3), and CH (from C1? No, C1 is CH3, attached to C2 as CH2. Wait, perhaps each of the C2 and C4 carbons is attached to two CH2 groups, making them secondary alcohols but not stereogenic centers.

Wait, for a carbon to be a stereogenic center, it must be attached to four different groups. Let's check C2:

- Group 1: CH3 (from C1)
- Group 2: OH
- Group 3: CH2 (connected to C3)
- Group 4: CH(OH)CH3 (from C3 and C4?)

Hmm, maybe I'm not getting this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps each C2 and C4 in the product is attached to:

- CH3 (from C1 or C5)
- OH
- CH2 (from C3)
- Another CH2 (from C1 or C5?)

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The product from Reaction II is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a symmetrical molecule and has no stereocenters. So, it's a single product with no stereochemistry.

So, the products from both reactions are combined. Let's summarize:

- Reaction I produces two stereoisomers: (R,S) and (S,S) at C3 and C5. Wait, earlier I thought that the product would have two diastereomers. But perhaps I should think that the product is a racemic mixture for the configuration at C3, leading to two diastereomers. So, each is a pair of enantiomers, but since the starting material was a single enantiomer, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I produces two enantiomers because the reduction creates a new chiral center, and the resulting product is a racemic mixture.

Wait, perhaps more accurately: the starting material is a single enantiomer at C5. Upon reduction, the C3 becomes a new stereocenter, leading to two possible configurations. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the attack of the hydride from either face would result in a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers: (R,S) and (S,S) (if C5 is S). So, two diastereomers in total, each of which is a pair of enantiomers. Wait, but if the product is a racemic mixture at C3, then each diastereomer exists as a racemic pair. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer because the existing configuration at C5 influences the approach of the hydride. But I'm not sure. I think it's more likely that the product is a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers, each as a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, no, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a certain configuration at C3. Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's proceed with the assumption that Reaction I produces two stereoisomers (each a pair of enantiomers), and Reaction II produces a single product.

So, when the products are combined, we have:

From Reaction I: Two diastereomers (since C3 and C5 are both stereocenters, and they're not mirror images). Or perhaps four stereoisomers because each of the two stereocenters has two possibilities. Wait, no, because Reaction I's product has two stereocenters (C3 and C5), each of which can be R or S.

Wait, no. The starting material is (S) at C5. After reduction, C3 becomes a stereocenter. So, the product has two stereocenters: C3 and C5. Since the starting material is (S) at C5, the product has C5 as S, and C3 as either R or S. So, the product would have two stereoisomers: (R,S) and (S,S).

Each of these is a diastereomer of the other, and each exists as a pair of enantiomers. So, each would have two enantiomers, but since the products are formed from a single enantiomer starting material, perhaps each product is a single enantiomer. Wait, no, because the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's proceed with the assumption that Reaction I produces two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single enantiomer because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction leads to a specific configuration at C3. But I'm not sure about that.

Let me try another approach. Let's consider the number of stereoisomers each product would have.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → after reduction, product has two stereocenters (C3 and C5). If the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, then for each molecule of the starting material, you get a 50:50 mixture of C3 R and C3 S. So, the product would have two diastereomers: (R,S) and (S,S), each of which would be a pair of enantiomers. But wait, since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture for each diastereomer, leading to four possible stereoisomers in total. But that doesn't make sense because the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product can't have four stereoisomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer, meaning that the reaction leads to a specific configuration at C3, making only one product. But I don't think that's the case because the reduction of a ketone with LAH typically leads to a racemic mixture.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's proceed with the assumption that Reaction I produces two stereoisomers, and Reaction II produces one product. So, when combined, there are three products in total.

Wait, no, the products from both reactions are combined. So, perhaps the products are:

From Reaction I: two stereoisomers.

From Reaction II: one product.

So, in total, three products: two diastereomers from Reaction I and one from Reaction II.

Wait, but Reaction II's product is a single compound. So, when combined, the mixture would have three compounds: two from I and one from II.

Now, when running on normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC, how many peaks would each show?

Normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity, with non-polar compounds eluting earlier. The number of peaks would correspond to the number of structurally distinct compounds in the mixture. So, if there are three compounds (two from I, one from II), the normal-phase HPLC would show three peaks.

Chiral HPLC, on the other hand, separates enantiomers. So, if any of the compounds are chiral and have enantiomers present, each enantiomer would elute as a separate peak.

So, let's evaluate each product.

From Reaction I: The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two stereocenters (C3 and C5). But wait, C5 was the stereocenter in the starting material, and it's unchanged except for the addition of the OH at C3. So, the product has two stereocenters. But earlier, I thought that the product might be a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers. So, each diastereomer would have two enantiomers, but perhaps each diastereomer is present as a racemic pair.

Wait, but in reality, since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product from Reaction I would have a specific configuration at C5 and a racemic mixture at C3. So, the product would be a racemic mixture of two diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, each of which is a diastereomer of the other. So, Reaction I produces two enantiomers, each of which is a diastereomer of the other.

But I'm getting stuck again. Let me think differently.

The product from Reaction I is (R,S) and (S,S) at C3 and C5. These are two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers. So, the mixture would contain four stereoisomers: (R,S), its enantiomer (S,R), (S,S), and its enantiomer (R,S)? No, I think that's not correct. Because if C5 is fixed as S, then the possible configurations are (R,S) and (S,S). Each of these is a diastereomer, but (R,S) and its enantiomer would be (S,R), but since C5 is fixed as S, the enantiomer would have C3 as S and C5 as S, which is the same as (S,S). Wait, no, no, because enantiomers are mirror images. So, the enantiomer of (R,S) would be (S,R), but since C5 is fixed as S, that's not possible. So, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture of (R,S) and (S,S).

Wait, but this is getting too tangled. Let me proceed.

Assuming that Reaction I produces two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product ends up as a racemic mixture, leading to four stereoisomers. But that can't be because the starting material is a single enantiomer. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, leading to two enantiomers.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer with a racemic configuration at C3, leading to two enantiomers. So, the product would have two enantiomers. So, when combined with the product from Reaction II (a single compound), the total would be three compounds, two of which are enantiomers and one is a single non-chiral compound.

Wait, no. Reaction II's product is 2,4-pentanediol, which has no stereocenters, so it's a single compound.

So, when you combine the products, you have:

- Two enantiomers from Reaction I (since they're chiral and form a racemic mixture)
- One compound from Reaction II (non-chiral)

So, when run on normal-phase HPLC, which doesn't separate enantiomers, you would see three peaks: the two enantiomers as one peak (since they're not separated on normal-phase), and the product from Reaction II as another. Wait, no, wait. On normal-phase HPLC, enantiomers would have the same polarity, so they would co-elute as a single peak. So, the two enantiomers from Reaction I would be one peak, and the product from Reaction II would be another. So, two peaks in total on normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Reaction I might produce two diastereomers, each of which would be a pair of enantiomers. But if that's the case, then on normal-phase HPLC, each diastereomer would elute as a separate peak, since diastereomers have different physical properties. So, if Reaction I produces two diastereomers, each being a pair of enantiomers, then the normal-phase HPLC would show two peaks (each diastereomer as a single peak, since the enantiomers co-elute). And the product from Reaction II would add another peak, totaling three peaks on normal-phase.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about the number of diastereomers. Let me think again. The product from Reaction I has two stereocenters, so four possible stereoisomers. But since the starting material is (S) at C5, and the reduction leads to a racemic mix at C3, the product would be two diastereomers: (R,S) and (S,S). Each of these is a pair of enantiomers. So, the mixture contains these two diastereomers, each as a racemic pair. So, four stereoisomers in total, but in the mixture, would they be present as two peaks on normal-phase HPLC (since each diastereomer would be a separate peak) and four peaks on chiral HPLC (each enantiomer as a separate peak).

Wait, but the starting material was a single enantiomer, so the product from Reaction I would have a certain configuration. Hmm, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me try to find another approach.

Let's think about the overall products:

After both reactions, the products are:

1. From Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two stereocenters (C3 and C5). So, two diastereomers, each a pair of enantiomers.

2. From Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol, which is a single non-chiral compound.

So, the combined mixture has three compounds: two diastereomers (each a pair of enantiomers) and one non-chiral.

Now, when run on normal-phase HPLC:

- The two diastereomers would elute as separate peaks, as diastereomers have different retention times.

- The non-chiral compound would elute as a single peak.

So, total of three peaks on normal-phase.

On chiral HPLC:

- Each pair of enantiomers from the two diastereomers would elute as separate peaks. So, each diastereomer's enantiomeric pair would split into two peaks, leading to four peaks from Reaction I.

- The non-chiral compound would elute as a single peak.

So, total of five peaks on chiral HPLC.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 5 and 4

B)3 and 2

C)4 and 2

D)3 and 3

Wait, but according to my latest reasoning, normal-phase would show three peaks, and chiral would show five. But option A says 5 peaks in chiral and 4 in normal-phase, which doesn't match. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternative approach: Perhaps Reaction I produces only one product. Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → treated with LAH.

LAH reduces the ketone to a secondary alcohol. The starting material is a single enantiomer at C5. When the ketone is reduced, the C3 becomes a new stereocenter. Since the reduction is with LAH, which is a strong reducing agent, perhaps it proceeds with inversion, leading to a specific configuration at C3. Or perhaps the product is a single enantiomer. Wait, no, LAH typically leads to racemization unless there's another stereocenter influencing the approach.

Wait, perhaps the product after reduction has a new stereocenter at C3, and because the starting material is a single enantiomer at C5, the product would be a single stereoisomer with C3 in a specific configuration. So, the product from Reaction I would have a single configuration at C3 and C5, leading to a single stereoisomer. No, that can't be because the reduction of a planar ketone would lead to a racemic mixture, regardless of the configuration at other stereocenters.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer with a specific configuration at C3. Because the existing configuration at C5 could influence the approach of the hydride. So, the product would have a specific configuration at C3, making it a single stereoisomer.

But I'm not entirely confident about this. Let me try to proceed with this assumption.

If Reaction I produces a single stereoisomer (i.e., a specific configuration at C3 and C5), then the product is a single compound, which would be chiral. So, when run on chiral HPLC, it would show as one peak, but on normal-phase, one peak as well.

Reaction II produces a single non-chiral compound.

So, when combined, the mixture has two compounds: one chiral (from Reaction I) and one non-chiral (from II).

On normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

On chiral HPLC: two peaks (the chiral compound would be a single peak, and the non-chiral as another).

But that would make the normal-phase show two peaks and chiral show two peaks, which isn't matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think in terms of the number of peaks each product would contribute.

Let me summarize:

Reaction I:

- Starting material: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

- Product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Assuming the product has two stereocenters (C3 and C5) and is a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers. So, four stereoisomers in total, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture for each diastereomer, leading to two diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers.

So, Reaction I produces two diastereomers, each as a racemic pair. So, four stereoisomers in total.

But when the products are combined, including Reaction II's product, which is a single compound, how does this affect the peaks?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Reaction I produces two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers, leading to four stereoisomers. However, if the reaction is 100% efficient and produces a racemic mixture, then each diastereomer would be present as a racemic pair. So, when you run on a chiral column, each pair would split into two peaks, leading to four peaks from Reaction I, plus one from Reaction II, totaling five peaks. On normal-phase, each diastereomer would be a single peak, so two peaks from Reaction I and one from II, totaling three.

But looking at the options, option A is 5 peaks in chiral and 4 in normal-phase, which doesn't match. Option C is 4 and 2, which also doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I produces a single diastereomer, which is a racemic mixture, leading to two enantiomers.

In that case, Reaction I would contribute two enantiomers, which on chiral HPLC would split into two peaks, and on normal-phase would be a single peak. Reaction II's product is a single peak. So, in total:

Chiral HPLC: 2 (from I) + 1 (from II) = 3 peaks.

Normal-phase: 1 (from I) + 1 (from II) = 2 peaks.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two enantiomers (each a pair), leading to two peaks on chiral HPLC and one on normal-phase. Reaction II's product is a single peak on both. So, total peaks:

Chiral: 2 + 1 = 3.

Normal-phase: 1 + 1 = 2.

But the options don't have this either.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the possible products and their chiral status.

Reaction I:

- Product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two stereocenters. So, it's a chiral compound, and the product would be a racemic mixture if the reduction leads to a racemic outcome. So, two enantiomers. So, when run on a chiral column, they would split into two peaks. On normal-phase, they would co-elute as a single peak.

Reaction II:

- Product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is not chiral (since it has a plane of symmetry). So, single peak on both columns.

So, when combined:

Chiral HPLC: 2 (from I) + 1 (from II) = 3 peaks.

Normal-phase HPLC: 1 (from I) + 1 (from II) = 2 peaks.

So, the HPLC results would show 3 peaks on chiral and 2 on normal-phase.

Looking at the options, option B says 3 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal-phase.

So, the correct answer would be option B: 3 and 2.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of peaks observed in two different HPLC chromatograms after some reactions. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, the problem describes two reactions (Reaction I and II) performed by an organic chemist. The products are then combined and run on two HPLC columns: one normal-phase and another chiral. I need to determine the number of peaks in each case.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH (which I think is Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, right? It's typically used to reduce carbonyl groups. So, hexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. When reduced, the ketone (C=O) becomes a CH2OH group? Wait, no, wait. LAH would reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one (which is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3) would become (CH2)2CH(OH)(CH2)3CH3? Wait, no, wait, the structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one is as follows:

The carbon chain is CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one would be CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, the compound here is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is: CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3 on the fifth carbon? Wait, no, let me get the structure right.

Hexan-3-one has carbonyl at position 3. So the structure is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. But wait, let me count. Carbon 1: CH2-, carbon 2: CH2-, carbon 3: C=O, carbon 4: CH2, carbon 5: CH2, carbon 6: CH3. So, the structure is more like CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. So, in 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the fifth carbon (from the CO) would be a methoxy group. Wait, so it's:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: OCH3
Wait, no, wait. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2C(O)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, the structure would be:

1: CH2CH2CO... no, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3? Let me draw it:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6

So, for 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the structure is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2? Wait, no, because hexan-3-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. So, the 5th carbon is CH2, but if it's 5-methoxy, then the 5th carbon has a methoxy group. So the structure is:

CH2CH2C(O)CH2-OCH3

Wait, but hexan-3-one has 6 carbons. Let me count:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: OCH3 (so that's a substituent on carbon 5)

Wait, that makes the structure: CH2CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? No, because that would be seven carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, hexan-3-one is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: OCH3 (so that's on the 5th carbon)

But wait, that would be only 6 carbons in total.

So, the structure is: CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? Wait, that's 7 carbons. Maybe I'm not getting it right. Let me think differently.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. So, 6 carbons in total. If the 5th carbon has a methoxy group, then the structure is CH2CH2C(O)CH2-OCH3 attached where? Wait, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2)2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3?

No, that would imply that carbon 4 has the OCH3. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2C(O)CH2-OCH2CH3? No, wait, that can't be right. Maybe it's:

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which is:

Positions 1 2 3 4 5 6:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: OCH3

6: CH3?

Wait, but that would make the 5th carbon a CH2-OCH3. No, perhaps I should think of the molecule as:

(CH2)2-C(O)-CH(CH2-OCH3)-CH2?

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's move forward. The important thing is that this compound is a ketone, and when treated with LAH, the ketone group (C=O) is reduced to an alcohol (CH2OH?), but wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent and reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.

Wait, no. LAH would reduce the ketone (C=O) to CH2OH? No, wait, no. LAH reduces carbonyl groups. For a ketone, R2CO, it would become R2CH-OH after acidic workup? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, when LAH is used to reduce a ketone, the product is a secondary alcohol. For example, R2CO → R2CH-OH. So, in this case, the ketone at position 3 would become a secondary alcohol.

So, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. After reduction with LAH and acidic workup, the ketone becomes an alcohol. So, the product of Reaction I would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait—what about the stereochemistry? Because the starting material is (S) configuration, but when the ketone is reduced, the alcohol will have the opposite configuration because of the inversion. Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically leads to a racemic mixture because it's an Sn2 mechanism? Or does it proceed through a different mechanism?

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically provides high stereoselectivity in the reduction of ketones. Wait, no, actually, the reduction of ketones with LAH typically proceeds through a two-step mechanism. The hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon in an Sn2-like fashion, which would invert the configuration. But wait, the starting ketone is (S) configuration at C5? Or is the configuration at C3?

Wait, maybe I should clarify the structure. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the ketone is at C3. The 5th carbon has a methoxy group. So, the configuration (S) would be at which carbon? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the (S) designation is at the 5th carbon, where the methoxy group is.

Wait, but the configuration (S) would be at the 5th carbon, which is a stereogenic center. So, the starting material has a stereogenic center at C5 (with the OCH3 group). When LAH reduces the ketone at C3, the product would be an alcohol at C3, but what about the configuration?

Wait, the ketone at C3 is (R) or (S)? Well, the starting material is (S) at C5. So, the ketone is at C3, which is a carbonyl, so not a stereocenter. Upon reduction, the C3 becomes a CH-OH group, which is a stereocenter. Because the ketone is planar, the addition of hydride (from LAH) can occur from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. Wait, no, LAH is a strong reducing agent, and in such reductions, the hydride attacks from the less hindered side, but without any existing stereocenter, the product would be a racemic mixture. However, since the starting material is enantioenriched (S configuration at C5), perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't affect the configuration at C5. The reduction of C3 (the ketone) would create a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material is (S) at C5, the configuration at C3 would be determined by the reduction. But wait, LAH is a strong enough reducing agent that it can lead to complete reduction, but I think the reduction of ketones with LAH typically gives a racemic mixture because there's no existing stereocenter to influence the attack. Wait, no, wait, in the case of a cyclic ketone, perhaps, but for a straight-chain ketone, the addition would be from either face, so leading to a racemic mixture.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is chiral at C5. Does that influence the reduction at C3? I don't think so because the two carbons (C3 and C5) are distinct and not directly connected. So the reduction at C3 would create a new stereocenter, and since it's a ketone without any existing stereogenic influence, the product would be a racemic mixture. So, after the reaction, we would get two enantiomers from the reduction at C3, but the C5 remains as it was.

Wait, no, the starting material is a single enantiomer at C5. When the ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol, the configuration at C3 would form a new stereocenter. Since the reduction is a two-step process with hydride and then protonation, the attack of the hydride could be either from the top or bottom face. So, if the starting material is a single enantiomer at C5, but the C3 is a planar sp2 center, then the reduction would lead to a 50:50 mixture of the two possible stereoisomers at C3. But wait, the original compound (the starting material) is a single enantiomer, so when you reduce C3, the product would have two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

So, the product of Reaction I would have two stereocenters: C3 and C5. The configuration at C3 would be a racemic mixture, while C5 remains as S. So, that would lead to two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers. But since the reaction is 100% complete, all the starting material is consumed, so the products would be 50% each of the two possible stereoisomers at C3, combined with the original configuration at C5.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The starting material: (S) at C5. Then, upon reduction, the C3 becomes a new stereocenter. So for each molecule, after reduction, we have two possible configurations at C3: R and S. So, each would have a new stereocenter. So, the product would have two stereocenters: C3 and C5. And each product from the reduction would have C5 as S, and C3 as R or S.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer. So, when the ketone is reduced, each molecule could form two possible diastereomers, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would be a racemic mixture for the C3 configuration. Hmm, no. Wait, perhaps the reaction produces a single diastereomer because the existing configuration (S at C5) would influence the approach of the hydride. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction doesn't produce a racemic mixture but instead leads to a single diastereomer because of the existing configuration.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about it another way. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the molecule has a stereocenter at C5, which is S. The ketone is at C3. When we reduce the ketone, the hydride could approach from either face of the planar carbonyl group. Since C5 is chiral, perhaps this creates a more favorable environment for the hydride to approach from a particular face, leading to a specific configuration at C3. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction proceeds with retention or inversion of configuration, but I don't think that's the case. Wait, no, ketones are sp2 hybridized, so the approach would be from either face, leading to racemic mixture.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have a new stereocenter at C3, leading to two possible diastereomers. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer with C3 configuration determined by the approach of the hydride relative to the existing C5 configuration. Or maybe the product is a racemic mixture at C3, but that depends on whether the starting material has any influence on the face of the carbonyl that the hydride approaches.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to a single diastereomer. Or perhaps the reaction results in a racemic mixture for C3, leading to four possible stereoisomers in total (two diastereomers, each with two enantiomers). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the product structure first. The product of Reaction I is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The configuration at C3 would be a new stereocenter, so the product could be either R or S at C3. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer (S) at C5, the product would have two stereocenters: C3 and C5. But whether the configuration at C3 is R or S would determine whether the product is a new compound.

Wait, but the starting material is (S) at C5, and upon reduction, the C3 becomes a new stereocenter which could be R or S. So, each product would have a configuration at C3, and the C5 remains as S. So, the product would have two stereocenters. How many stereoisomers would that produce?

Well, for two stereocenters, there are 2^2 = 4 possible stereoisomers. But in this case, only two are possible because the C3's configuration is determined by the reduction. Wait, no, no. The reduction of the ketone at C3 would produce two possible configurations at C3 (R and S), and the C5 remains S. So, the product would be two stereoisomers: one with C3 R and C5 S, and another with C3 S and C5 S. Wait, no, because the starting material is S at C5, and the reduction doesn't change that.

So, the product would be a racemic mixture at C3, leading to 50% each of the two possible configurations at C3, but keeping C5 as S. So, the product would be two enantiomeric pairs, but wait, since C5 is fixed as S, each C3 configuration would lead to a single stereoisomer.

Wait, no. Let me think: the starting material is (S) at C5. After reduction, we have a new stereocenter at C3. So, each molecule has the configuration at C5 fixed as S, and the configuration at C3 can be R or S. So, each product would be a diastereomer. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have 50% of each configuration at C3, leading to two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers. But wait, no, because the product would have two stereocenters, but the starting material is only a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps I should diagram it:

Starting material: C5 is S, C3 is not a stereocenter (it's a ketone).

After reduction, C3 becomes a stereocenter (R or S), and C5 remains S.

So, each product would have C3 R and C5 S, or C3 S and C5 S.

Wait, but then those are two different stereoisomers. So, two stereoisomers in total. But since the reduction is of a single enantiomer, would the product at C3 be a racemic mixture?

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, and in the reduction of ketones, the product is typically a racemic mixture because the hydride can attack from either face without any preference. So, if the starting material is (S) at C5, and the ketone at C3 is symmetric, the product would be a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers each of which is an enantiomer. So, in total, two stereoisomers, each present as a pair of enantiomers.

But wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. If the starting material is (S) at C5, and the ketone is at C3, when you reduce the ketone, the product would have a new stereocenter at C3. The reaction would proceed with the hydride attacking from either face, so each molecule of the starting material would produce a 50:50 mixture of the two possible configurations at C3. So, the product would be a 50:50 mixture of (R,S) and (S,S) configurations? Or wait, no, the C5 was (S), and the new configuration is at C3.

So, after reduction, the product would have:

- C3 R and C5 S → (R,S)

- C3 S and C5 S → (S,S)

So, two stereoisomers. But since the reaction is done with excess LAH and is 100% complete, the product would be a racemic mixture for each of these? Wait, no, wait. The starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have two stereoisomers, each present as a racemic mixture?

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let's proceed with the assumption that Reaction I produces two stereoisomers: (R,S) and (S,S) at C3 and C5. So, two products.

Now, moving on to Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent, but it's a weaker agent compared to LAH. Pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups: on carbons 2 and 4. The structure is (CH3)COCH2COCH3.

Wait, no, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait, pentane-2,4-dione would have ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4 of a five-carbon chain. So, the structure is CH3-CO-CH2-CO-CH3.

Wait, no, for pentane-2,4-dione, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O? No, wait, the correct structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, two ketone groups on adjacent carbons, making it a diketone.

When treated with NaBH4, which is a strong enough reducing agent for ketones, each ketone group would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. However, since there are two ketone groups, each would be reduced. But wait, NaBH4 typically reduces each ketone group in a diketone, but how?

In pentane-2,4-dione, each ketone is on carbons 2 and 4. So, each would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So, the product would be HOCH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OH. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure after reduction would be HOCH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OH? No, that's four carbons. Wait, the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. Upon reduction, each ketone becomes an alcohol. So, structure becomes CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait, pentane-2,4-dione has the structure O=C-C-O-C-C=O, but I'm not sure. Let me count the carbons properly. Pentane has five carbons. So, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. But wait, that can't be. Oh, wait, no: it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write the structure correctly.

Pentane-2,4-dione: the molecule has five carbons, with ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4. So, the structure is CH2(CO)CH2COCH3? No, wait, no. Let me think of it as:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: C=O

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: C=O

Carbon 5: CH3

Wait, that would be 2,4-pentanedione, which is (CH3)2C(O)CH2COCH3? No, wait, perhaps it's (CH3)C(O)CH2C(O)CH3. So, the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So, when treated with NaBH4, each ketone group (C=O) is reduced to a secondary alcohol. So, the product is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but that's a single compound. But wait, does each ketone reduction lead to any stereochemistry? Because each ketone is in a different environment.

Wait, each ketone in pentane-2,4-dione is identical. Because the molecule is symmetric. So, when both ketones are reduced, the product is a single compound. Because the two ketones are in equivalent positions due to the symmetry of the molecule.

So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a single compound with no stereocenters. Because both OH groups are on the same type of carbon (the 2 and 4 positions), and the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no new stereocenters.

Wait, but wait, wait. When each ketone is reduced, each becomes a secondary alcohol. Let me check: in the starting material, each of the ketones is on a carbon that's attached to two CH2 groups. So, upon reduction, each would become a CH(OH) group. So, each alcohol is on a secondary carbon, but since the molecule is symmetrical, both alcohols are the same. So, the product is a single compound, 2,4-pentanediol, with no stereocenters because the reduction doesn't introduce any new chiral centers.

Wait, but wait: 2,4-pentanediol would have two OH groups on the same type of carbon, but are those carbons chiral? Let's see: carbon 2 is attached to CH3, OH, two CH2 groups (carbon 1 and 3). So, carbon 2 is attached to four different groups: CH3, OH, CH2CH2OH (no, wait, carbon 3 is CH2, which is connected to carbon 4, which is CH(OH) and then CH3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, carbon 2: attached to CH3, OH, CH2 (which is connected to C3), and another CH2 (from C1). Wait, no, C1 is CH3, C2 is CH(OH), connected to C3 (CH2), and C1 (CH3). So, the groups on C2 would be: CH3, OH, CH2CH2OH (no, wait, C3 is CH2, which is connected to C4, which is CH(OH), then connected to CH3. Hmm, perhaps the groups on C2 are CH3, OH, CH2CH2CH3 (no, because C4 is a CH(OH)), perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe I should draw it. The product after reduction is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So, the structure is symmetrical, with OH groups on C2 and C4. Each of these carbons is attached to:

- C2: CH3, OH, CH2 (C3), and CH (from C1? No, C1 is CH3, attached to C2 as CH2. Wait, perhaps each of the C2 and C4 carbons is attached to two CH2 groups, making them secondary alcohols but not stereogenic centers.

Wait, for a carbon to be a stereogenic center, it must be attached to four different groups. Let's check C2:

- Group 1: CH3 (from C1)
- Group 2: OH
- Group 3: CH2 (connected to C3)
- Group 4: CH(OH)CH3 (from C3 and C4?)

Hmm, maybe I'm not getting this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps each C2 and C4 in the product is attached to:

- CH3 (from C1 or C5)
- OH
- CH2 (from C3)
- Another CH2 (from C1 or C5?)

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The product from Reaction II is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a symmetrical molecule and has no stereocenters. So, it's a single product with no stereochemistry.

So, the products from both reactions are combined. Let's summarize:

- Reaction I produces two stereoisomers: (R,S) and (S,S) at C3 and C5. Wait, earlier I thought that the product would have two diastereomers. But perhaps I should think that the product is a racemic mixture for the configuration at C3, leading to two diastereomers. So, each is a pair of enantiomers, but since the starting material was a single enantiomer, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I produces two enantiomers because the reduction creates a new chiral center, and the resulting product is a racemic mixture.

Wait, perhaps more accurately: the starting material is a single enantiomer at C5. Upon reduction, the C3 becomes a new stereocenter, leading to two possible configurations. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the attack of the hydride from either face would result in a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers: (R,S) and (S,S) (if C5 is S). So, two diastereomers in total, each of which is a pair of enantiomers. Wait, but if the product is a racemic mixture at C3, then each diastereomer exists as a racemic pair. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer because the existing configuration at C5 influences the approach of the hydride. But I'm not sure. I think it's more likely that the product is a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers, each as a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, no, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a certain configuration at C3. Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's proceed with the assumption that Reaction I produces two stereoisomers (each a pair of enantiomers), and Reaction II produces a single product.

So, when the products are combined, we have:

From Reaction I: Two diastereomers (since C3 and C5 are both stereocenters, and they're not mirror images). Or perhaps four stereoisomers because each of the two stereocenters has two possibilities. Wait, no, because Reaction I's product has two stereocenters (C3 and C5), each of which can be R or S.

Wait, no. The starting material is (S) at C5. After reduction, C3 becomes a stereocenter. So, the product has two stereocenters: C3 and C5. Since the starting material is (S) at C5, the product has C5 as S, and C3 as either R or S. So, the product would have two stereoisomers: (R,S) and (S,S).

Each of these is a diastereomer of the other, and each exists as a pair of enantiomers. So, each would have two enantiomers, but since the products are formed from a single enantiomer starting material, perhaps each product is a single enantiomer. Wait, no, because the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's proceed with the assumption that Reaction I produces two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single enantiomer because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction leads to a specific configuration at C3. But I'm not sure about that.

Let me try another approach. Let's consider the number of stereoisomers each product would have.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → after reduction, product has two stereocenters (C3 and C5). If the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, then for each molecule of the starting material, you get a 50:50 mixture of C3 R and C3 S. So, the product would have two diastereomers: (R,S) and (S,S), each of which would be a pair of enantiomers. But wait, since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture for each diastereomer, leading to four possible stereoisomers in total. But that doesn't make sense because the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product can't have four stereoisomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer, meaning that the reaction leads to a specific configuration at C3, making only one product. But I don't think that's the case because the reduction of a ketone with LAH typically leads to a racemic mixture.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's proceed with the assumption that Reaction I produces two stereoisomers, and Reaction II produces one product. So, when combined, there are three products in total.

Wait, no, the products from both reactions are combined. So, perhaps the products are:

From Reaction I: two stereoisomers.

From Reaction II: one product.

So, in total, three products: two diastereomers from Reaction I and one from Reaction II.

Wait, but Reaction II's product is a single compound. So, when combined, the mixture would have three compounds: two from I and one from II.

Now, when running on normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC, how many peaks would each show?

Normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity, with non-polar compounds eluting earlier. The number of peaks would correspond to the number of structurally distinct compounds in the mixture. So, if there are three compounds (two from I, one from II), the normal-phase HPLC would show three peaks.

Chiral HPLC, on the other hand, separates enantiomers. So, if any of the compounds are chiral and have enantiomers present, each enantiomer would elute as a separate peak.

So, let's evaluate each product.

From Reaction I: The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two stereocenters (C3 and C5). But wait, C5 was the stereocenter in the starting material, and it's unchanged except for the addition of the OH at C3. So, the product has two stereocenters. But earlier, I thought that the product might be a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers. So, each diastereomer would have two enantiomers, but perhaps each diastereomer is present as a racemic pair.

Wait, but in reality, since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product from Reaction I would have a specific configuration at C5 and a racemic mixture at C3. So, the product would be a racemic mixture of two diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, each of which is a diastereomer of the other. So, Reaction I produces two enantiomers, each of which is a diastereomer of the other.

But I'm getting stuck again. Let me think differently.

The product from Reaction I is (R,S) and (S,S) at C3 and C5. These are two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers. So, the mixture would contain four stereoisomers: (R,S), its enantiomer (S,R), (S,S), and its enantiomer (R,S)? No, I think that's not correct. Because if C5 is fixed as S, then the possible configurations are (R,S) and (S,S). Each of these is a diastereomer, but (R,S) and its enantiomer would be (S,R), but since C5 is fixed as S, the enantiomer would have C3 as S and C5 as S, which is the same as (S,S). Wait, no, no, because enantiomers are mirror images. So, the enantiomer of (R,S) would be (S,R), but since C5 is fixed as S, that's not possible. So, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture of (R,S) and (S,S).

Wait, but this is getting too tangled. Let me proceed.

Assuming that Reaction I produces two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product ends up as a racemic mixture, leading to four stereoisomers. But that can't be because the starting material is a single enantiomer. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, leading to two enantiomers.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer with a racemic configuration at C3, leading to two enantiomers. So, the product would have two enantiomers. So, when combined with the product from Reaction II (a single compound), the total would be three compounds, two of which are enantiomers and one is a single non-chiral compound.

Wait, no. Reaction II's product is 2,4-pentanediol, which has no stereocenters, so it's a single compound.

So, when you combine the products, you have:

- Two enantiomers from Reaction I (since they're chiral and form a racemic mixture)
- One compound from Reaction II (non-chiral)

So, when run on normal-phase HPLC, which doesn't separate enantiomers, you would see three peaks: the two enantiomers as one peak (since they're not separated on normal-phase), and the product from Reaction II as another. Wait, no, wait. On normal-phase HPLC, enantiomers would have the same polarity, so they would co-elute as a single peak. So, the two enantiomers from Reaction I would be one peak, and the product from Reaction II would be another. So, two peaks in total on normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Reaction I might produce two diastereomers, each of which would be a pair of enantiomers. But if that's the case, then on normal-phase HPLC, each diastereomer would elute as a separate peak, since diastereomers have different physical properties. So, if Reaction I produces two diastereomers, each being a pair of enantiomers, then the normal-phase HPLC would show two peaks (each diastereomer as a single peak, since the enantiomers co-elute). And the product from Reaction II would add another peak, totaling three peaks on normal-phase.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about the number of diastereomers. Let me think again. The product from Reaction I has two stereocenters, so four possible stereoisomers. But since the starting material is (S) at C5, and the reduction leads to a racemic mix at C3, the product would be two diastereomers: (R,S) and (S,S). Each of these is a pair of enantiomers. So, the mixture contains these two diastereomers, each as a racemic pair. So, four stereoisomers in total, but in the mixture, would they be present as two peaks on normal-phase HPLC (since each diastereomer would be a separate peak) and four peaks on chiral HPLC (each enantiomer as a separate peak).

Wait, but the starting material was a single enantiomer, so the product from Reaction I would have a certain configuration. Hmm, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me try to find another approach.

Let's think about the overall products:

After both reactions, the products are:

1. From Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two stereocenters (C3 and C5). So, two diastereomers, each a pair of enantiomers.

2. From Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol, which is a single non-chiral compound.

So, the combined mixture has three compounds: two diastereomers (each a pair of enantiomers) and one non-chiral.

Now, when run on normal-phase HPLC:

- The two diastereomers would elute as separate peaks, as diastereomers have different retention times.

- The non-chiral compound would elute as a single peak.

So, total of three peaks on normal-phase.

On chiral HPLC:

- Each pair of enantiomers from the two diastereomers would elute as separate peaks. So, each diastereomer's enantiomeric pair would split into two peaks, leading to four peaks from Reaction I.

- The non-chiral compound would elute as a single peak.

So, total of five peaks on chiral HPLC.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 5 and 4

B)3 and 2

C)4 and 2

D)3 and 3

Wait, but according to my latest reasoning, normal-phase would show three peaks, and chiral would show five. But option A says 5 peaks in chiral and 4 in normal-phase, which doesn't match. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternative approach: Perhaps Reaction I produces only one product. Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → treated with LAH.

LAH reduces the ketone to a secondary alcohol. The starting material is a single enantiomer at C5. When the ketone is reduced, the C3 becomes a new stereocenter. Since the reduction is with LAH, which is a strong reducing agent, perhaps it proceeds with inversion, leading to a specific configuration at C3. Or perhaps the product is a single enantiomer. Wait, no, LAH typically leads to racemization unless there's another stereocenter influencing the approach.

Wait, perhaps the product after reduction has a new stereocenter at C3, and because the starting material is a single enantiomer at C5, the product would be a single stereoisomer with C3 in a specific configuration. So, the product from Reaction I would have a single configuration at C3 and C5, leading to a single stereoisomer. No, that can't be because the reduction of a planar ketone would lead to a racemic mixture, regardless of the configuration at other stereocenters.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer with a specific configuration at C3. Because the existing configuration at C5 could influence the approach of the hydride. So, the product would have a specific configuration at C3, making it a single stereoisomer.

But I'm not entirely confident about this. Let me try to proceed with this assumption.

If Reaction I produces a single stereoisomer (i.e., a specific configuration at C3 and C5), then the product is a single compound, which would be chiral. So, when run on chiral HPLC, it would show as one peak, but on normal-phase, one peak as well.

Reaction II produces a single non-chiral compound.

So, when combined, the mixture has two compounds: one chiral (from Reaction I) and one non-chiral (from II).

On normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

On chiral HPLC: two peaks (the chiral compound would be a single peak, and the non-chiral as another).

But that would make the normal-phase show two peaks and chiral show two peaks, which isn't matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think in terms of the number of peaks each product would contribute.

Let me summarize:

Reaction I:

- Starting material: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

- Product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Assuming the product has two stereocenters (C3 and C5) and is a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers. So, four stereoisomers in total, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture for each diastereomer, leading to two diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers.

So, Reaction I produces two diastereomers, each as a racemic pair. So, four stereoisomers in total.

But when the products are combined, including Reaction II's product, which is a single compound, how does this affect the peaks?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Reaction I produces two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers, leading to four stereoisomers. However, if the reaction is 100% efficient and produces a racemic mixture, then each diastereomer would be present as a racemic pair. So, when you run on a chiral column, each pair would split into two peaks, leading to four peaks from Reaction I, plus one from Reaction II, totaling five peaks. On normal-phase, each diastereomer would be a single peak, so two peaks from Reaction I and one from II, totaling three.

But looking at the options, option A is 5 peaks in chiral and 4 in normal-phase, which doesn't match. Option C is 4 and 2, which also doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I produces a single diastereomer, which is a racemic mixture, leading to two enantiomers.

In that case, Reaction I would contribute two enantiomers, which on chiral HPLC would split into two peaks, and on normal-phase would be a single peak. Reaction II's product is a single peak. So, in total:

Chiral HPLC: 2 (from I) + 1 (from II) = 3 peaks.

Normal-phase: 1 (from I) + 1 (from II) = 2 peaks.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two enantiomers (each a pair), leading to two peaks on chiral HPLC and one on normal-phase. Reaction II's product is a single peak on both. So, total peaks:

Chiral: 2 + 1 = 3.

Normal-phase: 1 + 1 = 2.

But the options don't have this either.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the possible products and their chiral status.

Reaction I:

- Product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two stereocenters. So, it's a chiral compound, and the product would be a racemic mixture if the reduction leads to a racemic outcome. So, two enantiomers. So, when run on a chiral column, they would split into two peaks. On normal-phase, they would co-elute as a single peak.

Reaction II:

- Product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is not chiral (since it has a plane of symmetry). So, single peak on both columns.

So, when combined:

Chiral HPLC: 2 (from I) + 1 (from II) = 3 peaks.

Normal-phase HPLC: 1 (from I) + 1 (from II) = 2 peaks.

So, the HPLC results would show 3 peaks on chiral and 2 on normal-phase.

Looking at the options, option B says 3 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal-phase.

So, the correct answer would be option B: 3 and 2.


To determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms, we analyze the products of the two reactions and their behavior on normal-phase and chiral HPLC columns.
