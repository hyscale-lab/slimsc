Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But I'm not sure yet if the masses matter for this particular question. Let's see the other details.

The problem gives me some elemental abundances using LTE and the EW method. The given values are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

I remember that the notation [X/Y] means log10(N_X / N_Y) relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(N_X/N_Y) - log10(N_X/N_Y)_sun. If [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun. If it's negative, it's less.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2).

Wait, no, wait. The question says the ratio of silicon atoms between Star_1 and Star_2. So actually, it's (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2). Right.

The problem also gives the Sun's photospheric composition as:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that again. 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

For Mg, log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, in the Sun, nFe is 3.16e-5 times nH, and nMg is 1e-5 times nH.

Now, I think the approach is to find n_Si in each star relative to H, and then take the ratio.

But how?

Given that [Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means the star has the same Fe/H ratio as the Sun. Because [Fe/H]_1=0 → log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0 → so nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Wait, but [Fe/H] is defined as log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. So [Fe/H]_1=0 implies that log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But wait, I need to find the ratio of silicon in each star. Let's think about what data I have.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But from [Fe/H]_1=0, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun → So, nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, nH1 could be considered as the same as nH_sun, but I'm not sure. Wait, but the problem says that [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1.

But wait, if the total number of hydrogen is different, how do I proceed? Hmm. Maybe it's better to express all abundances in terms of H and then relate them.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that each star has the same H abundance as the Sun. Wait, but I don't think that's necessarily given. Because [Fe/H] is given, which is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun.

Wait, but if [Fe/H] is zero, then Fe/H is the same as the Sun. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → So, nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

But without knowing nH, perhaps it's better to think in terms of ratios. Let me think about the Sun's composition.

In the Sun:

nFe_sun/nH_sun = 3.16e-5, as calculated earlier.

nMg_sun/nH_sun = 1e-5.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe1/nH1 = same as Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

So, nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Wait, what's nSi_sun/nFe_sun?

nSi_sun = ?

Wait, the Sun's composition is given for Fe and Mg, but not Si. Hmm, this complicates things. Because I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe] value. Oh, but wait, perhaps I can compute it.

Wait, the Sun's [X/H] is given for Fe and Mg, but not Si. So perhaps I need to find the solar ratio of Si to Fe, and then use that.

Wait, but to find [Si/Fe]_sun, I need to know nSi_sun / nFe_sun. But I don't have that directly from the given data. Oh, but perhaps I can compute it from the other given data.

Wait, I'm given that in the Sun, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → so that's log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Similarly, log(nFe/nH)= -4.5 → nFe/nH=3.16e-5.

Now, what about nSi/nH in the Sun? Hmm. I don't have that data. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the problem doesn't require the exact solar Si abundance, but perhaps I can relate Si to Mg through Star_2.

Wait, because Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. So maybe I can find nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

But wait, I don't know nSi_sun, which is needed for that.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.

Let me make a table for each star:

For Star 1:

- [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 3.16e-5.

- [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

So, nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But I need to find nSi1 in terms of H, perhaps.

Similarly, since nFe1 = (3.16e-5) * nH1.

So, nSi1 = (3.16e-5) * nH1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But wait, I don't know nSi_sun. Hmm.

Wait, I'm stuck because I don't know the solar Si abundance. But perhaps I can express it in terms of Mg, since I know the solar Mg abundance.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem gives us the [Mg/Si] ratio for Star 2. So for Star 2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg2 / nSi2) = log(nMg_sun / nSi_sun) +0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

But I also know that for Star 2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun =1e-5.

So, nMg2 = (1e-5) * nH2.

Putting this into the [Mg/Si] equation:

(1e-5 * nH2) / nSi2 = (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) *1e0.3.

Hmm. But I still don't know nSi_sun, which is the solar silicon to hydrogen ratio.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the solar [Mg/Si] to get nSi_sun.

Wait, in the Sun, what's the [Mg/Si] ratio?

[Mg/Si]_sun = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)_sun. Wait, no, wait. Actually, [X/Y]_sun is log(nX_sun/nY_sun) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun) which is zero. So that approach isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps instead, I can find the solar [Mg/Si] ratio. Because I have nMg_sun and nFe_sun, but not nSi_sun.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try another approach.

I need to find the ratio (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2).

So:

n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 = ?

I can express each in terms of their respective H and other elements.

Let me try for Star 1 first.

For Star_1:

n_Si,1 = ?

We know [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1)= log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3 → nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Substituting nFe1:

nSi1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun * nH1) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^0.3 → nSi1 = (nH1 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

Wait, because (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) = nSi_sun /nH_sun.

So, nSi1 = nH1 /nH_sun * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

Wait, maybe I can write it as (nH1 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *10^0.3.

But that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express nSi1 in terms of nH1.

Wait, for the Sun:

nFe_sun /nH_sun = 3.16e-5.

nMg_sun /nH_sun =1e-5.

But what about nSi_sun /nH_sun? Hmm. Maybe I can find that from other data, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio is known, but I don't have that data. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to relate silicon to magnesium through the given [Mg/Si] ratio for Star_2.

Wait, let's tackle Star_2.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH2 = (1e-5) *nH2.

Putting this into the [Mg/Si]_2 equation:

(1e-5 *nH2) /nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

So, nSi2 = (1e-5 *nH2) / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 ) ].

But again, I don't know nMg_sun /nSi_sun. Hmm.

Wait, but nMg_sun =1e-5 * nH_sun.

So, nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

So, nMg_sun/nSi_sun = (1e-5 nH_sun) /nSi_sun.

So, [Mg/Si]_2 equation becomes:

nSi2 = (1e-5 nH2) / [ (1e-5 nH_sun /nSi_sun ) * 10^0.3 ) ].

Simplify that:

nSi2 = (1e-5 nH2) * (nSi_sun / (1e-5 nH_sun)) ) / 10^0.3.

Wait, let's compute this step by step.

nSi2 = (nMg2 ) * (nSi_sun/(nMg_sun)) ) / (10^0.3).

Wait, because:

nMg2 = (1e-5) *nH2.

nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

So,

nSi2 = (nMg2 * nSi_sun) / (nMg_sun * 10^0.3).

Substituting nMg2 and nMg_sun:

nSi2 = ( (1e-5 *nH2) *nSi_sun ) / ( (1e-5 *nH_sun) *10^0.3 ) ).

The 1e-5 cancels out:

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun) / (nH_sun *10^0.3).

Now, I can write this as:

nSi2 = (nH2 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /10^0.3).

Hmm. So, nSi2 is expressed in terms of nSi_sun and the H ratio.

But I'm not making progress because I don't know nSi_sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of the Sun's composition.

Wait, the problem is to find the ratio (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2).

So, let's write n_Si,1 and n_Si,2 in terms of their respective H and other elements.

From earlier, for Star_1:

n_Si,1 = (nH1 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *10^0.3.

Wait, no, let's go back to Star_1 again.

Wait, from [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3.

Which is log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

We also have [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 =nFe_sun *nH1/nH_sun.

So, substituting into nSi1:

nSi1 = (nFe1) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3 → [nFe_sun *nH1/nH_sun] * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

Simplify:

nSi1 = (nH1/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

So,

nSi1 = (nH1/nH_sun) * nSi_sun *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, from earlier steps, we have:

nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) /10^0.3.

Because from the earlier equation, nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * nSi_sun /10^0.3.

Wait, let me recheck that.

Wait, in the Star_2 case, I had:

nSi2 = (nH2 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /10^0.3).

Yes, because in the earlier step, nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun) / (nH_sun *10^0.3) → nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /10^0.3).

So, now I have expressions for both n_Si,1 and n_Si,2.

So, n_Si,1 = (nH1/nH_sun) * nSi_sun *10^0.3.

n_Si,2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * nSi_sun /10^0.3.

So, the ratio (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) is:

[ (nH1/nH_sun) * nSi_sun *10^0.3 ] / [ (nH2/nH_sun) *nSi_sun /10^0.3 ) ]

Simplify:

= [ (nH1 /nH_sun) / (nH2/nH_sun) ) ] * [ 10^0.3 / (1 /10^0.3) ) ].

nH_sun cancels out.

= (nH1/nH2) * (10^0.3 * 10^0.3) )

= (nH1/nH2) *10^(0.6).

Now, what is the ratio nH1/nH2?

Wait, the problem doesn't give any information about the H abundances of the stars. So, perhaps I can assume that the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun? That is, [H]_1 = [H]_2 = same as Sun. But wait, I don't have any data about [H] for either star. Wait, the given data are [Fe/H], [Mg/H], [Si/Fe], [Mg/Si].

Wait, because [Fe/H]_1=0, that means Star_1 has the same Fe/H as the Sun. But H is the denominator in these ratios, so if [Fe/H] is zero, Fe is same as Sun, but what about H?

Wait, H is the denominator, so if [X/H] is zero, the X abundance is same as the Sun. So, [H] would be [H/H] =0, which is trivial.

Hmm, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as it is in the Sun. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the ratio nH1/nH2 is 1, meaning same H in both. But that's an assumption.

Wait, but without knowing, I can't proceed. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem doesn't require knowing the absolute H abundances because the H cancels out. Let me think.

Wait, the ratio of n_Si1 to n_Si2 is:

(n_Si1 /n_Si2) = (nH1/nH2) *10^0.6.

But if the stars are in LTE and we're using EW method, maybe the H lines are used to determine the scale. So, perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun. So, nH1 = nH_sun * 1e([H]_1), but [H]_1 is not given. Wait, but [Fe/H]_1=0, which implies Fe/H is same as the Sun, which is [Fe/H]_1=0. So, nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1 /nH_sun).

But without knowing [H]_1 or [H]_2, I can't find nH1/nH2.

Wait, but perhaps the problem doesn't require knowing nH, and the ratio nH1/nH2 is 1. That is, the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars. But I don't know if that's a valid assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the ratio (nH1/nH2) is 1, so the H abundance is the same in both stars, perhaps because they have the same [Fe/H], but that's not given.

Wait, let's look at the given data again.

For Star_1: [Fe/H]=0, so Fe abundance is same as Sun.

Star_2: [Mg/H]=0, so Mg abundance same as Sun.

But no data about H in either star beyond that.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the H abundance is same in both stars as in the Sun, so nH1 =nH2 =nH_sun.

Wait, but that's an assumption. Let me proceed under that assumption and see if it works. If that's the case, then nH1/nH2 =1.

Then the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2) would be 10^0.6.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is about 3.98, so the answer could be option A) ~3.9.

But wait, let me compute it more accurately.

10^0.6= antilog(0.6)= 10^(6/10) = cube root of 10^(0.6*3/2) ? Alternatively, using known values:

10^0.6 ≈ 3.981.

So, approximately 3.98, which rounds to about 3.9, which is option A.

But wait, let me check if the assumption that nH1/nH2=1 is correct.

Wait, because [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

That doesn't imply that nH1 is the same as in the Sun, because nH1 could be higher or lower, as long as nFe1 is proportionally adjusted.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

Again, doesn't fix nH2.

But without knowing the [H] for either star, I can't find the ratio nH1/nH2. So, perhaps I have made a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the problem is expecting that the ratio of H is the same in both stars as in the Sun, so nH1 =nH2 =nH_sun.

But that is an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the ratio cancels out.

Wait, wait, the problem says to assume LTE and use EW method. The EW method relies on measuring equivalent widths of absorption lines, which would depend on the abundance of the element and the overall continuum, which depends on the star's temperature and gravity, but perhaps for this problem, we can assume that the H abundance is same in both stars.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun. Let me proceed with that and see what the answer would be.

So, under nH1 =nH2 =nH_sun.

Then, the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2) =10^0.6 ≈3.98 → option A.

But wait, another possibility: the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2) is (10^0.3)^2 =10^0.6 ≈3.98. So that would be answer A.

So, I think the correct answer is A) ~3.9.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar composition. The key steps are as follows:

### Given Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]₁ = 0 dex → \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
   - [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 dex → \( \log(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log(n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) + 0.3 \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]₂ = 0 dex → \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
   - [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 dex → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log(n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) + 0.3 \).

3. **Solar Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
From [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3:
\[
\log(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log(n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) + 0.3
\]
\[
n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}} = (n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
\]
Using [Fe/H]₁ = 0:
\[
n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \implies n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}).
\]
Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} \) into the expression for \( n_{\text{Si,1}} \):
\[
n_{\text{Si,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,1}} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
\]
\[
n_{\text{Si,1}} = (n_{\text{Fe,sun}} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
\]
\[
n_{\text{Si,1}} = (n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot n_{\text{Si,sun}} \cdot 10^{0.3}.
\]

#### For Star_2:
From [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3:
\[
\log(n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log(n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) + 0.3.
\]
\[
n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}} = (n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
\]
Using [Mg/H]₂ = 0:
\[
n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \implies n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}).
\]
Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} \) into the expression for \( n_{\text{Si,2}} \):
\[
n_{\text{Si,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,2}} / \left[(n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3}\right].
\]
\[
n_{\text{Si,2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}})}{(n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3}}.
\]
\[
n_{\text{Si,2}} = (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot n_{\text{Si,sun}} / 10^{0.3}.
\]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{(n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot n_{\text{Si,sun}} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{(n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot n_{\text{Si,sun}} / 10^{0.3}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,2}}}{1} \cdot \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{1}.
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} \cdot 10^{0.6}.
\]

#### Assumption:
The problem does not provide explicit data about the hydrogen abundances (\( n_{\text{H,1}} \) and \( n_{\text{H,2}} \)). To proceed, we assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun, i.e., \( n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = 1 \). This simplifies the ratio to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But I'm not sure yet if the masses matter for this particular question. Let's see the other details.

The problem gives me some elemental abundances using LTE and the EW method. The given values are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

I remember that the notation [X/Y] means log10(N_X / N_Y) relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(N_X/N_Y) - log10(N_X/N_Y)_sun. If [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun. If it's negative, it's less.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2).

Wait, no, wait. The question says the ratio of silicon atoms between Star_1 and Star_2. So actually, it's (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2). Right.

The problem also gives the Sun's photospheric composition as:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that again. 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

For Mg, log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, in the Sun, nFe is 3.16e-5 times nH, and nMg is 1e-5 times nH.

Now, I think the approach is to find n_Si in each star relative to H, and then take the ratio.

But how?

Given that [Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means the star has the same Fe/H ratio as the Sun. Because [Fe/H]_1=0 → log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0 → so nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Wait, but [Fe/H] is defined as log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. So [Fe/H]_1=0 implies that log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But wait, I need to find the ratio of silicon in each star. Let's think about what data I have.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But from [Fe/H]_1=0, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun → So, nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, nH1 could be considered as the same as nH_sun, but I'm not sure. Wait, but the problem says that [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1.

But wait, if the total number of hydrogen is different, how do I proceed? Hmm. Maybe it's better to express all abundances in terms of H and then relate them.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that each star has the same H abundance as the Sun. Wait, but I don't think that's necessarily given. Because [Fe/H] is given, which is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun.

Wait, but if [Fe/H] is zero, then Fe/H is the same as the Sun. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → So, nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

But without knowing nH, perhaps it's better to think in terms of ratios. Let me think about the Sun's composition.

In the Sun:

nFe_sun/nH_sun = 3.16e-5, as calculated earlier.

nMg_sun/nH_sun = 1e-5.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe1/nH1 = same as Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

So, nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Wait, what's nSi_sun/nFe_sun?

nSi_sun = ?

Wait, the Sun's composition is given for Fe and Mg, but not Si. Hmm, this complicates things. Because I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe] value. Oh, but wait, perhaps I can compute it.

Wait, the Sun's [X/H] is given for Fe and Mg, but not Si. So perhaps I need to find the solar ratio of Si to Fe, and then use that.

Wait, but to find [Si/Fe]_sun, I need to know nSi_sun / nFe_sun. But I don't have that directly from the given data. Oh, but perhaps I can compute it from the other given data.

Wait, I'm given that in the Sun, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → so that's log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Similarly, log(nFe/nH)= -4.5 → nFe/nH=3.16e-5.

Now, what about nSi/nH in the Sun? Hmm. I don't have that data. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the problem doesn't require the exact solar Si abundance, but perhaps I can relate Si to Mg through Star_2.

Wait, because Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. So maybe I can find nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

But wait, I don't know nSi_sun, which is needed for that.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.

Let me make a table for each star:

For Star 1:

- [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 3.16e-5.

- [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

So, nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But I need to find nSi1 in terms of H, perhaps.

Similarly, since nFe1 = (3.16e-5) * nH1.

So, nSi1 = (3.16e-5) * nH1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But wait, I don't know nSi_sun. Hmm.

Wait, I'm stuck because I don't know the solar Si abundance. But perhaps I can express it in terms of Mg, since I know the solar Mg abundance.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem gives us the [Mg/Si] ratio for Star 2. So for Star 2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg2 / nSi2) = log(nMg_sun / nSi_sun) +0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

But I also know that for Star 2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun =1e-5.

So, nMg2 = (1e-5) * nH2.

Putting this into the [Mg/Si] equation:

(1e-5 * nH2) / nSi2 = (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) *1e0.3.

Hmm. But I still don't know nSi_sun, which is the solar silicon to hydrogen ratio.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the solar [Mg/Si] to get nSi_sun.

Wait, in the Sun, what's the [Mg/Si] ratio?

[Mg/Si]_sun = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)_sun. Wait, no, wait. Actually, [X/Y]_sun is log(nX_sun/nY_sun) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun) which is zero. So that approach isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps instead, I can find the solar [Mg/Si] ratio. Because I have nMg_sun and nFe_sun, but not nSi_sun.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try another approach.

I need to find the ratio (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2).

So:

n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 = ?

I can express each in terms of their respective H and other elements.

Let me try for Star 1 first.

For Star_1:

n_Si,1 = ?

We know [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1)= log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3 → nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Substituting nFe1:

nSi1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun * nH1) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^0.3 → nSi1 = (nH1 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

Wait, because (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) = nSi_sun /nH_sun.

So, nSi1 = nH1 /nH_sun * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

Wait, maybe I can write it as (nH1 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *10^0.3.

But that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express nSi1 in terms of nH1.

Wait, for the Sun:

nFe_sun /nH_sun = 3.16e-5.

nMg_sun /nH_sun =1e-5.

But what about nSi_sun /nH_sun? Hmm. Maybe I can find that from other data, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio is known, but I don't have that data. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to relate silicon to magnesium through the given [Mg/Si] ratio for Star_2.

Wait, let's tackle Star_2.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH2 = (1e-5) *nH2.

Putting this into the [Mg/Si]_2 equation:

(1e-5 *nH2) /nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

So, nSi2 = (1e-5 *nH2) / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 ) ].

But again, I don't know nMg_sun /nSi_sun. Hmm.

Wait, but nMg_sun =1e-5 * nH_sun.

So, nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

So, nMg_sun/nSi_sun = (1e-5 nH_sun) /nSi_sun.

So, [Mg/Si]_2 equation becomes:

nSi2 = (1e-5 nH2) / [ (1e-5 nH_sun /nSi_sun ) * 10^0.3 ) ].

Simplify that:

nSi2 = (1e-5 nH2) * (nSi_sun / (1e-5 nH_sun)) ) / 10^0.3.

Wait, let's compute this step by step.

nSi2 = (nMg2 ) * (nSi_sun/(nMg_sun)) ) / (10^0.3).

Wait, because:

nMg2 = (1e-5) *nH2.

nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

So,

nSi2 = (nMg2 * nSi_sun) / (nMg_sun * 10^0.3).

Substituting nMg2 and nMg_sun:

nSi2 = ( (1e-5 *nH2) *nSi_sun ) / ( (1e-5 *nH_sun) *10^0.3 ) ).

The 1e-5 cancels out:

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun) / (nH_sun *10^0.3).

Now, I can write this as:

nSi2 = (nH2 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /10^0.3).

Hmm. So, nSi2 is expressed in terms of nSi_sun and the H ratio.

But I'm not making progress because I don't know nSi_sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of the Sun's composition.

Wait, the problem is to find the ratio (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2).

So, let's write n_Si,1 and n_Si,2 in terms of their respective H and other elements.

From earlier, for Star_1:

n_Si,1 = (nH1 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *10^0.3.

Wait, no, let's go back to Star_1 again.

Wait, from [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3.

Which is log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

We also have [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 =nFe_sun *nH1/nH_sun.

So, substituting into nSi1:

nSi1 = (nFe1) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3 → [nFe_sun *nH1/nH_sun] * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

Simplify:

nSi1 = (nH1/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

So,

nSi1 = (nH1/nH_sun) * nSi_sun *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, from earlier steps, we have:

nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) /10^0.3.

Because from the earlier equation, nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * nSi_sun /10^0.3.

Wait, let me recheck that.

Wait, in the Star_2 case, I had:

nSi2 = (nH2 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /10^0.3).

Yes, because in the earlier step, nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun) / (nH_sun *10^0.3) → nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /10^0.3).

So, now I have expressions for both n_Si,1 and n_Si,2.

So, n_Si,1 = (nH1/nH_sun) * nSi_sun *10^0.3.

n_Si,2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * nSi_sun /10^0.3.

So, the ratio (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) is:

[ (nH1/nH_sun) * nSi_sun *10^0.3 ] / [ (nH2/nH_sun) *nSi_sun /10^0.3 ) ]

Simplify:

= [ (nH1 /nH_sun) / (nH2/nH_sun) ) ] * [ 10^0.3 / (1 /10^0.3) ) ].

nH_sun cancels out.

= (nH1/nH2) * (10^0.3 * 10^0.3) )

= (nH1/nH2) *10^(0.6).

Now, what is the ratio nH1/nH2?

Wait, the problem doesn't give any information about the H abundances of the stars. So, perhaps I can assume that the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun? That is, [H]_1 = [H]_2 = same as Sun. But wait, I don't have any data about [H] for either star. Wait, the given data are [Fe/H], [Mg/H], [Si/Fe], [Mg/Si].

Wait, because [Fe/H]_1=0, that means Star_1 has the same Fe/H as the Sun. But H is the denominator in these ratios, so if [Fe/H] is zero, Fe is same as Sun, but what about H?

Wait, H is the denominator, so if [X/H] is zero, the X abundance is same as the Sun. So, [H] would be [H/H] =0, which is trivial.

Hmm, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as it is in the Sun. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the ratio nH1/nH2 is 1, meaning same H in both. But that's an assumption.

Wait, but without knowing, I can't proceed. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem doesn't require knowing the absolute H abundances because the H cancels out. Let me think.

Wait, the ratio of n_Si1 to n_Si2 is:

(n_Si1 /n_Si2) = (nH1/nH2) *10^0.6.

But if the stars are in LTE and we're using EW method, maybe the H lines are used to determine the scale. So, perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun. So, nH1 = nH_sun * 1e([H]_1), but [H]_1 is not given. Wait, but [Fe/H]_1=0, which implies Fe/H is same as the Sun, which is [Fe/H]_1=0. So, nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1 /nH_sun).

But without knowing [H]_1 or [H]_2, I can't find nH1/nH2.

Wait, but perhaps the problem doesn't require knowing nH, and the ratio nH1/nH2 is 1. That is, the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars. But I don't know if that's a valid assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the ratio (nH1/nH2) is 1, so the H abundance is the same in both stars, perhaps because they have the same [Fe/H], but that's not given.

Wait, let's look at the given data again.

For Star_1: [Fe/H]=0, so Fe abundance is same as Sun.

Star_2: [Mg/H]=0, so Mg abundance same as Sun.

But no data about H in either star beyond that.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the H abundance is same in both stars as in the Sun, so nH1 =nH2 =nH_sun.

Wait, but that's an assumption. Let me proceed under that assumption and see if it works. If that's the case, then nH1/nH2 =1.

Then the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2) would be 10^0.6.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is about 3.98, so the answer could be option A) ~3.9.

But wait, let me compute it more accurately.

10^0.6= antilog(0.6)= 10^(6/10) = cube root of 10^(0.6*3/2) ? Alternatively, using known values:

10^0.6 ≈ 3.981.

So, approximately 3.98, which rounds to about 3.9, which is option A.

But wait, let me check if the assumption that nH1/nH2=1 is correct.

Wait, because [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

That doesn't imply that nH1 is the same as in the Sun, because nH1 could be higher or lower, as long as nFe1 is proportionally adjusted.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

Again, doesn't fix nH2.

But without knowing the [H] for either star, I can't find the ratio nH1/nH2. So, perhaps I have made a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the problem is expecting that the ratio of H is the same in both stars as in the Sun, so nH1 =nH2 =nH_sun.

But that is an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the ratio cancels out.

Wait, wait, the problem says to assume LTE and use EW method. The EW method relies on measuring equivalent widths of absorption lines, which would depend on the abundance of the element and the overall continuum, which depends on the star's temperature and gravity, but perhaps for this problem, we can assume that the H abundance is same in both stars.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun. Let me proceed with that and see what the answer would be.

So, under nH1 =nH2 =nH_sun.

Then, the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2) =10^0.6 ≈3.98 → option A.

But wait, another possibility: the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2) is (10^0.3)^2 =10^0.6 ≈3.98. So that would be answer A.

So, I think the correct answer is A) ~3.9.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar composition. The key steps are as follows:

### Given Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]₁ = 0 dex → \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
   - [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 dex → \( \log(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log(n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) + 0.3 \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]₂ = 0 dex → \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
   - [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 dex → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log(n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) + 0.3 \).

3. **Solar Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
From [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3:
\[
\log(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log(n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) + 0.3
\]
\[
n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}} = (n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
\]
Using [Fe/H]₁ = 0:
\[
n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \implies n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}).
\]
Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} \) into the expression for \( n_{\text{Si,1}} \):
\[
n_{\text{Si,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,1}} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
\]
\[
n_{\text{Si,1}} = (n_{\text{Fe,sun}} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
\]
\[
n_{\text{Si,1}} = (n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot n_{\text{Si,sun}} \cdot 10^{0.3}.
\]

#### For Star_2:
From [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3:
\[
\log(n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log(n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) + 0.3.
\]
\[
n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}} = (n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
\]
Using [Mg/H]₂ = 0:
\[
n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \implies n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}).
\]
Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} \) into the expression for \( n_{\text{Si,2}} \):
\[
n_{\text{Si,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,2}} / \left[(n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3}\right].
\]
\[
n_{\text{Si,2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}})}{(n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3}}.
\]
\[
n_{\text{Si,2}} = (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot n_{\text{Si,sun}} / 10^{0.3}.
\]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{(n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot n_{\text{Si,sun}} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{(n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot n_{\text{Si,sun}} / 10^{0.3}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,2}}}{1} \cdot \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{1}.
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} \cdot 10^{0.6}.
\]

#### Assumption:
The problem does not provide explicit data about the hydrogen abundances (\( n_{\text{H,1}} \) and \( n_{\text{H,2}} \)). To proceed, we assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun, i.e., \( n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = 1 \). This simplifies the ratio to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

#### Final Calculation:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \implies \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} \approx 3.9.
