Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about isomers and some specific compounds. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question is asking about two parts: A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism. Then I have to choose the correct option from A to D.

First, I'll tackle part A. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I'm trying to remember what tautomerism is. Tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and a shift of electrons, usually between positions, like in keto-enol tautomerism. For that to happen, there must be adjacent carbonyl groups or a conjugated system that allows the hydrogen to shift, right?

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which has two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups connected by a benzene ring. So the structure is like O=C6H4=O, but with the benzene ring in between. So the two carbonyls are opposite each other on the benzene. But for tautomerism, I think the carbonyl groups need to be adjacent or in a position that allows a hydrogen shift. Benzoquinone's structure doesn't have adjacent carbonyls; they're on opposite ends. So maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism?

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's about whether the carbonyl groups can shift a hydrogen. In quinones, I think they can tautomerize. For example, benzoguinone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism because the two carbonyl groups are conjugated. So when a hydrogen moves, it changes between the two rings. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize because the two carbonyls are too far apart.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups around a cyclohexane ring. So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C around the ring. Wait, no, 1,3,5-trione would have carbonyls at positions 1, 3, and 5, so every other carbon. So the ring is symmetric. Does this compound undergo tautomerism?

Wait, another thought. Tautomerism happens when there's a conjugated diene or some conjugation that allows the hydrogen to shift. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyl groups are every other carbon. So maybe there's a possibility for a hydrogen to move between two adjacent carbonyls, like in a keto-enol form.

Wait, but wait. Benzoquinone has two carbonyls on opposite ends of a benzene ring, which is a conjugated system. So perhaps it can tautomerize. Let me think. Benzoquinone can tautomerize to a dihydroxybenzene structure. Oh, wait, that's called hydroquinone. So benzoquinone and hydroquinone are tautomers. So benzoquinone does show tautomerism? Then which of the two given compounds does NOT show tautomerism?

Wait, the question is part A: which one does not show tautomerism. So if benzoquinone can tautomerize, then the one that can't must be the other compound.

Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Let me think about that. That's a ring with three carbonyl groups. How would tautomerism work here? Each carbonyl is separated by a single bond (since it's 1,3,5). So between each carbonyl is a CH group, right? So maybe each CH could potentially lose a hydrogen and form an enol, but wait, this is a cyclic system. Let me think about the structure.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three carbonyl groups is opposite a CH2 group? Or is it CH groups? Wait, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CO? No, wait, no. Wait, no, cyclohexane has six carbons. 1,3,5-trione would have carbonyls on carbons 1,3,5. So each of those three carbons is double-bonded to O, and the other three are CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1,3,5. So the structure is like O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2, but that's a cycle. So each carbonyl is separated by two CH2 groups. Hmm, but that might not allow for tautomerism. Because for tautomerism, you usually need adjacent carbonyls or a conjugated system that allows the hydrogen shift.

Wait, if I have three carbonyls in a row, like in something like (O=C-O-C=O), but wait, that's not the case here. In trione, perhaps each carbonyl is in a position where a hydrogen could move, but perhaps the structure is such that it's rigid, or maybe the conjugation isn't right. Alternatively, maybe the trione can't tautomerize because there's no conjugated diene to allow the shift.

Wait, another angle: which of these compounds can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Benzoquinone is a dienone, so it can tautomerize. But cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a triketone. Let me think: could it tautomerize? Maybe not because all the carbonyl groups are separated by CH2 groups. So maybe it can't form enol tautomers because the necessary conjugation isn't present.

Wait, but wait. If a molecule has multiple adjacent carbonyl groups, like two in a row, then tautomerism is possible. Like in diketones, if adjacent, they can tautomerize. But in 1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is separated by a CH2, so no two are adjacent. So perhaps the molecule can't tautomerize, unlike benzoquinone.

So, if part A is which doesn't show tautomerism, then the answer would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Because benzoquinone does show tautomerism, as it can form hydroquinone.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. For tautomerism, the molecule needs to have a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group, which can shift, leading to the formation of an enol or keto form.

In benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O. Wait, no, that's not the case. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups attached to a benzene ring, each connected by a single bond. So each O is double-bonded to a carbon, which is attached to the benzene. So each carbonyl is on a benzene ring. So, the structure is O=C6H4=O? No, actually, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms connected via a single bond, each double bonded to a benzene carbon.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So the two carbonyls are across from each other on the benzene. So, in the para positions.

In that case, each carbonyl is connected to a benzene ring. Now, can such a structure undergo tautomerism? I think it can. Benzoquinone can tautomerize to hydroquinone, which has two hydroxyl groups on the benzene. So, yes, benzoquinone does tautomerize.

Therefore, among the two compounds, benzoquinone can tautomerize, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione cannot. So part A's answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione as the one that doesn't show tautomerism. So A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Moving on to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, making it capable of rotating plane-polarized light. So I need to check each compound for the presence of a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw its structure. The formula would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2-COOCH3? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is OHC-CH(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, no, let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, no, wait.

Wait, the formula of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But when it's the ester, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it step by step.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the chain is three carbons: COOH is on the third carbon. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon: structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be methyl ester: the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but in this case, is there a chiral center? Let's see. The central carbon (the second carbon) has an OH, a CH2COOCH3 group, and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon is attached to: OH, CH2COOCH3, CH3? No, wait, let's see: the first carbon is CH3, the second is CH2, but wait, maybe I'm confusing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to number the chain. Let's consider the acid as HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the formula is CH3CH(OH)COOH. No, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, perhaps I should think about the structure.

Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the three carbons are: CH3-CH2-COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the middle carbon (the second carbon). So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, that's a four-carbon chain? No, wait, no. Wait, no, propanoic acid is three carbons: the first is CH3, the second is CH2, the third is COOH. So the middle is CH2, so 2-hydroxy would be on the middle, which is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, but that's four carbons. No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So the middle carbon is CH(OH), connected to two CH2 groups? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as the acid being HOOC-CH2-CH3? No, that's not right. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the ester. For methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH2- ?

Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propanoate ester. So the ester is OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)- ?

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure.

The ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. So the acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH of the COOH becomes OMe. So the structure becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, so the structure is: methyl group (OCH3) attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH2(OH) group, which is attached to a CH3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting the order wrong.

Wait, the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH? No, that can't be right because that's four carbons. Hmm, maybe it's better to think that 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, that's three carbons: the first is CH2(OH), the second is CH2, and the third is COOH. So when esterified, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the second carbon (the CH2) is connected to the OH group, another CH2, and the COOCH3. Wait, that's not a chiral center because for a chiral center, you need four different substituents. Let me look: the CH2 group in question is attached to:

- CH2(OH) (from the first carbon)
- CH2COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- Two Hs?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon is CH2. So the middle carbon is attached to:

- The first CH2 group (which has the OH)
- The third carbon (which is COOCH3)
- Two hydrogens.

Wait, that's only three substituents. So the middle carbon isn't a chiral center because it's attached to two identical groups (the two CH2 groups and the two Hs). So there's no chiral center here. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the hydroxyl is on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl, making that carbon a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: the formula of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, that would make the second carbon attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- COOCH3 (from the third)
- OH
- H

So the four substituents are: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. All four are different, so that's a chiral center. Oh! So in that case, the compound would have a chiral center and thus exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, so perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me confirm. If the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, then the middle carbon (carbon 2) has four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So yes, that's a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: maybe I got the structure wrong. Let me clarify. The IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is the ester of propanoic acid, which is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH3CH2COOCH3. But with a hydroxyl at position 2, it would be on the second carbon of the propanoate.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon (carbon 2) is CH2, attached to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2COOCH3
- Two Hs.

Wait, so that's only three substituents. So it's not a chiral center. So no optical isomerism?

Hmm, this is confusing. I think I might be mixing up the structure. Let me think again. The correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Because the parent acid is propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH?), and 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the middle carbon is CH(OH), connected to CH3, COOCH3, and H. So substituents are:

- CH3 (methyl)
- COOCH3 (ester group)
- OH (hydroxyl)
- H (hydrogen)

So all four substituents are different. Therefore, that carbon is a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus can exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the middle carbon (C2) is attached to:

- C1: CH3
- C3: COOCH3
- OH
- H

So yes, four different groups. Therefore, it's a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can show optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait. No, maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but when it loses water, it becomes fumaric acid, which is the cis diacid. When esterified, dimethyl fumarate would be the di-ester: CH2CH(COOCH3)2. Or, more accurately, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? Wait, no.

Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure: (COOCH3)CH-CH2(COOCH3). No, wait, fumarate is the trans isomer, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the structure is:

O
|| 
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
|

Wait, no, more accurately, it's:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is trans, so the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but that's incorrect. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is actually the cis diacid, but wait, no, maleic acid is the cis and fumaric acid is the trans? I might be getting this mixed up. Let me clarify.

Actually, maleic acid is the cis diacid: the two carboxylic acid groups are on the same side of the double bond. Fumaric acid is the trans diacid.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid. So the structure would be (CH2)2(COOCH3)2, but with a double bond.

Wait, no, the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
|

So, it's a trans configuration, with each COOCH3 group on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester.

Now, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Let's see. The molecule has a double bond, but each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH3 groups? Wait, no.

Wait, wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 group attached. Let me draw it:

- One carbon (C1) is CH2 connected to a double bond.
- The other carbon (C2) is CH connected to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond.

Wait, no, wait. Structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

(CH2)COOCH3
   \ 
    C=C
   /
CH2COOCH3

No, that's not right. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, no, fumarate comes from fumaric acid, which is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, no, wait, that's succinic acid. I'm getting confused.

Wait, maleic acid is cis-butenedioic acid: HO2C-CHCH2-CO2H, but the two COOH groups are on adjacent carbons with a double bond between them, and in the cis configuration. Fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid: same structure but trans.

So when you esterify fumaric acid with methanol, you get the diester. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration.

Wait, so each of the double-bonded carbons (C1 and C2) is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Wait, no, perhaps each is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a CH3 group? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
  \
   C=C
  /
O-C-OCH3
O

But arranged with the substituents trans.

But regardless, the key point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. Let's consider each carbon in the double bond. Each of them is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups? No, perhaps each is attached to a COOCH3, a CH2, and two other groups. Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps each of the double-bonded carbons (let's call them C and C') has a structure like:

C: attached to COOCH3, CH2, and double bond to C'.

C': attached to another COOCH3, another CH2, and double bond to C.

Wait, no, I'm not getting it right. Let me think of the actual structure.

Fumarate is the trans ester. So the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, no, that can't be right because each carbon can only have four bonds. Let me think again. Each of the double-bonded carbons is connected to two substituents. So:

Each carbon (C1 and C2) is bonded to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH2 group (maybe from the other end)
Wait, perhaps not. Maybe each is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O

But in the trans configuration. So each of the double-bonded carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups? No, I think each is attached to a COOCH3 and on the other side, a CH2COOCH3 group? Not sure, but perhaps I should think about symmetry.

If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't have a chiral center. Let's see: dimethyl fumarate is a trans diester. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the molecule is symmetric. The two ester groups are mirror images of each other across the double bond. Therefore, the molecule is not chiral because it's symmetrical. So it doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Wait, each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So each carbon in the double bond has two identical groups. So, even if the molecule is symmetric, the individual carbons might not be chiral centers.

Wait, for a carbon to be a chiral center, it needs four distinct substituents. In dimethyl fumarate, each of the double-bonded carbons is attached to:

- Two COOCH3 groups (but same on both sides? No, wait, each is attached to one COOCH3 on each end.

Wait, perhaps each double-bonded carbon is attached to two different groups. Let me think again: each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, but the arrangement around the double bond is trans.

Wait, no, perhaps each is attached to a COOCH3 and another substituent, but I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule lacks a chiral center because of its symmetry. Since each side is a mirror image, the molecule is achiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, to recap:

- Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3), so it shows optical isomerism.
- Dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical and has no chiral centers, so it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate had a chiral center, but if the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the middle carbon isn't a chiral center. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look up the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Upon checking, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is CH3-CHOH-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which would be an achiral molecule because the central carbon is connected to two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Another approach: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (CH3)COHCH2COOH? No, that's not right. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH.

Wait, but that's four carbons. No, propanoic acid has three carbons: CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the second carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2COOCH3
- Two hydrogens.

But that's only three different groups. So the central carbon isn't a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. So which is correct?

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me try another approach: maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the same as methyl glycolate. Glycolic acid is CH2(OH)COOH, so methyl glycolate would be CH2(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, that's a two-carbon chain: CH2(OH) connected to COOCH3. So that would have a structure like CH2(OH)COOCH3. In that structure, the carbon adjacent to the OH is CH2, which isn't a chiral center. So methyl glycolate doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, but methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which has three carbons. So perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

Wait, that's possible. Then the middle carbon (CHOH) would be attached to:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- H

Wait, that would make four different groups, so a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center and show optical isomerism.

But I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternative approach:

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the formula is C3H6O3.

Wait, the molecular formula is C3H6O3. The structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C(OH)H
   /
CH3

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. In that case, the middle carbon (C) has four different substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So it's a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Yes, that's correct. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate, as discussed earlier, has a structure that is symmetrical across the double bond (trans configuration), so it's achiral and doesn't have optical isomers.

So, part B is which one shows optical isomerism. The answer would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait. Earlier, I thought that dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical and thus not chiral. But another thought: perhaps fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So the correct answer is that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting conclusions about the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think again. If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the middle carbon is a chiral center. So the molecule has optical isomerism.

So, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism, and dimethyl fumarate does not.

Now, putting it all together.

Part A: The compound that does not show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Part B: The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So looking at the options:

Option C says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B is dimethyl fumarate. But part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option A says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That matches.

Option D says A is benzoquinone, B is dimethyl fumarate. Both are wrong.

Option B says A is benzoquinone, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. A is wrong, so B is partially correct.

Wait, the options are:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → correct.

B) A = benzoquinone (wrong), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (correct).

C) A = cyclohexane..., B = dimethyl fumarate (wrong).

D) A = benzoquinone (wrong), B = dimethyl fumarate (wrong).

So the correct option is A: A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and a shift of electrons, typically between carbonyl groups. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring. It can undergo tautomerism, forming hydroquinone. Therefore, benzoquinone shows tautomerism.
2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three carbonyl groups on a cyclohexane ring, positioned at alternating carbons. The carbonyl groups are not adjacent, and there is no conjugated system to allow a hydrogen shift. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, which requires four different substituents attached to a single carbon atom.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-C(OH)H-COOCH₃. The second carbon (C) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, so methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.
2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is a trans diester with the structure (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH₃)₂. The molecule is symmetrical across the double bond, and no carbon atom has four different substituents. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results from Part A and Part B, the correct option is:

**A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

---

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about isomers and some specific compounds. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question is asking about two parts: A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism. Then I have to choose the correct option from A to D.

First, I'll tackle part A. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I'm trying to remember what tautomerism is. Tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and a shift of electrons, usually between positions, like in keto-enol tautomerism. For that to happen, there must be adjacent carbonyl groups or a conjugated system that allows the hydrogen to shift, right?

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which has two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups connected by a benzene ring. So the structure is like O=C6H4=O, but with the benzene ring in between. So the two carbonyls are opposite each other on the benzene. But for tautomerism, I think the carbonyl groups need to be adjacent or in a position that allows a hydrogen shift. Benzoquinone's structure doesn't have adjacent carbonyls; they're on opposite ends. So maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism?

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's about whether the carbonyl groups can shift a hydrogen. In quinones, I think they can tautomerize. For example, benzoguinone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism because the two carbonyl groups are conjugated. So when a hydrogen moves, it changes between the two rings. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize because the two carbonyls are too far apart.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups around a cyclohexane ring. So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C around the ring. Wait, no, 1,3,5-trione would have carbonyls at positions 1, 3, and 5, so every other carbon. So the ring is symmetric. Does this compound undergo tautomerism?

Wait, another thought. Tautomerism happens when there's a conjugated diene or some conjugation that allows the hydrogen to shift. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyl groups are every other carbon. So maybe there's a possibility for a hydrogen to move between two adjacent carbonyls, like in a keto-enol form.

Wait, but wait. Benzoquinone has two carbonyls on opposite ends of a benzene ring, which is a conjugated system. So perhaps it can tautomerize. Let me think. Benzoquinone can tautomerize to a dihydroxybenzene structure. Oh, wait, that's called hydroquinone. So benzoquinone and hydroquinone are tautomers. So benzoquinone does show tautomerism? Then which of the two given compounds does NOT show tautomerism?

Wait, the question is part A: which one does not show tautomerism. So if benzoquinone can tautomerize, then the one that can't must be the other compound.

Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Let me think about that. That's a ring with three carbonyl groups. How would tautomerism work here? Each carbonyl is separated by a single bond (since it's 1,3,5). So between each carbonyl is a CH group, right? So maybe each CH could potentially lose a hydrogen and form an enol, but wait, this is a cyclic system. Let me think about the structure.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three carbonyl groups is opposite a CH2 group? Or is it CH groups? Wait, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CO? No, wait, no. Wait, no, cyclohexane has six carbons. 1,3,5-trione would have carbonyls on carbons 1,3,5. So each of those three carbons is double-bonded to O, and the other three are CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1,3,5. So the structure is like O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2, but that's a cycle. So each carbonyl is separated by two CH2 groups. Hmm, but that might not allow for tautomerism. Because for tautomerism, you usually need adjacent carbonyls or a conjugated system that allows the hydrogen shift.

Wait, if I have three carbonyls in a row, like in something like (O=C-O-C=O), but wait, that's not the case here. In trione, perhaps each carbonyl is in a position where a hydrogen could move, but perhaps the structure is such that it's rigid, or maybe the conjugation isn't right. Alternatively, maybe the trione can't tautomerize because there's no conjugated diene to allow the shift.

Wait, another angle: which of these compounds can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Benzoquinone is a dienone, so it can tautomerize. But cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a triketone. Let me think: could it tautomerize? Maybe not because all the carbonyl groups are separated by CH2 groups. So maybe it can't form enol tautomers because the necessary conjugation isn't present.

Wait, but wait. If a molecule has multiple adjacent carbonyl groups, like two in a row, then tautomerism is possible. Like in diketones, if adjacent, they can tautomerize. But in 1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is separated by a CH2, so no two are adjacent. So perhaps the molecule can't tautomerize, unlike benzoquinone.

So, if part A is which doesn't show tautomerism, then the answer would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Because benzoquinone does show tautomerism, as it can form hydroquinone.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. For tautomerism, the molecule needs to have a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group, which can shift, leading to the formation of an enol or keto form.

In benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O. Wait, no, that's not the case. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups attached to a benzene ring, each connected by a single bond. So each O is double-bonded to a carbon, which is attached to the benzene. So each carbonyl is on a benzene ring. So, the structure is O=C6H4=O? No, actually, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms connected via a single bond, each double bonded to a benzene carbon.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So the two carbonyls are across from each other on the benzene. So, in the para positions.

In that case, each carbonyl is connected to a benzene ring. Now, can such a structure undergo tautomerism? I think it can. Benzoquinone can tautomerize to hydroquinone, which has two hydroxyl groups on the benzene. So, yes, benzoquinone does tautomerize.

Therefore, among the two compounds, benzoquinone can tautomerize, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione cannot. So part A's answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione as the one that doesn't show tautomerism. So A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Moving on to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, making it capable of rotating plane-polarized light. So I need to check each compound for the presence of a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw its structure. The formula would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2-COOCH3? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is OHC-CH(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, no, let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, no, wait.

Wait, the formula of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But when it's the ester, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it step by step.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the chain is three carbons: COOH is on the third carbon. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon: structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be methyl ester: the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but in this case, is there a chiral center? Let's see. The central carbon (the second carbon) has an OH, a CH2COOCH3 group, and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon is attached to: OH, CH2COOCH3, CH3? No, wait, let's see: the first carbon is CH3, the second is CH2, but wait, maybe I'm confusing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to number the chain. Let's consider the acid as HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the formula is CH3CH(OH)COOH. No, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, perhaps I should think about the structure.

Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the three carbons are: CH3-CH2-COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the middle carbon (the second carbon). So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, that's a four-carbon chain? No, wait, no. Wait, no, propanoic acid is three carbons: the first is CH3, the second is CH2, the third is COOH. So the middle is CH2, so 2-hydroxy would be on the middle, which is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, but that's four carbons. No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So the middle carbon is CH(OH), connected to two CH2 groups? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as the acid being HOOC-CH2-CH3? No, that's not right. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the ester. For methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH2- ?

Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propanoate ester. So the ester is OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)- ?

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure.

The ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. So the acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH of the COOH becomes OMe. So the structure becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, so the structure is: methyl group (OCH3) attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH2(OH) group, which is attached to a CH3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting the order wrong.

Wait, the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH? No, that can't be right because that's four carbons. Hmm, maybe it's better to think that 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, that's three carbons: the first is CH2(OH), the second is CH2, and the third is COOH. So when esterified, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the second carbon (the CH2) is connected to the OH group, another CH2, and the COOCH3. Wait, that's not a chiral center because for a chiral center, you need four different substituents. Let me look: the CH2 group in question is attached to:

- CH2(OH) (from the first carbon)
- CH2COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- Two Hs?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon is CH2. So the middle carbon is attached to:

- The first CH2 group (which has the OH)
- The third carbon (which is COOCH3)
- Two hydrogens.

Wait, that's only three substituents. So the middle carbon isn't a chiral center because it's attached to two identical groups (the two CH2 groups and the two Hs). So there's no chiral center here. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the hydroxyl is on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl, making that carbon a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: the formula of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, that would make the second carbon attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- COOCH3 (from the third)
- OH
- H

So the four substituents are: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. All four are different, so that's a chiral center. Oh! So in that case, the compound would have a chiral center and thus exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, so perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me confirm. If the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, then the middle carbon (carbon 2) has four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So yes, that's a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: maybe I got the structure wrong. Let me clarify. The IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is the ester of propanoic acid, which is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH3CH2COOCH3. But with a hydroxyl at position 2, it would be on the second carbon of the propanoate.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon (carbon 2) is CH2, attached to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2COOCH3
- Two Hs.

Wait, so that's only three substituents. So it's not a chiral center. So no optical isomerism?

Hmm, this is confusing. I think I might be mixing up the structure. Let me think again. The correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Because the parent acid is propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH?), and 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the middle carbon is CH(OH), connected to CH3, COOCH3, and H. So substituents are:

- CH3 (methyl)
- COOCH3 (ester group)
- OH (hydroxyl)
- H (hydrogen)

So all four substituents are different. Therefore, that carbon is a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus can exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the middle carbon (C2) is attached to:

- C1: CH3
- C3: COOCH3
- OH
- H

So yes, four different groups. Therefore, it's a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can show optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait. No, maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but when it loses water, it becomes fumaric acid, which is the cis diacid. When esterified, dimethyl fumarate would be the di-ester: CH2CH(COOCH3)2. Or, more accurately, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? Wait, no.

Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure: (COOCH3)CH-CH2(COOCH3). No, wait, fumarate is the trans isomer, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the structure is:

O
|| 
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
|

Wait, no, more accurately, it's:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is trans, so the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but that's incorrect. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is actually the cis diacid, but wait, no, maleic acid is the cis and fumaric acid is the trans? I might be getting this mixed up. Let me clarify.

Actually, maleic acid is the cis diacid: the two carboxylic acid groups are on the same side of the double bond. Fumaric acid is the trans diacid.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid. So the structure would be (CH2)2(COOCH3)2, but with a double bond.

Wait, no, the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
|

So, it's a trans configuration, with each COOCH3 group on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester.

Now, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Let's see. The molecule has a double bond, but each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH3 groups? Wait, no.

Wait, wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 group attached. Let me draw it:

- One carbon (C1) is CH2 connected to a double bond.
- The other carbon (C2) is CH connected to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond.

Wait, no, wait. Structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

(CH2)COOCH3
   \ 
    C=C
   /
CH2COOCH3

No, that's not right. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, no, fumarate comes from fumaric acid, which is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, no, wait, that's succinic acid. I'm getting confused.

Wait, maleic acid is cis-butenedioic acid: HO2C-CHCH2-CO2H, but the two COOH groups are on adjacent carbons with a double bond between them, and in the cis configuration. Fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid: same structure but trans.

So when you esterify fumaric acid with methanol, you get the diester. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration.

Wait, so each of the double-bonded carbons (C1 and C2) is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Wait, no, perhaps each is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a CH3 group? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
  \
   C=C
  /
O-C-OCH3
O

But arranged with the substituents trans.

But regardless, the key point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. Let's consider each carbon in the double bond. Each of them is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups? No, perhaps each is attached to a COOCH3, a CH2, and two other groups. Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps each of the double-bonded carbons (let's call them C and C') has a structure like:

C: attached to COOCH3, CH2, and double bond to C'.

C': attached to another COOCH3, another CH2, and double bond to C.

Wait, no, I'm not getting it right. Let me think of the actual structure.

Fumarate is the trans ester. So the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, no, that can't be right because each carbon can only have four bonds. Let me think again. Each of the double-bonded carbons is connected to two substituents. So:

Each carbon (C1 and C2) is bonded to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH2 group (maybe from the other end)
Wait, perhaps not. Maybe each is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O

But in the trans configuration. So each of the double-bonded carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups? No, I think each is attached to a COOCH3 and on the other side, a CH2COOCH3 group? Not sure, but perhaps I should think about symmetry.

If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't have a chiral center. Let's see: dimethyl fumarate is a trans diester. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the molecule is symmetric. The two ester groups are mirror images of each other across the double bond. Therefore, the molecule is not chiral because it's symmetrical. So it doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Wait, each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So each carbon in the double bond has two identical groups. So, even if the molecule is symmetric, the individual carbons might not be chiral centers.

Wait, for a carbon to be a chiral center, it needs four distinct substituents. In dimethyl fumarate, each of the double-bonded carbons is attached to:

- Two COOCH3 groups (but same on both sides? No, wait, each is attached to one COOCH3 on each end.

Wait, perhaps each double-bonded carbon is attached to two different groups. Let me think again: each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, but the arrangement around the double bond is trans.

Wait, no, perhaps each is attached to a COOCH3 and another substituent, but I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule lacks a chiral center because of its symmetry. Since each side is a mirror image, the molecule is achiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, to recap:

- Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3), so it shows optical isomerism.
- Dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical and has no chiral centers, so it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate had a chiral center, but if the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the middle carbon isn't a chiral center. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look up the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Upon checking, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is CH3-CHOH-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which would be an achiral molecule because the central carbon is connected to two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Another approach: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (CH3)COHCH2COOH? No, that's not right. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH.

Wait, but that's four carbons. No, propanoic acid has three carbons: CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the second carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2COOCH3
- Two hydrogens.

But that's only three different groups. So the central carbon isn't a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. So which is correct?

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me try another approach: maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the same as methyl glycolate. Glycolic acid is CH2(OH)COOH, so methyl glycolate would be CH2(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, that's a two-carbon chain: CH2(OH) connected to COOCH3. So that would have a structure like CH2(OH)COOCH3. In that structure, the carbon adjacent to the OH is CH2, which isn't a chiral center. So methyl glycolate doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, but methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which has three carbons. So perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

Wait, that's possible. Then the middle carbon (CHOH) would be attached to:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- H

Wait, that would make four different groups, so a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center and show optical isomerism.

But I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternative approach:

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the formula is C3H6O3.

Wait, the molecular formula is C3H6O3. The structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C(OH)H
   /
CH3

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. In that case, the middle carbon (C) has four different substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So it's a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Yes, that's correct. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate, as discussed earlier, has a structure that is symmetrical across the double bond (trans configuration), so it's achiral and doesn't have optical isomers.

So, part B is which one shows optical isomerism. The answer would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait. Earlier, I thought that dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical and thus not chiral. But another thought: perhaps fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So the correct answer is that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting conclusions about the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think again. If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the middle carbon is a chiral center. So the molecule has optical isomerism.

So, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism, and dimethyl fumarate does not.

Now, putting it all together.

Part A: The compound that does not show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Part B: The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So looking at the options:

Option C says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B is dimethyl fumarate. But part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option A says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That matches.

Option D says A is benzoquinone, B is dimethyl fumarate. Both are wrong.

Option B says A is benzoquinone, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. A is wrong, so B is partially correct.

Wait, the options are:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → correct.

B) A = benzoquinone (wrong), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (correct).

C) A = cyclohexane..., B = dimethyl fumarate (wrong).

D) A = benzoquinone (wrong), B = dimethyl fumarate (wrong).

So the correct option is A: A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and a shift of electrons, typically between carbonyl groups. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring. It can undergo tautomerism, forming hydroquinone. Therefore, benzoquinone shows tautomerism.
2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three carbonyl groups on a cyclohexane ring, positioned at alternating carbons. The carbonyl groups are not adjacent, and there is no conjugated system to allow a hydrogen shift. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, which requires four different substituents attached to a single carbon atom.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-C(OH)H-COOCH₃. The second carbon (C) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, so methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.
2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is a trans diester with the structure (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH₃)₂. The molecule is symmetrical across the double bond, and no carbon atom has four different substituents. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results from Part A and Part B, the correct option is:

**A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

---

**Answer: A**
