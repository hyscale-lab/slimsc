Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with toluene. Let me break down each step and see what each product might be.

First step: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitration usually occurs in such conditions. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene. Nitration would add a nitro group. Where does it go? The methyl group is an activating group, so the nitration should occur at the para position. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Toluene has methyl attached. Nitration of toluene gives a nitro group either in para or sometimes ortho, but more predominantly para. Yeah, so product 1 is 4-nitro toluene.

Second step: Product 1 (para-nitrotoluene) is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. Hmm, MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. I think in acidic conditions, especially with H2SO4, it can oxidize nitro groups. Oh wait, nitro groups can be reduced, but wait, in this case, maybe it's the oxidation of the nitro group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, nitration gives a nitro group. Then treating with MnO2 and H2SO4—I think that's a nitration reduction or oxidation?

Wait, another thought. Maybe it's the oxidation of the methyl group. Oh, but the methyl group is attached to benzene, which is already a substituent. Oh, wait, when you have a nitro group, which is a strong deactivating group, so the methyl group is next to it. Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nitration followed by something else.

Wait, wait, no. Another approach. The second step is treating the nitro compound with MnO2 and H2SO4. Oh, MnO2 in H2SO4 is a condition for the oxidation of nitro groups to carboxylic acids. Wait, nitro group → upon strong oxidation, maybe becomes a carboxylic acid. So for example, nitrotoluene, when oxidized, would the methyl group be transformed?

Wait, para-nitrotoluene has a methyl and nitro group on benzene. If we oxidize the methyl group, perhaps. Oh, wait. Wait, no. The nitro group is a meta-directing group. But in this case, the reaction is not about directing but about transforming the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is being reduced. Oh, wait, MnO2 is usually a mild oxidizing agent. But wait, in H2SO4, maybe it's a different context. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is being converted into something else.

Wait, another possibility: para-nitrotoluene undergoes nitration and then something else. Wait, maybe the MnO2 is for oxidation of the nitro group. So, nitro group (NO2) is converted into a COOH group. So, after oxidation, the methyl group is attached to the benzene ring, and the nitro group becomes a carboxylic acid. So product 2 would be benzoic acid with a methyl group in the para position. Wait, but that would be 4-methylbenzoic acid, or also known as para-methylbenzoic acid.

Wait, but wait, the nitro group is in the para position relative to the methyl. So when the nitro group (NO2) at position 4 is oxidized to COOH, then the structure becomes benzene with methyl at position 1 and COOH at position 4?

Wait, no. Let me think. Toluene is benzene with methyl at position 1. Then nitration adds NO2 in para, which would be position 4. So when product 1 is para-nitrotoluene, then product 2 would be the product of oxidizing that nitro group to COOH. So the structure becomes benzene with methyl at position 1 and COOH at position 4. So the substituents are at 1 and 4 positions.

Wait, but wait: when you oxidize a nitro group attached to a benzene ring, what happens? The nitro group is -NO2. Oxidation would typically convert it to -COOH. So yes, product 2 would be 4-methylbenzoic acid.

Third step: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds like a Claisen condensation or some kind of aldol reaction. Wait, acetone is (propan-2-one). Under basic conditions, acetone can undergo condensation reactions, like the formation of a beta-hydroxy ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. Another thought: when you have sodium hydroxide and acetone, perhaps it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Bayer-Villiger oxidation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a saponification, but product 2 is an acid, so maybe it's esterifying.

Wait, product 2 is 4-methylbenzoic acid. When you treat an acid with acetone and NaOH, perhaps it's forming an acetylated product. Wait, maybe it's an ester? No, but wait, acetone is a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's undergoing a nucleophilic attack. Or maybe it's forming a saponified ester if it were an ester, but product 2 is an acid.

Wait, another approach. Maybe product 2 is 4-methylbenzoic acid. When treated with acetone and aqueous NaOH, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution occurs. But where would the substitution be?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the structure. 4-methylbenzoic acid has a COOH group and a methyl group on the benzene ring. Now, when you treat an acid with acetone and a base, perhaps you're doing an acetylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's treating the acid with acetone to form an acetylated derivative, like an ester.

Wait, but wait, 4-methylbenzoic acid has a COOH group. Maybe the reaction is forming a mixed anhydride or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group, but the COOH is a good leaving group?

Alternatively, another thought: Maybe it's forming an acid chloride first, but that's not the case here because the conditions are acetone and aqueous NaOH.

Wait, perhaps it's a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The Claisen-Schmidt condensation occurs between ketones and aldehydes in basic conditions, forming a β,γ-unsaturated ketone. But product 2 is an acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the benzoic acid is being converted into its conjugate base, the benzoate ion. Then, maybe the acetone is undergoing nucleophilic attack. Or perhaps acetone is acting as a nucleophile.

Wait, maybe it's the formation of a benzil derivative. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group, but I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that's done with acylium ions, which usually involves AlCl3 as a catalyst. But in this case, the conditions are different.

Alternatively, maybe the 4-methylbenzoic acid is being decarboxylated. Wait, under certain conditions, benzoic acid can lose CO2. But with acetone and NaOH, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, maybe the reaction is forming a benzoin. That's when two aldehydes condense in basic conditions, but I'm not sure about that here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the third step again. Product 2 is 4-methylbenzoic acid. It's treated with acetone and aqueous NaOH. So, acetone is (CH3)2CO. Under aqueous NaOH, perhaps it's a base-catalyzed reaction.

Wait, maybe the benzoic acid is converted into a sodium benzoate. Then, acetone can undergo some kind of nucleophilic attack. Wait, but acetone's carbonyl isn't very reactive towards nucleophiles unless it's activated. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen condensation between acetone and the sodium benzoate.

Wait, Claisen condensation typically involves two esters or two ketones. But sodium benzoate is a salt of a benzoic acid. Maybe it's a crossed Claisen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the acetone is undergoing aldol condensation. But for that, you usually need an aldehyde. Wait, but acetone is a ketone, so it can undergo aldol under certain conditions.

Wait, but in this case, the conditions are NaOH and acetone, and the presence of the benzoic acid derivative. Maybe the benzoate is acting as a base for the enolate formation.

Wait, perhaps the 4-methylbenzoic acid is deprotonated to form the benzoate ion, which is a strong base. Then, acetone, in the presence of a base, can form an enolate. The enolate could attack the carbonyl of another acetone molecule, leading to a dimer.

Wait, but without an aldehyde, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the benzoate is acting as an aromatic nucleophile, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is forming an acetylated derivative. For example, the carboxylic acid is converted into an acetylated ester. But how?

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. The benzoic acid's -COOH group is converted into an acetylated group like an ester using acetone. But typically, esterification would require an acid catalyst, not NaOH.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an acetylation using acetone in basic conditions. Wait, but acetylation usually uses acetyl chloride or similar; alternatively, in the presence of a base, perhaps it's forming an acetylated product through a different mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. Let me think about the steps again. Starting from toluene, nitration gives para-nitrotoluene. Then, oxidation with MnO2 and H2SO4 converts the nitro group to a COOH group, giving 4-methylbenzoic acid. Then, treated with acetone and aqueous NaOH.

Wait, maybe the 4-methylbenzoic acid is undergoing some kind of substitution. The COOH group is a good leaving group if deprotonated. So, in basic conditions, it becomes COO^- Na+. Then, acetone could attack the adjacent carbon (the methyl group?) but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the COOH group is being converted into an acetyl group. So, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would require an acylium ion, which isn't present here. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetylation via the formation of an acetylated benzoate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack on the benzene ring. Wait, but for that, you usually need a catalyst like AlCl3, which isn't present here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on the methyl group. But the methyl group is attached to benzene, which is a poor leaving group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the methyl group is being oxidized further. But in that case, with what reagents? MnO2 is an oxidizing agent, but in the second step, it was used with H2SO4. Now, in the third step, it's different reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 3 is a ketone formed by some oxidation. Wait, but I'm not getting it. Maybe I should think about the molecular symmetry group of product 3, which is the last step.

Wait, the question is asking about the molecular symmetry group of product 3. So perhaps I can figure out what product 3 is without knowing the exact structure, but by looking at its symmetry.

Wait, what determines the molecular symmetry group? It depends on the structure. For example, benzene has D6h symmetry, but when substituents are added, the symmetry reduces.

If product 3 is a molecule with certain symmetries, like having a plane of symmetry or a C2 axis, that would determine its point group.

But I'm a bit stuck on what product 3 is. Let's think again.

Product 2 is 4-methylbenzoic acid. Let's imagine its structure: benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4 (para to each other). Now, when product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous NaOH, perhaps it's undergoing a reaction that forms a new group attached to the ring.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the COOH group is being converted into a COOCH3 group (methyl ester). But that would require an esterification, which typically uses an alcohol and acid catalyst. But the reagents here are acetone and aqueous NaOH, so that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is undergoing a substitution. For instance, forming an acetylated derivative. Maybe it's a nucleophilic attack where the COO- group is a leaving group. But that would require a good leaving group, which COO^- isn't.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not on the benzoic acid part but on the methyl group. Could the methyl group undergo some oxidation or substitution?

Wait, if the methyl group is oxidized, it would become a carbonyl. But under what conditions? MnO2 in H2SO4 is for oxidation. Wait, no, that's in the second step. The third step is with acetone and NaOH.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group is undergoing some kind of elimination or substitution.

Wait, maybe the methyl group is being converted into a ketone. So, 4-methylbenzoic acid would become 4-formylbenzoic acid? But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group is being oxidized to a carbonyl group. So, the methyl (CH3) becomes a CO group. So the structure would be benzene with two substituents: COOH and CO (formyl) groups, para to each other.

Wait, so product 3 would be 4-formylbenzoic acid.

But wait, how would that happen from 4-methylbenzoic acid using acetone and NaOH?

Hmm. Another thought: Maybe the reaction is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. Claisen-Schmidt involves the base-induced condensation of aromatic aldehydes with ketones. But in this case, product 2 is 4-methylbenzoic acid, which is a carboxylic acid, not an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the COOH group is somehow converted into an aldehyde. But that would require a reduction, which isn't the case here.

Wait, maybe the benzoic acid is being decarboxylated to form benzene with a methyl group. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming an ortho ester or something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible product and its structure.

If product 3 is 4-formylbenzoic acid, what's its symmetry? Let's imagine the structure: benzene ring with a COOH group and a formyl (CHO) group para to each other.

So the molecule has two substituents opposite each other on the benzene ring: COOH and CHO. Now, what's the symmetry here?

Well, in this case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Because if you draw a mirror plane down the middle between the two substituents, each substituent is a mirror image of the other. So the point group would be C2h, which is option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the symmetry. The molecule has two substituents para to each other. So, each substituent is on opposite sides of the ring. So, the molecule has a center of inversion, right? Because each substituent is opposite the other.

Wait, no. Wait, if the substituents are the same, then inversion would leave the molecule unchanged. But in this case, the substituents are different: one is COOH, the other is CHO. So, inversion would swap them, which would change the molecule. Hence, no center of inversion.

Wait, but wait, in 4-formylbenzoic acid, the two substituents are different, so the molecule doesn't have a center of inversion. Then, what symmetry does it have?

If the substituents are opposite each other, the molecule would have a C2 axis perpendicular to the ring, passing through the center of the ring and the midpoints between the two substituents. But wait, with two different substituents, a C2 rotation would swap the substituents, but since they are different, it wouldn't leave the molecule unchanged. So maybe there's no C2 axis.

Wait, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Imagine a plane that bisects the ring between the two substituents. So, the plane is along the line connecting the two substituents. Then, each substituent would mirror the other. So, the molecule would have a mirror plane, making its point group Cs (which is option A).

Wait, but wait. If you have two different substituents opposite each other in a ring, the molecule has a plane of symmetry (a mirror plane) that lies between the two substituents. So, each substituent is the mirror image of the other. Hence, the point group would be Cs.

So, the symmetry group is Cs, which is option A.

But wait, another possibility: If the substituents are identical, then the point group would be D2h, which has more symmetry elements. But in our case, the substituents are different, so only a Cs symmetry would be present.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain about the structure of product 3. Let me recap the steps once more.

1. Toluene → nitration → para-nitrotoluene.

2. Oxidation of nitro to COOH → 4-methylbenzoic acid.

3. Reacted with acetone and NaOH. Hmm. Maybe the COOH group is being converted into another group.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the reaction is hydrolysis of some kind. But product 2 is a carboxylic acid, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzoic acid is undergoing a substitution where the COOH is replaced by an acetone-derived group.

Wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution. The COOH group is converted into an ester, but with what? Acetone has (CH3)2CO. So, perhaps the COOH group is being converted into an acetyl group via some mechanism.

Wait, but that would require something like a substitution where the -OH of the COOH is replaced by an acetyl group, which doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think the given reagents would allow that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the product 3 is something else. Let me try to think of another possibility.

Wait, when you have benzoic acid and you treat it with a base like NaOH, you get the sodium salt, sodium benzoate. Then, when you add acetone, perhaps it's undergoing a Claisen condensation. But Claisen is between esters, so perhaps not.

Wait, maybe the sodium benzoate is reacting with acetone in some way. For example, perhaps it's forming a benzoin condensation, but that usually involves two aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that product 3 is a ketone. So the benzene ring has a ketone group. How?

Wait, another approach: Maybe the benzoic acid is being converted into a benzaldehyde. But how? That would require a reduction, which isn't part of the given steps.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about product 2. Maybe product 2 isn't 4-methylbenzoic acid but something else.

Wait, let me re-examine the second step. Product 1 is para-nitrotoluene. When treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, which is a strong oxidizing condition. Perhaps MnO2 is acting as a catalyst in the oxidation of nitro groups.

Wait, some sources say that nitrobenzene can be oxidized to phenyl nitrobenzoate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another possibility is that the methyl group is getting oxidized.

Wait, para-nitrotoluene structure: benzene ring with methyl at position 1 and nitro at position 4. So, when oxidized, perhaps the methyl group is oxidized to a ketone.

Wait, oxidation of methyl to ketone would require a strong oxidizing agent. MnO2 in H2SO4 is a strong oxidizing condition. So, perhaps the methyl group (-CH3) is oxidized to a carbonyl group (-CO).

So, para-nitrotoluene upon oxidation would become 4-nitrobenzaldehyde? Wait, but wait, oxidation of methyl (CH3) to CO would give a benzaldehyde group.

Wait, but that would require breaking the CH3 and forming a carbonyl. So, product 2 would be 4-nitrobenzaldehyde?

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the methyl group is attached to the benzene ring. Wait, wait, the methyl group is attached to the benzene, so the structure is C6H5-CH2-NO2. Wait no, toluene is C6H5-CH3. So, para-nitrotoluene is C6H4(NO2)(CH3) at positions 1 and 4.

Wait, oxidizing the methyl group in para-nitrotoluene would require it to become a carbonyl group. But how? The methyl is attached to the benzene as a substituent. So, oxidation would convert CH3 into CO, but that's not possible because the substituent is -CH3 attached directly to the ring. Wait, wait, no, wait. The methyl group is attached to the benzene as a substituent. So, it's a benzyl group: CH2CH3? No, toluene is C6H5-CH3. So, in para-nitrotoluene, the structure is benzene with NO2 and CH3 groups opposite each other.

So, when you oxidize the CH3 group, perhaps it becomes a CO group. So, product 2 would be 4-methylnitrobenzaldehyde? No, wait, no, the methyl is CH3, so oxidizing it would give a CO group, but that would mean the methyl becomes a carbonyl. So, the structure would be benzene with NO2 and CO groups. But wait, the position would be 1 and 4 again.

Wait, but wait, if the methyl is oxidized to CO, then the substituent becomes a carbonyl group. So, the structure becomes 4-nitrobenzaldehyde? No, because the methyl is at position 1 and the nitro at 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out in my mind. Toluene is benzene with CH3 at position 1. After nitration, it's nitro group at position 4. So, structure is benzene with CH3 at 1 and NO2 at 4.

When oxidizing the methyl group, which is at position 1, to a carbonyl group, the structure becomes benzene with CO (as in formyl group) at position 1 and NO2 at position 4. So, product 2 would be 4-nitrobenzaldehyde? No, because aldehyde is CHO, which is a formyl group. So, product 2 is 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.

Wait, but then product 2 is 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. Then, step 3 is treatment with acetone and aqueous NaOH.

Hmm. So, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde treated with acetone and NaOH.

Wait, perhaps this is a condensation reaction. Benzaldehyde can undergo aldol condensation with ketones in basic conditions.

So, in the presence of a base like NaOH, benzaldehyde (as product 2) can react with acetone. The base deprotonates the alpha carbon of acetone, forming an enolate. The enolate attacks the benzaldehyde's carbonyl, leading to a β-hydroxy ketone, which can eliminate water to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone.

So, product 3 would be the conjugated enone. The structure would be a benzene ring with a nitro group at position 4 and a substituent that is an α,β-unsaturated ketone at position 1.

Wait, let me think about that structure. So, the benzaldehyde (CHO) at position 1 reacts with acetone to form a substituted cinnamaldehyde-like structure.

The product of the Claisen-Schmidt condensation between benzaldehyde and acetone would be 4-nitro-cinnamaldehyde derivative.

Wait, but wait, the starting benzaldehyde has a nitro group at position 4. So, after condensation, the structure would have a side chain attached to the benzene ring at position 1, which is a CH₂-C(O)-CH₂-CHO group or something similar.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The aldol condensation between benzaldehyde and acetone would form a structure where the benzaldehyde's aldehyde group is connected via a CH₂ group to the acetone's carbonyl. So, the structure would be benzalacetophenone or something like that.

Wait, more accurately, the aldol product would have a benzene ring with a substituent that is a propenyl group attached to a ketone. So, the structure would be C6H4(NO2)-CH₂-C(O)-CH3. Wait, but that's not right because in the aldol condensation, the two carbonyl compounds form a new double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is C6H4(NO2)-CH₂-CH(OH)-COCH3, but under basic conditions, this would eliminate water to form a double bond.

So, after elimination, the structure would be C6H4(NO2)-CH=CH-COCH3.

Wait, but the substituents on the benzene would be the nitro group and the new substituent. So, the benzene has a nitro group at position 4 and the new substituent at position 1, which is a propenyl group attached to a ketone.

Hmm. So the structure would be 4-nitro-1-(3-oxopropenyl)benzene or something along those lines.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 4-nitrostyryl acetophenone.

Now, what's the symmetry of this molecule?

The molecule has a benzene ring with a nitro group at position 4 and a substituent at position 1 that is a propenone group (CH₂-C(O)-CH3, but with a double bond).

Wait, so the substituents are at positions 1 and 4 on the benzene ring. The substituent at 1 is a propenone group (CH₂-C(O)-CH3, but in the enone form: CH₂=C(O)CH3? No, wait, the structure after elimination would be CH₂=CH-COCH3, but that may not be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH₂-CH₂-COCH3 group, but that's not correct because of the elimination.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure, but perhaps the key point is the positions of substituents and their symmetry.

Assuming that the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, both being different groups, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between them.

Wait, but if the substituent at position 1 is a group that has its own symmetry, that could influence the overall symmetry.

But regardless, the main ring has substituents opposite each other, leading to a plane of symmetry. So the point group would be Cs, which is option A.

But wait, another possibility: If the substituent on the benzene is a group that itself has a plane of symmetry, then the overall molecule might have more symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituent is a tri-substituted group, like a ketone with a double bond, the symmetry could be lower.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is symmetric enough that the entire molecule has a higher symmetry group.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let's think again about the point groups. The options are:

A) cs

B) d2h

C) c2h

D) c3

In the scenario where product 3 is 4-formylbenzoic acid, the substituents are COOH and CHO, which are different, leading to a Cs symmetry (a plane of symmetry between them).

But if product 3 is a more complex molecule with substituents that are mirror images, perhaps with a C2 axis, then the symmetry would be C2h, which is option C.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should think about the options. If the product has a plane of symmetry, it's Cs. If it has a C2 axis and a mirror plane, it could be C2h. If it has a three-fold axis, it's C3.

But in the case of the structure I'm considering, with substituents opposite each other, the symmetry is probably Cs.

So, the answer would be A) cs.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with toluene, leading to a final product whose molecular symmetry group is to be determined. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, resulting in nitration. The methyl group on toluene is an activating group, directing the nitro group to the para position. Thus, the product (Product 1) is **para-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).

2. **Reaction 2**: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄. MnO₂ in acidic conditions is a strong oxidizing agent. The nitro group (-NO₂) on the benzene ring is oxidized to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This converts para-nitrotoluene into **4-methylbenzoic acid** (benzoic acid with a methyl group at the para position).

3. **Reaction 3**: Product 2 (4-methylbenzoic acid) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. Under basic conditions, the methyl group (-CH₃) on the benzene ring is oxidized to a carbonyl group (-CO), forming **4-formylbenzoic acid**. The structure now has a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an aldehyde (-CHO) group at the para positions on the benzene ring.

4. **Symmetry Analysis**: The final product, 4-formylbenzoic acid, has two substituents (-COOH and -CHO) on opposite sides of the benzene ring. This creates a plane of symmetry between the two substituents. The molecule lacks a center of inversion due to the different nature of the substituents, but it retains a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecular symmetry group of the final product (Product 3) is **Cs**.

**Critical Evaluation of Options**:
- **A) Cs**: Correct. The molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two substituents, corresponding to the Cs point group.
- **B) D₂h**: Incorrect. This point group requires multiple symmetry elements (e.g., a center of inversion and multiple mirror planes), which are not present in the final product.
- **C) C₂h**: Incorrect. This point group requires a C₂ axis and a horizontal mirror plane, which are not present here.
- **D) C₃**: Incorrect. This point group requires a three-fold axis of rotation, which is not applicable to the structure of the final product.

**Answer**: A

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with toluene. Let me break down each step and see what each product might be.

First step: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitration usually occurs in such conditions. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene. Nitration would add a nitro group. Where does it go? The methyl group is an activating group, so the nitration should occur at the para position. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Toluene has methyl attached. Nitration of toluene gives a nitro group either in para or sometimes ortho, but more predominantly para. Yeah, so product 1 is 4-nitro toluene.

Second step: Product 1 (para-nitrotoluene) is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. Hmm, MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. I think in acidic conditions, especially with H2SO4, it can oxidize nitro groups. Oh wait, nitro groups can be reduced, but wait, in this case, maybe it's the oxidation of the nitro group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, nitration gives a nitro group. Then treating with MnO2 and H2SO4—I think that's a nitration reduction or oxidation?

Wait, another thought. Maybe it's the oxidation of the methyl group. Oh, but the methyl group is attached to benzene, which is already a substituent. Oh, wait, when you have a nitro group, which is a strong deactivating group, so the methyl group is next to it. Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nitration followed by something else.

Wait, wait, no. Another approach. The second step is treating the nitro compound with MnO2 and H2SO4. Oh, MnO2 in H2SO4 is a condition for the oxidation of nitro groups to carboxylic acids. Wait, nitro group → upon strong oxidation, maybe becomes a carboxylic acid. So for example, nitrotoluene, when oxidized, would the methyl group be transformed?

Wait, para-nitrotoluene has a methyl and nitro group on benzene. If we oxidize the methyl group, perhaps. Oh, wait. Wait, no. The nitro group is a meta-directing group. But in this case, the reaction is not about directing but about transforming the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is being reduced. Oh, wait, MnO2 is usually a mild oxidizing agent. But wait, in H2SO4, maybe it's a different context. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is being converted into something else.

Wait, another possibility: para-nitrotoluene undergoes nitration and then something else. Wait, maybe the MnO2 is for oxidation of the nitro group. So, nitro group (NO2) is converted into a COOH group. So, after oxidation, the methyl group is attached to the benzene ring, and the nitro group becomes a carboxylic acid. So product 2 would be benzoic acid with a methyl group in the para position. Wait, but that would be 4-methylbenzoic acid, or also known as para-methylbenzoic acid.

Wait, but wait, the nitro group is in the para position relative to the methyl. So when the nitro group (NO2) at position 4 is oxidized to COOH, then the structure becomes benzene with methyl at position 1 and COOH at position 4?

Wait, no. Let me think. Toluene is benzene with methyl at position 1. Then nitration adds NO2 in para, which would be position 4. So when product 1 is para-nitrotoluene, then product 2 would be the product of oxidizing that nitro group to COOH. So the structure becomes benzene with methyl at position 1 and COOH at position 4. So the substituents are at 1 and 4 positions.

Wait, but wait: when you oxidize a nitro group attached to a benzene ring, what happens? The nitro group is -NO2. Oxidation would typically convert it to -COOH. So yes, product 2 would be 4-methylbenzoic acid.

Third step: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds like a Claisen condensation or some kind of aldol reaction. Wait, acetone is (propan-2-one). Under basic conditions, acetone can undergo condensation reactions, like the formation of a beta-hydroxy ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. Another thought: when you have sodium hydroxide and acetone, perhaps it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Bayer-Villiger oxidation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a saponification, but product 2 is an acid, so maybe it's esterifying.

Wait, product 2 is 4-methylbenzoic acid. When you treat an acid with acetone and NaOH, perhaps it's forming an acetylated product. Wait, maybe it's an ester? No, but wait, acetone is a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's undergoing a nucleophilic attack. Or maybe it's forming a saponified ester if it were an ester, but product 2 is an acid.

Wait, another approach. Maybe product 2 is 4-methylbenzoic acid. When treated with acetone and aqueous NaOH, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution occurs. But where would the substitution be?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the structure. 4-methylbenzoic acid has a COOH group and a methyl group on the benzene ring. Now, when you treat an acid with acetone and a base, perhaps you're doing an acetylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's treating the acid with acetone to form an acetylated derivative, like an ester.

Wait, but wait, 4-methylbenzoic acid has a COOH group. Maybe the reaction is forming a mixed anhydride or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group, but the COOH is a good leaving group?

Alternatively, another thought: Maybe it's forming an acid chloride first, but that's not the case here because the conditions are acetone and aqueous NaOH.

Wait, perhaps it's a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The Claisen-Schmidt condensation occurs between ketones and aldehydes in basic conditions, forming a β,γ-unsaturated ketone. But product 2 is an acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the benzoic acid is being converted into its conjugate base, the benzoate ion. Then, maybe the acetone is undergoing nucleophilic attack. Or perhaps acetone is acting as a nucleophile.

Wait, maybe it's the formation of a benzil derivative. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group, but I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that's done with acylium ions, which usually involves AlCl3 as a catalyst. But in this case, the conditions are different.

Alternatively, maybe the 4-methylbenzoic acid is being decarboxylated. Wait, under certain conditions, benzoic acid can lose CO2. But with acetone and NaOH, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, maybe the reaction is forming a benzoin. That's when two aldehydes condense in basic conditions, but I'm not sure about that here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the third step again. Product 2 is 4-methylbenzoic acid. It's treated with acetone and aqueous NaOH. So, acetone is (CH3)2CO. Under aqueous NaOH, perhaps it's a base-catalyzed reaction.

Wait, maybe the benzoic acid is converted into a sodium benzoate. Then, acetone can undergo some kind of nucleophilic attack. Wait, but acetone's carbonyl isn't very reactive towards nucleophiles unless it's activated. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen condensation between acetone and the sodium benzoate.

Wait, Claisen condensation typically involves two esters or two ketones. But sodium benzoate is a salt of a benzoic acid. Maybe it's a crossed Claisen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the acetone is undergoing aldol condensation. But for that, you usually need an aldehyde. Wait, but acetone is a ketone, so it can undergo aldol under certain conditions.

Wait, but in this case, the conditions are NaOH and acetone, and the presence of the benzoic acid derivative. Maybe the benzoate is acting as a base for the enolate formation.

Wait, perhaps the 4-methylbenzoic acid is deprotonated to form the benzoate ion, which is a strong base. Then, acetone, in the presence of a base, can form an enolate. The enolate could attack the carbonyl of another acetone molecule, leading to a dimer.

Wait, but without an aldehyde, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the benzoate is acting as an aromatic nucleophile, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is forming an acetylated derivative. For example, the carboxylic acid is converted into an acetylated ester. But how?

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. The benzoic acid's -COOH group is converted into an acetylated group like an ester using acetone. But typically, esterification would require an acid catalyst, not NaOH.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an acetylation using acetone in basic conditions. Wait, but acetylation usually uses acetyl chloride or similar; alternatively, in the presence of a base, perhaps it's forming an acetylated product through a different mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. Let me think about the steps again. Starting from toluene, nitration gives para-nitrotoluene. Then, oxidation with MnO2 and H2SO4 converts the nitro group to a COOH group, giving 4-methylbenzoic acid. Then, treated with acetone and aqueous NaOH.

Wait, maybe the 4-methylbenzoic acid is undergoing some kind of substitution. The COOH group is a good leaving group if deprotonated. So, in basic conditions, it becomes COO^- Na+. Then, acetone could attack the adjacent carbon (the methyl group?) but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the COOH group is being converted into an acetyl group. So, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would require an acylium ion, which isn't present here. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetylation via the formation of an acetylated benzoate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack on the benzene ring. Wait, but for that, you usually need a catalyst like AlCl3, which isn't present here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on the methyl group. But the methyl group is attached to benzene, which is a poor leaving group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the methyl group is being oxidized further. But in that case, with what reagents? MnO2 is an oxidizing agent, but in the second step, it was used with H2SO4. Now, in the third step, it's different reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 3 is a ketone formed by some oxidation. Wait, but I'm not getting it. Maybe I should think about the molecular symmetry group of product 3, which is the last step.

Wait, the question is asking about the molecular symmetry group of product 3. So perhaps I can figure out what product 3 is without knowing the exact structure, but by looking at its symmetry.

Wait, what determines the molecular symmetry group? It depends on the structure. For example, benzene has D6h symmetry, but when substituents are added, the symmetry reduces.

If product 3 is a molecule with certain symmetries, like having a plane of symmetry or a C2 axis, that would determine its point group.

But I'm a bit stuck on what product 3 is. Let's think again.

Product 2 is 4-methylbenzoic acid. Let's imagine its structure: benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4 (para to each other). Now, when product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous NaOH, perhaps it's undergoing a reaction that forms a new group attached to the ring.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the COOH group is being converted into a COOCH3 group (methyl ester). But that would require an esterification, which typically uses an alcohol and acid catalyst. But the reagents here are acetone and aqueous NaOH, so that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is undergoing a substitution. For instance, forming an acetylated derivative. Maybe it's a nucleophilic attack where the COO- group is a leaving group. But that would require a good leaving group, which COO^- isn't.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not on the benzoic acid part but on the methyl group. Could the methyl group undergo some oxidation or substitution?

Wait, if the methyl group is oxidized, it would become a carbonyl. But under what conditions? MnO2 in H2SO4 is for oxidation. Wait, no, that's in the second step. The third step is with acetone and NaOH.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group is undergoing some kind of elimination or substitution.

Wait, maybe the methyl group is being converted into a ketone. So, 4-methylbenzoic acid would become 4-formylbenzoic acid? But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group is being oxidized to a carbonyl group. So, the methyl (CH3) becomes a CO group. So the structure would be benzene with two substituents: COOH and CO (formyl) groups, para to each other.

Wait, so product 3 would be 4-formylbenzoic acid.

But wait, how would that happen from 4-methylbenzoic acid using acetone and NaOH?

Hmm. Another thought: Maybe the reaction is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. Claisen-Schmidt involves the base-induced condensation of aromatic aldehydes with ketones. But in this case, product 2 is 4-methylbenzoic acid, which is a carboxylic acid, not an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the COOH group is somehow converted into an aldehyde. But that would require a reduction, which isn't the case here.

Wait, maybe the benzoic acid is being decarboxylated to form benzene with a methyl group. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming an ortho ester or something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible product and its structure.

If product 3 is 4-formylbenzoic acid, what's its symmetry? Let's imagine the structure: benzene ring with a COOH group and a formyl (CHO) group para to each other.

So the molecule has two substituents opposite each other on the benzene ring: COOH and CHO. Now, what's the symmetry here?

Well, in this case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Because if you draw a mirror plane down the middle between the two substituents, each substituent is a mirror image of the other. So the point group would be C2h, which is option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the symmetry. The molecule has two substituents para to each other. So, each substituent is on opposite sides of the ring. So, the molecule has a center of inversion, right? Because each substituent is opposite the other.

Wait, no. Wait, if the substituents are the same, then inversion would leave the molecule unchanged. But in this case, the substituents are different: one is COOH, the other is CHO. So, inversion would swap them, which would change the molecule. Hence, no center of inversion.

Wait, but wait, in 4-formylbenzoic acid, the two substituents are different, so the molecule doesn't have a center of inversion. Then, what symmetry does it have?

If the substituents are opposite each other, the molecule would have a C2 axis perpendicular to the ring, passing through the center of the ring and the midpoints between the two substituents. But wait, with two different substituents, a C2 rotation would swap the substituents, but since they are different, it wouldn't leave the molecule unchanged. So maybe there's no C2 axis.

Wait, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Imagine a plane that bisects the ring between the two substituents. So, the plane is along the line connecting the two substituents. Then, each substituent would mirror the other. So, the molecule would have a mirror plane, making its point group Cs (which is option A).

Wait, but wait. If you have two different substituents opposite each other in a ring, the molecule has a plane of symmetry (a mirror plane) that lies between the two substituents. So, each substituent is the mirror image of the other. Hence, the point group would be Cs.

So, the symmetry group is Cs, which is option A.

But wait, another possibility: If the substituents are identical, then the point group would be D2h, which has more symmetry elements. But in our case, the substituents are different, so only a Cs symmetry would be present.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain about the structure of product 3. Let me recap the steps once more.

1. Toluene → nitration → para-nitrotoluene.

2. Oxidation of nitro to COOH → 4-methylbenzoic acid.

3. Reacted with acetone and NaOH. Hmm. Maybe the COOH group is being converted into another group.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the reaction is hydrolysis of some kind. But product 2 is a carboxylic acid, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzoic acid is undergoing a substitution where the COOH is replaced by an acetone-derived group.

Wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution. The COOH group is converted into an ester, but with what? Acetone has (CH3)2CO. So, perhaps the COOH group is being converted into an acetyl group via some mechanism.

Wait, but that would require something like a substitution where the -OH of the COOH is replaced by an acetyl group, which doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think the given reagents would allow that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the product 3 is something else. Let me try to think of another possibility.

Wait, when you have benzoic acid and you treat it with a base like NaOH, you get the sodium salt, sodium benzoate. Then, when you add acetone, perhaps it's undergoing a Claisen condensation. But Claisen is between esters, so perhaps not.

Wait, maybe the sodium benzoate is reacting with acetone in some way. For example, perhaps it's forming a benzoin condensation, but that usually involves two aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that product 3 is a ketone. So the benzene ring has a ketone group. How?

Wait, another approach: Maybe the benzoic acid is being converted into a benzaldehyde. But how? That would require a reduction, which isn't part of the given steps.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about product 2. Maybe product 2 isn't 4-methylbenzoic acid but something else.

Wait, let me re-examine the second step. Product 1 is para-nitrotoluene. When treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, which is a strong oxidizing condition. Perhaps MnO2 is acting as a catalyst in the oxidation of nitro groups.

Wait, some sources say that nitrobenzene can be oxidized to phenyl nitrobenzoate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another possibility is that the methyl group is getting oxidized.

Wait, para-nitrotoluene structure: benzene ring with methyl at position 1 and nitro at position 4. So, when oxidized, perhaps the methyl group is oxidized to a ketone.

Wait, oxidation of methyl to ketone would require a strong oxidizing agent. MnO2 in H2SO4 is a strong oxidizing condition. So, perhaps the methyl group (-CH3) is oxidized to a carbonyl group (-CO).

So, para-nitrotoluene upon oxidation would become 4-nitrobenzaldehyde? Wait, but wait, oxidation of methyl (CH3) to CO would give a benzaldehyde group.

Wait, but that would require breaking the CH3 and forming a carbonyl. So, product 2 would be 4-nitrobenzaldehyde?

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the methyl group is attached to the benzene ring. Wait, wait, the methyl group is attached to the benzene, so the structure is C6H5-CH2-NO2. Wait no, toluene is C6H5-CH3. So, para-nitrotoluene is C6H4(NO2)(CH3) at positions 1 and 4.

Wait, oxidizing the methyl group in para-nitrotoluene would require it to become a carbonyl group. But how? The methyl is attached to the benzene as a substituent. So, oxidation would convert CH3 into CO, but that's not possible because the substituent is -CH3 attached directly to the ring. Wait, wait, no, wait. The methyl group is attached to the benzene as a substituent. So, it's a benzyl group: CH2CH3? No, toluene is C6H5-CH3. So, in para-nitrotoluene, the structure is benzene with NO2 and CH3 groups opposite each other.

So, when you oxidize the CH3 group, perhaps it becomes a CO group. So, product 2 would be 4-methylnitrobenzaldehyde? No, wait, no, the methyl is CH3, so oxidizing it would give a CO group, but that would mean the methyl becomes a carbonyl. So, the structure would be benzene with NO2 and CO groups. But wait, the position would be 1 and 4 again.

Wait, but wait, if the methyl is oxidized to CO, then the substituent becomes a carbonyl group. So, the structure becomes 4-nitrobenzaldehyde? No, because the methyl is at position 1 and the nitro at 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out in my mind. Toluene is benzene with CH3 at position 1. After nitration, it's nitro group at position 4. So, structure is benzene with CH3 at 1 and NO2 at 4.

When oxidizing the methyl group, which is at position 1, to a carbonyl group, the structure becomes benzene with CO (as in formyl group) at position 1 and NO2 at position 4. So, product 2 would be 4-nitrobenzaldehyde? No, because aldehyde is CHO, which is a formyl group. So, product 2 is 4-nitrobenzaldehyde.

Wait, but then product 2 is 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. Then, step 3 is treatment with acetone and aqueous NaOH.

Hmm. So, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde treated with acetone and NaOH.

Wait, perhaps this is a condensation reaction. Benzaldehyde can undergo aldol condensation with ketones in basic conditions.

So, in the presence of a base like NaOH, benzaldehyde (as product 2) can react with acetone. The base deprotonates the alpha carbon of acetone, forming an enolate. The enolate attacks the benzaldehyde's carbonyl, leading to a β-hydroxy ketone, which can eliminate water to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone.

So, product 3 would be the conjugated enone. The structure would be a benzene ring with a nitro group at position 4 and a substituent that is an α,β-unsaturated ketone at position 1.

Wait, let me think about that structure. So, the benzaldehyde (CHO) at position 1 reacts with acetone to form a substituted cinnamaldehyde-like structure.

The product of the Claisen-Schmidt condensation between benzaldehyde and acetone would be 4-nitro-cinnamaldehyde derivative.

Wait, but wait, the starting benzaldehyde has a nitro group at position 4. So, after condensation, the structure would have a side chain attached to the benzene ring at position 1, which is a CH₂-C(O)-CH₂-CHO group or something similar.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The aldol condensation between benzaldehyde and acetone would form a structure where the benzaldehyde's aldehyde group is connected via a CH₂ group to the acetone's carbonyl. So, the structure would be benzalacetophenone or something like that.

Wait, more accurately, the aldol product would have a benzene ring with a substituent that is a propenyl group attached to a ketone. So, the structure would be C6H4(NO2)-CH₂-C(O)-CH3. Wait, but that's not right because in the aldol condensation, the two carbonyl compounds form a new double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is C6H4(NO2)-CH₂-CH(OH)-COCH3, but under basic conditions, this would eliminate water to form a double bond.

So, after elimination, the structure would be C6H4(NO2)-CH=CH-COCH3.

Wait, but the substituents on the benzene would be the nitro group and the new substituent. So, the benzene has a nitro group at position 4 and the new substituent at position 1, which is a propenyl group attached to a ketone.

Hmm. So the structure would be 4-nitro-1-(3-oxopropenyl)benzene or something along those lines.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 4-nitrostyryl acetophenone.

Now, what's the symmetry of this molecule?

The molecule has a benzene ring with a nitro group at position 4 and a substituent at position 1 that is a propenone group (CH₂-C(O)-CH3, but with a double bond).

Wait, so the substituents are at positions 1 and 4 on the benzene ring. The substituent at 1 is a propenone group (CH₂-C(O)-CH3, but in the enone form: CH₂=C(O)CH3? No, wait, the structure after elimination would be CH₂=CH-COCH3, but that may not be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH₂-CH₂-COCH3 group, but that's not correct because of the elimination.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure, but perhaps the key point is the positions of substituents and their symmetry.

Assuming that the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, both being different groups, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between them.

Wait, but if the substituent at position 1 is a group that has its own symmetry, that could influence the overall symmetry.

But regardless, the main ring has substituents opposite each other, leading to a plane of symmetry. So the point group would be Cs, which is option A.

But wait, another possibility: If the substituent on the benzene is a group that itself has a plane of symmetry, then the overall molecule might have more symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituent is a tri-substituted group, like a ketone with a double bond, the symmetry could be lower.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is symmetric enough that the entire molecule has a higher symmetry group.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let's think again about the point groups. The options are:

A) cs

B) d2h

C) c2h

D) c3

In the scenario where product 3 is 4-formylbenzoic acid, the substituents are COOH and CHO, which are different, leading to a Cs symmetry (a plane of symmetry between them).

But if product 3 is a more complex molecule with substituents that are mirror images, perhaps with a C2 axis, then the symmetry would be C2h, which is option C.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should think about the options. If the product has a plane of symmetry, it's Cs. If it has a C2 axis and a mirror plane, it could be C2h. If it has a three-fold axis, it's C3.

But in the case of the structure I'm considering, with substituents opposite each other, the symmetry is probably Cs.

So, the answer would be A) cs.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with toluene, leading to a final product whose molecular symmetry group is to be determined. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, resulting in nitration. The methyl group on toluene is an activating group, directing the nitro group to the para position. Thus, the product (Product 1) is **para-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).

2. **Reaction 2**: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄. MnO₂ in acidic conditions is a strong oxidizing agent. The nitro group (-NO₂) on the benzene ring is oxidized to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This converts para-nitrotoluene into **4-methylbenzoic acid** (benzoic acid with a methyl group at the para position).

3. **Reaction 3**: Product 2 (4-methylbenzoic acid) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. Under basic conditions, the methyl group (-CH₃) on the benzene ring is oxidized to a carbonyl group (-CO), forming **4-formylbenzoic acid**. The structure now has a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an aldehyde (-CHO) group at the para positions on the benzene ring.

4. **Symmetry Analysis**: The final product, 4-formylbenzoic acid, has two substituents (-COOH and -CHO) on opposite sides of the benzene ring. This creates a plane of symmetry between the two substituents. The molecule lacks a center of inversion due to the different nature of the substituents, but it retains a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecular symmetry group of the final product (Product 3) is **Cs**.

**Critical Evaluation of Options**:
- **A) Cs**: Correct. The molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two substituents, corresponding to the Cs point group.
- **B) D₂h**: Incorrect. This point group requires multiple symmetry elements (e.g., a center of inversion and multiple mirror planes), which are not present in the final product.
- **C) C₂h**: Incorrect. This point group requires a C₂ axis and a horizontal mirror plane, which are not present here.
- **D) C₃**: Incorrect. This point group requires a three-fold axis of rotation, which is not applicable to the structure of the final product.

**Answer**: A
