Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩ of its spin-up and spin-down states. The |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx, up to one decimal place. The options are A to D.

Hmm, expectation values. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average outcome you'd expect from measuring that observable many times on identically prepared systems. So for a given state, you calculate ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

In this case, the operator is 10σz +5σx. Oh wait, σz and σx are the Pauli matrices for spin in the z and x directions, right? So each of them has their own eigenstates.

The state given is |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. Let me write that down properly. So ψ = (0.5)|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Wait, 0.5 is 1/2, and sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

First, I think I need to calculate the expectation values of σz and σx individually, then combine them with their coefficients to get the expectation value of the operator.

Wait, because expectation values are linear. So ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes it easier; I can compute each part separately.

So let's compute ⟨σz⟩ first. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward.

The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So when σz acts on |↑⟩, it gives +1 times |↑⟩, and similarly for |↓⟩.

So the expectation value of σz is the probability of being in |↑⟩ times (+1) plus the probability of being in |↓⟩ times (-1).

The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2, so the probabilities are the squares of the magnitudes of these coefficients. Let's compute those.

For |0.5|^2: (0.5)^2 = 0.25. For (sqrt(3)/2)^2: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3)/4 = 0.75. So the probabilities add up to 1, which is good.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, that's straightforward. Now, moving on to ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which represents the spin in the x-direction. Its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so this might be a bit more involved.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The matrix σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So when you apply it to a state, it swaps the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ components.

Alternatively, another approach: to compute ⟨σx⟩, I can write it as ψ† σx ψ, where ψ is the column vector representing the state.

Alternatively, since σx can be expressed in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, perhaps I can calculate it using the expansion.

Alternatively, another method: since σx is a Hermitian operator, and |ψ⟩ is a normalized state, the expectation value is given by ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

So let's write |ψ⟩ as a vector. Let's assume |↑⟩ is (1, 0) and |↓⟩ is (0, 1), then |ψ⟩ would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So σx is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So the expectation value is ψ† σx ψ.

Let me compute ψ† σx ψ.

So ψ is a row vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], and ψ is the column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ σx is [0.5*0 + sqrt(3)/2 *1, 0.5*1 + sqrt(3)/2 *0 ] → [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ].

Then multiply by ψ†: [sqrt(3)/2 *0.5 + 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ].

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

Alternatively, matrix multiplication: ψ† σx ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ].

Wait, maybe it's easier to just compute the inner product.

First, compute σx |ψ⟩:

σx |ψ⟩ = σx (0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩ ) → 0.5 σx |↑⟩ + (√3/2) σx |↓⟩.

But σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩. Because σx swaps the states.

So σx |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩.

Now, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = [0.5 ⟨↑| + (√3/2) ⟨↓| ] [0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩ ].

Multiplying this out:

0.5 * 0.5 ⟨↑| ↓ ⟩ + 0.5 * (√3/2) ⟨↑| ↑⟩ + (√3/2) * 0.5 ⟨↓| ↓⟩ + (√3/2) * (√3/2) ⟨↓| ↑ ⟩.

But ⟨↑| ↓⟩ is zero, and ⟨↑| ↑⟩ is 1, ⟨↓| ↓⟩ is 1, and ⟨↓| ↑ ⟩ is zero.

So the terms become:

0.5 * 0.5 * 0 → 0

0.5 * (√3/2) *1 → (0.5 * √3/2 )= √3/4 ≈ 0.4330

(√3/2) *0.5 *1 → same as above, √3/4 ≈0.4330

(√3/2) * (√3/2) * 0 → 0

So adding the non-zero terms: √3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Another approach: using the components.

As ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], then σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ψ† σx is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * σx, which is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, when you multiply by ψ, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], you get:

(s)(0.5) + (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Wait, no, wait: ψ† σx is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5], and ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. So the product is:

sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 + 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2.

Which is (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5 + 0.5) )? Because both terms are same.

Wait, sqrt(3)/2 *0.5 is 0.5*sqrt(3)/2, and 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 is the same. So adding them: sqrt(3)/2 * (0.5+0.5) )= sqrt(3)/2 *1 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

Yes, that's correct. So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So now, putting it all together:

The expectation value of 10σz +5σx is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

We found ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5, and ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(0.866) ≈4.33.

Adding them: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, wait a minute, that would be approximately -0.67.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7, which would be correct if I round to one decimal place.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because sometimes I make mistakes in signs or arithmetic.

Wait, let me recompute ⟨σx⟩.

Calculating 10σz +5σx's expectation:

10*(⟨σz⟩) +5*(⟨σx⟩) =10*(-0.5)+5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Compute each term:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*(0.8660) ≈4.330.

So adding them: -5 +4.330= -0.670.

Which is approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.7. Looking at the options, option C is -0.7.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) -1.4

B)1.65

C)-0.7

D)0.85

Yes, option C is -0.7, which matches our result. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me verify if I made any mistake in calculating the expectation value of σx.

Alternative approach: Use the general formula for expectation value.

The state is |ψ> = a|↑> + b|↓>, where a =0.5, b=√3/2.

σx's expectation value is (a^2 + b^2) ? No, wait, that's not correct. Because σx doesn't have the same eigenstates as σz.

Wait, another approach: The expectation value can be found using |a|^2 - |b|^2 for σx is ( |a|^2 + |b|^2 ) - 2 Re(ab^*) ? Wait, no, perhaps another way.

Alternatively, for a general spin-½ state, the expectation value of σx is ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ), but wait, no, that's for σz. Because σz has eigenstates |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so expectation value is |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2*(-1) = |a|^2 - |b|^2.

But for σx, the expectation is 2 Re(ab^*), or perhaps a different expression.

Wait, let's compute it again. Let me write the state as |ψ> = (a, b), where a=0.5 and b=√3/2.

The expectation value of σx is (a b* + a* b ) because σx = [[0,1],[1,0]].

Wait, the expectation is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (a^* b + b^* a). Because σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you multiply it into |ψ>, you get the same as above.

Since a and b are real numbers in this case (since the coefficients are 0.5 and √3/2—real), a^* = a and b^* =b.

So a^*b + b^*a = 2ab.

So in this case, a=0.5, b=√3/2.

So 2*(0.5)*(√3/2) = 2*( (√3)/4 ) )= √3/2 ≈0.866.

Which matches our previous result. So this confirms that ⟨σx⟩ is indeed √3/2.

So putting it all together: 10*(-0.5) +5*(√3/2) → -5 + (5*1.732/2) → -5 + (8.66/2) → -5 +4.33 → -0.67 → approx -0.7.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.7. So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given quantum state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is linear, so we compute \( \langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle \) separately.

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The coefficients of \( |\psi\rangle \) are \( 0.5 \) and \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), so the probabilities of measuring \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the squares of these coefficients:
\[
P(|\uparrow\rangle) = |0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad P(|\downarrow\rangle) = \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75.
\]
Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = P(|\uparrow\rangle)(+1) + P(|\downarrow\rangle)(-1) = 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator swaps the states \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \). For a general state \( |\psi\rangle = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is given by:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab.
\]
Here, \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), so:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2(0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is approximately \( -0.7 \).

The correct option is:

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩ of its spin-up and spin-down states. The |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx, up to one decimal place. The options are A to D.

Hmm, expectation values. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average outcome you'd expect from measuring that observable many times on identically prepared systems. So for a given state, you calculate ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

In this case, the operator is 10σz +5σx. Oh wait, σz and σx are the Pauli matrices for spin in the z and x directions, right? So each of them has their own eigenstates.

The state given is |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. Let me write that down properly. So ψ = (0.5)|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Wait, 0.5 is 1/2, and sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

First, I think I need to calculate the expectation values of σz and σx individually, then combine them with their coefficients to get the expectation value of the operator.

Wait, because expectation values are linear. So ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes it easier; I can compute each part separately.

So let's compute ⟨σz⟩ first. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward.

The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So when σz acts on |↑⟩, it gives +1 times |↑⟩, and similarly for |↓⟩.

So the expectation value of σz is the probability of being in |↑⟩ times (+1) plus the probability of being in |↓⟩ times (-1).

The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2, so the probabilities are the squares of the magnitudes of these coefficients. Let's compute those.

For |0.5|^2: (0.5)^2 = 0.25. For (sqrt(3)/2)^2: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3)/4 = 0.75. So the probabilities add up to 1, which is good.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, that's straightforward. Now, moving on to ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which represents the spin in the x-direction. Its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so this might be a bit more involved.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The matrix σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So when you apply it to a state, it swaps the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ components.

Alternatively, another approach: to compute ⟨σx⟩, I can write it as ψ† σx ψ, where ψ is the column vector representing the state.

Alternatively, another method: since σx is a Hermitian operator, and |ψ⟩ is a normalized state, the expectation value is given by ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

So let's write |ψ⟩ as a vector. Let's assume |↑⟩ is (1, 0) and |↓⟩ is (0, 1), then |ψ⟩ would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So σx is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So the expectation value is ψ† σx ψ.

Let me compute ψ† σx ψ.

So ψ is a row vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], and ψ is the column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ σx is [0.5*0 + sqrt(3)/2 *1, 0.5*1 + sqrt(3)/2 *0 ] → [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ].

Then multiply by ψ†: [sqrt(3)/2 *0.5 + 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ].

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

Alternatively, matrix multiplication: ψ† σx ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ].

Wait, maybe it's easier to just compute the inner product.

First, compute σx |ψ⟩:

σx |ψ⟩ = σx (0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩ ) → 0.5 σx |↑⟩ + (√3/2) σx |↓⟩.

But σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩. Because σx swaps the states.

So σx |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩.

Now, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = [0.5 ⟨↑| + (√3/2) ⟨↓| ] [0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩ ].

Multiplying this out:

0.5 * 0.5 ⟨↑| ↓ ⟩ + 0.5 * (√3/2) ⟨↑| ↑⟩ + (√3/2) * 0.5 ⟨↓| ↓⟩ + (√3/2) * (√3/2) ⟨↓| ↑ ⟩.

But ⟨↑| ↓⟩ is zero, and ⟨↑| ↑⟩ is 1, ⟨↓| ↓⟩ is 1, and ⟨↓| ↑ ⟩ is zero.

So the terms become:

0.5 * 0.5 * 0 → 0

0.5 * (√3/2) *1 → (0.5 * √3/2 )= √3/4 ≈ 0.4330

(√3/2) *0.5 *1 → same as above, √3/4 ≈0.4330

(√3/2) * (√3/2) * 0 → 0

So adding the non-zero terms: √3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Another approach: using the components.

As ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], then σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ψ† σx is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * σx, which is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, when you multiply by ψ, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], you get:

(s)(0.5) + (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Wait, no, wait: ψ† σx is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5], and ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. So the product is:

sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 + 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2.

Which is (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5 + 0.5) )? Because both terms are same.

Wait, sqrt(3)/2 *0.5 is 0.5*sqrt(3)/2, and 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 is the same. So adding them: sqrt(3)/2 * (0.5+0.5) )= sqrt(3)/2 *1 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

Yes, that's correct. So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So now, putting it all together:

The expectation value of 10σz +5σx is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

We found ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5, and ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(0.866) ≈4.33.

Adding them: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, wait a minute, that would be approximately -0.67.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7, which would be correct if I round to one decimal place.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because sometimes I make mistakes in signs or arithmetic.

Wait, let me recompute ⟨σx⟩.

Calculating 10σz +5σx's expectation:

10*(⟨σz⟩) +5*(⟨σx⟩) =10*(-0.5)+5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Compute each term:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*(0.8660) ≈4.330.

So adding them: -5 +4.330= -0.670.

Which is approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.7. Looking at the options, option C is -0.7.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) -1.4

B)1.65

C)-0.7

D)0.85

Yes, option C is -0.7, which matches our result. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me verify if I made any mistake in calculating the expectation value of σx.

Alternative approach: Use the general formula for expectation value.

The state is |ψ> = a|↑> + b|↓>, where a =0.5, b=√3/2.

σx's expectation value is (a^2 + b^2) ? No, wait, that's not correct. Because σx doesn't have the same eigenstates as σz.

Wait, another approach: The expectation value can be found using |a|^2 - |b|^2 for σx is ( |a|^2 + |b|^2 ) - 2 Re(ab^*) ? Wait, no, perhaps another way.

Alternatively, for a general spin-½ state, the expectation value of σx is ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ), but wait, no, that's for σz. Because σz has eigenstates |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so expectation value is |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2*(-1) = |a|^2 - |b|^2.

But for σx, the expectation is 2 Re(ab^*), or perhaps a different expression.

Wait, let's compute it again. Let me write the state as |ψ> = (a, b), where a=0.5 and b=√3/2.

The expectation value of σx is (a b* + a* b ) because σx = [[0,1],[1,0]].

Wait, the expectation is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (a^* b + b^* a). Because σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you multiply it into |ψ>, you get the same as above.

Since a and b are real numbers in this case (since the coefficients are 0.5 and √3/2—real), a^* = a and b^* =b.

So a^*b + b^*a = 2ab.

So in this case, a=0.5, b=√3/2.

So 2*(0.5)*(√3/2) = 2*( (√3)/4 ) )= √3/2 ≈0.866.

Which matches our previous result. So this confirms that ⟨σx⟩ is indeed √3/2.

So putting it all together: 10*(-0.5) +5*(√3/2) → -5 + (5*1.732/2) → -5 + (8.66/2) → -5 +4.33 → -0.67 → approx -0.7.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.7. So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given quantum state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is linear, so we compute \( \langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle \) separately.

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The coefficients of \( |\psi\rangle \) are \( 0.5 \) and \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), so the probabilities of measuring \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the squares of these coefficients:
\[
P(|\uparrow\rangle) = |0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad P(|\downarrow\rangle) = \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75.
\]
Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = P(|\uparrow\rangle)(+1) + P(|\downarrow\rangle)(-1) = 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator swaps the states \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \). For a general state \( |\psi\rangle = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is given by:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab.
\]
Here, \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), so:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2(0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is approximately \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The correct option is:
