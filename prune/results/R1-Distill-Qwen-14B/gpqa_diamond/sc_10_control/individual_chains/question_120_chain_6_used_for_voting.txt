Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance—closer stars have larger parallaxes, right? Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Parallax is the apparent shift of a star's position as seen from Earth as we orbit the Sun. So the closer the star, the larger the parallax. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is very far away, but wait, no, wait again—parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So distance d = 1/plx, where plx is in parsecs.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So like, how many stars are there in a certain range of parallax values. I think this is about the volume of space for different distances. Because stars are spread uniformly, the number of stars in a given volume depends on the size of that volume.

Let me think. A unit range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx. Wait, but plx is in parsecs, right? So the distance is inversely proportional to parallax. So dplx is the change in parallax. How does the volume of space change with distance?

I remember that the volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr. So for a thin shell at distance r, the volume is 4π r² dr. But here, we're considering a range in parallax, which is 1/r. So if I have a thin shell at distance r, dr is a small change in r. But since plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx. So let's express things in terms of plx.

Let me see: dr is the change in r. Since r = 1/plx, dr = -1/(plx^2) dplx. So the volume at a certain plx is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/(plx^2) dplx). Wait, but we can ignore the negative sign because we're dealing with absolute changes. So the volume element dV is 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx? Wait no, wait.

Wait, wait. Let me re-derive this. The volume between r and r + dr is 4π r² dr. But since r = 1/plx (since plx = 1/r), we can write r = 1/plx. So dr is the change in r. Let's express dr in terms of dplx.

If plx = 1/r, then dplx = - (1/r²) dr. So rearranging, dr = - r² dplx. Since r is positive, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, r decreases. But when considering the volume, we take the absolute value.

So, substituting r = 1/plx into dr:

dr = -( (1/plx)^2 ) dplx.

So the volume element dV is 4π r² dr.

Substituting r = 1/plx, we get r² = 1/(plx)^2.

And dr is -( (1/(plx)^2 )) dplx.

So putting it all together:

dV = 4π * (1/(plx)^2) * ( -(1/(plx)^2) dplx ).

The negative is just about direction, so for the magnitude, we can take the absolute value. So dV = 4π * (1/(plx)^2) * (1/(plx)^2) dplx.

Wait, that would make dV proportional to 1/(plx)^4 times dplx. But wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me approach it differently.

We have dV = 4π r² dr. And r = 1/plx. So plx = 1/r.

Expressed in terms of plx, dr = derivative of r with respect to plx multiplied by dplx. dr/dplx = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx. So derivative of (1/x) is -1/x². So dr = - (1/(plx^2)) dplx.

So dV = 4π (r^2) dr = 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * ( -1/(plx^2) dplx )

Again, taking the absolute value, dV is proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the number of stars in that volume is proportional to dV, assuming uniform distribution. So the number of stars per unit parallax (dplx) would be proportional to 1/(plx^4), right?

Wait, but that would suggest that the number per unit plx range is proportional to 1/plx^4, but looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. But that seems a bit high. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the variables. Let me think in terms of the actual counts.

We have a uniform distribution of stars. So the number density is constant. The number of stars in a volume dV is n * dV, where n is the number density.

The volume dV for a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr is 4π r² dr. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π r² dr.

But r = 1/plx. So dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So substituting:

n * 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * ( -1/(plx^2) dplx )

Again, ignoring the negative sign for magnitude:

n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in a given range of plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/(plx^4) times dplx.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So it's the number divided by dplx. That would be (n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx ) / dplx ) = n * 4π (1/plx^4).

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would mean the number of stars per unit plx range decreases as 1/plx^4, which is option A.

But wait, I've heard that the number of stars decreases with distance, and parallax is inversely related to distance. So higher plx means closer stars. So as plx increases, the number of stars per unit plx should increase because closer stars are more numerous. Wait, but wait, no, if we're considering per unit plx, but the volume increases rapidly.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about it in terms of plx as the variable.

Imagine that the number of stars per unit plx (let's say each unit is 0.1 parsec in plx) is how many stars in each such interval. Since the volume for each higher plx is smaller, but the number of stars in each volume depends on the volume.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think differently. Suppose we have a small change in plx, dplx. How much volume does that correspond to in space?

The volume between plx and plx + dplx is the volume of the shell at average plx. Wait, no, because when plx increases, r decreases.

Wait, the shell at plx with thickness dplx would correspond to a sphere of radius r = 1/plx and a slightly smaller sphere of radius r = 1/(plx + dplx). But for small dplx, the change in r is dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So the volume of the shell is 4π r² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * [ - dplx/(plx^2) ].

Which gives 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx)/(plx^2) ) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

So the volume is proportional to dplx / plx^4. So the number of stars in that volume is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, no. The number of stars is proportional to the volume (since density is uniform). So for each dplx, the number of stars is proportional to (dplx) / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is (number of stars) / dplx = (proportional to dplx / plx^4 ) / dplx = proportional to 1/plx^4.

But that's option A. But let me think again. If plx increases (closer stars), the volume per unit plx is smaller because 1/plx^4 is larger? Wait, no—when plx increases, 1/plx^4 decreases. So for a unit increase in plx, the volume is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But that doesn't seem right because when plx is larger (say, closer stars), there are more stars, so the number per unit plx should be higher. Wait, no. Let's think: when plx is small, say 1 parsec, that's a very distant star. The volume per unit plx there is 1/(1)^4 = 1. But when plx is 0.5 parsecs, which is closer, the volume per unit plx is 1/(0.5)^4 = 16, which is much larger. So more stars would be in that volume.

Wait, but the number per unit plx is the number in that volume divided by the plx width. Hmm, no, the number per unit plx is the number of stars in a slice of width dplx, so as plx increases, the volume per dplx is smaller, meaning fewer stars per unit plx.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused because I'm mixing up the axes. Let me think in terms of distance for a moment. The number of stars per unit distance increases because the volume between r and r+dr is 4π r² dr, which grows as r increases. So as r increases, the volume per dr increases, so more stars are present per unit distance. So for a fixed dr, the number of stars increases with r.

But in terms of plx, since plx is 1/r, a small change in plx corresponds to a larger change in r when plx is small. So the volume per unit plx would be larger for small plx. So the number of stars per unit plx would decrease as plx increases.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.

The number of stars per unit range of plx would be N = (number of stars in the volume) / (dplx). The volume is dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d r), and dr is ( -1/plx^2 dplx ). So dV = 4π (1/plx²) * ( -1/(plx²) ) dplx. Taking absolute, dV = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in a range dplx is (n * dV) = n *4π (dplx / plx^4 ).

So the number per unit plx (dplx) is (n *4π (dplx / plx^4 )) / dplx = n *4π (1/plx^4 ). So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

But earlier, I thought that when plx is larger (closer stars), the number per unit plx should be higher. But according to this, the number per unit plx decreases as plx increases. Because 1/plx^4 becomes smaller when plx increases.

So for example, plx = 1, the number per unit plx is 1. plx = 0.5, number per unit plx is 16 times higher. So that makes sense because closer stars (lower plx, wait no, wait plx is 0.5 is lower plx? No, wait plx is 0.5 is actually a larger plx than plx=1. Because plx=1 is 1 arcsecond, plx=0.5 is 0.5 arcseconds, meaning closer. Wait, no: parallax in arcseconds. Wait, no, wait, 1 parsec is about 3.26 light-years. The closer the star, the larger the parallax in arcseconds. So a star at 2 parsecs has a parallax of 0.5 arcseconds, which is smaller than a star at 1 parsec (plx=1 arcsecond). So plx=0.5 is a larger distance (further away) than plx=1. Wait, no, no: distance is inversely proportional to plx. So plx=1 is at 1 parsec. Plx=0.5 is at 2 parsecs. So plx=0.5 is a larger (greater) distance than plx=1.

So, in that case, when plx decreases (from 1 to 0.5), the distance increases. So the number of stars per unit plx would be proportional to 1/(plx)^4. So when plx is smaller (distance is larger), 1/plx^4 is larger. So more stars per unit plx when plx is smaller (further away). That makes sense because for a given plx range, the volume is larger when plx is smaller. So more stars would be found in that volume.

Wait, but let's think about a small plx, like plx=1. The volume per unit plx (dplx=1) would be 4π (1/1^4) * dplx. So 4π * 1 * 1. But for plx=0.5, the volume per unit plx (dplx=1) would be 4π (1/(0.5)^4) * 1 = 4π * (1/0.0625) )= 4π * 16 = 64π. So the volume is 64 times larger. So more stars in that volume. So the number per unit plx is higher for smaller plx.

Which aligns with the calculation: 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx is higher when plx is smaller (distance is larger), which makes sense because the volume is much larger.

So the answer should be option A, 1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). The number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume element, which for a thin shell at distance \( r \) with thickness \( dr \) is \( dV = 4\pi r^2 dr \). Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we have:

\[
dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the volume element becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right).
\]

Taking the absolute value and simplifying:

\[
dV = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to \( dV \), assuming a uniform distribution of stars. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of stars}}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This result aligns with the fact that the volume of space corresponding to a given range of parallax decreases rapidly as the parallax increases (i.e., as the distance decreases), leading to fewer stars per unit parallax at larger parallaxes.

Thus, the correct answer is:

So dV = 4π (r^2) dr = 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * ( -1/(plx^2) dplx )

Again, taking the absolute value, dV is proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the number of stars in that volume is proportional to dV, assuming uniform distribution. So the number of stars per unit parallax (dplx) would be proportional to 1/(plx^4), right?

The volume dV for a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr is 4π r² dr. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π r² dr.

But r = 1/plx. So dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So substituting:

Again, ignoring the negative sign for magnitude:

n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the volume of the shell is 4π r² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * [ - dplx/(plx^2) ].

Which gives 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx)/(plx^2) ) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

So the volume is proportional to dplx / plx^4. So the number of stars in that volume is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, no. The number of stars is proportional to the volume (since density is uniform). So for each dplx, the number of stars is proportional to (dplx) / plx^4.

Let's think: when plx is small, say 1 parsec, that's a very distant star. The volume per unit plx there is 1/(1)^4 = 1. But when plx is 0.5 parsecs, which is closer, the volume per unit plx is 1/(0.5)^4 = 16, which is much larger. So more stars would be in that volume.

The number of stars per unit range of plx would be N = (number of stars in the volume) / (dplx). The volume is dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d r), and dr is ( -1/plx^2 dplx ). So dV = 4π (1/plx²) * ( -1/(plx²) ) dplx. Taking absolute, dV = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in a range dplx is (n * dV) = n *4π (dplx / plx^4 ).

So the number per unit plx (dplx) is (n *4π (dplx / plx^4 )) / dplx = n *4π (1/plx^4 ). So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

But earlier, I thought that when plx is larger (closer stars), the number per unit plx should be higher. But according to this, the number per unit plx decreases as plx increases. Because 1/plx^4 becomes smaller when plx increases.

So for example, plx = 1, the number per unit plx is 1. plx = 0.5, number per unit plx is 16 times higher. So that makes sense because closer stars (lower plx, wait no, wait plx is 0.5 is lower plx? No, wait plx is 0.5 is actually a larger plx than plx=1. Because plx=1 is 1 arcsecond, plx=0.5 is 0.5 arcseconds, meaning closer. Wait, no: parallax in arcseconds. Wait, no, wait, 1 parsec is about 3.26 light-years. The closer the star, the larger the parallax in arcseconds. So a star at 2 parsecs has a parallax of 0.5 arcseconds, which is smaller than a star at 1 parsec (plx=1 arcsecond). So plx=0.5 is a larger distance (further away) than plx=1. Wait, no, no: distance is inversely proportional to plx. So plx=1 is at 1 parsec. Plx=0.5 is at 2 parsecs. So plx=0.5 is a larger (greater) distance than plx=1.

So, in that case, when plx decreases (from 1 to 0.5), the distance increases. So the number of stars per unit plx would be proportional to 1/(plx)^4. So when plx is smaller (distance is larger), 1/plx^4 is larger. So more stars per unit plx when plx is smaller (further away). That makes sense because for a given plx range, the volume is larger when plx is smaller. So more stars would be found in that volume.

Wait, but let's think about a small plx, like plx=1. The volume per unit plx (dplx=1) would be 4π (1/1^4) * dplx. So 4π * 1 * 1. But for plx=0.5, the volume per unit plx (dplx=1) would be 4π (1/(0.5)^4) * 1 = 4π * (1/0.0625) )= 4π * 16 = 64π. So the volume is 64 times larger. So more stars in that volume. So the number per unit plx is higher for smaller plx.

Which aligns with the calculation: 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx is higher when plx is smaller (distance is larger), which makes sense because the volume is much larger.

So the answer should be option A, 1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). The number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume element, which for a thin shell at distance \( r \) with thickness \( dr \) is \( dV = 4\pi r^2 dr \). Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we have:

\[
dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the volume element becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right).
\]

Taking the absolute value and simplifying:

\[
dV = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to \( dV \), assuming a uniform distribution of stars. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of stars}}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This result aligns with the fact that the volume of space corresponding to a given range of parallax decreases rapidly as the parallax increases (i.e., as the distance decreases), leading to fewer stars per unit parallax at larger parallaxes.

Thus, the correct answer is:
