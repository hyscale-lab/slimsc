Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. We need to figure out which sequence of reactions from the given options will achieve this starting from benzene.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Looking at the numbering, the tert-butyl is in position 2, ethoxy in position 1, and nitro in position 3. Wait, wait, benzene is a ring, so positions are relative. Let's think about the substituents' positions. Let me draw it out in my mind: the ethoxy is at position 1 (which is the para position relative to itself if we consider the nitro as another substituent), but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the numbering is 1 for ethoxy, 2 for tert-butyl, and 3 for nitro. So the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, meaning they are adjacent to each other in a certain arrangement.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me imagine that: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So they are meta to each other? Wait, no, positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So like 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, and 3 is nitro. So it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with substituents in the 1,2,3 positions.

Wait, but when doing synthesis, the order of adding substituents matters because of the directing effects of the groups already present. So, adding groups in the right order is crucial.

The target molecule has two substituents that are meta directors: nitro is a strong meta director, and ethoxy is an ortho/para director. Wait, no, ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an ether), so it's an ortho/para director. Nitro is deactivating and meta. The tert-butyl group is bulky; I think it's a deactivating group because it's an alkyl group attached via a sigma bond. Wait, no, wait. Alkyl groups are activating (electron donating by induction), so they are ortho/para directors. Wait, but wait, tert-butyl is a bulky group, so perhaps it's more about steric hindrance when adding subsequent groups. But in terms of directing, it should be an activating group (since it's an alkyl chain), thus directing incoming substituents to ortho and para positions.

So the target molecule has three substituents. Let's think about the order in which they were added. Since nitro is a strong deactivating group, it's probably better to add it after groups that are activating, because once the nitro group is present, it will deactivate the ring and direct meta.

So perhaps the steps are: first add the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro. Or maybe another order.

Wait, but the target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. Let me think about how the positions would be directed.

Let's assume we start with benzene. First, we add one substituent. Let's say we add the tert-butyl group. Because AlCl3 is a Lewis acid catalyst, so tert-butyl chloride would undergo Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts works for activating groups. So after adding tert-butyl, the ring has a tert-butyl group attached. Then, next substituent: let's say we add ethoxy. Since tert-butyl is an activating group (alkyl), it's ortho/para directing. So when adding ethoxy, which is also activating (since it's an ether, OCH2CH3), it would go into ortho or para positions relative to the tert-butyl.

Wait, but after adding tert-butyl, the next substituent (ethoxy) would go either ortho or para to the tert-butyl. Let's say we add ethoxy next. Then, the ring has ethoxy in position either ortho or para to the tert-butyl. Suppose ethoxy is added in the para position relative to tert-butyl. Then, the next substituent would be nitro. But nitro is a deactivating group, so after adding nitro, the ring is deactivated, making further substitutions harder. Alternatively, maybe nitro is added after ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the order is: first add tert-butyl, then nitro, then ethoxy. Because once nitro is added, it would direct the next substituent to a certain position.

Wait, no, that might complicate because nitro is a meta director. Let me think again.

Alternatively, let's think about which substituents are meta to each other. The target has ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So in the ring, 1,2,3 positions are adjacent. So, the substituents are in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted arrangement.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to approach this by considering the directing effects. Let's think of the substituents' order.

Suppose we first add the ethoxy group. Then, the ring is activated, and ethoxy is an ortho/para director. Next, adding tert-butyl would go either ortho or para to ethoxy. But since tert-butyl is bulky, perhaps it's added in a specific position. Then, adding nitro would be directed by the existing groups.

Wait, but if the first substituent is ethoxy, then adding the second substituent (tert-butyl) would be in either ortho or para. Let's say para. Then, the third substituent, nitro, would be added. Since nitro is a meta director, but which existing substituents are present?

Hmm, maybe another approach: the substituents are nitro (meta director), ethoxy (ortho/para), and tert-butyl (ortho/para). So perhaps the nitro is added first, then the other groups in a way that they are directed by it.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating group, so adding it early on would make the ring harder to substitute further. So perhaps it's better to add nitro last.

So the plan is: first add the tert-butyl, then the ethoxy, and then the nitro. But wait, the nitro is a meta director, so when adding it, it would go to a position directed by the other substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added first, then the other groups. Let me see.

Wait, looking at the target, the nitro is at position 3. So if we imagine the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3, their relative positions are such that nitro is adjacent to both ethoxy and tert-butyl. Hmm, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is the last group to be added. Let me think: after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, their positions would direct where the nitro goes.

Wait, let me outline the possible steps:

1. Benzene â†’ add tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
2. Then, add ethoxy group. The ring is activated by tert-butyl, so ethoxy can be added in an ortho or para position relative to tert-butyl.
3. Then, add nitro group. At this point, the ring has two substituents: tert-butyl and ethoxy. The nitro group will go into a position directed by both, but since nitro is a meta director with respect to any activating groups, but once added, it deactivates the ring. Wait, but if we're adding nitro as a substituent, perhaps it's best to add it when the ring is still activated by other groups.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the nitro is in a position that's adjacent to the tert-butyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy and tert-butyl are already present, and then the nitro is added in a position that's directed by both.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first, then the other groups. Let me see.

Wait, if I first nitrate benzene, the nitro group will be in a certain position. Then, adding ethoxy and tert-butyl. But nitro is a meta director, so when adding ethoxy, it would go meta to nitro, but since ethoxy is itself an ortho/para director, perhaps this could be possible.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each substituent's effect.

The target molecule's substituents:

- Position 1: ethoxy (OCH2CH3). This is an activating group, ortho/para director.
- Position 2: tert-butyl (C(CH3)3). Activating, ortho/para director.
- Position 3: nitro (NO2). Deactivating, meta director.

So when adding the nitro group last, it should be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, let me think: after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the positions where nitro can be added would be determined by their directing effects.

Suppose the ethoxy is in position 1, tert-butyl in position 2. Then, the ring has these two groups. The next substituent (nitro) would be added in a position that's meta to one of these groups or perhaps ortho/para to another. Hmm.

Alternatively, the nitro could be added as the last step. Let's think about how to get all three substituents in the correct positions.

Another approach: the substituents are in positions 1, 2, 3. So in a benzene ring, numbers 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So 1 is next to 2 and 3, 2 is next to 1 and 3, and 3 is next to 2 and 1. So all three substituents are adjacent to each other. So each substituent is adjacent to the other two.

So perhaps the ethoxy is introduced first. Then, the tert-butyl is added in the para position relative to ethoxy. Then, the nitro is added in the meta position relative to ethoxy, which would be adjacent to tert-butyl. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the order of reactions in the options given. Each option has a series of steps, and the correct option would correctly place all substituents.

Looking at the options, each starts with a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3). So step i in all options is adding tert-butyl.

Option A: after i, the steps are HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), then SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation?), then more steps. Option B: after i, nitration, then Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction?), etc.

Wait, perhaps the order is important. Let's think for each option.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

Looking at the substituents:

- Ethoxy is at position 1.

- Tert-butyl at 2.

- Nitro at 3.

So let's think about the order of substitution.

An effective strategy is to add the substituents in an order that allows each new group to be directed by the existing groups to the desired position.

Assuming the first substituent is tert-butyl (since all options start with that). So after step i, we have tert-butyl benzene.

Next, in step ii, some options nitrate. For example, option A step ii is nitration (HNO3/H2SO4). Then step iii is sulfonation. Hmm.

Wait, but the target has an ethoxy group. So when is the ethoxy added?

Looking at the options, in option A, step vii is NaOH/EtBr (probably an SN2 reaction, like ethoxylation via Williamson or similar?), and step viii is Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction, like converting nitro to amine? Or perhaps a different reaction).

Wait, but in the target, we have an ethoxy group, a nitro group, and a tert-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps we need to nitrate the ring, then introduce the ethoxy group via a substitution.

Wait, but benzene can't directly substitute OCH2CH3 unless it's through a nitration followed by some other steps.

Wait, no. To add an ethoxy group, we can perform an alkoxylation, but that's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps it's added as a nitro group first, then reduced to an amine, then undergo some kind of substitution, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a different method. Another approach is to have a nitration, then a sulfonation, then a nitration again, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an ether formation. Alternatively, maybe using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires activating groups.

Wait, perhaps steps involve adding the tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro, but in a specific order.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option D.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitro group added. Then ii) Fe/HCl â†’ maybe reduction of nitro to amine? But that's not part of the target. iii) Alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. Then iv) nitrate again.

Wait, but the target has one nitro group, so perhaps this isn't right.

Option C: i) tert-butyl, ii) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonation (adds a sulfonic acid group which is a strong meta director), then iii) nitration. Hmm, but the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so maybe that's not the right path.

Option B: i) t-butyl, ii) nitrate; iii) Fe/HCl (maybe reduce nitro to amine?), iv) nitrate again. Hmm, not sure.

Option A: i) t-butyl, ii) nitrate, iii) sulfonate, iv) more steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl (Friedel-Crafts alkylation).

2. Nitrate the ring â†’ the nitro group will be added in a position directed by the tert-butyl. Since tert-butyl is ortho/para, nitro would go para or ortho. But nitro is a meta director, so wait, no. The nitro group is added when the ring is activated by the t-butyl group. So where would nitro go?

Wait, nitro is added in a nitration step. Since the ring is activated by t-butyl, the nitro group would be added in the ortho or para position relative to t-butyl. But nitro is a meta director, so when adding another group after nitro, it would go meta to nitro.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is in position 3. So perhaps the nitro is added after ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added after the ethoxy group. Let's think:

1. Add t-butyl (step i).

2. Add ethoxy group (how? Maybe via a substitution, but benzene can't just substitute directly. Wait, perhaps after making a nitro group, reduce it to an amine, then perform some kind of alkylation. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method, such as using an ether formation after nitration. Wait, but no, that's not straightforward.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach this differently. Let me think about the target structure again.

The molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

So, in the ring, these are adjacent to each other. So 1 is adjacent to 2 and 3, 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3, and 3 is adjacent to 1 and 2.

So, the substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Now, let's think about the order of adding substituents.

Option 1: Add t-butyl first. Then, add ethoxy. Then, add nitro.

But when adding the nitro group, the existing substituents (t-butyl and ethoxy) would direct its position.

Alternatively, Option 2: Add ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

Let me consider Option 2. Starting with benzene, add ethoxy. Since ethoxy is OCH2CH3, it's an activating, ortho/para director.

So, after adding ethoxy, the next substituent (t-butyl) would go either ortho or para to ethoxy.

If t-butyl is added as ortho to ethoxy, then when adding nitro, it would be directed by both ethoxy and t-butyl. But nitro is a meta director, so perhaps it would go in a position meta to ethoxy or t-butyl.

Wait, but the target has nitro in position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy (position 1) and t-butyl (position 2). Hmm, that's tricky. Because if nitro is added last, and the ring has ethoxy (position 1) and t-butyl (position 2), then the available positions are 3,4,5,6. But in the target, nitro is in position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy (1) and t-butyl (2). So perhaps, when adding nitro after ethoxy and t-butyl, the nitro would have to go into a position that's meta to one group and ortho to another.

Wait, but nitro is meta directing, so when adding it, it would go meta to the activating groups. So if ethoxy is at position 1 and t-butyl at 2, then where would nitro go?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added before the ethoxy and t-butyl. Let me think: if nitro is added first, then the nitro group is at position 3. Then, adding ethoxy would go meta to nitro, but ethoxy is an activating group, so in a nitro-substituted benzene, the ethoxy would go in the para position, perhaps.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline each option's steps and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options, each starts with adding t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts. So step i is t-butyl.

Then, step ii varies. Let's see:

Option A: after t-butyl, step ii is nitration. So now we have t-butyl and nitro groups on benzene. Next step iii is sulfonation. Wait, but in the target, there's an ethoxy group. So when does the ethoxy get introduced?

Looking at option A, step vii is NaOH and EtBr. Maybe that's a nucleophilic substitution, like introducing an ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis. But wait, to do that, we would need a good leaving group, like a bromide.

Hmm, perhaps this option adds the ethoxy group after some steps. Let's imagine the steps:

i) t-butyl added: we have tert-butyl benzene.

ii) Nitrate: nitro group added. Since t-butyl is an activating group, the nitro would go para to t-butyl (because nitration is directed by the activating group, which is ortho/para, but nitro is a meta director. Wait, no: when adding nitro to a ring activated by t-butyl, the nitro will go in the para position relative to t-butyl.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director with respect to itself, but when added to an activated ring, it goes ortho or para. Wait, no, the activating group (t-butyl) is ortho/para directing. So when adding nitro, the nitro group would be in ortho or para to the t-butyl.

Wait, but the target has nitro in position 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl in position 2 and ethoxy in position 1. Hmm, so perhaps the nitro is added after the ethoxy.

But in option A, after adding t-butyl and nitro, there's a sulfonation step. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps let's think of the steps in each option.

Option D steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate benzene. Now benzene has nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ perhaps reduce nitro to amine? But then, what's next? iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl. But nitro is a meta director, so adding t-butyl would go meta to nitro. So, if nitro is at position 1, t-butyl would be at 3. Then, step iv) nitrate again? But that would add another nitro group, which isn't in the target.

So probably, option D is not the correct sequence.

Option B steps:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate. So now, t-butyl and nitro are on the ring. Nitro is para to t-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl â†’ perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again â†’ but target has only one nitro group.

Hmm, not matching.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonate. Now ring has t-butyl and sulfonic acid (which is a strong meta director).

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate. So where does nitro go? Since the ring has t-butyl (ortho/para) and sulfonic acid (meta), the nitro would be directed to a position that's ortho or para to t-butyl and meta to sulfonic acid.

But this seems complicated, and the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so option C is likely incorrect.

Option A:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate â†’ nitro added para to t-butyl.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonate. Hmm, but target doesn't have this.

iv) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization, perhaps.

v) dilute H2SO4 â†’ hydrolysis? Or maybe acid workup.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ maybe steam distillation or hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ perhaps an SN2 reaction, introducing ethoxy group.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonate again?

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, but the target doesn't have sulfonic acid, so steps iii and viii in option A add sulfonic acid, which isn't part of the target. So perhaps option A is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps. Let me think again.

In option A, after adding t-butyl and nitro (steps i and ii), step iii is sulfonation, which adds a sulfonic acid group. Then step iv is NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), which is typically used with aromatic amines. But if we have nitro and sulfonic acid groups, which are meta directors, perhaps the next substitution would be in a specific position.

But this seems to be leading away from the target. So perhaps the correct option isn't A.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again about the target structure. It has ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro in positions 1,2,3.

So the order of adding substituents must be such that each new group is directed into the correct position by the existing groups.

Another approach: the nitro group is a meta director, so it's probably added last. Because once nitro is present, it's hard to add other groups.

So the plan is:

1. Add t-butyl â†’ benzene becomes tert-butyl benzene.

2. Add ethoxy â†’ in ortho or para to t-butyl.

3. Add nitro â†’ in a position directed by both t-butyl and ethoxy.

Wait, but if ethoxy and t-butyl are both activating, they are both ortho/para directors. So when adding nitro (which is meta), but wait, no: nitro is added via nitration, which is a meta director. Wait, no: the existing groups are activating, so when adding nitro (a meta director), the nitro group will go meta to the most activating group, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added after ethoxy and t-butyl groups are in place, such that it is directed into the correct position.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's steps and see which one aligns with the target.

Let me think about option D's steps:

i) Nitrate benzene â†’ nitro group at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine (NH2 group at position 1).

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation â†’ add t-butyl. The amine is a strong activating group, so t-butyl would go ortho or para to amine.

So, if amine is at position 1, t-butyl can go to position 3 or 4. Wait, but in the target, t-butyl is at position 2. So this doesn't match.

Option B:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate â†’ nitro at para (position 4).

iii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again â†’ another nitro group. But target has only one nitro.

No good.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) sulfonate â†’ adds SO3H group at meta to t-butyl.

iii) nitrate â†’ nitro would go meta to SO3H and ortho/para to t-butyl. Hmm.

But the target doesn't have sulfonate.

Option A:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate â†’ nitro at para.

iii) sulfonate â†’ adds SO3H.

iv) diazotization.

v) H2SO4.

vi) H3O+/H2O/heat.

vii) NaOH/EtBr.

viii) sulfonate again.

ix) H2SO4.

Target doesn't have sulfonate, so likely not.

Wait, but what if the steps after introducing t-butyl and nitro involve substituting a group to introduce ethoxy.

Wait, in option A, step vii is NaOH and EtBr, which is likely an SN2 reaction. So perhaps they're substituting a bromide with ethoxide.

But where would that bromide come from?

Wait, maybe after nitration and sulfonation, some steps involve replacing a leaving group with ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps in option B, after nitration and reduction, etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the target molecule again.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So substituents are:

- Position 1: ethoxy.

- Position 2: t-butyl.

- Position 3: nitro.

So the positions are 1,2,3, meaning all adjacent.

So perhaps the order is:

- Add ethoxy first. Then add t-butyl. Then nitro.

Let's see:

1. Add ethoxy to benzene: via nitration followed by reduction? No, benzene can't directly substitute ethoxy. Alternatively, perhaps we can perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by some reduction, but that's not straightforward. Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acyl group, which can be reduced to CH2, but that's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires activating groups.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene â†’ nitro group in position 1.

2. Reduce nitro to amine â†’ NH2 in position 1.

3. Perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add t-butyl. But amine is a strong activating group, so t-butyl would go ortho or para to amine.

Wait, let's say amine is at position 1. Then t-butyl can be added at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). If we add it at position 2, then the ring has NH2 at 1 and t-butyl at 2.

4. Then, introduce ethoxy group. But how? Maybe via a substitution reaction.

Wait, but that's a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if any of the options match this sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is: t-butyl â†’ nitro â†’ ethoxy.

But how to introduce ethoxy after nitro and t-butyl?

Wait, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring must have activating groups. If the ring has t-butyl and nitro, which are deactivating and activating respectively, perhaps it's possible.

Wait, nitro is deactivating, t-butyl is activating. So the ring is overall activated. So perhaps after adding t-butyl and nitro, we can introduce ethoxy via a substitution.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced as a leaving group. Like, perhaps we have a nitration followed by a substitution.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about the steps in each option again.

Looking again at option D:

i) Nitrate benzene â†’ nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduces nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation â†’ add t-butyl.

iv) Nitrate again â†’ another nitro group. But target has only one nitro. So this can't be right.

Option B:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate â†’ nitro para to t-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again. Again, target has only one nitro, so this is unlikely.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

But target doesn't have sulfonate.

Option A:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization).

v) dilute H2SO4 â†’ hydrolysis (maybe of a diazonium salt).

vi) H3O+/H2O/heat â†’ perhaps hydrolysis to form a hydroxyl group.

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ substitution to introduce ethoxy.

viii) sulfonate again.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, but the target doesn't have sulfonate. So perhaps option A is not correct.

Wait, but maybe in option A, the sulfonate steps are to introduce a leaving group, which is then replaced by ethoxy.

Wait, let's think: after adding t-butyl and nitro, sulfonate is added as a meta director. Then, perhaps a diazonium salt is formed, which is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group. Then, the hydroxyl is replaced by ethoxy via an SN2 reaction (NaOH and EtBr).

Wait, but let's outline this:

1. Benzene â†’ t-butyl (step i).

2. Nitrate â†’ nitro added para to t-butyl (step ii).

3. Sulfonate â†’ adds a sulfonic acid group. Where? It would go meta to t-butyl and ortho/para to nitro. Hmm, but nitro is a meta director, so sulfonic acid would go meta to nitro as well. Or since t-butyl is more activating, perhaps it's directed by t-butyl.

Wait, probably, the sulfonic acid group would go meta to the t-butyl group. So, if t-butyl is at position 2, nitro at 4, then sulfonic acid could go at position 6 (meta to t-butyl). Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Then, step iv is NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization. But where? If we have nitro groups and sulfonic acid, perhaps the amine is formed by reduction. Wait, but in step ii, we have nitro. So step iii is sulfonate, then step iv is diazotization. But to form a diazonium salt, we need an aromatic amine. So maybe steps iii and iv are not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps steps in option A are introducing a leaving group which is replaced by ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps after adding t-butyl and nitro, the sulfonate is added to create a good leaving group. Then, the sulfonic acid group is replaced by ethoxy.

But that would require a substitution reaction, which typically requires a good leaving group and an activating group. But sulfonic acid is a strong -M group, which deactivates the ring, making substitution difficult.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think about the correct order of adding substituents.

The target has ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro.

The ethoxy is at position 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, the order should be such that when adding nitro, it goes into position 3, which is between ethoxy (1) and t-butyl (2).

But to get nitro into position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy and t-butyl, perhaps the nitro is added last, as a meta director, but directed by the existing groups.

So, steps:

1. Add ethoxy.

2. Add t-butyl.

3. Add nitro.

But how?

After adding ethoxy (step 1), the ring is activated and ethoxy is ortho/para directing.

Adding t-butyl (step 2) would go either ortho or para to ethoxy. If it goes ortho, then the positions are ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2.

Now, when adding nitro (step 3), the ring has ethoxy at 1 and t-butyl at 2. The nitro group is a meta director, so where would it go?

Since the ring is activated by ethoxy and t-butyl, the nitro group would be directed by these groups. The available positions are 3,4,5,6.

But in the target, nitro is at 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy (1) and t-butyl (2). So, when adding nitro, it would need to be in a position that is meta to one of the existing groups but adjacent to the other.

Wait, but that's conflicting. Because nitro is a meta director, it would go meta to the existing substituents.

Wait, perhaps ethoxy is at position 1, t-butyl at 2. Nitro would go meta to ethoxy, which would be position 4. But that's not the target's position.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added meta to t-butyl. t-butyl is at 2, so meta would be position 5. That's not the target either.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the order is different.

Alternative approach: perhaps the nitro is added first. So:

1. Nitrate benzene â†’ nitro at position 1.

2. Add ethoxy. Since nitro is a meta director, ethoxy would go to position 4 (meta to nitro).

But then, adding t-butyl would be directed by both nitro and ethoxy. Nitro is a meta director, ethoxy is ortho/para. So t-butyl would go in a position that is ortho or para to ethoxy and meta to nitro.

If nitro is at 1, ethoxy at 4, then t-butyl could be at position 3 (meta to nitro, and ortho to ethoxy).

Wait, that would give substituents at 1 (nitro),4 (ethoxy),3 (t-butyl). But the target has substituents at 1,2,3.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first at position 3.

Wait, but how to direct nitro to position 3 first.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Add nitro.

3. Add ethoxy.

But when adding ethoxy, it would go ortho or para to t-butyl, which is at position 2. So ethoxy could be at position 1 or 3.

But in the target, ethoxy is at 1, nitro at 3.

So, after adding t-butyl (position 2), nitro is added (meta to t-butyl â†’ position 5?), then ethoxy is added ortho to t-butyl (position 1 or 3).

Wait, but position 3 is where nitro is in the target. So perhaps this isn't right.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think about the options again and see which one's steps lead to the correct structure.

Looking for an option where ethoxy is introduced after tert-butyl and nitro.

Wait, in option A, after several steps (including sulfonation, diazotization, etc.), step vii is NaOH and EtBr. That's probably for introducing the ethoxy group via SN2.

So, if the steps are:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitro.

iii) sulfonate.

iv) make diazonium salt.

v) hydrolyze to OH.

vi) H3O+/H2O/heat â†’ maybe acid workup.

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ substitute OH with OEt.

viii) sulfonate again.

ix) H2SO4.

But the target doesn't have sulfonate groups, so option A is probably incorrect.

Option D:

i) nitrate â†’ nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts â†’ amine is activating, so t-butyl goes ortho or para to amine.

iv) nitrate again â†’ another nitro.

But target has one nitro. So D is wrong.

Option B:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate â†’ nitro para to t-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again â†’ another nitro.

No, so B is wrong.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate â†’ nitro goes where?

iv) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

v) diazotize.

vi) nitrate again.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, going back to the problem, the target has ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro in positions 1, 2, 3.

So, to get substituents at positions 1,2,3, perhaps the first substituent is t-butyl at position 2. Then, add ethoxy at position 1 (ortho to t-butyl). Then, add nitro at position 3 (meta to ethoxy and ortho to t-butyl).

Wait, but how to add nitro in position 3 after ethoxy and t-butyl.

Wait, perhaps after adding ethoxy and t-butyl, the nitro is added where it's directed by both groups.

Since both ethoxy and t-butyl are activating and ortho/para directors, the nitro would go into a position that is ortho or para to both. But that's not possible because they are adjacent. So perhaps the nitro would go into position 3, which is adjacent to both.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director. So when the ring has ethoxy at 1 and t-butyl at 2, the nitro would go meta to one of them. But given their positions, the meta positions would be 4 (meta to 1) and 5 (meta to 2). So that doesn't align with the target.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should consider that the correct option is D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to nitrate first, then add ethoxy, then add t-butyl.

Wait, if I nitrate first, nitro at position 1. Then, ethoxy would be added in the para position (position 4) due to nitro being meta director. Then, t-butyl would be added in the meta position relative to nitro, which is position 3. But that's not matching the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add t-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy.

Wait, t-butyl at position 2. Nitro would go meta to t-butyl â†’ position 5. Ethoxy would go ortho to t-butyl â†’ position 1 or 3. If ethoxy is at position 1, then nitro is at 5. That's not the target.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to look for the correct option based on the steps.

The target has ethoxy, which is an activating group. To introduce an ethoxy group via substitution, perhaps we need a good leaving group, like a nitro group.

Wait, another approach: maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring needs to have a strong activating group. So perhaps the steps involve:

1. Add t-butyl (activating) â†’ step i.

2. Add nitro group (deactivating) â†’ step ii.

3. Then, add ethoxy via substitution of a nitro group.

Wait, but nitro is not a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps convert nitro to a leaving group.

Wait, maybe reduce nitro to amine, then convert amine to a good leaving group like diazonium chloride, then substitute with ethoxy.

So steps:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate â†’ nitro.

iii) reduce nitro to amine.

iv) make diazonium salt.

v) substitute with ethoxy.

But looking at the options, does any option have such a sequence?

Looking at option B: steps are i) t-butyl, ii) nitrate, iii) Fe/HCl (reduce nitro to amine), iv) nitrate again (unlikely). So not matching.

Option A: After nitration, sulfonate, etc., but doesn't directly add ethoxy.

Wait, in option A, step vii is NaOH and EtBr. That's likely introducing ethoxy via an SN2 reaction. So perhaps the leaving group is a bromide.

How would bromide be introduced? Maybe via a substitution after making a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps after nitration and sulfonation, one of the steps introduces a bromide.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate â†’ nitro.

iii) sulfonate â†’ adds SO3H.

iv) diazotization â†’ forms diazonium salt.

v) dilute H2SO4 â†’ hydrolyzes diazonium to a hydroxyl group.

vi) H3O+/H2O/heat â†’ perhaps acid workup.

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ substitutes hydroxyl with ethoxy.

So after steps i to vii, we have t-butyl, nitro, and ethoxy groups. But where?

Hmm, perhaps this is the case in option A.

Wait, in option A:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate â†’ nitro para to t-butyl.

iii) sulfonate â†’ adds SO3H at meta to t-butyl (position 6).

iv) NaNO2/HCl â†’ makes a diazonium salt from the nitro group? No, nitro is already present. Maybe from the sulfonate group? No, sulfonate is a strong -M group.

Wait, perhaps the steps in option A introduce a bromide which is then replaced by ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via an alkoxy group formation after making a leaving group.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess that option D is the correct one, but I'm not completely sure.

Wait, no, option D starts with nitration, which seems to lead to incorrect positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, no, I think I should conclude that option D is not correct because after nitration, steps lead to adding t-butyl in the wrong position.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is option D: starting with nitration, then reduction, then alkylation, etc. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: let's think about the number of substituents and their positions.

In the target, positions 1,2,3 are filled. So, in the correct sequence, each substituent must be added in a way that directs the next one into the correct position.

Perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy ortho to t-butyl.

3. Add nitro meta to ethoxy, which would be adjacent to t-butyl.

So to achieve this, the steps would be:

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl.

ii) Friedel-Crafts etherification with ethoxy. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts doesn't work for ethers. Ethers require a different method, like using a Williamson ether synthesis, which involves a good leaving group.

So, perhaps after adding t-butyl, we need to introduce a nitro group to direct the ethoxy into the correct position.

Wait, I'm getting even more confused.

Given the time I've spent, I'll make a guess that the correct answer is option D.

The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. The analysis focuses on the directing effects of these groups and the sequence of their introduction.

### Key Analysis of the Target Molecule:
1. **Substituent Effects**:
   - **tert-butyl**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - **ethoxy**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - **nitro**: Deactivating, meta-directing.

2. **Substituent Positions**:
   - The substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern, meaning they are adjacent to each other on the benzene ring.

3. **Challenges**:
   - The nitro group is a strong deactivating group, making it difficult to add subsequent substituents after it is introduced.
   - The ethoxy group must be introduced in a way that avoids steric hindrance and aligns with the directing effects of the existing substituents.

### Evaluation of Options:
#### **Option A**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  2. Nitration.
  3. Sulfonation.
  4. Diazotization.
  5. Hydrolysis.
  6. Acid workup.
  7. Substitution with ethoxy.
  8. Sulfonation.
  9. Acid workup.
- **Issues**:
  - Introduces a sulfonic acid group (SOâ‚ƒH), which is not part of the target molecule.
  - The sequence does not clearly align with the desired positions of the substituents.

#### **Option B**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  2. Nitration.
  3. Reduction of nitro to amine.
  4. Nitration again.
- **Issues**:
  - Adds an additional nitro group, which is not part of the target molecule.
  - Does not account for the introduction of the ethoxy group.

#### **Option C**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  2. Sulfonation.
  3. Nitration.
  4. Reduction of nitro to amine.
  5. Diazotization.
  6. Nitration again.
- **Issues**:
  - Introduces a sulfonic acid group (SOâ‚ƒH), which is not part of the target molecule.
  - Does not clearly align with the desired positions of the substituents.

#### **Option D**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Nitration.
  2. Reduction of nitro to amine.
  3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  4. Nitration again.
- **Issues**:
  - Adds an additional nitro group, which is not part of the target molecule.
  - Does not account for the introduction of the ethoxy group.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating all options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the desired synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option D** is selected as the most plausible choice, despite its shortcomings.

Answer: D

Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. We need to figure out which sequence of reactions from the given options will achieve this starting from benzene.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Looking at the numbering, the tert-butyl is in position 2, ethoxy in position 1, and nitro in position 3. Wait, wait, benzene is a ring, so positions are relative. Let's think about the substituents' positions. Let me draw it out in my mind: the ethoxy is at position 1 (which is the para position relative to itself if we consider the nitro as another substituent), but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the numbering is 1 for ethoxy, 2 for tert-butyl, and 3 for nitro. So the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, meaning they are adjacent to each other in a certain arrangement.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me imagine that: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So they are meta to each other? Wait, no, positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So like 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, and 3 is nitro. So it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with substituents in the 1,2,3 positions.

Wait, but when doing synthesis, the order of adding substituents matters because of the directing effects of the groups already present. So, adding groups in the right order is crucial.

The target molecule has two substituents that are meta directors: nitro is a strong meta director, and ethoxy is an ortho/para director. Wait, no, ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an ether), so it's an ortho/para director. Nitro is deactivating and meta. The tert-butyl group is bulky; I think it's a deactivating group because it's an alkyl group attached via a sigma bond. Wait, no, wait. Alkyl groups are activating (electron donating by induction), so they are ortho/para directors. Wait, but wait, tert-butyl is a bulky group, so perhaps it's more about steric hindrance when adding subsequent groups. But in terms of directing, it should be an activating group (since it's an alkyl chain), thus directing incoming substituents to ortho and para positions.

So the target molecule has three substituents. Let's think about the order in which they were added. Since nitro is a strong deactivating group, it's probably better to add it after groups that are activating, because once the nitro group is present, it will deactivate the ring and direct meta.

So perhaps the steps are: first add the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro. Or maybe another order.

Wait, but the target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. Let me think about how the positions would be directed.

Let's assume we start with benzene. First, we add one substituent. Let's say we add the tert-butyl group. Because AlCl3 is a Lewis acid catalyst, so tert-butyl chloride would undergo Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts works for activating groups. So after adding tert-butyl, the ring has a tert-butyl group attached. Then, next substituent: let's say we add ethoxy. Since tert-butyl is an activating group (alkyl), it's ortho/para directing. So when adding ethoxy, which is also activating (since it's an ether, OCH2CH3), it would go into ortho or para positions relative to the tert-butyl.

Wait, but after adding tert-butyl, the next substituent (ethoxy) would go either ortho or para to the tert-butyl. Let's say we add ethoxy next. Then, the ring has ethoxy in position either ortho or para to the tert-butyl. Suppose ethoxy is added in the para position relative to tert-butyl. Then, the next substituent would be nitro. But nitro is a deactivating group, so after adding nitro, the ring is deactivated, making further substitutions harder. Alternatively, maybe nitro is added after ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the order is: first add tert-butyl, then nitro, then ethoxy. Because once nitro is added, it would direct the next substituent to a certain position.

Wait, no, that might complicate because nitro is a meta director. Let me think again.

Alternatively, let's think about which substituents are meta to each other. The target has ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So in the ring, 1,2,3 positions are adjacent. So, the substituents are in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted arrangement.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to approach this by considering the directing effects. Let's think of the substituents' order.

Suppose we first add the ethoxy group. Then, the ring is activated, and ethoxy is an ortho/para director. Next, adding tert-butyl would go either ortho or para to ethoxy. But since tert-butyl is bulky, perhaps it's added in a specific position. Then, adding nitro would be directed by the existing groups.

Wait, but if the first substituent is ethoxy, then adding the second substituent (tert-butyl) would be in either ortho or para. Let's say para. Then, the third substituent, nitro, would be added. Since nitro is a meta director, but which existing substituents are present?

Hmm, maybe another approach: the substituents are nitro (meta director), ethoxy (ortho/para), and tert-butyl (ortho/para). So perhaps the nitro is added first, then the other groups in a way that they are directed by it.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating group, so adding it early on would make the ring harder to substitute further. So perhaps it's better to add nitro last.

So the plan is: first add the tert-butyl, then the ethoxy, and then the nitro. But wait, the nitro is a meta director, so when adding it, it would go to a position directed by the other substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added first, then the other groups. Let me see.

Wait, looking at the target, the nitro is at position 3. So if we imagine the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3, their relative positions are such that nitro is adjacent to both ethoxy and tert-butyl. Hmm, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is the last group to be added. Let me think: after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, their positions would direct where the nitro goes.

Wait, let me outline the possible steps:

1. Benzene â†’ add tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
2. Then, add ethoxy group. The ring is activated by tert-butyl, so ethoxy can be added in an ortho or para position relative to tert-butyl.
3. Then, add nitro group. At this point, the ring has two substituents: tert-butyl and ethoxy. The nitro group will go into a position directed by both, but since nitro is a meta director with respect to any activating groups, but once added, it deactivates the ring. Wait, but if we're adding nitro as a substituent, perhaps it's best to add it when the ring is still activated by other groups.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the nitro is in a position that's adjacent to the tert-butyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy and tert-butyl are already present, and then the nitro is added in a position that's directed by both.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first, then the other groups. Let me see.

Wait, if I first nitrate benzene, the nitro group will be in a certain position. Then, adding ethoxy and tert-butyl. But nitro is a meta director, so when adding ethoxy, it would go meta to nitro, but since ethoxy is itself an ortho/para director, perhaps this could be possible.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each substituent's effect.

The target molecule's substituents:

- Position 1: ethoxy (OCH2CH3). This is an activating group, ortho/para director.
- Position 2: tert-butyl (C(CH3)3). Activating, ortho/para director.
- Position 3: nitro (NO2). Deactivating, meta director.

So when adding the nitro group last, it should be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, let me think: after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the positions where nitro can be added would be determined by their directing effects.

Suppose the ethoxy is in position 1, tert-butyl in position 2. Then, the ring has these two groups. The next substituent (nitro) would be added in a position that's meta to one of these groups or perhaps ortho/para to another. Hmm.

Alternatively, the nitro could be added as the last step. Let's think about how to get all three substituents in the correct positions.

Another approach: the substituents are in positions 1, 2, 3. So in a benzene ring, numbers 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So 1 is next to 2 and 3, 2 is next to 1 and 3, and 3 is next to 2 and 1. So all three substituents are adjacent to each other. So each substituent is adjacent to the other two.

So perhaps the ethoxy is introduced first. Then, the tert-butyl is added in the para position relative to ethoxy. Then, the nitro is added in the meta position relative to ethoxy, which would be adjacent to tert-butyl. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the order of reactions in the options given. Each option has a series of steps, and the correct option would correctly place all substituents.

Looking at the options, each starts with a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3). So step i in all options is adding tert-butyl.

Option A: after i, the steps are HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), then SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation?), then more steps. Option B: after i, nitration, then Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction?), etc.

Wait, perhaps the order is important. Let's think for each option.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

Looking at the substituents:

- Ethoxy is at position 1.

- Tert-butyl at 2.

- Nitro at 3.

So let's think about the order of substitution.

An effective strategy is to add the substituents in an order that allows each new group to be directed by the existing groups to the desired position.

Assuming the first substituent is tert-butyl (since all options start with that). So after step i, we have tert-butyl benzene.

Next, in step ii, some options nitrate. For example, option A step ii is nitration (HNO3/H2SO4). Then step iii is sulfonation. Hmm.

Wait, but the target has an ethoxy group. So when is the ethoxy added?

Looking at the options, in option A, step vii is NaOH/EtBr (probably an SN2 reaction, like ethoxylation via Williamson or similar?), and step viii is Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction, like converting nitro to amine? Or perhaps a different reaction).

Wait, but in the target, we have an ethoxy group, a nitro group, and a tert-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps we need to nitrate the ring, then introduce the ethoxy group via a substitution.

Wait, but benzene can't directly substitute OCH2CH3 unless it's through a nitration followed by some other steps.

Wait, no. To add an ethoxy group, we can perform an alkoxylation, but that's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps it's added as a nitro group first, then reduced to an amine, then undergo some kind of substitution, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a different method. Another approach is to have a nitration, then a sulfonation, then a nitration again, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an ether formation. Alternatively, maybe using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires activating groups.

Wait, perhaps steps involve adding the tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro, but in a specific order.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option D.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitro group added. Then ii) Fe/HCl â†’ maybe reduction of nitro to amine? But that's not part of the target. iii) Alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. Then iv) nitrate again.

Wait, but the target has one nitro group, so perhaps this isn't right.

Option C: i) tert-butyl, ii) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonation (adds a sulfonic acid group which is a strong meta director), then iii) nitration. Hmm, but the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so maybe that's not the right path.

Option B: i) t-butyl, ii) nitrate; iii) Fe/HCl (maybe reduce nitro to amine?), iv) nitrate again. Hmm, not sure.

Option A: i) t-butyl, ii) nitrate, iii) sulfonate, iv) more steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl (Friedel-Crafts alkylation).

2. Nitrate the ring â†’ the nitro group will be added in a position directed by the tert-butyl. Since tert-butyl is ortho/para, nitro would go para or ortho. But nitro is a meta director, so wait, no. The nitro group is added when the ring is activated by the t-butyl group. So where would nitro go?

Wait, nitro is added in a nitration step. Since the ring is activated by t-butyl, the nitro group would be added in the ortho or para position relative to t-butyl. But nitro is a meta director, so when adding another group after nitro, it would go meta to nitro.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is in position 3. So perhaps the nitro is added after ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added after the ethoxy group. Let's think:

1. Add t-butyl (step i).

2. Add ethoxy group (how? Maybe via a substitution, but benzene can't just substitute directly. Wait, perhaps after making a nitro group, reduce it to an amine, then perform some kind of alkylation. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method, such as using an ether formation after nitration. Wait, but no, that's not straightforward.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach this differently. Let me think about the target structure again.

The molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

So, in the ring, these are adjacent to each other. So 1 is adjacent to 2 and 3, 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3, and 3 is adjacent to 1 and 2.

So, the substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Now, let's think about the order of adding substituents.

Option 1: Add t-butyl first. Then, add ethoxy. Then, add nitro.

But when adding the nitro group, the existing substituents (t-butyl and ethoxy) would direct its position.

Alternatively, Option 2: Add ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

Let me consider Option 2. Starting with benzene, add ethoxy. Since ethoxy is OCH2CH3, it's an activating, ortho/para director.

So, after adding ethoxy, the next substituent (t-butyl) would go either ortho or para to ethoxy.

If t-butyl is added as ortho to ethoxy, then when adding nitro, it would be directed by both ethoxy and t-butyl. But nitro is a meta director, so perhaps it would go in a position meta to ethoxy or t-butyl.

Wait, but the target has nitro in position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy (position 1) and t-butyl (position 2). Hmm, that's tricky. Because if nitro is added last, and the ring has ethoxy (position 1) and t-butyl (position 2), then the available positions are 3,4,5,6. But in the target, nitro is in position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy (1) and t-butyl (2). So perhaps, when adding nitro after ethoxy and t-butyl, the nitro would have to go into a position that's meta to one group and ortho to another.

Wait, but nitro is meta directing, so when adding it, it would go meta to the activating groups. So if ethoxy is at position 1 and t-butyl at 2, then where would nitro go?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added before the ethoxy and t-butyl. Let me think: if nitro is added first, then the nitro group is at position 3. Then, adding ethoxy would go meta to nitro, but ethoxy is an activating group, so in a nitro-substituted benzene, the ethoxy would go in the para position, perhaps.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline each option's steps and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options, each starts with adding t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts. So step i is t-butyl.

Then, step ii varies. Let's see:

Option A: after t-butyl, step ii is nitration. So now we have t-butyl and nitro groups on benzene. Next step iii is sulfonation. Wait, but in the target, there's an ethoxy group. So when does the ethoxy get introduced?

Looking at option A, step vii is NaOH and EtBr. Maybe that's a nucleophilic substitution, like introducing an ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis. But wait, to do that, we would need a good leaving group, like a bromide.

Hmm, perhaps this option adds the ethoxy group after some steps. Let's imagine the steps:

i) t-butyl added: we have tert-butyl benzene.

ii) Nitrate: nitro group added. Since t-butyl is an activating group, the nitro would go para to t-butyl (because nitration is directed by the activating group, which is ortho/para, but nitro is a meta director. Wait, no: when adding nitro to a ring activated by t-butyl, the nitro will go in the para position relative to t-butyl.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director with respect to itself, but when added to an activated ring, it goes ortho or para. Wait, no, the activating group (t-butyl) is ortho/para directing. So when adding nitro, the nitro group would be in ortho or para to the t-butyl.

Wait, but the target has nitro in position 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl in position 2 and ethoxy in position 1. Hmm, so perhaps the nitro is added after the ethoxy.

But in option A, after adding t-butyl and nitro, there's a sulfonation step. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps let's think of the steps in each option.

Option D steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate benzene. Now benzene has nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ perhaps reduce nitro to amine? But then, what's next? iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl. But nitro is a meta director, so adding t-butyl would go meta to nitro. So, if nitro is at position 1, t-butyl would be at 3. Then, step iv) nitrate again? But that would add another nitro group, which isn't in the target.

So probably, option D is not the correct sequence.

Option B steps:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate. So now, t-butyl and nitro are on the ring. Nitro is para to t-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl â†’ perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again â†’ but target has only one nitro group.

Hmm, not matching.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonate. Now ring has t-butyl and sulfonic acid (which is a strong meta director).

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate. So where does nitro go? Since the ring has t-butyl (ortho/para) and sulfonic acid (meta), the nitro would be directed to a position that's ortho or para to t-butyl and meta to sulfonic acid.

But this seems complicated, and the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so option C is likely incorrect.

Option A:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate â†’ nitro added para to t-butyl.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonate. Hmm, but target doesn't have this.

iv) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization, perhaps.

v) dilute H2SO4 â†’ hydrolysis? Or maybe acid workup.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ maybe steam distillation or hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ perhaps an SN2 reaction, introducing ethoxy group.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonate again?

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, but the target doesn't have sulfonic acid, so steps iii and viii in option A add sulfonic acid, which isn't part of the target. So perhaps option A is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps. Let me think again.

In option A, after adding t-butyl and nitro (steps i and ii), step iii is sulfonation, which adds a sulfonic acid group. Then step iv is NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), which is typically used with aromatic amines. But if we have nitro and sulfonic acid groups, which are meta directors, perhaps the next substitution would be in a specific position.

But this seems to be leading away from the target. So perhaps the correct option isn't A.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again about the target structure. It has ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro in positions 1,2,3.

So the order of adding substituents must be such that each new group is directed into the correct position by the existing groups.

Another approach: the nitro group is a meta director, so it's probably added last. Because once nitro is present, it's hard to add other groups.

So the plan is:

1. Add t-butyl â†’ benzene becomes tert-butyl benzene.

2. Add ethoxy â†’ in ortho or para to t-butyl.

3. Add nitro â†’ in a position directed by both t-butyl and ethoxy.

Wait, but if ethoxy and t-butyl are both activating, they are both ortho/para directors. So when adding nitro (which is meta), but wait, no: nitro is added via nitration, which is a meta director. Wait, no: the existing groups are activating, so when adding nitro (a meta director), the nitro group will go meta to the most activating group, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added after ethoxy and t-butyl groups are in place, such that it is directed into the correct position.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's steps and see which one aligns with the target.

Let me think about option D's steps:

i) Nitrate benzene â†’ nitro group at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine (NH2 group at position 1).

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation â†’ add t-butyl. The amine is a strong activating group, so t-butyl would go ortho or para to amine.

So, if amine is at position 1, t-butyl can go to position 3 or 4. Wait, but in the target, t-butyl is at position 2. So this doesn't match.

Option B:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate â†’ nitro at para (position 4).

iii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again â†’ another nitro group. But target has only one nitro.

No good.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) sulfonate â†’ adds SO3H group at meta to t-butyl.

iii) nitrate â†’ nitro would go meta to SO3H and ortho/para to t-butyl. Hmm.

But the target doesn't have sulfonate.

Option A:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate â†’ nitro at para.

iii) sulfonate â†’ adds SO3H.

iv) diazotization.

v) H2SO4.

vi) H3O+/H2O/heat.

vii) NaOH/EtBr.

viii) sulfonate again.

ix) H2SO4.

Target doesn't have sulfonate, so likely not.

Wait, but what if the steps after introducing t-butyl and nitro involve substituting a group to introduce ethoxy.

Wait, in option A, step vii is NaOH and EtBr, which is likely an SN2 reaction. So perhaps they're substituting a bromide with ethoxide.

But where would that bromide come from?

Wait, maybe after nitration and sulfonation, some steps involve replacing a leaving group with ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps in option B, after nitration and reduction, etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the target molecule again.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So substituents are:

- Position 1: ethoxy.

- Position 2: t-butyl.

- Position 3: nitro.

So the positions are 1,2,3, meaning all adjacent.

So perhaps the order is:

- Add ethoxy first. Then add t-butyl. Then nitro.

Let's see:

1. Add ethoxy to benzene: via nitration followed by reduction? No, benzene can't directly substitute ethoxy. Alternatively, perhaps we can perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by some reduction, but that's not straightforward. Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acyl group, which can be reduced to CH2, but that's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires activating groups.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene â†’ nitro group in position 1.

2. Reduce nitro to amine â†’ NH2 in position 1.

3. Perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add t-butyl. But amine is a strong activating group, so t-butyl would go ortho or para to amine.

Wait, let's say amine is at position 1. Then t-butyl can be added at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). If we add it at position 2, then the ring has NH2 at 1 and t-butyl at 2.

4. Then, introduce ethoxy group. But how? Maybe via a substitution reaction.

Wait, but that's a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if any of the options match this sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is: t-butyl â†’ nitro â†’ ethoxy.

But how to introduce ethoxy after nitro and t-butyl?

Wait, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring must have activating groups. If the ring has t-butyl and nitro, which are deactivating and activating respectively, perhaps it's possible.

Wait, nitro is deactivating, t-butyl is activating. So the ring is overall activated. So perhaps after adding t-butyl and nitro, we can introduce ethoxy via a substitution.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced as a leaving group. Like, perhaps we have a nitration followed by a substitution.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about the steps in each option again.

Looking again at option D:

i) Nitrate benzene â†’ nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduces nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation â†’ add t-butyl.

iv) Nitrate again â†’ another nitro group. But target has only one nitro. So this can't be right.

Option B:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate â†’ nitro para to t-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again. Again, target has only one nitro, so this is unlikely.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

But target doesn't have sulfonate.

Option A:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization).

v) dilute H2SO4 â†’ hydrolysis (maybe of a diazonium salt).

vi) H3O+/H2O/heat â†’ perhaps hydrolysis to form a hydroxyl group.

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ substitution to introduce ethoxy.

viii) sulfonate again.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, but the target doesn't have sulfonate. So perhaps option A is not correct.

Wait, but maybe in option A, the sulfonate steps are to introduce a leaving group, which is then replaced by ethoxy.

Wait, let's think: after adding t-butyl and nitro, sulfonate is added as a meta director. Then, perhaps a diazonium salt is formed, which is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group. Then, the hydroxyl is replaced by ethoxy via an SN2 reaction (NaOH and EtBr).

Wait, but let's outline this:

1. Benzene â†’ t-butyl (step i).

2. Nitrate â†’ nitro added para to t-butyl (step ii).

3. Sulfonate â†’ adds a sulfonic acid group. Where? It would go meta to t-butyl and ortho/para to nitro. Hmm, but nitro is a meta director, so sulfonic acid would go meta to nitro as well. Or since t-butyl is more activating, perhaps it's directed by t-butyl.

Wait, probably, the sulfonic acid group would go meta to the t-butyl group. So, if t-butyl is at position 2, nitro at 4, then sulfonic acid could go at position 6 (meta to t-butyl). Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Then, step iv is NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization. But where? If we have nitro groups and sulfonic acid, perhaps the amine is formed by reduction. Wait, but in step ii, we have nitro. So step iii is sulfonate, then step iv is diazotization. But to form a diazonium salt, we need an aromatic amine. So maybe steps iii and iv are not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps steps in option A are introducing a leaving group which is replaced by ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps after adding t-butyl and nitro, the sulfonate is added to create a good leaving group. Then, the sulfonic acid group is replaced by ethoxy.

But that would require a substitution reaction, which typically requires a good leaving group and an activating group. But sulfonic acid is a strong -M group, which deactivates the ring, making substitution difficult.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think about the correct order of adding substituents.

The target has ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro.

The ethoxy is at position 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, the order should be such that when adding nitro, it goes into position 3, which is between ethoxy (1) and t-butyl (2).

But to get nitro into position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy and t-butyl, perhaps the nitro is added last, as a meta director, but directed by the existing groups.

So, steps:

1. Add ethoxy.

2. Add t-butyl.

3. Add nitro.

But how?

After adding ethoxy (step 1), the ring is activated and ethoxy is ortho/para directing.

Adding t-butyl (step 2) would go either ortho or para to ethoxy. If it goes ortho, then the positions are ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2.

Now, when adding nitro (step 3), the ring has ethoxy at 1 and t-butyl at 2. The nitro group is a meta director, so where would it go?

Since the ring is activated by ethoxy and t-butyl, the nitro group would be directed by these groups. The available positions are 3,4,5,6.

But in the target, nitro is at 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy (1) and t-butyl (2). So, when adding nitro, it would need to be in a position that is meta to one of the existing groups but adjacent to the other.

Wait, but that's conflicting. Because nitro is a meta director, it would go meta to the existing substituents.

Wait, perhaps ethoxy is at position 1, t-butyl at 2. Nitro would go meta to ethoxy, which would be position 4. But that's not the target's position.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added meta to t-butyl. t-butyl is at 2, so meta would be position 5. That's not the target either.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the order is different.

Alternative approach: perhaps the nitro is added first. So:

1. Nitrate benzene â†’ nitro at position 1.

2. Add ethoxy. Since nitro is a meta director, ethoxy would go to position 4 (meta to nitro).

But then, adding t-butyl would be directed by both nitro and ethoxy. Nitro is a meta director, ethoxy is ortho/para. So t-butyl would go in a position that is ortho or para to ethoxy and meta to nitro.

If nitro is at 1, ethoxy at 4, then t-butyl could be at position 3 (meta to nitro, and ortho to ethoxy).

Wait, that would give substituents at 1 (nitro),4 (ethoxy),3 (t-butyl). But the target has substituents at 1,2,3.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first at position 3.

Wait, but how to direct nitro to position 3 first.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Add nitro.

3. Add ethoxy.

But when adding ethoxy, it would go ortho or para to t-butyl, which is at position 2. So ethoxy could be at position 1 or 3.

But in the target, ethoxy is at 1, nitro at 3.

So, after adding t-butyl (position 2), nitro is added (meta to t-butyl â†’ position 5?), then ethoxy is added ortho to t-butyl (position 1 or 3).

Wait, but position 3 is where nitro is in the target. So perhaps this isn't right.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think about the options again and see which one's steps lead to the correct structure.

Looking for an option where ethoxy is introduced after tert-butyl and nitro.

Wait, in option A, after several steps (including sulfonation, diazotization, etc.), step vii is NaOH and EtBr. That's probably for introducing the ethoxy group via SN2.

So, if the steps are:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitro.

iii) sulfonate.

iv) make diazonium salt.

v) hydrolyze to OH.

vi) H3O+/H2O/heat â†’ maybe acid workup.

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ substitute OH with OEt.

viii) sulfonate again.

ix) H2SO4.

But the target doesn't have sulfonate groups, so option A is probably incorrect.

Option D:

i) nitrate â†’ nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts â†’ amine is activating, so t-butyl goes ortho or para to amine.

iv) nitrate again â†’ another nitro.

But target has one nitro. So D is wrong.

Option B:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate â†’ nitro para to t-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again â†’ another nitro.

No, so B is wrong.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate â†’ nitro goes where?

iv) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

v) diazotize.

vi) nitrate again.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, going back to the problem, the target has ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro in positions 1, 2, 3.

So, to get substituents at positions 1,2,3, perhaps the first substituent is t-butyl at position 2. Then, add ethoxy at position 1 (ortho to t-butyl). Then, add nitro at position 3 (meta to ethoxy and ortho to t-butyl).

Wait, but how to add nitro in position 3 after ethoxy and t-butyl.

Wait, perhaps after adding ethoxy and t-butyl, the nitro is added where it's directed by both groups.

Since both ethoxy and t-butyl are activating and ortho/para directors, the nitro would go into a position that is ortho or para to both. But that's not possible because they are adjacent. So perhaps the nitro would go into position 3, which is adjacent to both.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director. So when the ring has ethoxy at 1 and t-butyl at 2, the nitro would go meta to one of them. But given their positions, the meta positions would be 4 (meta to 1) and 5 (meta to 2). So that doesn't align with the target.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should consider that the correct option is D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to nitrate first, then add ethoxy, then add t-butyl.

Wait, if I nitrate first, nitro at position 1. Then, ethoxy would be added in the para position (position 4) due to nitro being meta director. Then, t-butyl would be added in the meta position relative to nitro, which is position 3. But that's not matching the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add t-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy.

Wait, t-butyl at position 2. Nitro would go meta to t-butyl â†’ position 5. Ethoxy would go ortho to t-butyl â†’ position 1 or 3. If ethoxy is at position 1, then nitro is at 5. That's not the target.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to look for the correct option based on the steps.

The target has ethoxy, which is an activating group. To introduce an ethoxy group via substitution, perhaps we need a good leaving group, like a nitro group.

Wait, another approach: maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring needs to have a strong activating group. So perhaps the steps involve:

1. Add t-butyl (activating) â†’ step i.

2. Add nitro group (deactivating) â†’ step ii.

3. Then, add ethoxy via substitution of a nitro group.

Wait, but nitro is not a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps convert nitro to a leaving group.

Wait, maybe reduce nitro to amine, then convert amine to a good leaving group like diazonium chloride, then substitute with ethoxy.

So steps:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate â†’ nitro.

iii) reduce nitro to amine.

iv) make diazonium salt.

v) substitute with ethoxy.

But looking at the options, does any option have such a sequence?

Looking at option B: steps are i) t-butyl, ii) nitrate, iii) Fe/HCl (reduce nitro to amine), iv) nitrate again (unlikely). So not matching.

Option A: After nitration, sulfonate, etc., but doesn't directly add ethoxy.

Wait, in option A, step vii is NaOH and EtBr. That's likely introducing ethoxy via an SN2 reaction. So perhaps the leaving group is a bromide.

How would bromide be introduced? Maybe via a substitution after making a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps after nitration and sulfonation, one of the steps introduces a bromide.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate â†’ nitro.

iii) sulfonate â†’ adds SO3H.

iv) diazotization â†’ forms diazonium salt.

v) dilute H2SO4 â†’ hydrolyzes diazonium to a hydroxyl group.

vi) H3O+/H2O/heat â†’ perhaps acid workup.

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ substitutes hydroxyl with ethoxy.

So after steps i to vii, we have t-butyl, nitro, and ethoxy groups. But where?

Hmm, perhaps this is the case in option A.

Wait, in option A:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate â†’ nitro para to t-butyl.

iii) sulfonate â†’ adds SO3H at meta to t-butyl (position 6).

iv) NaNO2/HCl â†’ makes a diazonium salt from the nitro group? No, nitro is already present. Maybe from the sulfonate group? No, sulfonate is a strong -M group.

Wait, perhaps the steps in option A introduce a bromide which is then replaced by ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via an alkoxy group formation after making a leaving group.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess that option D is the correct one, but I'm not completely sure.

Wait, no, option D starts with nitration, which seems to lead to incorrect positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, no, I think I should conclude that option D is not correct because after nitration, steps lead to adding t-butyl in the wrong position.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is option D: starting with nitration, then reduction, then alkylation, etc. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: let's think about the number of substituents and their positions.

In the target, positions 1,2,3 are filled. So, in the correct sequence, each substituent must be added in a way that directs the next one into the correct position.

Perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy ortho to t-butyl.

3. Add nitro meta to ethoxy, which would be adjacent to t-butyl.

So to achieve this, the steps would be:

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl.

ii) Friedel-Crafts etherification with ethoxy. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts doesn't work for ethers. Ethers require a different method, like using a Williamson ether synthesis, which involves a good leaving group.

So, perhaps after adding t-butyl, we need to introduce a nitro group to direct the ethoxy into the correct position.

Wait, I'm getting even more confused.

Given the time I've spent, I'll make a guess that the correct answer is option D.


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. The analysis focuses on the directing effects of these groups and the sequence of their introduction.

### Key Analysis of the Target Molecule:
1. **Substituent Effects**:
   - **tert-butyl**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - **ethoxy**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - **nitro**: Deactivating, meta-directing.

2. **Substituent Positions**:
   - The substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern, meaning they are adjacent to each other on the benzene ring.

3. **Challenges**:
   - The nitro group is a strong deactivating group, making it difficult to add subsequent substituents after it is introduced.
   - The ethoxy group must be introduced in a way that avoids steric hindrance and aligns with the directing effects of the existing substituents.

### Evaluation of Options:
#### **Option A**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  2. Nitration.
  3. Sulfonation.
  4. Diazotization.
  5. Hydrolysis.
  6. Acid workup.
  7. Substitution with ethoxy.
  8. Sulfonation.
  9. Acid workup.
- **Issues**:
  - Introduces a sulfonic acid group (SOâ‚ƒH), which is not part of the target molecule.
  - The sequence does not clearly align with the desired positions of the substituents.

#### **Option B**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  2. Nitration.
  3. Reduction of nitro to amine.
  4. Nitration again.
- **Issues**:
  - Adds an additional nitro group, which is not part of the target molecule.
  - Does not account for the introduction of the ethoxy group.

#### **Option C**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  2. Sulfonation.
  3. Nitration.
  4. Reduction of nitro to amine.
  5. Diazotization.
  6. Nitration again.
- **Issues**:
  - Introduces a sulfonic acid group (SOâ‚ƒH), which is not part of the target molecule.
  - Does not clearly align with the desired positions of the substituents.

#### **Option D**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Nitration.
  2. Reduction of nitro to amine.
  3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  4. Nitration again.
- **Issues**:
  - Adds an additional nitro group, which is not part of the target molecule.
  - Does not account for the introduction of the ethoxy group.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating all options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the desired synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option D** is selected as the most plausible choice, despite its shortcomings.

Answer: D
