Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can remember.

The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out what reagent A and catalyst B are used.

First, I should probably draw the structures to visualize what's happening. So, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a six-membered ring with five carbons and one nitrogen. The methyl group is on the third carbon. The product looks like it has a cyclohexylidene group attached to the pyrrolidine ring.

Wait, cyclohexylidene methyl would be a cyclohexane ring with a double bond (the 'idene' suggests a double bond) attached to a methyl group. So the product has a substituent that's cyclohexyl connected via a double bond to a methyl which is attached to the pyrrolidine.

Hmm, thinking about reactions that form such structures. Oh, maybe it's a cyclopropane formation or some kind of ring-forming reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ene reaction or some sort of conjugate addition.

Wait, wait, I think I remember something called the Aldol reaction, but that's usually between carbonyl compounds. Another possibility is the Claisen or Cope rearrangement, but those are for specific structures.

Wait, the product structure looks like a bicyclic compound. Alternatively, considering that the starting material is a pyrrolidine and the product has a ring attached via a double bond, maybe it's an example of a ring expansion or a [2+2] cycloaddition? Or perhaps it's an enamine formation.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine has a secondary amine. If it's reacting with an aldehyde, maybe it's forming an imine or an enamine. Enamines are formed from amines and ketones or aldehydes, right? So the process involves forming a Schiff base and then eliminating water to form the enamine.

Wait, the product looks like it's a substituted pyrrolidine with a substituent that's a cyclohexylidene methyl group. So maybe it's a case where the amine is reacting with an aldehyde to form an imine, and then perhaps undergoing some cyclization.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine reacting with a carbonyl compound. Let me think. When amines react with carbonyl compounds, they can form imines if the carbonyl is an aldehyde or ketone. But wait, for imine formation, you typically have an amine and a carbonyl, and under acidic conditions, they form the imine with loss of water.

Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine. So the substituent is at position 1, which is the nitrogen-bearing carbon in pyrrolidine. So in pyrrolidine, the nitrogen is at position 1. So when they talk about 1-something-pyrrolidine, that's the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen.

Wait, no, wait. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with one nitrogen. So the positions are numbered so that the nitrogen is position 1. So in 3-methylpyrrolidine, the methyl is on position 3. So when the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine, the substituent is attached to the nitrogen.

Wait, but the product's structure is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the cyclohexylidenemethyl group is attached to the nitrogen. So the nitrogen has a substituent which is a cyclohexylidene group attached to a methyl.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution or a ring-forming reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Stork enamine reaction, which involves the reaction of enamine with an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, but the product seems to have a new ring attached. Let me think about the reagents. The options give possible A and B. Let's look at the options.

Options:
A) A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH
B) A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid
C) A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid
D) A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH

So the catalyst is either TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) or acetic acid. TsOH is a strong acid, acetic is a weaker acid.

The reagent A is either cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane.

Hmm. Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is an aldehyde with a cyclohexyl group attached.

So the reaction is acid-catalyzed. So what reactions involve an amine and either an aldehyde or an alkene under acidic conditions.

If the reagent is an aldehyde, say cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, then the reaction might be forming an imine. But imine formation typically needs an amine and a carbonyl, with acid as a catalyst. So that fits option A or B. But the product is a ring-substituted pyrrolidine.

Wait, but the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine. So the substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group on the nitrogen. Wait, cyclohexylidene methyl would have a structure like CH2 connected to a cyclohexene ring. So it's a vinyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine has the structure: a five-membered ring with N at position 1, and methyl at position 3.

In the product, the nitrogen is attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a cyclohexene ring (cyclohexylidene methyl would be CH2-Cyclohexene).

So perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the amine attacks a carbonyl, then undergoes some elimination.

Wait, if the reagent is an aldehyde, like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (which is O=CH-Cyclohexane), then the amine could react to form an imine.

But then, after imine formation, what happens? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the Hantzsch pyrrolidine synthesis, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack. The amine is a good nucleophile and could attack an aldehyde under acidic conditions.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a case of the amine undergoing a conjugate addition or some kind of Michael addition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the possible reaction types that would form a ring with a double bond. Perhaps an enamine synthesis.

Enamine synthesis involves two steps: first, forming a Schiff base (imine) between an amine and a ketone or aldehyde, then treating with a dehydrating agent to form the enamine, which can then react with an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, but in this case, the product doesn't look like an enamine. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a cyclopropanation. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of the Baylis-Hillman reaction, but that's more about alkenes and carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a [1,2]-shift or some kind of cyclization. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the product, it's 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine. So the substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group attached to the nitrogen.

Wait, if the starting amine is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and it's reacting with an aldehyde, perhaps the aldehyde is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the aldehyde would have structure O=CH-Cyclohexane.

So the amine (3-methylpyrrolidine) would react with the aldehyde to form an imine. The product would be something like a secondary amine connected to the aldehyde group. But then, perhaps under acidic conditions, this imine could cyclize further.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde becomes part of a ring. Wait, another possibility: the aldehyde group could form a ring with the amine.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about what each option entails.

Option A: A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B is TsOH.

So under strong acid (TsOH), the amine would react with the aldehyde to form an imine. But then, would that lead to the product?

Alternatively, maybe another reaction. If the aldehyde is in excess, perhaps the amine could form a Schiff base, but I'm not sure how that would form the cyclohexylidene methyl group.

Wait, the product's substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl, which is CH2 connected to a cyclohexene ring. So maybe the aldehyde is being converted into an alkene via elimination.

Wait, if the aldehyde (RCHO) reacts with the amine, perhaps forming an imine, which then loses water to form an enamine.

Wait, no, enamine formation typically requires a ketone or aldehyde and a secondary amine. The process is: amine + ketone → imine, then eliminate water to form enamine (which is a conjugated amine with a double bond).

Wait, but in this case, the product seems to have a substituent that's a cyclohexane ring connected via a double bond. So perhaps the aldehyde is used to form an enamine, and then undergoes some reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't about forming an imine but something else.

Wait, another angle: the product's substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group. That suggests that a cyclohexene ring is attached to a CH2 group, which is then attached to the amine.

So perhaps the reagent A is a cyclohexene derivative. But looking at the options, A is either cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane.

Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene, so perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction or some addition could happen.

Wait, but the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, an amine. If the reagent is vinylcyclohexane, perhaps it's an example of the Michael addition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition where the amine acts as a nucleophile attacking an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, but vinylcyclohexane is an alkene, not a carbonyl. So that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires a benzene ring, which isn't present here.

Hmm. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: A is vinylcyclohexane, B is acetic acid.

So with vinylcyclohexane, an alkene, and acetic acid as catalyst. But how would that react with an amine?

Wait, maybe the amine is acting as a base and abstracting a proton from somewhere. Or perhaps it's a hydride shift.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of the Houben-Weyl reaction or some other acid-catalyzed cyclization.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible reaction mechanisms.

If the reagent is an aldehyde (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde), then under acid conditions, the amine would form an imine. So in the first step, the amine would attack the aldehyde's carbonyl, forming a protonated iminium ion. Then, perhaps, some dehydration happens, but I'm not sure how that would lead to the product.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a condensation reaction. But I'm not clear on the exact steps.

Wait, let me think about the product structure again. It's 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. The substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group attached to the pyrrolidine's nitrogen.

If the reagent is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, reacting with the amine, perhaps the aldehyde group would end up as a substituent on the nitrogen, but how does that form the cyclohexylidene group?

Wait, maybe the aldehyde is used to form a new carbon-nitrogen bond, and then undergoes some kind of elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the aldehyde is converted into a Grignard reagent, but that's under basic conditions, and the question is about acid-catalyzed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an example of the benzoin condensation, but that's for aldehydes and ketones, and involves cyanide as a catalyst, which doesn't match here.

Wait, maybe it's a case of the amine acting as a nucleophile in an addition reaction. If the aldehyde is treated with acid, it can form an electrophilic carbonyl, which the amine could attack.

Wait, another thought: the product's substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group, which is CH2-Cyclohexene. So the aldehyde (O=CH-Cyclohexane) perhaps loses an oxygen to form this group.

Wait, but how? Maybe via a tautomerism or some elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of the formation of a ring via an imine intermediate followed by cyclization.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the other options.

Option C and D have vinylcyclohexane as reagent A. Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene, so perhaps a reaction involving that.

Wait, if the reagent is vinyl cyclohexane, and the catalyst is acetic acid, perhaps it's a case of acid-catalyzed addition of the amine to the alkene.

Wait, but amines typically don't add to alkenes under acidic conditions. Alternatively, maybe the vinylcyclohexane is acting as a dienophile or something else.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a conjugate addition. If the reagent is an enone, but vinylcyclohexane is just an alkene.

Hmm. Another angle: the product has a new ring formed. Perhaps the reaction is a ring expansion.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine has a five-membered ring. The product has a substituent that's a six-membered ring attached via a double bond. Maybe the reaction forms a bridge or a fused ring.

Wait, maybe the starting amine reacts with an aldehyde to form a bridge. Let me think: the amine attacks the aldehyde, forming a bond between the nitrogen and the aldehyde carbon. Then, the other end (the cyclohexane part) could form a ring.

Wait, that would require the aldehyde's R group (cyclohexyl) to connect to the amine in such a way that a ring forms.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the aldol reaction. But the starting material isn't a carbonyl; it's an amine.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a cross-aldol addition, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a case of the Michael addition, where the amine is the nucleophile attacking an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. But the reagent here is an aldehyde, which isn't conjugated.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is part of an enamine. Wait, no, enamine is the product of a reaction between an amine and a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Stork enamine alkylation. In that reaction, the enamine acts as a nucleophile towards an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. But in this case, the starting material is an amine and an aldehyde, so if the amine reacts with the aldehyde, they form an imine, which could then react further.

But the product is a ring with a substituent that's cyclohexylidene methyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde is first converted into an enamine with the amine, and then undergoes some reaction.

Wait, enamine formation requires a ketone or aldehyde. So 3-methylpyrrolidine (secondary amine) reacts with aldehyde to form an imine, which then eliminates water to form an enamine. The enamine would have a double bond adjacent to the nitrogen.

So, for example, if the aldehyde is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, the enamine would have a cyclohexyl group connected to a double bond adjacent to the nitrogen.

Wait, but the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine. So the substituent is a CH2 connected to cyclohexene.

Wait, maybe the enamine isn't the product but an intermediate that then reacts further.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. But that involves an aldehyde and a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible product structures.

In the product, the substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group attached to the amine. So the substituent is CH2-Cyclohexene.

If the reagent is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (O=CH-Cyclohexane), then perhaps under acidic conditions, the aldehyde group is converted into a CH2 group attached to the amine, and the cyclohexane becomes a cyclohexene.

Wait, how would that happen? Maybe via the formation of an imine, followed by deprotonation and elimination, forming a double bond.

So the reaction could be:

3-methylpyrrolidine (amine) + cyclohexanecarbaldehyde → imine intermediate → elimination to form enamine with CH2-Cyclohexene substituent.

Wait, but the product in the question is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine, which is the same as having a CH2-Cyclohexene substituent attached to the nitrogen.

So if the amine reacts with an aldehyde to form an imine, which then loses water to form an enamine (with a double bond), that would fit.

But wait, in the product, the substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group, so the enamine would have a double bond between the nitrogen and the CH2 group, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is used to form a ring. Wait, if the amine has five members, adding an aldehyde substituent could form a larger ring.

Hmm, it's getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think about each option.

Option A: A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B is TsOH.

So, under strong acid (TsOH), the amine reacts with the aldehyde to form an imine. Then perhaps, further reaction occurs.

Wait, but for imine formation, you typically have an amine and a carbonyl. The product would be an imine, which is a compound with the structure R2C=NR'. But in this case, the product is a substituted pyrrolidine with a cyclohexylidene methyl group attached to the nitrogen. So perhaps the aldehyde provides the R group (cyclohexyl) and the imine forms, but then some rearrangement happens.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is involved in a [2+4] cycloaddition, but I don't think that's happening here.

Option C: A is vinylcyclohexane, B is acetic acid.

Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene. Under acidic conditions, could the amine perform an addition? I know that in some cases, amines can add to alkenes in acid to form N-alkylated products, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a hydroamination. But hydroamination typically uses amines and alkenes to form imine derivatives. But I'm not sure if that would form the product in question.

Alternatively, if the amine adds to the double bond of vinylcyclohexane, perhaps in a conjugate addition, but I can't picture that leading to the product.

Wait, maybe it's a case of the amine acting as a base, abstracting a proton from vinylcyclohexane to form a carbocation, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Diels-Alder between the diene and the dienophile. But vinylcyclohexane is just an alkene, not a dienophile.

Wait, the starting material is a pyrrolidine, so maybe it's a five-membered ring acting as a diene. But I don't think that's the case here.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the possible product.

The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine. So the nitrogen in pyrrolidine has a substituent that's a cyclohexylidene methyl group. That substituent is CH2 connected to a cyclohexene ring.

So perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition where the amine attacks a carbonyl group, leading to the formation of a new carbon-nitrogen bond, and then the aldehyde is converted into a double bond.

Wait, another approach: considering the catalysts.

Option A and D use TsOH, which is a strong acid. Option B and C use acetic acid, a weaker acid.

If the reaction involves forming an enamine, which requires elimination, a strong acid might be necessary for that. So perhaps the correct option has TsOH as catalyst.

Looking back at the options, options A and D have TsOH.

So, A: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH.

D: A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH.

Wait, but what reaction would require a strong acid?

Enamine formation usually requires a strong acid, like H2SO4 or TsOH, to protonate the carbonyl, facilitate the attack, and then eliminate water to form the enamine.

So if the reaction is forming an enamine, then the reagent must be a carbonyl (either aldehyde or ketone). Looking at the options, options A and B have cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is an aldehyde.

So if the reaction is forming an enamine, then the correct options would be A or B.

But wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine. So the substituent is a CH2 connected to a cyclohexene ring.

Wait, when an enamine is formed from an aldehyde, the structure would have a CH2 group attached to the amine. For example, if cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (RCHO) reacts with pyrrolidine (N), the enamine would be R-CH2-NR' (but with a double bond between the N and CH2).

Wait, but in the product, the substituent is CH2-Cyclohexene. So the R group from the aldehyde is cyclohexyl, and after forming the enamine, the structure would have a CH2-Cyclohexene connected to the N.

Hmm, perhaps the enamine formation is the key here.

So, the steps would be:

1. Formation of imine: 3-methylpyrrolidine reacts with cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form an imine (protonated under TsOH).

2. Elimination of water to form an enamine, which would have a double bond adjacent to the N. The structure would be CH2-Cyclohexene attached to the N.

So, the product would be 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine, which matches the given product.

That makes sense. So the correct reagent A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the catalyst is TsOH (strong acid).

So the correct option would be A: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH.

Wait, but wait. Enamine formation typically requires a ketone or aldehyde and a secondary amine. The general process is:

R2R'N + R"CO → R2R'N=CR" + H2O (imine), then dehydration to form R2R'N-CR"=CH2.

Wait, but in our case, the aldehyde is RCHO, and the product substituent is CH2-Cyclohexene. So perhaps the aldehyde's R is cyclohexyl, and after imine and dehydration, the substituent becomes CH2-Cyclohexene.

Wait, no. The aldehyde is RCHO, so R is cyclohexyl. The imine would be RCH=N-R', then dehydration to form RCH=NR', but that's not an enamine. Or wait, perhaps the enamine has the structure RCH2-NR', with a double bond between N and CH2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between imine and enamine structures.

An enamine is a compound with the structure R2N-CR2=CR2, where the nitrogen is connected to two R groups and a carbon-carbon double bond.

So, when a secondary amine reacts with a carbonyl, it forms a Schiff base (imine), which can then lose a proton and water to form an enamine.

So, if 3-methylpyrrolidine (secondary amine) reacts with cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, the steps would be:

1. Amine attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a protonated imine.

2. Water is lost, forming an enamine with a double bond adjacent to the nitrogen.

The structure would be CH2-Cyclohexene attached to the nitrogen.

So the product would be 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine, which is exactly the product given. So the reagent must be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and the catalyst must be a strong acid like TsOH.

Looking back at the options, that's option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves 3-methylpyrrolidine reacting with a reagent (A) under acidic catalysis (B) to form 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. The product has a cyclohexylidene methyl group (CH2-Cyclohexene) attached to the nitrogen of the pyrrolidine ring. This suggests a reaction mechanism involving the formation of an enamine, which typically requires a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound under strong acidic conditions.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH**  
   Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is an aldehyde with a cyclohexyl group. Under strong acid conditions (TsOH), the amine in 3-methylpyrrolidine can react with the aldehyde to form an imine intermediate. Subsequent dehydration of the imine forms an enamine, resulting in the product 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. This matches the expected reaction mechanism.

2. **Option B: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid**  
   While cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is a suitable reagent, acetic acid is a weaker acid compared to TsOH. Enamine formation typically requires a strong acid to facilitate the dehydration step. Thus, this option is less likely to yield the desired product efficiently.

3. **Option C: A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid**  
   Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene and does not contain a carbonyl group, which is necessary for enamine formation. Additionally, acetic acid is not strong enough to facilitate the required reaction steps. This option does not align with the product structure.

4. **Option D: A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH**  
   Similar to Option C, vinylcyclohexane lacks a carbonyl group, making it unsuitable for enamine formation. Even though TsOH is a strong acid, the absence of a carbonyl group in the reagent rules out this option.

### Conclusion:
The reaction proceeds via enamine formation, requiring a carbonyl compound (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) and a strong acid catalyst (TsOH). This makes **Option A** the correct choice.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can remember.

The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out what reagent A and catalyst B are used.

First, I should probably draw the structures to visualize what's happening. So, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a six-membered ring with five carbons and one nitrogen. The methyl group is on the third carbon. The product looks like it has a cyclohexylidene group attached to the pyrrolidine ring.

Hmm, thinking about reactions that form such structures. Oh, maybe it's a cyclopropane formation or some kind of ring-forming reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ene reaction or some sort of conjugate addition.

Wait, wait, I think I remember something called the Aldol reaction, but that's usually between carbonyl compounds. Another possibility is the Claisen or Cope rearrangement, but those are for specific structures.

Wait, the product structure looks like a bicyclic compound. Alternatively, considering that the starting material is a pyrrolidine and the product has a ring attached via a double bond, maybe it's an example of a ring expansion or a [2+2] cycloaddition? Or perhaps it's an enamine formation.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine has a secondary amine. If it's reacting with an aldehyde, maybe it's forming an imine or an enamine. Enamines are formed from amines and ketones or aldehydes, right? So the process involves forming a Schiff base and then eliminating water to form the enamine.

Wait, the product looks like it's a substituted pyrrolidine with a substituent that's a cyclohexylidene methyl group. So maybe it's a case where the amine is reacting with an aldehyde to form an imine, and then perhaps undergoing some cyclization.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine reacting with a carbonyl compound. Let me think. When amines react with carbonyl compounds, they can form imines if the carbonyl is an aldehyde or ketone. But wait, for imine formation, you typically have an amine and a carbonyl, and under acidic conditions, they form the imine with loss of water.

Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine. So the substituent is at position 1, which is the nitrogen-bearing carbon in pyrrolidine. So in pyrrolidine, the nitrogen is at position 1. So when they talk about 1-something-pyrrolidine, that's the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen.

Wait, no, wait. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with one nitrogen. So the positions are numbered so that the nitrogen is position 1. So in 3-methylpyrrolidine, the methyl is on position 3. So when the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine, the substituent is attached to the nitrogen.

Wait, but the product's structure is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the cyclohexylidenemethyl group is attached to the nitrogen. So the nitrogen has a substituent which is a cyclohexylidene group attached to a methyl.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution or a ring-forming reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Stork enamine reaction, which involves the reaction of enamine with an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, but the product seems to have a new ring attached. Let me think about the reagents. The options give possible A and B. Let's look at the options.

Options:
A) A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH
B) A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid
C) A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid
D) A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH

So the catalyst is either TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) or acetic acid. TsOH is a strong acid, acetic is a weaker acid.

The reagent A is either cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane.

Hmm. Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is an aldehyde with a cyclohexyl group attached.

So the reaction is acid-catalyzed. So what reactions involve an amine and either an aldehyde or an alkene under acidic conditions.

If the reagent is an aldehyde, say cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, then the reaction might be forming an imine. But imine formation typically needs an amine and a carbonyl, with acid as a catalyst. So that fits option A or B. But the product is a ring-substituted pyrrolidine.

Wait, but the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine. So the substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group on the nitrogen. Wait, cyclohexylidene methyl would have a structure like CH2 connected to a cyclohexene ring. So it's a vinyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine has the structure: a five-membered ring with N at position 1, and methyl at position 3.

In the product, the nitrogen is attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a cyclohexene ring (cyclohexylidene methyl would be CH2-Cyclohexene).

So perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the amine attacks a carbonyl, then undergoes some elimination.

Wait, if the reagent is an aldehyde, like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (which is O=CH-Cyclohexane), then the amine could react to form an imine.

But then, after imine formation, what happens? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the Hantzsch pyrrolidine synthesis, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack. The amine is a good nucleophile and could attack an aldehyde under acidic conditions.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a case of the amine undergoing a conjugate addition or some kind of Michael addition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the possible reaction types that would form a ring with a double bond. Perhaps an enamine synthesis.

Enamine synthesis involves two steps: first, forming a Schiff base (imine) between an amine and a ketone or aldehyde, then treating with a dehydrating agent to form the enamine, which can then react with an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, but in this case, the product doesn't look like an enamine. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a cyclopropanation. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of the Baylis-Hillman reaction, but that's more about alkenes and carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a [1,2]-shift or some kind of cyclization. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the product, it's 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine. So the substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group attached to the nitrogen.

Wait, if the starting amine is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and it's reacting with an aldehyde, perhaps the aldehyde is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the aldehyde would have structure O=CH-Cyclohexane.

So the amine (3-methylpyrrolidine) would react with the aldehyde to form an imine. The product would be something like a secondary amine connected to the aldehyde group. But then, perhaps under acidic conditions, this imine could cyclize further.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde becomes part of a ring. Wait, another possibility: the aldehyde group could form a ring with the amine.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about what each option entails.

Option A: A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B is TsOH.

So under strong acid (TsOH), the amine would react with the aldehyde to form an imine. But then, would that lead to the product?

Alternatively, maybe another reaction. If the aldehyde is in excess, perhaps the amine could form a Schiff base, but I'm not sure how that would form the cyclohexylidene methyl group.

Wait, the product's substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl, which is CH2 connected to a cyclohexene ring. So maybe the aldehyde is being converted into an alkene via elimination.

Wait, if the aldehyde (RCHO) reacts with the amine, perhaps forming an imine, which then loses water to form an enamine.

Wait, no, enamine formation typically requires a ketone or aldehyde and a secondary amine. The process is: amine + ketone → imine, then eliminate water to form enamine (which is a conjugated amine with a double bond).

Wait, but in this case, the product seems to have a substituent that's a cyclohexane ring connected via a double bond. So perhaps the aldehyde is used to form an enamine, and then undergoes some reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't about forming an imine but something else.

Wait, another angle: the product's substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group. That suggests that a cyclohexene ring is attached to a CH2 group, which is then attached to the amine.

So perhaps the reagent A is a cyclohexene derivative. But looking at the options, A is either cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane.

Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene, so perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction or some addition could happen.

Wait, but the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, an amine. If the reagent is vinylcyclohexane, perhaps it's an example of the Michael addition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition where the amine acts as a nucleophile attacking an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, but vinylcyclohexane is an alkene, not a carbonyl. So that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires a benzene ring, which isn't present here.

Hmm. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: A is vinylcyclohexane, B is acetic acid.

So with vinylcyclohexane, an alkene, and acetic acid as catalyst. But how would that react with an amine?

Wait, maybe the amine is acting as a base and abstracting a proton from somewhere. Or perhaps it's a hydride shift.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of the Houben-Weyl reaction or some other acid-catalyzed cyclization.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible reaction mechanisms.

If the reagent is an aldehyde (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde), then under acid conditions, the amine would form an imine. So in the first step, the amine would attack the aldehyde's carbonyl, forming a protonated iminium ion. Then, perhaps, some dehydration happens, but I'm not sure how that would lead to the product.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a condensation reaction. But I'm not clear on the exact steps.

Wait, let me think about the product structure again. It's 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. The substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group attached to the pyrrolidine's nitrogen.

If the reagent is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, reacting with the amine, perhaps the aldehyde group would end up as a substituent on the nitrogen, but how does that form the cyclohexylidene group?

Wait, maybe the aldehyde is used to form a new carbon-nitrogen bond, and then undergoes some kind of elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the aldehyde is converted into a Grignard reagent, but that's under basic conditions, and the question is about acid-catalyzed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an example of the benzoin condensation, but that's for aldehydes and ketones, and involves cyanide as a catalyst, which doesn't match here.

Wait, maybe it's a case of the amine acting as a nucleophile in an addition reaction. If the aldehyde is treated with acid, it can form an electrophilic carbonyl, which the amine could attack.

Wait, another thought: the product's substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group, which is CH2-Cyclohexene. So the aldehyde (O=CH-Cyclohexane) perhaps loses an oxygen to form this group.

Wait, but how? Maybe via a tautomerism or some elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of the formation of a ring via an imine intermediate followed by cyclization.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the other options.

Option C and D have vinylcyclohexane as reagent A. Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene, so perhaps a reaction involving that.

Wait, if the reagent is vinyl cyclohexane, and the catalyst is acetic acid, perhaps it's a case of acid-catalyzed addition of the amine to the alkene.

Wait, but amines typically don't add to alkenes under acidic conditions. Alternatively, maybe the vinylcyclohexane is acting as a dienophile or something else.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a conjugate addition. If the reagent is an enone, but vinylcyclohexane is just an alkene.

Hmm. Another angle: the product has a new ring formed. Perhaps the reaction is a ring expansion.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine has a five-membered ring. The product has a substituent that's a six-membered ring attached via a double bond. Maybe the reaction forms a bridge or a fused ring.

Wait, maybe the starting amine reacts with an aldehyde to form a bridge. Let me think: the amine attacks the aldehyde, forming a bond between the nitrogen and the aldehyde carbon. Then, the other end (the cyclohexane part) could form a ring.

Wait, that would require the aldehyde's R group (cyclohexyl) to connect to the amine in such a way that a ring forms.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the aldol reaction. But the starting material isn't a carbonyl; it's an amine.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a cross-aldol addition, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a case of the Michael addition, where the amine is the nucleophile attacking an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. But the reagent here is an aldehyde, which isn't conjugated.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is part of an enamine. Wait, no, enamine is the product of a reaction between an amine and a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Stork enamine alkylation. In that reaction, the enamine acts as a nucleophile towards an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. But in this case, the starting material is an amine and an aldehyde, so if the amine reacts with the aldehyde, they form an imine, which could then react further.

But the product is a ring with a substituent that's cyclohexylidene methyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde is first converted into an enamine with the amine, and then undergoes some reaction.

Wait, enamine formation requires a ketone or aldehyde. So 3-methylpyrrolidine (secondary amine) reacts with aldehyde to form an imine, which then eliminates water to form an enamine. The enamine would have a double bond adjacent to the nitrogen.

So, for example, if the aldehyde is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, the enamine would have a cyclohexyl group connected to a double bond adjacent to the nitrogen.

Wait, but the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine. So the substituent is a CH2 connected to cyclohexene.

Wait, maybe the enamine isn't the product but an intermediate that then reacts further.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. But that involves an aldehyde and a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible product structures.

In the product, the substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group attached to the amine. So the substituent is CH2-Cyclohexene.

If the reagent is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (O=CH-Cyclohexane), then perhaps under acidic conditions, the aldehyde group is converted into a CH2 group attached to the amine, and the cyclohexane becomes a cyclohexene.

Wait, how would that happen? Maybe via the formation of an imine, followed by deprotonation and elimination, forming a double bond.

So the reaction could be:

3-methylpyrrolidine (amine) + cyclohexanecarbaldehyde → imine intermediate → elimination to form enamine with CH2-Cyclohexene substituent.

Wait, but the product in the question is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine, which is the same as having a CH2-Cyclohexene substituent attached to the nitrogen.

So if the amine reacts with an aldehyde to form an imine, which then loses water to form an enamine (with a double bond), that would fit.

But wait, in the product, the substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group, so the enamine would have a double bond between the nitrogen and the CH2 group, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is used to form a ring. Wait, if the amine has five members, adding an aldehyde substituent could form a larger ring.

Hmm, it's getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think about each option.

Option A: A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B is TsOH.

So, under strong acid (TsOH), the amine reacts with the aldehyde to form an imine. Then perhaps, further reaction occurs.

Wait, but for imine formation, you typically have an amine and a carbonyl. The product would be an imine, which is a compound with the structure R2C=NR'. But in this case, the product is a substituted pyrrolidine with a cyclohexylidene methyl group attached to the nitrogen. So perhaps the aldehyde provides the R group (cyclohexyl) and the imine forms, but then some rearrangement happens.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is involved in a [2+4] cycloaddition, but I don't think that's happening here.

Option C: A is vinylcyclohexane, B is acetic acid.

Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene. Under acidic conditions, could the amine perform an addition? I know that in some cases, amines can add to alkenes in acid to form N-alkylated products, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a hydroamination. But hydroamination typically uses amines and alkenes to form imine derivatives. But I'm not sure if that would form the product in question.

Alternatively, if the amine adds to the double bond of vinylcyclohexane, perhaps in a conjugate addition, but I can't picture that leading to the product.

Wait, maybe it's a case of the amine acting as a base, abstracting a proton from vinylcyclohexane to form a carbocation, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Diels-Alder between the diene and the dienophile. But vinylcyclohexane is just an alkene, not a dienophile.

Wait, the starting material is a pyrrolidine, so maybe it's a five-membered ring acting as a diene. But I don't think that's the case here.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the possible product.

The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine. So the nitrogen in pyrrolidine has a substituent that's a cyclohexylidene methyl group. That substituent is CH2 connected to a cyclohexene ring.

So perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition where the amine attacks a carbonyl group, leading to the formation of a new carbon-nitrogen bond, and then the aldehyde is converted into a double bond.

Wait, another approach: considering the catalysts.

Option A and D use TsOH, which is a strong acid. Option B and C use acetic acid, a weaker acid.

If the reaction involves forming an enamine, which requires elimination, a strong acid might be necessary for that. So perhaps the correct option has TsOH as catalyst.

Looking back at the options, options A and D have TsOH.

So, A: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH.

D: A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH.

Wait, but what reaction would require a strong acid?

Enamine formation usually requires a strong acid, like H2SO4 or TsOH, to protonate the carbonyl, facilitate the attack, and then eliminate water to form the enamine.

So if the reaction is forming an enamine, then the reagent must be a carbonyl (either aldehyde or ketone). Looking at the options, options A and B have cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is an aldehyde.

So if the reaction is forming an enamine, then the correct options would be A or B.

But wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine. So the substituent is a CH2 connected to a cyclohexene ring.

Wait, when an enamine is formed from an aldehyde, the structure would have a CH2 group attached to the amine. For example, if cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (RCHO) reacts with pyrrolidine (N), the enamine would be R-CH2-NR' (but with a double bond between the N and CH2).

Wait, but in the product, the substituent is CH2-Cyclohexene. So the R group from the aldehyde is cyclohexyl, and after forming the enamine, the structure would have a CH2-Cyclohexene connected to the N.

Hmm, perhaps the enamine formation is the key here.

So, the steps would be:

1. Formation of imine: 3-methylpyrrolidine reacts with cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form an imine (protonated under TsOH).

2. Elimination of water to form an enamine, which would have a double bond adjacent to the N. The structure would be CH2-Cyclohexene attached to the N.

So, the product would be 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine, which matches the given product.

That makes sense. So the correct reagent A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the catalyst is TsOH (strong acid).

So the correct option would be A: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH.

Wait, but wait. Enamine formation typically requires a ketone or aldehyde and a secondary amine. The general process is:

R2R'N + R"CO → R2R'N=CR" + H2O (imine), then dehydration to form R2R'N-CR"=CH2.

Wait, but in our case, the aldehyde is RCHO, and the product substituent is CH2-Cyclohexene. So perhaps the aldehyde's R is cyclohexyl, and after imine and dehydration, the substituent becomes CH2-Cyclohexene.

Wait, no. The aldehyde is RCHO, so R is cyclohexyl. The imine would be RCH=N-R', then dehydration to form RCH=NR', but that's not an enamine. Or wait, perhaps the enamine has the structure RCH2-NR', with a double bond between N and CH2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between imine and enamine structures.

An enamine is a compound with the structure R2N-CR2=CR2, where the nitrogen is connected to two R groups and a carbon-carbon double bond.

So, when a secondary amine reacts with a carbonyl, it forms a Schiff base (imine), which can then lose a proton and water to form an enamine.

So, if 3-methylpyrrolidine (secondary amine) reacts with cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, the steps would be:

1. Amine attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a protonated imine.

2. Water is lost, forming an enamine with a double bond adjacent to the nitrogen.

The structure would be CH2-Cyclohexene attached to the nitrogen.

So the product would be 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine, which is exactly the product given. So the reagent must be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and the catalyst must be a strong acid like TsOH.

Looking back at the options, that's option A.


The reaction involves 3-methylpyrrolidine reacting with a reagent (A) under acidic catalysis (B) to form 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. The product has a cyclohexylidene methyl group (CH2-Cyclohexene) attached to the nitrogen of the pyrrolidine ring. This suggests a reaction mechanism involving the formation of an enamine, which typically requires a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound under strong acidic conditions.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH**  
   Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is an aldehyde with a cyclohexyl group. Under strong acid conditions (TsOH), the amine in 3-methylpyrrolidine can react with the aldehyde to form an imine intermediate. Subsequent dehydration of the imine forms an enamine, resulting in the product 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. This matches the expected reaction mechanism.

2. **Option B: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid**  
   While cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is a suitable reagent, acetic acid is a weaker acid compared to TsOH. Enamine formation typically requires a strong acid to facilitate the dehydration step. Thus, this option is less likely to yield the desired product efficiently.

3. **Option C: A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid**  
   Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene and does not contain a carbonyl group, which is necessary for enamine formation. Additionally, acetic acid is not strong enough to facilitate the required reaction steps. This option does not align with the product structure.

4. **Option D: A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH**  
   Similar to Option C, vinylcyclohexane lacks a carbonyl group, making it unsuitable for enamine formation. Even though TsOH is a strong acid, the absence of a carbonyl group in the reagent rules out this option.

### Conclusion:
The reaction proceeds via enamine formation, requiring a carbonyl compound (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) and a strong acid catalyst (TsOH). This makes **Option A** the correct choice.
