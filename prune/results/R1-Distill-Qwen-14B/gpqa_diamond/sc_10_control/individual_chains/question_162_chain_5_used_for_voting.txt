Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I remember that pseudospheres are related to hyperbolic geometry, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I think the first thing I should do is recognize what kind of geometry this metric represents. The general form of a metric in two dimensions is ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²). So here, g(x,y) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

Wait, I remember that metrics can describe different geometries depending on their form. For example, the Euclidean metric is just (dx² + dy²), but when you have a scaling factor like this, it changes the geometry. In this case, the scaling factor is 32 divided by (4 - x² - y²). 

I think that the denominator (4 - x² - y²) makes me think of a sphere or something. Because when you have 4 - x² - y², that would be similar to the equation of a circle of radius 2, since x² + y² = 4. But wait, in the metric, it's (4 - x² - y²) in the denominator. So the scaling factor is positive when 4 - x² - y² is positive, which would be inside the circle. But what happens when x² + y² approaches 4? The denominator approaches zero, so the scaling factor blows up. So maybe this is a model of hyperbolic geometry, perhaps the Poincaré disk model?

Wait, the Poincaré disk model has a metric where the scaling factor is 4/(1 - x² - y²)^2. Hmm, but wait, our scaling factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me see: 32 is 8 times 4. Alternatively, maybe it's better to write it as 8*(4)/(4 - x² - y²). Wait, 32/(4 - x² - y²) can be written as 8*(4)/(4 - x² - y²). Wait, 4/(4 - x² - y²) would be if the denominator were (4 - (x² + y²)), but that's the same as in the metric. So maybe the scaling factor is 8 times (4)/(4 - x² - y²). Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the metric in terms of a conformal metric. Because this is a conformal metric, meaning it's a multiple of the Euclidean metric. Conformal metrics are often used in models of hyperbolic space, like the Poincaré disk. 

In the Poincaré disk model, the metric is usually written as ds² = (4/(1 - (x² + y²))²) (dx² + dy²), but wait, no, I think the metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing it up with the Beltrami-Klein model. Alternatively, the Poincaré disk metric is ds² = (4/(1 - (x² + y²))²) (dx² + dy²). So in that case, the scaling factor is 4/(1 - r²)^2, where r² = x² + y². 

But in our given problem, the scaling factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me factor out the 4 from the denominator: 32/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)) = (32/4) * [1/(1 - (x² + y²)/4)] = 8 * [1/(1 - (x² + y²)/4)]. So the scaling factor is 8 * [1/(1 - (r²/4))], where r² = x² + y². 

Hmm, that looks similar to the Poincaré metric, but scaled. The standard Poincaré disk has a scaling factor of 4/(1 - r²)^2, but here we have a scaling factor of 8/(1 - (r²/4)). Wait, not exactly the same. Maybe this is a scaled version of the Poincaré disk. Like, perhaps it's a model with radius 2 instead of radius 1. 

Wait, because in the standard Poincaré disk, the curvature is -1, which corresponds to a hyperbolic plane with radius (or 'curvature radius') 1. The general form for a Poincaré disk with curvature k is ds² = (4/k)/(1 - (k r²))² (dr² + r² dθ²). So when k = -1, it's 4/(1 - r²)^2. Hmm, but in our problem, the metric is 32/(4 - r²) times (dx² + dy²), where r² is x² + y². So 32/(4 - r²) = 8*(4/(4 - r²)) = 8/(1 - (r²/4)). 

So if I think of it as (8/(1 - (r²/4))), maybe that's similar to a Poincaré model with a curvature parameter. Let me see: the general form of the Poincaré metric is (4/(1 - (r²/R²))²) (dr² + r² dθ²), where R is the radius of the pseudosphere. Wait, I'm not entirely sure about that, but perhaps the denominator here is (4 - r²) = 4(1 - r²/4). So it's similar to the standard Poincaré model scaled by a factor of 2.

Wait, for the standard Poincaré disk with R=1, the denominator would be (1 - r²), while here it's (4 - r²) which is (4)(1 - r²/4). So perhaps this metric is equivalent to the Poincaré disk model with R=2, since 4 is 2 squared.

Wait, but the scaling factor in the metric is 32/(4 - r²) = 8/(1 - r²/4). So maybe this is a version of the Poincaré metric with R=2, because 1 - (r²/4) would imply that R is 2. So the presence of 4 in the denominator suggests that the radius is 2.

So the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, wait, the question says "pseudosphere of radius r=2". But in hyperbolic geometry, the concept of a sphere is a bit different. The area of a pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant negative curvature) with a given radius might involve a specific formula.

Wait, no, I think the term 'pseudosphere' here refers to the hyperbolic plane itself. Or perhaps it's referring to a surface embedded in Euclidean space, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the area being asked is the area of a specific region in the hyperbolic plane modeled by this metric.

Wait, the question says, "what is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?" Hmm, I'm not entirely certain, but I think in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle (which would be the analog of a sphere) of radius r is given by 2π times (cosh(r) - 1), but wait, that's when the curvature is -1. Alternatively, for a hyperbolic plane with curvature k=-1, the area of a circle of radius r is 2π (cosh(r) - 1).

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the area element in this metric. The area element is derived from the metric. For a 2D metric ds² = g(r) (dr² + r² dθ²), the area element would be sqrt(g(r)) * r dr dθ. But wait, in our case, the metric is conformally flat, so it's (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). So in polar coordinates, where x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

So the area element dA would be sqrt( [32/(4 - r²)]^2 * r² ) dr dθ. Wait, no, wait. The area element in 2D is sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}) ) dr dθ, but only when the metric is diagonal. Since our metric is diagonal with g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²) and g_{θθ} = [32/(4 - r²)] r². So the area element is sqrt( (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) dr dθ. Wait, that would be sqrt( (32^2 r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ) dr dθ. Simplifying that, it's (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Wait, but that's the area element. So the total area would be the integral over all space. But wait, in this metric, the domain is where 4 - r² > 0, which is when r² < 4, so r < 2. Because if r² >=4, the denominator becomes zero or negative, and the metric would be undefined or have imaginary components. So the space we're considering is the disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane, right? Because inside r=2, it's a valid metric.

So the area would be the integral of dA over the entire disk. So integrating r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π. The area A would be the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2 of (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Let me compute that. Let's first compute the integral over r. Let's make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r => -du/2 = r dr. So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral for r becomes ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2. Let me factor 32 out: 32 ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Substituting u=4 - r²: r dr = (-du/2). So the integral becomes 32 ∫ (1/u) * (-du/2) from u=4 to u=0.

Which is 32*(-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0. The integral of 1/u is ln(u), so:

32*(-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = 32*(-1/2) [ (ln 0) is negative infinity, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution limits. Let's re-express it. 

Wait, when r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0. So the substitution would change the integral's limits from u=4 to u=0. But the integral is ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2. Let me write this as ∫ [r/(u)] dr, but with u = 4 - r². So dr = du/( -2r ), because du = -2r dr => dr = - du/(2r).

So substituting, the integral becomes ∫ (r / u) * (- du/(2r)) ) = ∫ (-1/(2 u)) du. The r cancels out.

So the integral becomes (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-1/2) [ln(u)] from 4 to 0. Evaluating, it's (-1/2) ( ln(0) - ln(4) ). 

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this becomes (-1/2) ( -infty - ln4 ), which would be positive infinity. So the integral diverges. Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, but that suggests that the area is infinite. But wait, the area of the hyperbolic plane is infinite, so perhaps the question is a bit of a trick.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the question is asking for. Because the entire hyperbolic plane under this metric has an infinite area, but maybe the question refers to the area of a specific region, like a disk of radius 2 in this model.

Wait, no, in the Poincaré disk model, the entire hyperbolic plane is represented within the disk of radius R (in the model space, which here is R=2). So the area of the entire hyperbolic plane would indeed be infinite, but I'm not sure if the question is referring to that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the area of a specific circle, not the entire plane. Wait, the term 'pseudosphere' might be a bit confusing. A pseudosphere is a surface in Euclidean space with constant negative curvature, but in this context, perhaps it's referring to the hyperbolic plane itself.

Wait, but the options include 4π(x² + y²), 4π(x² - y²), 0, and +infinity. Wait, looking back at the options, option D is +infinity. So if the area of the entire space under this metric is infinite, then the answer would be D.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The metric given is for the hyperbolic plane in the Poincaré disk model, scaled to have a radius of 2. The area of the entire hyperbolic plane is infinite, so the total area under this metric would be infinite. Hence, the answer would be D) +infty.

Wait, but the question says, "the pseudosphere of radius r=2." Hmm, perhaps the pseudosphere refers to the surface, but in hyperbolic geometry, a pseudosphere of radius r would have a certain area. But I might not have the exact formula in mind.

Wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle (which is the analog of a sphere) of radius r is A = 2π (cosh(r) − 1). For r=2, that would be 2π (cosh(2) - 1). But cosh(2) is (e^2 + e^(-2))/2 ≈ (7.389 + 0.135)/2 ≈ 3.762. So 3.762 - 1 = 2.762, multiplied by 2π gives approx 17.36. But that's a finite value. However, looking at the options, I don't see any option that matches this. The options are either expressions in x and y, zero, or infinity. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe the question is about the area of the entire space, not a specific circle. Because the options include D) +infty, which would make sense if the area is divergent. But let me think again about the area integral.

Earlier, when I computed the area element, I got (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ. The integral over the entire disk would be from r=0 to r=2, and θ=0 to θ=2π.

So the area A is the integral from θ=0 to 2π of ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from r=0 to 2.

The θ integral contributes a factor of 2π, so A = 2π * ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute the integral ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me substitute u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (32 r)/(u) dr → 32 ∫ (r)/(u) dr → 32 ∫ (r dr )/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ (-du/2)/u.

So that becomes 32*(-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this becomes (-16) ( -infty - ln4 ) → which is positive infinity. So the integral diverges, which means the area is infinite.

So the area of the entire space under this metric is infinite. Therefore, the answer would be D) +infty.

Wait, but the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2." Hmm, maybe pseudosphere refers to a different concept here. Alternatively, perhaps the area is being considered for a specific circle (like the boundary at r=2), but that would just be a circumference, not an area. Alternatively, perhaps it's the area of a sphere in this metric, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more straightforward. The metric given is a 2D metric, so the area would be for a 2D surface. Since the hyperbolic plane is unbounded, its area is infinite. So the answer is D) +infty.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a conformal metric, where the scaling factor is \( g(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The metric resembles the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, which typically has the form:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{4}{(1 - r^2)^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right),
\]

where \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \). In this case, the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) suggests a scaling by a factor of 4, indicating that the model represents a hyperbolic plane with a radius of 2. The metric is valid only within the disk \( r < 2 \), where \( 4 - r^2 > 0 \).

To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we calculate the total area under this metric by integrating the area element. In polar coordinates, the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta}} \, dr \, d\theta = \sqrt{\frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2}} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \) can be evaluated using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \). This gives:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-1}{2u} \, du = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[\ln u\right]_4^0.
\]

Here, \( \ln u \) diverges as \( u \to 0 \), leading to an infinite result. Thus, the total area under the metric is infinite. This reflects the fact that the hyperbolic plane, represented by this metric, is unbounded and has infinite area.

Given the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.  
**B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid expression for the area.  
**C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid expression for the area.  
**D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the total area under the metric is infinite.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I remember that pseudospheres are related to hyperbolic geometry, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to think this through step by step.

I think that the denominator (4 - x² - y²) makes me think of a sphere or something. Because when you have 4 - x² - y², that would be similar to the equation of a circle of radius 2, since x² + y² = 4. But wait, in the metric, it's (4 - x² - y²) in the denominator. So the scaling factor is positive when 4 - x² - y² is positive, which would be inside the circle. But what happens when x² + y² approaches 4? The denominator approaches zero, so the scaling factor blows up. So maybe this is a model of hyperbolic geometry, perhaps the Poincaré disk model?

Wait, the Poincaré disk model has a metric where the scaling factor is 4/(1 - x² - y²)^2. Hmm, but wait, our scaling factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me see: 32 is 8 times 4. Alternatively, maybe it's better to write it as 8*(4)/(4 - x² - y²). Wait, 32/(4 - x² - y²) can be written as 8*(4)/(4 - x² - y²). Wait, 4/(4 - x² - y²) would be if the denominator were (4 - (x² + y²)), but that's the same as in the metric. So maybe the scaling factor is 8 times (4)/(4 - x² - y²). Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the metric in terms of a conformal metric. Because this is a conformal metric, meaning it's a multiple of the Euclidean metric. Conformal metrics are often used in models of hyperbolic space, like the Poincaré disk. 

In the Poincaré disk model, the metric is usually written as ds² = (4/(1 - (x² + y²))²) (dx² + dy²), but wait, no, I think the metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing it up with the Beltrami-Klein model. Alternatively, the Poincaré disk metric is ds² = (4/(1 - (x² + y²))²) (dx² + dy²). So in that case, the scaling factor is 4/(1 - r²)^2, where r² = x² + y². 

But in our given problem, the scaling factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me factor out the 4 from the denominator: 32/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)) = (32/4) * [1/(1 - (x² + y²)/4)] = 8 * [1/(1 - (x² + y²)/4)]. So the scaling factor is 8 * [1/(1 - (r²/4))], where r² = x² + y². 

Hmm, that looks similar to the Poincaré metric, but scaled. The standard Poincaré disk has a scaling factor of 4/(1 - r²)^2, but here we have a scaling factor of 8/(1 - (r²/4)). Wait, not exactly the same. Maybe this is a scaled version of the Poincaré disk. Like, perhaps it's a model with radius 2 instead of radius 1. 

Wait, because in the standard Poincaré disk, the curvature is -1, which corresponds to a hyperbolic plane with radius (or 'curvature radius') 1. The general form for a Poincaré disk with curvature k is ds² = (4/k)/(1 - (k r²))² (dr² + r² dθ²). So when k = -1, it's 4/(1 - r²)^2. Hmm, but in our problem, the metric is 32/(4 - r²) times (dx² + dy²), where r² is x² + y². So 32/(4 - r²) = 8*(4/(4 - r²)) = 8/(1 - (r²/4)). 

So if I think of it as (8/(1 - (r²/4))), maybe that's similar to a Poincaré model with a curvature parameter. Let me see: the general form of the Poincaré metric is (4/(1 - (r²/R²))²) (dr² + r² dθ²), where R is the radius of the pseudosphere. Wait, I'm not entirely sure about that, but perhaps the denominator here is (4 - r²) = 4(1 - r²/4). So it's similar to the standard Poincaré model scaled by a factor of 2.

Wait, for the standard Poincaré disk with R=1, the denominator would be (1 - r²), while here it's (4 - r²) which is (4)(1 - r²/4). So perhaps this metric is equivalent to the Poincaré disk model with R=2, since 4 is 2 squared.

Wait, but the scaling factor in the metric is 32/(4 - r²) = 8/(1 - r²/4). So maybe this is a version of the Poincaré metric with R=2, because 1 - (r²/4) would imply that R is 2. So the presence of 4 in the denominator suggests that the radius is 2.

So the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, wait, the question says "pseudosphere of radius r=2". But in hyperbolic geometry, the concept of a sphere is a bit different. The area of a pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant negative curvature) with a given radius might involve a specific formula.

Wait, no, I think the term 'pseudosphere' here refers to the hyperbolic plane itself. Or perhaps it's referring to a surface embedded in Euclidean space, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the area being asked is the area of a specific region in the hyperbolic plane modeled by this metric.

Wait, the question says, "what is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?" Hmm, I'm not entirely certain, but I think in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle (which would be the analog of a sphere) of radius r is given by 2π times (cosh(r) - 1), but wait, that's when the curvature is -1. Alternatively, for a hyperbolic plane with curvature k=-1, the area of a circle of radius r is 2π (cosh(r) - 1).

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the area element in this metric. The area element is derived from the metric. For a 2D metric ds² = g(r) (dr² + r² dθ²), the area element would be sqrt(g(r)) * r dr dθ. But wait, in our case, the metric is conformally flat, so it's (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). So in polar coordinates, where x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

So the area element dA would be sqrt( [32/(4 - r²)]^2 * r² ) dr dθ. Wait, no, wait. The area element in 2D is sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}) ) dr dθ, but only when the metric is diagonal. Since our metric is diagonal with g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²) and g_{θθ} = [32/(4 - r²)] r². So the area element is sqrt( (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) dr dθ. Wait, that would be sqrt( (32^2 r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ) dr dθ. Simplifying that, it's (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Wait, but that's the area element. So the total area would be the integral over all space. But wait, in this metric, the domain is where 4 - r² > 0, which is when r² < 4, so r < 2. Because if r² >=4, the denominator becomes zero or negative, and the metric would be undefined or have imaginary components. So the space we're considering is the disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane, right? Because inside r=2, it's a valid metric.

So the area would be the integral of dA over the entire disk. So integrating r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π. The area A would be the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2 of (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Let me compute that. Let's first compute the integral over r. Let's make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r => -du/2 = r dr. So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral for r becomes ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2. Let me factor 32 out: 32 ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Substituting u=4 - r²: r dr = (-du/2). So the integral becomes 32 ∫ (1/u) * (-du/2) from u=4 to u=0.

Which is 32*(-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0. The integral of 1/u is ln(u), so:

32*(-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = 32*(-1/2) [ (ln 0) is negative infinity, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution limits. Let's re-express it. 

Wait, when r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0. So the substitution would change the integral's limits from u=4 to u=0. But the integral is ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2. Let me write this as ∫ [r/(u)] dr, but with u = 4 - r². So dr = du/( -2r ), because du = -2r dr => dr = - du/(2r).

So substituting, the integral becomes ∫ (r / u) * (- du/(2r)) ) = ∫ (-1/(2 u)) du. The r cancels out.

So the integral becomes (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-1/2) [ln(u)] from 4 to 0. Evaluating, it's (-1/2) ( ln(0) - ln(4) ). 

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this becomes (-1/2) ( -infty - ln4 ), which would be positive infinity. So the integral diverges. Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, but that suggests that the area is infinite. But wait, the area of the hyperbolic plane is infinite, so perhaps the question is a bit of a trick.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the question is asking for. Because the entire hyperbolic plane under this metric has an infinite area, but maybe the question refers to the area of a specific region, like a disk of radius 2 in this model.

Wait, no, in the Poincaré disk model, the entire hyperbolic plane is represented within the disk of radius R (in the model space, which here is R=2). So the area of the entire hyperbolic plane would indeed be infinite, but I'm not sure if the question is referring to that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the area of a specific circle, not the entire plane. Wait, the term 'pseudosphere' might be a bit confusing. A pseudosphere is a surface in Euclidean space with constant negative curvature, but in this context, perhaps it's referring to the hyperbolic plane itself.

Wait, but the options include 4π(x² + y²), 4π(x² - y²), 0, and +infinity. Wait, looking back at the options, option D is +infinity. So if the area of the entire space under this metric is infinite, then the answer would be D.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The metric given is for the hyperbolic plane in the Poincaré disk model, scaled to have a radius of 2. The area of the entire hyperbolic plane is infinite, so the total area under this metric would be infinite. Hence, the answer would be D) +infty.

Wait, but the question says, "the pseudosphere of radius r=2." Hmm, perhaps the pseudosphere refers to the surface, but in hyperbolic geometry, a pseudosphere of radius r would have a certain area. But I might not have the exact formula in mind.

Wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle (which is the analog of a sphere) of radius r is A = 2π (cosh(r) − 1). For r=2, that would be 2π (cosh(2) - 1). But cosh(2) is (e^2 + e^(-2))/2 ≈ (7.389 + 0.135)/2 ≈ 3.762. So 3.762 - 1 = 2.762, multiplied by 2π gives approx 17.36. But that's a finite value. However, looking at the options, I don't see any option that matches this. The options are either expressions in x and y, zero, or infinity. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe the question is about the area of the entire space, not a specific circle. Because the options include D) +infty, which would make sense if the area is divergent. But let me think again about the area integral.

Earlier, when I computed the area element, I got (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ. The integral over the entire disk would be from r=0 to r=2, and θ=0 to θ=2π.

So the area A is the integral from θ=0 to 2π of ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from r=0 to 2.

The θ integral contributes a factor of 2π, so A = 2π * ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute the integral ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me substitute u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (32 r)/(u) dr → 32 ∫ (r)/(u) dr → 32 ∫ (r dr )/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ (-du/2)/u.

So that becomes 32*(-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this becomes (-16) ( -infty - ln4 ) → which is positive infinity. So the integral diverges, which means the area is infinite.

So the area of the entire space under this metric is infinite. Therefore, the answer would be D) +infty.

Wait, but the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2." Hmm, maybe pseudosphere refers to a different concept here. Alternatively, perhaps the area is being considered for a specific circle (like the boundary at r=2), but that would just be a circumference, not an area. Alternatively, perhaps it's the area of a sphere in this metric, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more straightforward. The metric given is a 2D metric, so the area would be for a 2D surface. Since the hyperbolic plane is unbounded, its area is infinite. So the answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a conformal metric, where the scaling factor is \( g(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The metric resembles the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, which typically has the form:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{4}{(1 - r^2)^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right),
\]

where \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \). In this case, the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) suggests a scaling by a factor of 4, indicating that the model represents a hyperbolic plane with a radius of 2. The metric is valid only within the disk \( r < 2 \), where \( 4 - r^2 > 0 \).

To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we calculate the total area under this metric by integrating the area element. In polar coordinates, the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta}} \, dr \, d\theta = \sqrt{\frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2}} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \) can be evaluated using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \). This gives:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-1}{2u} \, du = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[\ln u\right]_4^0.
\]

Here, \( \ln u \) diverges as \( u \to 0 \), leading to an infinite result. Thus, the total area under the metric is infinite. This reflects the fact that the hyperbolic plane, represented by this metric, is unbounded and has infinite area.

Given the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.  
**B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid expression for the area.  
**C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid expression for the area.  
**D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the total area under the metric is infinite.
