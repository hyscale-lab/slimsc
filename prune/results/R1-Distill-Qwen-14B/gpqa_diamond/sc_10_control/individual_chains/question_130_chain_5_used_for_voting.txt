Okay, let's try to tackle this question. So, the question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen that absorb light from background quasars. The absorption is at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The goal is to find the smallest redshift where these objects can be detected using optical ground-based telescopes.

Hmm, I remember that redshift tells us how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The Lyman alpha line is emitted by hydrogen when an electron transitions from the second to the first energy level. In the rest frame of the hydrogen, it's at 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But when this light is redshifted, its wavelength increases.

Wait, optical telescopes operate in the visible spectrum, right? So if the redshifted Lyman alpha wavelength falls into the visible range, we can detect it. But if it's shifted into the infrared or something beyond optical, then ground-based telescopes can't see it because they're not designed for those wavelengths. Oh wait, no, actually, some optical telescopes can capture near-infrared, but I think the question is assuming standard visible light.

So, the Lyman alpha wavelength after redshift, lambda_obs, should be equal to the rest wavelength multiplied by (1 + z), where z is the redshift. So lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z). But what's the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can observe?

Wait, visible light is typically from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red), right? So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Wait, no, wait. 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms? No, wait, 1 nm is 10 angstroms, so 400 nm is 4000 angstroms. Wait, no, 1 nm = 10 angstroms, so 100 nm is 1000 angstroms. So 400 nm would be 4000 angstroms, and 700 nm would be 7000 angstroms.

Wait, so the observed wavelength must be less than or equal to 7000 Angstroms (700 nm, red) for ground-based optical telescopes to detect it. Because if it's longer than that, it's in the infrared, which optical telescopes can't see. Wait, but wait, some telescopes can observe near-infrared, but the question specifies 'optical' ground-based, so I think we should stick to visible light.

Wait, but wait, another angle: the quasars are emitting light that is absorbed by the hydrogen clouds. So the quasars must be at a higher redshift than the clouds, right? Because the clouds are in front of the quasars from our perspective, so the quasars are farther away. So the hydrogen cloud's redshift can't be higher than the quasar's, but we're looking for the lower limit on the cloud's redshift. Hmm, maybe that's a bit tangential.

Wait, the problem is about the clouds being detected. The clouds are seen in absorption against the quasar's emission. So the quasar's light must be redshifted so that the Lyman alpha line is in the observed wavelength range. Wait, no, the quasar's light is at a certain wavelength, but the absorption happens when the Lyman alpha wavelength of the cloud matches a wavelength in the quasar's spectrum.

Wait, perhaps the quasar emits light at various wavelengths, and the cloud absorbs at their own Lyman alpha wavelength. So when the cloud's Lyman alpha is in the quasar's emitted spectrum, we can detect the absorption. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The key is that the Lyman alpha absorption from the hydrogen cloud must be observed in the optical range. So the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha line (from the cloud) must be less than or equal to 7000 Angstroms (red end of visible light), because beyond that, it's infrared, which optical telescopes can't detect.

Wait, but wait, another point: the quasar's light is emitted at optical wavelengths, but the Lyman alpha absorption occurs at a specific rest wavelength. So the quasar's own light is redshifted as well. So if the quasar's emission is in the optical, then the quasar's redshift must be such that its emitted light (say, in the optical) is shifted into the observed optical. So the quasar's redshift can't be too high because otherwise, its light would be shifted out of the optical range. But I'm not sure if that affects the clouds' redshift.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it step by step.

The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the hydrogen cloud. The observed wavelength (lambda_obs) is lambda_rest * (1 + z). For the cloud to be detected, the observed wavelength must be <= the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can observe, which is about 7000 Angstroms (700 nm). So:

lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) <= 7000

Solving for z:

1 + z <= 7000 / 1216 ≈ 5.756

So z <= 5.756 - 1 ≈ 4.756.

Wait, but wait, no. That gives the maximum redshift where the Lyman alpha is still in the optical. But the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift, so the objects can be detected. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this reversed.

Wait, no. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal redshift at which the Lyman alpha absorption is still in the optical.

Wait, no. Wait, if the cloud is at a lower redshift, then the observed wavelength is longer. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think: higher redshift means the wavelength is stretched more. So for a lower redshift, lambda_obs is closer to 1216, which is in the ultraviolet. Oh wait, but 1216 Ang is 121.6 nm, which is in the far ultraviolet, which optical telescopes can't see because the atmosphere blocks UV. So ground-based optical telescopes can't observe UV due to atmospheric absorption. So for the Lyman alpha absorption to be seen, the observed wavelength must be in the optical, i.e., longer than 4000 Ang (400 nm, violet). Wait, no, optical is from 4000 (violet) to 7000 (red) Ang.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 4000 Ang is 400 nm, which is violet. So, for the Lyman alpha line to be in the optical, the observed wavelength must be between 4000 and 7000 Ang.

Wait, but wait, the Lyman alpha line is in the rest frame at 1216 Ang. So if the cloud is at some redshift, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z). For this to be in the observed optical range (4000-7000 Ang), the redshift must satisfy:

4000 <= 1216*(1+z) <=7000.

So solving for z:

Lower limit: 4000 = 1216*(1+z) → 1+z = 4000/1216 ≈ 3.29 → z ≈ 2.29.

Upper limit: 7000 = 1216*(1+z) → 1+z ≈5.756 → z≈4.756.

So the redshift z must be in the range approximately 2.29 to 4.756.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal redshift is about 2.29. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is close. Option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So the lower limit is approximately 2.29, so the minimal redshift is around 2.29, so the answer would be the smallest option that is equal or higher than this.

Looking at the options:

A)3 → z=3 is higher than 2.29, so possible.

B)1.2 → too low, observed wavelength would be 1216*(1+1.2)=2678.72 Ang, which is 267.87 nm, which is UV, so ground-based optical telescopes can't see it.

C)2.4 → 1216*(1+2.4)=1216 *3.4=4134.4 Ang, which is 413 nm, violet, within optical.

D)1.9 → 1216*(2.9)=3526.4 Ang, 352.6 nm, which is near UV. But wait, is 352 nm considered in the optical? I think 400 nm is the start of the optical (violet), so 350 is UV. So option D would be in UV, which optical can't see. So the lower limit is about 2.29, so options with z >= ~2.29 are acceptable. Therefore, the minimal redshift is around 2.29. So the first option above that is 2.4 (option C) or 3 (option A).

Wait, but wait, another consideration: the quasar's own emission must be in the optical as well, because we're observing the quasar through the cloud. So the quasar's emission that we see must be in the optical. So the quasar's redshift must be such that its emitted optical light is observed in optical. So if the quasar's rest wavelength is, say, 5000 Ang (green), then the observed wavelength is 5000*(1+z_quasar) must be less than or equal to 7000 Ang. So 1+z_quasar <= 7000/5000=1.4 → z_quasar <=0.4. Wait, that can't be right because quasars are usually at high redshifts. Hmm, this seems conflicting.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm mixing up the frames. The quasar emits light in the optical, but when we observe it, that light is redshifted. So for the quasar's emission to be in the optical, the quasar's redshift must be such that its emitted optical light (say, 5000 Ang) is observed in the optical (<=7000 Ang). So 5000*(1+z_quasar) <=7000 → 1+z_quasar <=1.4 → z_quasar <=0.4. But that would imply quasars can't be at high redshifts, which contradicts what I know.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: the quasar emits light across the spectrum, including the optical. When we observe a quasar, we see its emission lines redshifted. So the quasar's emission line (say, at 5000 Ang rest) would be observed at 5000*(1+z_quasar). For this to be in the optical (<=7000 Ang), z_quasar must be <= (7000/5000)-1=0.4. But that's impossible because quasars are typically at higher redshifts. So perhaps the quasar's emitted light isn't in the optical but in the UV or something else. Wait, no, quasars are very bright and emit across the spectrum, including optical.

Hmm, but this seems contradictory. So perhaps the correct approach is to ignore the quasar's redshift and just focus on the Lyman alpha line of the hydrogen cloud. Because the absorption line is what we're detecting, not the quasar's emission.

Wait, another approach: the Lyman alpha absorption occurs when the quasar's emitted light passes through the hydrogen cloud. So the quasar's emitted light must include the Lyman alpha wavelength as seen by the hydrogen. So the quasar's rest frame must have emitted light at 1216 Ang, which is the Lyman alpha line. But quasars emit in a broad range, so that's possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's get back to the initial problem. The hydrogen cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is observed in the optical. So the observed wavelength must be in the range 4000-7000 Ang. Therefore:

4000 ≤ 1216*(1+z) ≤7000.

Which gives:

z ≥ (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29.

z ≤ (7000/1216) -1≈5.756-1=4.756.

So the redshift of the hydrogen cloud must be between ~2.29 and ~4.756.

The question is asking for the lower limit, so the minimal z is approximately 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest higher option is C) 2.4. But wait, option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So if the cloud's redshift is 1.9, the observed wavelength is 1216 * 2.9 ≈ 3526 Ang, which is 352.6 nm. That's in the near-UV, which ground-based optical telescopes can't see because the atmosphere blocks UV. So the lower limit is approximately 2.29, so the minimal z is around 2.29. The options don't have 2.29, but option C is 2.4, which is just above. So the answer would be option C) 2.4.

Wait, but what about the upper limit of the optical spectrum? If the observed wavelength is less than 4000 Ang, it's UV and can't be seen by optical telescopes. So only when z is >= 2.29 (so that 1216*(1+z) >=4000) can the Lyman alpha line be detected in optical. So the lower limit is about 2.29, so any z below that would have the absorption line in UV and thus undetectable by optical telescopes.

So the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29. Among the options, the smallest z that is equal or higher than 2.29 is option C (2.4) and option A (3). So the lower limit is 2.29, so the minimal z is 2.29. So the correct answer is the smallest option that is >=2.29. So option C is 2.4, which is the closest higher than 2.29. Therefore, the correct answer should be C) 2.4.

To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the relationship between the observed wavelength and the redshift. The Lyman alpha line has a rest wavelength of \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \), and the observed wavelength is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z),
\]

where \( z \) is the redshift. Optical ground-based telescopes can only observe wavelengths in the range \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \leq \lambda_{\text{obs}} \leq 7000 \, \text{Å} \) (visible light). For the Lyman alpha absorption to be detectable, the observed wavelength must fall within this range. Focusing on the lower limit, we require:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 4000 \, \text{Å}.
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z) \), we solve for \( z \):

\[
1 + z \geq \frac{4000}{1216}.
\]

\[
1 + z \geq 3.29 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z \geq 2.29.
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \). Among the given options, the smallest redshift that satisfies this condition is \( z = 2.4 \) (option C). Lower redshifts, such as \( z = 1.9 \) (option D), would result in an observed wavelength of \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the ultraviolet and undetectable by optical telescopes.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

So z <= 5.756 - 1 ≈ 4.756.

Wait, but wait, no. That gives the maximum redshift where the Lyman alpha is still in the optical. But the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift, so the objects can be detected. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this reversed.

Wait, no. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal redshift at which the Lyman alpha absorption is still in the optical.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 4000 Ang is 400 nm, which is violet. So, for the Lyman alpha line to be in the optical, the observed wavelength must be between 4000 and 7000 Ang.

Wait, but wait, the Lyman alpha line is in the rest frame at 1216 Ang. So if the cloud is at some redshift, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z). For this to be in the observed optical range (4000-7000 Ang), the redshift must satisfy:

4000 <= 1216*(1+z) <=7000.

So the redshift z must be in the range approximately 2.29 to 4.756.

So 1+z_quasar <= 7000/5000=1.4 → z_quasar <=0.4. Wait, that can't be right because quasars are usually at high redshifts. Hmm, this seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's get back to the initial problem. The hydrogen cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is observed in the optical. So the observed wavelength must be in the range 4000-7000 Ang. Therefore:

4000 ≤ 1216*(1+z) ≤7000.

Which gives:

z ≥ (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29.

z ≤ (7000/1216) -1≈5.756-1=4.756.

So the redshift of the hydrogen cloud must be between ~2.29 and ~4.756.

The question is asking for the lower limit, so the minimal z is approximately 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest higher option is C) 2.4. But wait, option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So if the cloud's redshift is 1.9, the observed wavelength is 1216 * 2.9 ≈ 3526 Ang, which is 352.6 nm. That's in the near-UV, which ground-based optical telescopes can't see because the atmosphere blocks UV. So the lower limit is approximately 2.29, so the minimal z is around 2.29. The options don't have 2.29, but option C is 2.4, which is just above. So the answer would be option C) 2.4.

Wait, but what about the upper limit of the optical spectrum? If the observed wavelength is less than 4000 Ang, it's UV and can't be seen by optical telescopes. So only when z is >= 2.29 (so that 1216*(1+z) >=4000) can the Lyman alpha line be detected in optical. So the lower limit is about 2.29, so any z below that would have the absorption line in UV and thus undetectable by optical telescopes.

So the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29. Among the options, the smallest z that is equal or higher than 2.29 is option C (2.4) and option A (3). So the lower limit is 2.29, so the minimal z is 2.29. So the correct answer is the smallest option that is >=2.29. So option C is 2.4, which is the closest higher than 2.29. Therefore, the correct answer should be C) 2.4.


To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the relationship between the observed wavelength and the redshift. The Lyman alpha line has a rest wavelength of \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \), and the observed wavelength is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z),
\]

where \( z \) is the redshift. Optical ground-based telescopes can only observe wavelengths in the range \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \leq \lambda_{\text{obs}} \leq 7000 \, \text{Å} \) (visible light). For the Lyman alpha absorption to be detectable, the observed wavelength must fall within this range. Focusing on the lower limit, we require:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 4000 \, \text{Å}.
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z) \), we solve for \( z \):

\[
1 + z \geq \frac{4000}{1216}.
\]

\[
1 + z \geq 3.29 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z \geq 2.29.
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \). Among the given options, the smallest redshift that satisfies this condition is \( z = 2.4 \) (option C). Lower redshifts, such as \( z = 1.9 \) (option D), would result in an observed wavelength of \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the ultraviolet and undetectable by optical telescopes.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
