Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle and Pauli statistics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, so I need to consider the quantum numbers—angular momentum, spin, isospin.

The given condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since the final NN state has T(NN) = 0, I can plug that into the equation. So 0 equals S + L +1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2, meaning S + L is odd. Let me note that down: S + L is odd.

The problem asks which partial wave isn't permitted. The options are A to D, each involving the emission of a particle (like p, f, etc.), so I think the last part in each option is the particle emitted (like p for proton, maybe? Or perhaps it's the orbital angular momentum quantum number, lowercase letters... Wait, the problem says the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So the 'p' in option B is the angular momentum state of X, so l=1, because P is l=1 in spectroscopic notation. Wait, no, spectroscopic notation uses S=0, P=1, D=2, F=3, etc. So 'p' is l=1.

So, I need to analyze each option and see if the angular momentum is conserved, as well as parity.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. So that's the NN state. Let me parse the 1S0 notation. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 means 2S+1 =1 → S=0, L=Spectroscopic notation S is L=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0. So the initial angular momentum is J_initial =0.

They emit a particle X, so the final state is NN plus X. But since the problem is about the NN state after emission, I think we're considering the process as NN → NN' + X. Or maybe the X is the emitted particle, and the NN system changes. Hmm, perhaps I should model this as NN emitting X, so the initial state is NN in 1S0, and the final state includes another NN state and X.

But for the problem, the question is about the NN's quantum numbers in the final state, so their T, S, L, and the emitted particle's l and spin.

Wait, the problem says "the final NN state has T=0." So before emission, the initial state is 1S0, which is for the NN system. After emitting X, the NN system is in a state with T=0. So I need to find the allowed transitions.

And the condition is that T = S + L +1 mod 2. T is 0, so S + L +1 ≡ 0 mod 2 → S + L ≡1 mod 2. So S and L must sum to an odd number.

Each option gives a transition from 1S0 to another state plus a particle. So for each option, I need to look at the final NN state's S, L, and the emitted particle's l.

Wait, but the NN state in the final state: each option shows that. For instance, option A is 7D1. So the final NN state has, for 7D1: the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). Wait, but wait, 7D1: 7 is 2S+1 → 2S+1=7 → S=3. And D means L=2. So S=3, L=2. Then S + L =3+2=5, which is odd. So that's allowed because 5 mod 2 is 1, which fits the condition (since 0 ≡ 3+2 +1 mod 2 → 3+2=5, 5+1=6 → 6 mod 2=0. So yes, that works. So T=0, S=3, L=2, so T =3+2 +1 mod 2 → 6 mod2=0. So that's allowed.

Wait, but the condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So T=0, so 0 = (S + L +1) mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. So for each option, calculate S + L for the final NN state and see if it's 1 mod 2. If it's not, that option isn't allowed.

But wait, what about angular momentum conservation? Because the initial state has J_initial =0 (since L=0 and S=0, so J=0). The process is NN → NN' + X. The total angular momentum must be conserved.

So, the initial angular momentum is J_initial =0. The final state's angular momentum J_final is the sum of the angular momentum of the NN' state and the X particle. But since they are emitted, the total J_final must be equal to J_initial, which is 0.

Wait, but the problem says to use conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So parity must also be conserved.

The initial state's parity is determined by the NN state. For a state with orbital angular momentum L, the parity is (-1)^L. The initial state is 1S0, so L=0. So parity P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1.

The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So, the parity of the final state (NN' + X) must be equal to the initial parity.

The parity of the NN' state is (-1)^L', where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' state in the final state. The parity of X is given as -1.

So the total parity P_final = P_NN' * P_X. So P_final = (-1)^L' * (-1) = (-1)^(L' +1) 

This must equal the initial parity, which is +1.

So,

(-1)^(L' +1) = (+1) → 

Which implies that L' +1 is even → L' must be odd.

So L' must be odd. Because if L' is even, L' +1 is odd → (-1)^(odd) = -1, which won't match initial parity. So L' must be odd.

So, the orbital angular momentum L' of the final NN' state must be odd.

So let's go through each option.

Each option is of the form initial state → final state + particle. The particle's angular momentum quantum number is given as a letter (like p, s, etc.), which corresponds to l.

Wait, no—the particle's angular momentum is its orbital angular momentum. Because in the term symbol, the particle's orbital angular momentum would contribute to the total angular momentum. But in the options, the particle's state is given as a lowercase letter, which is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. Like, for example, p is l=1.

So for each option, the final NN state is given, and the emitted X has a certain l (from the letter). So when considering angular momentum conservation, the total angular momentum in the final state must be 0.

Let me start by analyzing each option.

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p

The initial state is 1S0 → S=0, L=0, J=0.

The final NN state is 7D1. So the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). For 7D1, 2S+1=7 → S=3. L is D →2. So S=3, L=2.

So J_NN' is the total angular momentum of the NN' state. It's given as 1. Because the term is 7D1, so J=1.

The emitted particle X has l=p → l=1 (since p is l=1).

So the total angular momentum of the final state is the vector sum of J_NN' (1) and l_X (1). But since angular momentum is a vector, the total J_final can be 0,1, or 2, depending on their relative orientations. But the initial J is 0, so the final J must be 0 as well. So the sum of J_NN' and l_X must result in a total angular momentum of 0.

Wait, but J_NN' is 1 and l_X is 1. The possible total J is |1-1| to 1+1 → 0,1,2. So for the total J to be 0, the individual angular momenta must be aligned opposite, resulting in cancellation. So it's possible only if J_NN' and l_X are opposite in direction and their magnitudes match to sum to zero. But how do their quantum numbers relate? Because the condition for total J=0 is that J_NN' and l_X must combine to zero. But combining two spin-1 particles (since l=1 is spin-1? Wait, no, wait. X is a boson or fermion? Well, regardless, for angular momentum addition, the possible total J would be |1-1| to 1+1.

Wait, but in this problem, I'm probably supposed to consider the conservation of angular momentum in terms of quantum numbers, not their vector sums. Because when considering allowed transitions, you look at whether the total angular momentum quantum numbers can add up. But wait, because the initial state has J=0, the final must have total J=0.

So in the final state, the NN' has J=1, and X has l=1, so the sum of their J and l must be zero. But wait, J is the total angular momentum of the NN' system, and X's orbital angular momentum is l.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's think in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The total angular momentum is the sum of the NN' and X's angular momenta. But since the initial state has J=0, the sum must be zero. So, the possible J for the final state is |J_NN' - l_X| ≤ J_final ≤ J_NN' + l_X. But the only way J_final can be zero is if J_NN' and l_X are such that their vector sum is zero. But in terms of quantum numbers, this requires that J_NN' = l_X, and they are opposite in direction. But in angular momentum addition, the sum can be zero only if J_NN' = l_X, and their sum is zero. So for the case where J_NN' = l_X and they are in opposite directions.

But in any case, the possible J_final is 0 only if the angular momenta can combine that way.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to consider that the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l. So the total angular momentum of the system (NN' + X) must be zero. So the sum of the angular momentum of the NN' system and the X's orbital angular momentum must be zero. So, the NN' has J, and X has l. So J_NN' and l must be such that their vector sum is zero, meaning that J_NN' = l and their directions are opposite. But in quantum mechanics, this is only possible if the total angular momentum is zero, which requires that the individual angular momenta are equal and opposite, but in terms of quantum numbers, the only way is if J_NN' and l are such that their possible sum includes zero. But this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the conservation of angular momentum in terms of quantum numbers. The initial state has J=0. The final state's J must be 0. So the sum of the angular momenta of the NN' and X must equal zero. But the way to approach this is to consider that the total angular momentum is the sum of the NN' and X's orbital angular momenta. But wait, the X's orbital angular momentum is part of the total angular momentum. So, the total J_final is J_NN' + l_X. But since J_initial is zero, the only way is if J_NN' + l_X = 0. But this isn't possible because angular momenta are non-negative, and J_NN' and l_X can't be negative. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible angular momentum states. The initial state has J=0. The final state must have total J=0. The NN' has J_NN' and the X has l_X (which is its orbital angular momentum). So the total angular momentum is the vector sum of these two.

But since the initial J is zero, the only way the final J can be zero is if J_NN' and l_X are such that they can combine to zero. The possible cases are when J_NN' = l_X and their spins are in opposite directions. But in terms of quantum numbers, this would require that the total angular momentum is zero. So J_NN' and l must be compatible. So for example, if J_NN' is 1 and l_X is 1, their sum can be 0, 1, or 2. So it's possible to have a state where J=0.

So in option A, J_NN' is 1 and l_X is 1. So the sum can be 0, so it's allowed.

But wait, the problem is about whether the partial wave is permitted. The partial wave is characterized by the orbital angular momentum of X, which is the l value.

So for each option, I need to check two things:

1. The parity condition: L' (from the final NN state) must be odd, since L' +1 must be even (as P_final = (-1)^(L' +1) must equal +1).

2. The angular momentum conservation: J_initial = 0 must equal the total J_final. The total J_final is the sum of the NN' J and the X's l. But wait, J is the total angular momentum of the NN' system, and X's orbital angular momentum is l. So the sum (vector sum) must be zero. But how to check that the sum can be zero?

Wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the NN' has angular momentum J. So the sum J_NN' + l_X must be zero. But that's only possible if J_NN' = l_X and the directions are opposite. But quantum mechanically, the sum of two angular momenta can result in a total J of zero only if the individual J's can combine to zero. So, J_NN' and l_X must satisfy that their sum can be zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the sum of the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system and the orbital angular momentum of X must be zero. Because in the initial state, the orbital angular momentum is zero, so the sum of the final orbital angular momenta must be zero.

Wait, no, because the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, but when the system emits a particle, the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system plus the orbital angular momentum of X must sum to zero. Because orbital angular momentum is conserved in the absence of external fields.

Wait, that's probably the right way to think about it. So the total orbital angular momentum (L) is conserved. The initial orbital angular momentum is zero (from 1S0). So the final orbital angular momentum is the sum of the NN' orbital angular momentum (L') and X's orbital angular momentum (l_X) → L' + l_X must be zero.

Wait, but the problem is that the orbital angular momenta are vectors. So their vector sum must be zero. So L' and l_X must be such that their vector sum is zero.

But for that, the magnitudes must be equal and opposite. So |L' - l_X| ≤ 0 ≤ L' + l_X.

Wait, but the only way for their vector sum to be zero is if L' = l_X and they are opposite in direction. But in quantum terms, the orbital angular momenta are quantized in magnitude, so the only way their sum can be zero is if L' = l_X, and they're in opposite directions.

But since L' and l are quantum numbers, their magnitudes are integers, so L' must equal l_X.

So for each option, L' must equal l_X. Because only then can their sum be zero.

Wait, but in the options, the final NN state has certain L' and the X has a certain l.

So for each option, check if L' = l_X. If not, then angular momentum isn't conserved, and that partial wave is not allowed.

Let's check each option.

Option A: 7D1 + p.

NN' state: 7D1 → L'=2 (since D is L=2). X has l_X = 1 (p → l=1). So L'=2, l_X=1. 2≠1 → can't sum to zero. So this would not conserve angular momentum. So this transition is not allowed. So option A is not permitted.

Wait, but I thought earlier that parity might allow it. Hmm, but if the angular momentum condition isn't met, then it's forbidden. So perhaps option A is not permitted.

But let me check the other options.

Option B: 3S1 + p.

NN' state: 3S1. So S=1 (from 2S+1=3 → S=1), L' is S → L'=0. So L'=0.

X has l_X =1 (p).

So L' =0, l_X=1 → sum is 1, which isn't zero. So this violates angular momentum conservation. So option B is not allowed.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the parity condition requires L' to be odd. So let's check each option's parity condition.

The parity condition is that L' must be odd.

Option A: L'=2 → even. So this would violate the parity condition. So option A is forbidden.

Option B: L'=0 → even. So this is also forbidden.

Option C: 3D3 + f.

NN' state: 3D3 → so 2S+1=3 → S=1. L' is D → 2. J=3.

X has l_X = f → l=3.

So L'=2, l_X=3. Sum is 5. So unless 2 and 3 can combine to zero (which they can't, as 2+3=5), this is not allowed. Also, the parity condition: L' =2 (even) → which violates the parity requirement (L' must be odd). So option C is forbidden.

Option D: 3P0 + s.

NN' state: 3P0. So 2S+1=3 → S=1. L' is P → 1. J=0.

X has l_X = s → l=0 (since s is l=0).

So L'=1, l_X=0. Sum is 1, which doesn't equal zero. But wait, initial L was zero, so sum must be zero. So L' + l_X must be zero. But 1+0=1≠0 → violates angular momentum. So option D is forbidden.

Wait, but let me recheck.

Wait, for angular momentum conservation, the sum of L' and l_X must be zero. So L' must equal l_X, because their sum is zero only if they are equal and opposite. So L' must equal l_X.

So let's reevaluate each option.

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → 2≠1 → no.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 → 0≠1 → no.

Option C: L'=2, l_X=3 → 2≠3 → no.

Option D: L'=1, l_X=0 → 1≠0 → no.

Wait, but that's a problem because none of the options meet L' = l_X except maybe if I'm miscounting.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-express the problem.

The initial state is NN in 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0.

They emit X, so the final state is NN' (new state) plus X.

The total angular momentum must be conserved, so J_initial = J_final. But J_initial is 0, so J_final must be 0.

The total J_final is the sum of the NN' state's J and X's l. So the sum of their angular momenta must be zero.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the X's orbital angular momentum is part of the total angular momentum. So the sum of the NN' and X's orbital angular momenta must be zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system plus the orbital angular momentum of X must sum to zero because the initial orbital angular momentum is zero.

So L_NN' + l_X = 0.

Which implies that L_NN' must equal l_X, and their directions are opposite. But since their magnitudes are integers, L_NN' must equal l_X.

So in each option, we can check if L' from the NN' state equals l_X.

Option A: L' =2, l_X=1 → 2≠1 → No.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 → 0≠1 → No.

Option C: L'=2, l_X=3 → 2≠3 → No.

Option D: L'=1, l_X=0 → 1≠0 → No.

Wait, that can't be right because all options are being rejected, but the problem states only one is not permitted. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum L' of the NN' state plus the orbital angular momentum l_X of the emitted particle must sum to the initial orbital angular momentum, which is zero. So L_NN' + l_X must be zero, but as vectors, their magnitudes can add or subtract. So the sum's magnitude can be |L_NN' - l_X| up to L_NN' + l_X. But the only way the sum can be zero is if L_NN' = l_X and they are in opposite directions. So L_NN' must equal l_X.

Therefore, the only allowed transitions are those where L_NN' = l_X.

So checking each option:

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → 2≠1 → Not allowed.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 → 0≠1 → Not allowed.

Option C: L'=2, l_X=3 → 2≠3 → Not allowed.

Option D: L'=1, l_X=0 → 1≠0 → Not allowed.

Wait, but all options are not allowed, which can't be the case. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing orbital angular momentum and spin. The X's orbital angular momentum is l, and the NN' state's orbital angular momentum is L'. The sum of these must be zero.

So L' = l_X.

So in that case:

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → 2≠1 → No.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 → 0≠1 → No.

Option C: L'=2, l_X=3 → 2≠3 → No.

Option D: L'=1, l_X=0 → 1≠0 → No.

So according to this, all options are not allowed. But that can't be right because the question says one is not permitted.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching the angular momentum part wrong. Maybe the way to think about it is that the total angular momentum of the system (NN' + X) must be zero. So the vector sum of the NN' state's J and the X's orbital angular momentum l must be zero. So J_NN' and l_X must combine to zero.

But J_NN' is the total angular momentum of the NN' system, which includes their spin and orbital angular momentum. Wait, but in the options, the term symbol for the NN' state gives L and S, and J is given as well.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is to consider that the initial state has J=0. The final state's J must be 0, which is the sum of the NN' J and the X's orbital angular momentum.

Wait, but the X's orbital angular momentum is part of the final state's angular momentum, so the sum of the NN' J and the X's l must be zero.

So, the only way J_NN' and l_X can sum to zero is if J_NN' = l_X and the spins are opposite. So J_NN' must equal l_X.

Looking at each option:

Option A: J_NN'=1, l_X=1 → 1=1 → allowed.

Option B: J_NN'=1, l_X=1 → allowed.

Option C: J_NN'=3, l_X=3 → allowed.

Option D: J_NN'=0, l_X=0 → allowed.

Wait, but the problem says which partial wave is NOT permitted. So options where J_NN' != l_X would be forbidden.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: J_NN'=1, l_X=1 → allowed.

Option B: J_NN'=1, l_X=1 → allowed.

Option C: J_NN'=3, l_X=3 → allowed.

Option D: J_NN'=0, l_X=0 → allowed.

Wait, but all options have J_NN' equal to l_X. So none are forbidden. But the problem states one is not permitted. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, I think I've mixed up J and l. The X's orbital angular momentum is l, but the NN' state's J includes both its spin and orbital angular momentum. So perhaps the correct condition is that the sum of the NN' orbital angular momentum (L') and the X's l must be zero. Because orbital angular momentum is conserved (as per the absence of external fields), so L' + l_X = initial L, which is zero.

So L' + l_X must be zero → L' = -l_X. But since L' and l_X are magnitudes, this implies that L' = l_X, and the direction is opposite. So L' must equal l_X, but that's impossible because angular momentum magnitudes are non-negative. So the only way is that L' = l_X =0.

Wait, that would mean that only option D (L'=1, l_X=0) doesn't satisfy L'=l_X, but option D has L'=1, l_X=0 → sum is 1 → not zero. So option D is not allowed.

But wait, let's reevaluate. The initial orbital angular momentum is zero. So the sum of L' (NN' state's orbital angular momentum) and l_X (X's orbital angular momentum) must be zero. So L' + l_X must be zero. But since these are vectors, the only way their sum is zero is if L' = l_X and their directions are opposite. But in terms of quantum numbers, this would require that L' = l_X. Because you can't have negative angular momentum, so L' must equal l_X and the direction is opposite. But how can you have that? It's only possible if both are zero, because any other L' and l_X would require opposite vectors, but their magnitudes must be equal.

So the only possible way is L' = l_X =0. So the only allowed transition is when L' =0 and l_X=0.

Looking at the options:

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → sum=3 → not zero → not allowed.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 → sum=1 → not allowed.

Option C: L'=2, l_X=3 → sum=5 → not allowed.

Option D: L'=1, l_X=0 → sum=1 → not allowed.

Wait, but that's the same conclusion as before, that none are allowed. But this can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that orbital angular momentum is conserved. Wait, when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum is conserved between the initial and final states. So the initial orbital angular momentum (L_initial) is zero. The final orbital angular momentum is L_final = L_NN' + l_X. So L_final must equal L_initial, which is zero. So L_NN' + l_X must be zero. But since these are magnitudes, L_NN' and l_X must be zero. So the only allowed option is when L_NN' =0 and l_X=0.

Looking at each option:

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → sum =3 → not zero.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 → sum=1 → not zero.

Option C: L'=2, l_X=3 → sum=5 → not zero.

Option D: L'=1, l_X=0 → sum=1 → not zero.

So none of the options satisfy L_NN' + l_X =0. But that can't be the case because the problem gives four options.

I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternative approach: the parity condition.

The parity of the initial state is +1 (since L=0 → (-1)^0=1).

The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of X.

Parity of NN' is (-1)^L' and X's parity is given as -1.

So P_final = (-1)^L' * (-1) = (-1)^(L' +1).

But P_final must equal the initial parity, which is +1.

So:

(-1)^(L' +1) = 1 → L' +1 must be even → L' must be odd.

So L' must be odd.

Now, checking each option's L':

Option A: 7D1 → L'=2 → even → violates parity condition.

So option A is not allowed.

Option B: 3S1 → L'=0 → even → violates parity → not allowed.

Option C:3D3 → L'=2 → even → violates parity → not allowed.

Option D:3P0 → L'=1 → odd → satisfies parity.

So only option D satisfies the parity condition. So the other options are forbidden because they don't satisfy parity.

Wait, but the question is about which partial wave (emission of X) is not permitted. So if options A, B, and C have L' even, they don't meet the parity condition, so their partial waves are forbidden.

But the question is asking which is not permitted. So among the options, which one doesn't meet either parity or angular momentum condition.

Wait, but the problem also involves Pauli statistics, which gave the condition T= S + L +1 mod2.

In the final NN state (T=0), S + L must be 1 mod2.

So for each option, we have to calculate S' (from the final NN state) and L', then check if S' + L' is odd.

Let me recheck each option, considering both the parity and the condition from Pauli.

Option A: 7D1 → S' =3, L'=2 → S + L =5 → odd → allowed (as per Pauli condition). But parity condition: L' is even → not allowed. So option A is forbidden.

Option B:3S1 → S'=1, L'=0 → S + L=1 → odd → allowed (Pauli). But parity condition: L' even → forbidden.

Option C:3D3 → S'=1, L'=2 → S + L=3 → odd → allowed (Pauli). But parity condition: L' even → forbidden.

Option D:3P0 → S'=1, L'=1 → S + L=2 → even → violates Pauli condition, which requires S+L to be odd. So option D is forbidden.

Wait, so for option D, S'=1, L'=1 → sum is 2, which is even. So the condition T = S + L +1 mod2 → 1 +1 +1 =3 → mod2=1 → T would be 1. But the question states T=0. So option D's final state would have T=1, which violates the condition.

So option D is not allowed because it violates the Pauli condition.

Wait, but earlier I thought option D's parity was allowed because L'=1 (odd), but the Pauli condition is not met. So option D is forbidden for two reasons.

So now, looking back at the options, which one is not permitted.

The problem is to find which partial wave is not permitted. So let's check each option against both conditions.

Option A:

- Parity: L' =2 (even) → P_final = (-1)^(2+1) =-1 → doesn't match initial +1. So parity condition not met.

- Pauli condition: S' =3, L'=2 → 3+2 =5 (odd) → OK.

So overall, parity condition not met → forbidden.

Option B:

- Parity: L'=0 (even) → P_final = (-1)^(0+1) =-1 → doesn't match. Forbidden.

- Pauli condition: S'=1, L'=0 → sum 1 (odd) → OK.

Option C:

- Parity: L'=2 (even) → P_final =-1 → forbidden.

- Pauli condition: S'=1, L'=2 → sum 3 (odd) → OK.

Option D:

- Parity: L'=1 (odd) → P_final = (-1)^(1+1) =1 → matches initial parity. OK.

- Pauli condition: S'=1, L'=1 → sum 2 (even) → T= (1+1)+1 mod2 → 3 mod2=1 → which doesn't match T=0. So violates Pauli condition → forbidden.

So among the options, only option D satisfies the parity condition but violates the Pauli condition. The others violate parity.

So the question is which partial wave is not permitted. The options that are forbidden are A, B, C, and D.

Wait, but the question says only one is not permitted. So perhaps the correct approach is to find which option is forbidden for both angular momentum and parity, or just one.

Wait, the problem also involves angular momentum conservation. So each option must satisfy:

1. The sum of the angular momenta (J_NN' and l_X) can be zero.

2. The parity condition is met.

3. The Pauli condition (S' + L' is odd) is met.

So let's reevaluate each option.

Option A: 7D1 + p.

- S' =3, L'=2 → S + L=5 → odd → Pauli condition met.

- L'=2 (even) → parity condition not met. So forbidden.

Option B:3S1 + p.

- S'=1, L'=0 → sum 1 → Pauli condition met.

- L'=0 (even) → parity not met. Forbbiden.

Option C:3D3 + f.

- S'=1, L'=2 → sum 3 → Pauli condition met.

- L'=2 (even) → parity not met. Forbidden.

Option D:3P0 + s.

- S'=1, L'=1 → sum 2 → even → Pauli condition not met. Forbidden.

- L'=1 (odd) → parity condition met.

- Angular momentum: J_NN' =0, l_X=0 → sum is 0 → allowed.

So option D meets the parity condition but violates the Pauli condition. So it's forbidden.

So the only options that meet all conditions are none. But the problem says which is not permitted. So perhaps the correct approach is to focus on angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system plus the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle must equal the initial orbital angular momentum, which is zero. So L_NN' + l_X =0 → L_NN' = l_X.

So in each option, check if L_NN' = l_X.

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → 2≠1 → no.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 → 0≠1 → no.

Option C: L'=2, l_X=3 → 2≠3 → no.

Option D: L'=1, l_X=0 → 1≠0 → no.

So none of the options meet this condition. But that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to approach it step by step.

The initial state is 1S0 → S=0, L=0, J=0.

The final state is NN' in a state with T=0. So the Pauli condition is S' + L' must be odd (since T=0 → S' + L' +1 ≡0 mod2 → S' + L' ≡1 mod2).

The emitted particle X has l, and parity -1.

Parity condition: (-1)^(L') * (-1) = +1 → (-1)^(L' +1) =1 → L' +1 even → L' odd.

So L' must be odd.

So the possible L' values are 1,3,5,...

So let's see which options have L' odd.

Option A: L'=2 → even → no.

Option B: L'=0 → even → no.

Option C:L'=2→ even → no.

Option D:L'=1 → odd → yes.

So only option D meets the parity condition.

Now, check if option D meets the Pauli condition.

In option D, the final NN' state is 3P0.

So S' =1 (since 3=2S+1 → S=1), L'=1.

So S' + L' =2 → even → which violates the condition because it needs to be odd. So option D violates the Pauli condition.

So option D is forbidden.

Now, regarding angular momentum: the sum of J_NN' and l_X must be zero.

Option D: J_NN' =0, l_X=0 → sum is 0 → allowed.

So option D meets the parity condition but violates Pauli.

So among the options, only option D meets parity but violates Pauli.

Other options:

Option A: violates parity → forbidden.

Option B: violates parity → forbidden.

Option C: violates parity → forbidden.

Option D: violates Pauli → forbidden.

So all options are forbidden except perhaps none. But the question says which is not permitted. So perhaps the correct forbidden option is option D.

Wait, but the question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Pauli Statistics Condition**: For the final NN state with \( T = 0 \), the condition \( T = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) must hold. This implies \( S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), meaning \( S + L \) must be odd.

2. **Parity Conservation**: The initial state has parity \( +1 \) (since \( L = 0 \) for \( 1S_0 \)). The final state's parity is the product of the parity of the NN' state (\( (-1)^{L'} \)) and the parity of the emitted particle \( X \) (intrinsic parity \( -1 \)). Thus, \( P_{\text{final}} = (-1)^{L'} \cdot (-1) = (-1)^{L' + 1} \). For parity conservation, \( P_{\text{final}} = P_{\text{initial}} = +1 \), which requires \( L' + 1 \) to be even. Hence, \( L' \) must be odd.

3. **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The initial state has \( J = 0 \). The final state's total angular momentum \( J_{\text{final}} \) must also be \( 0 \). The total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN' state's \( J_{\text{NN'}} \) and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum \( l_X \). This implies \( J_{\text{NN'}} + l_X = 0 \), meaning \( J_{\text{NN'}} = l_X \).

### Analysis of Each Option

#### **Option A: \( 1S_0 \to 7D_1 + p \)**
- **Final NN' State**: \( 7D_1 \) implies \( S' = 3 \) (from \( 2S + 1 = 7 \)) and \( L' = 2 \) (from \( D \)).
- **Pauli Condition**: \( S' + L' = 3 + 2 = 5 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
- **Parity Condition**: \( L' = 2 \), which is even. Parity condition violated.
- **Conclusion**: Forbidden due to parity violation.

#### **Option B: \( 1S_0 \to 3S_1 + p \)**
- **Final NN' State**: \( 3S_1 \) implies \( S' = 1 \) (from \( 2S + 1 = 3 \)) and \( L' = 0 \) (from \( S \)).
- **Pauli Condition**: \( S' + L' = 1 + 0 = 1 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
- **Parity Condition**: \( L' = 0 \), which is even. Parity condition violated.
- **Conclusion**: Forbidden due to parity violation.

#### **Option C: \( 1S_0 \to 3D_3 + f \)**
- **Final NN' State**: \( 3D_3 \) implies \( S' = 1 \) (from \( 2S + 1 = 3 \)) and \( L' = 2 \) (from \( D \)).
- **Pauli Condition**: \( S' + L' = 1 + 2 = 3 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
- **Parity Condition**: \( L' = 2 \), which is even. Parity condition violated.
- **Conclusion**: Forbidden due to parity violation.

#### **Option D: \( 1S_0 \to 3P_0 + s \)**
- **Final NN' State**: \( 3P_0 \) implies \( S' = 1 \) (from \( 2S + 1 = 3 \)) and \( L' = 1 \) (from \( P \)).
- **Pauli Condition**: \( S' + L' = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is even. Condition violated.
- **Parity Condition**: \( L' = 1 \), which is odd. Parity condition satisfied.
- **Angular Momentum Conservation**: \( J_{\text{NN'}} = 0 \) (from \( 3P_0 \)) and \( l_X = 0 \) (from \( s \)). \( J_{\text{NN'}} = l_X \), so angular momentum is conserved.
- **Conclusion**: Forbidden due to Pauli condition violation.

### Final Answer
The partial wave that is not permitted is **Option D**, as it violates the Pauli condition. 

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle and Pauli statistics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, so I need to consider the quantum numbers—angular momentum, spin, isospin.

The given condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since the final NN state has T(NN) = 0, I can plug that into the equation. So 0 equals S + L +1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2, meaning S + L is odd. Let me note that down: S + L is odd.

The problem asks which partial wave isn't permitted. The options are A to D, each involving the emission of a particle (like p, f, etc.), so I think the last part in each option is the particle emitted (like p for proton, maybe? Or perhaps it's the orbital angular momentum quantum number, lowercase letters... Wait, the problem says the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So the 'p' in option B is the angular momentum state of X, so l=1, because P is l=1 in spectroscopic notation. Wait, no, spectroscopic notation uses S=0, P=1, D=2, F=3, etc. So 'p' is l=1.

So, I need to analyze each option and see if the angular momentum is conserved, as well as parity.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. So that's the NN state. Let me parse the 1S0 notation. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 means 2S+1 =1 → S=0, L=Spectroscopic notation S is L=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0. So the initial angular momentum is J_initial =0.

They emit a particle X, so the final state is NN plus X. But since the problem is about the NN state after emission, I think we're considering the process as NN → NN' + X. Or maybe the X is the emitted particle, and the NN system changes. Hmm, perhaps I should model this as NN emitting X, so the initial state is NN in 1S0, and the final state includes another NN state and X.

But for the problem, the question is about the NN's quantum numbers in the final state, so their T, S, L, and the emitted particle's l and spin.

Wait, the problem says "the final NN state has T=0." So before emission, the initial state is 1S0, which is for the NN system. After emitting X, the NN system is in a state with T=0. So I need to find the allowed transitions.

And the condition is that T = S + L +1 mod 2. T is 0, so S + L +1 ≡ 0 mod 2 → S + L ≡1 mod 2. So S and L must sum to an odd number.

Each option gives a transition from 1S0 to another state plus a particle. So for each option, I need to look at the final NN state's S, L, and the emitted particle's l.

Wait, but the NN state in the final state: each option shows that. For instance, option A is 7D1. So the final NN state has, for 7D1: the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). Wait, but wait, 7D1: 7 is 2S+1 → 2S+1=7 → S=3. And D means L=2. So S=3, L=2. Then S + L =3+2=5, which is odd. So that's allowed because 5 mod 2 is 1, which fits the condition (since 0 ≡ 3+2 +1 mod 2 → 3+2=5, 5+1=6 → 6 mod 2=0. So yes, that works. So T=0, S=3, L=2, so T =3+2 +1 mod 2 → 6 mod2=0. So that's allowed.

Wait, but the condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So T=0, so 0 = (S + L +1) mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. So for each option, calculate S + L for the final NN state and see if it's 1 mod 2. If it's not, that option isn't allowed.

But wait, what about angular momentum conservation? Because the initial state has J_initial =0 (since L=0 and S=0, so J=0). The process is NN → NN' + X. The total angular momentum must be conserved.

So, the initial angular momentum is J_initial =0. The final state's angular momentum J_final is the sum of the angular momentum of the NN' state and the X particle. But since they are emitted, the total J_final must be equal to J_initial, which is 0.

Wait, but the problem says to use conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So parity must also be conserved.

The initial state's parity is determined by the NN state. For a state with orbital angular momentum L, the parity is (-1)^L. The initial state is 1S0, so L=0. So parity P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1.

The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So, the parity of the final state (NN' + X) must be equal to the initial parity.

The parity of the NN' state is (-1)^L', where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' state in the final state. The parity of X is given as -1.

So the total parity P_final = P_NN' * P_X. So P_final = (-1)^L' * (-1) = (-1)^(L' +1) 

This must equal the initial parity, which is +1.

So,

(-1)^(L' +1) = (+1) → 

Which implies that L' +1 is even → L' must be odd.

So L' must be odd. Because if L' is even, L' +1 is odd → (-1)^(odd) = -1, which won't match initial parity. So L' must be odd.

So, the orbital angular momentum L' of the final NN' state must be odd.

So let's go through each option.

Each option is of the form initial state → final state + particle. The particle's angular momentum quantum number is given as a letter (like p, s, etc.), which corresponds to l.

Wait, no—the particle's angular momentum is its orbital angular momentum. Because in the term symbol, the particle's orbital angular momentum would contribute to the total angular momentum. But in the options, the particle's state is given as a lowercase letter, which is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. Like, for example, p is l=1.

So for each option, the final NN state is given, and the emitted X has a certain l (from the letter). So when considering angular momentum conservation, the total angular momentum in the final state must be 0.

Let me start by analyzing each option.

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p

The initial state is 1S0 → S=0, L=0, J=0.

The final NN state is 7D1. So the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). For 7D1, 2S+1=7 → S=3. L is D →2. So S=3, L=2.

So J_NN' is the total angular momentum of the NN' state. It's given as 1. Because the term is 7D1, so J=1.

The emitted particle X has l=p → l=1 (since p is l=1).

So the total angular momentum of the final state is the vector sum of J_NN' (1) and l_X (1). But since angular momentum is a vector, the total J_final can be 0,1, or 2, depending on their relative orientations. But the initial J is 0, so the final J must be 0 as well. So the sum of J_NN' and l_X must result in a total angular momentum of 0.

Wait, but J_NN' is 1 and l_X is 1. The possible total J is |1-1| to 1+1 → 0,1,2. So for the total J to be 0, the individual angular momenta must be aligned opposite, resulting in cancellation. So it's possible only if J_NN' and l_X are opposite in direction and their magnitudes match to sum to zero. But how do their quantum numbers relate? Because the condition for total J=0 is that J_NN' and l_X must combine to zero. But combining two spin-1 particles (since l=1 is spin-1? Wait, no, wait. X is a boson or fermion? Well, regardless, for angular momentum addition, the possible total J would be |1-1| to 1+1.

Wait, but in this problem, I'm probably supposed to consider the conservation of angular momentum in terms of quantum numbers, not their vector sums. Because when considering allowed transitions, you look at whether the total angular momentum quantum numbers can add up. But wait, because the initial state has J=0, the final must have total J=0.

So in the final state, the NN' has J=1, and X has l=1, so the sum of their J and l must be zero. But wait, J is the total angular momentum of the NN' system, and X's orbital angular momentum is l.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's think in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The total angular momentum is the sum of the NN' and X's angular momenta. But since the initial state has J=0, the sum must be zero. So, the possible J for the final state is |J_NN' - l_X| ≤ J_final ≤ J_NN' + l_X. But the only way J_final can be zero is if J_NN' and l_X are such that their vector sum is zero. But in terms of quantum numbers, this requires that J_NN' = l_X, and they are opposite in direction. But in angular momentum addition, the sum can be zero only if J_NN' = l_X, and their sum is zero. So for the case where J_NN' = l_X and they are in opposite directions.

But in any case, the possible J_final is 0 only if the angular momenta can combine that way.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to consider that the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l. So the total angular momentum of the system (NN' + X) must be zero. So the sum of the angular momentum of the NN' system and the X's orbital angular momentum must be zero. So, the NN' has J, and X has l. So J_NN' and l must be such that their vector sum is zero, meaning that J_NN' = l and their directions are opposite. But in quantum mechanics, this is only possible if the total angular momentum is zero, which requires that the individual angular momenta are equal and opposite, but in terms of quantum numbers, the only way is if J_NN' and l are such that their possible sum includes zero. But this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the conservation of angular momentum in terms of quantum numbers. The initial state has J=0. The final state's J must be 0. So the sum of the angular momenta of the NN' and X must equal zero. But the way to approach this is to consider that the total angular momentum is the sum of the NN' and X's orbital angular momenta. But wait, the X's orbital angular momentum is part of the total angular momentum. So, the total J_final is J_NN' + l_X. But since J_initial is zero, the only way is if J_NN' + l_X = 0. But this isn't possible because angular momenta are non-negative, and J_NN' and l_X can't be negative. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible angular momentum states. The initial state has J=0. The final state must have total J=0. The NN' has J_NN' and the X has l_X (which is its orbital angular momentum). So the total angular momentum is the vector sum of these two.

But since the initial J is zero, the only way the final J can be zero is if J_NN' and l_X are such that they can combine to zero. The possible cases are when J_NN' = l_X and their spins are in opposite directions. But in terms of quantum numbers, this would require that the total angular momentum is zero. So J_NN' and l must be compatible. So for example, if J_NN' is 1 and l_X is 1, their sum can be 0, 1, or 2. So it's possible to have a state where J=0.

So in option A, J_NN' is 1 and l_X is 1. So the sum can be 0, so it's allowed.

But wait, the problem is about whether the partial wave is permitted. The partial wave is characterized by the orbital angular momentum of X, which is the l value.

So for each option, I need to check two things:

1. The parity condition: L' (from the final NN state) must be odd, since L' +1 must be even (as P_final = (-1)^(L' +1) must equal +1).

2. The angular momentum conservation: J_initial = 0 must equal the total J_final. The total J_final is the sum of the NN' J and the X's l. But wait, J is the total angular momentum of the NN' system, and X's orbital angular momentum is l. So the sum (vector sum) must be zero. But how to check that the sum can be zero?

Wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the NN' has angular momentum J. So the sum J_NN' + l_X must be zero. But that's only possible if J_NN' = l_X and the directions are opposite. But quantum mechanically, the sum of two angular momenta can result in a total J of zero only if the individual J's can combine to zero. So, J_NN' and l_X must satisfy that their sum can be zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the sum of the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system and the orbital angular momentum of X must be zero. Because in the initial state, the orbital angular momentum is zero, so the sum of the final orbital angular momenta must be zero.

Wait, no, because the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, but when the system emits a particle, the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system plus the orbital angular momentum of X must sum to zero. Because orbital angular momentum is conserved in the absence of external fields.

Wait, that's probably the right way to think about it. So the total orbital angular momentum (L) is conserved. The initial orbital angular momentum is zero (from 1S0). So the final orbital angular momentum is the sum of the NN' orbital angular momentum (L') and X's orbital angular momentum (l_X) → L' + l_X must be zero.

Wait, but the problem is that the orbital angular momenta are vectors. So their vector sum must be zero. So L' and l_X must be such that their vector sum is zero.

But for that, the magnitudes must be equal and opposite. So |L' - l_X| ≤ 0 ≤ L' + l_X.

Wait, but the only way for their vector sum to be zero is if L' = l_X and they are opposite in direction. But in quantum terms, the orbital angular momenta are quantized in magnitude, so the only way their sum can be zero is if L' = l_X, and they're in opposite directions.

But since L' and l are quantum numbers, their magnitudes are integers, so L' must equal l_X.

So for each option, L' must equal l_X. Because only then can their sum be zero.

Wait, but in the options, the final NN state has certain L' and the X has a certain l.

So for each option, check if L' = l_X. If not, then angular momentum isn't conserved, and that partial wave is not allowed.

Let's check each option.

Option A: 7D1 + p.

NN' state: 7D1 → L'=2 (since D is L=2). X has l_X = 1 (p → l=1). So L'=2, l_X=1. 2≠1 → can't sum to zero. So this would not conserve angular momentum. So this transition is not allowed. So option A is not permitted.

Wait, but I thought earlier that parity might allow it. Hmm, but if the angular momentum condition isn't met, then it's forbidden. So perhaps option A is not permitted.

But let me check the other options.

Option B: 3S1 + p.

NN' state: 3S1. So S=1 (from 2S+1=3 → S=1), L' is S → L'=0. So L'=0.

X has l_X =1 (p).

So L' =0, l_X=1 → sum is 1, which isn't zero. So this violates angular momentum conservation. So option B is not allowed.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the parity condition requires L' to be odd. So let's check each option's parity condition.

The parity condition is that L' must be odd.

Option A: L'=2 → even. So this would violate the parity condition. So option A is forbidden.

Option B: L'=0 → even. So this is also forbidden.

Option C: 3D3 + f.

NN' state: 3D3 → so 2S+1=3 → S=1. L' is D → 2. J=3.

X has l_X = f → l=3.

So L'=2, l_X=3. Sum is 5. So unless 2 and 3 can combine to zero (which they can't, as 2+3=5), this is not allowed. Also, the parity condition: L' =2 (even) → which violates the parity requirement (L' must be odd). So option C is forbidden.

Option D: 3P0 + s.

NN' state: 3P0. So 2S+1=3 → S=1. L' is P → 1. J=0.

X has l_X = s → l=0 (since s is l=0).

So L'=1, l_X=0. Sum is 1, which doesn't equal zero. But wait, initial L was zero, so sum must be zero. So L' + l_X must be zero. But 1+0=1≠0 → violates angular momentum. So option D is forbidden.

Wait, but let me recheck.

Wait, for angular momentum conservation, the sum of L' and l_X must be zero. So L' must equal l_X, because their sum is zero only if they are equal and opposite. So L' must equal l_X.

So let's reevaluate each option.

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → 2≠1 → no.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 → 0≠1 → no.

Option C: L'=2, l_X=3 → 2≠3 → no.

Option D: L'=1, l_X=0 → 1≠0 → no.

Wait, but that's a problem because none of the options meet L' = l_X except maybe if I'm miscounting.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-express the problem.

The initial state is NN in 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0.

They emit X, so the final state is NN' (new state) plus X.

The total angular momentum must be conserved, so J_initial = J_final. But J_initial is 0, so J_final must be 0.

The total J_final is the sum of the NN' state's J and X's l. So the sum of their angular momenta must be zero.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the X's orbital angular momentum is part of the total angular momentum. So the sum of the NN' and X's orbital angular momenta must be zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system plus the orbital angular momentum of X must sum to zero because the initial orbital angular momentum is zero.

So L_NN' + l_X = 0.

Which implies that L_NN' must equal l_X, and their directions are opposite. But since their magnitudes are integers, L_NN' must equal l_X.

So in each option, we can check if L' from the NN' state equals l_X.

Option A: L' =2, l_X=1 → 2≠1 → No.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 → 0≠1 → No.

Option C: L'=2, l_X=3 → 2≠3 → No.

Option D: L'=1, l_X=0 → 1≠0 → No.

Wait, that can't be right because all options are being rejected, but the problem states only one is not permitted. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum L' of the NN' state plus the orbital angular momentum l_X of the emitted particle must sum to the initial orbital angular momentum, which is zero. So L_NN' + l_X must be zero, but as vectors, their magnitudes can add or subtract. So the sum's magnitude can be |L_NN' - l_X| up to L_NN' + l_X. But the only way the sum can be zero is if L_NN' = l_X and they are in opposite directions. So L_NN' must equal l_X.

Therefore, the only allowed transitions are those where L_NN' = l_X.

So checking each option:

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → 2≠1 → Not allowed.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 → 0≠1 → Not allowed.

Option C: L'=2, l_X=3 → 2≠3 → Not allowed.

Option D: L'=1, l_X=0 → 1≠0 → Not allowed.

Wait, but all options are not allowed, which can't be the case. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing orbital angular momentum and spin. The X's orbital angular momentum is l, and the NN' state's orbital angular momentum is L'. The sum of these must be zero.

So L' = l_X.

So in that case:

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → 2≠1 → No.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 → 0≠1 → No.

Option C: L'=2, l_X=3 → 2≠3 → No.

Option D: L'=1, l_X=0 → 1≠0 → No.

So according to this, all options are not allowed. But that can't be right because the question says one is not permitted.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching the angular momentum part wrong. Maybe the way to think about it is that the total angular momentum of the system (NN' + X) must be zero. So the vector sum of the NN' state's J and the X's orbital angular momentum l must be zero. So J_NN' and l_X must combine to zero.

But J_NN' is the total angular momentum of the NN' system, which includes their spin and orbital angular momentum. Wait, but in the options, the term symbol for the NN' state gives L and S, and J is given as well.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is to consider that the initial state has J=0. The final state's J must be 0, which is the sum of the NN' J and the X's orbital angular momentum.

Wait, but the X's orbital angular momentum is part of the final state's angular momentum, so the sum of the NN' J and the X's l must be zero.

So, the only way J_NN' and l_X can sum to zero is if J_NN' = l_X and the spins are opposite. So J_NN' must equal l_X.

Looking at each option:

Option A: J_NN'=1, l_X=1 → 1=1 → allowed.

Option B: J_NN'=1, l_X=1 → allowed.

Option C: J_NN'=3, l_X=3 → allowed.

Option D: J_NN'=0, l_X=0 → allowed.

Wait, but the problem says which partial wave is NOT permitted. So options where J_NN' != l_X would be forbidden.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: J_NN'=1, l_X=1 → allowed.

Option B: J_NN'=1, l_X=1 → allowed.

Option C: J_NN'=3, l_X=3 → allowed.

Option D: J_NN'=0, l_X=0 → allowed.

Wait, but all options have J_NN' equal to l_X. So none are forbidden. But the problem states one is not permitted. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, I think I've mixed up J and l. The X's orbital angular momentum is l, but the NN' state's J includes both its spin and orbital angular momentum. So perhaps the correct condition is that the sum of the NN' orbital angular momentum (L') and the X's l must be zero. Because orbital angular momentum is conserved (as per the absence of external fields), so L' + l_X = initial L, which is zero.

So L' + l_X must be zero → L' = -l_X. But since L' and l_X are magnitudes, this implies that L' = l_X, and the direction is opposite. So L' must equal l_X, but that's impossible because angular momentum magnitudes are non-negative. So the only way is that L' = l_X =0.

Wait, that would mean that only option D (L'=1, l_X=0) doesn't satisfy L'=l_X, but option D has L'=1, l_X=0 → sum is 1 → not zero. So option D is not allowed.

But wait, let's reevaluate. The initial orbital angular momentum is zero. So the sum of L' (NN' state's orbital angular momentum) and l_X (X's orbital angular momentum) must be zero. So L' + l_X must be zero. But since these are vectors, the only way their sum is zero is if L' = l_X and their directions are opposite. But in terms of quantum numbers, this would require that L' = l_X. Because you can't have negative angular momentum, so L' must equal l_X and the direction is opposite. But how can you have that? It's only possible if both are zero, because any other L' and l_X would require opposite vectors, but their magnitudes must be equal.

So the only possible way is L' = l_X =0. So the only allowed transition is when L' =0 and l_X=0.

Looking at the options:

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → sum=3 → not zero → not allowed.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 → sum=1 → not allowed.

Option C: L'=2, l_X=3 → sum=5 → not allowed.

Option D: L'=1, l_X=0 → sum=1 → not allowed.

Wait, but that's the same conclusion as before, that none are allowed. But this can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that orbital angular momentum is conserved. Wait, when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum is conserved between the initial and final states. So the initial orbital angular momentum (L_initial) is zero. The final orbital angular momentum is L_final = L_NN' + l_X. So L_final must equal L_initial, which is zero. So L_NN' + l_X must be zero. But since these are magnitudes, L_NN' and l_X must be zero. So the only allowed option is when L_NN' =0 and l_X=0.

Looking at each option:

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → sum =3 → not zero.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 → sum=1 → not zero.

Option C: L'=2, l_X=3 → sum=5 → not zero.

Option D: L'=1, l_X=0 → sum=1 → not zero.

So none of the options satisfy L_NN' + l_X =0. But that can't be the case because the problem gives four options.

I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternative approach: the parity condition.

The parity of the initial state is +1 (since L=0 → (-1)^0=1).

The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of X.

Parity of NN' is (-1)^L' and X's parity is given as -1.

So P_final = (-1)^L' * (-1) = (-1)^(L' +1).

But P_final must equal the initial parity, which is +1.

So:

(-1)^(L' +1) = 1 → L' +1 must be even → L' must be odd.

So L' must be odd.

Now, checking each option's L':

Option A: 7D1 → L'=2 → even → violates parity condition.

So option A is not allowed.

Option B: 3S1 → L'=0 → even → violates parity → not allowed.

Option C:3D3 → L'=2 → even → violates parity → not allowed.

Option D:3P0 → L'=1 → odd → satisfies parity.

So only option D satisfies the parity condition. So the other options are forbidden because they don't satisfy parity.

Wait, but the question is about which partial wave (emission of X) is not permitted. So if options A, B, and C have L' even, they don't meet the parity condition, so their partial waves are forbidden.

But the question is asking which is not permitted. So among the options, which one doesn't meet either parity or angular momentum condition.

Wait, but the problem also involves Pauli statistics, which gave the condition T= S + L +1 mod2.

In the final NN state (T=0), S + L must be 1 mod2.

So for each option, we have to calculate S' (from the final NN state) and L', then check if S' + L' is odd.

Let me recheck each option, considering both the parity and the condition from Pauli.

Option A: 7D1 → S' =3, L'=2 → S + L =5 → odd → allowed (as per Pauli condition). But parity condition: L' is even → not allowed. So option A is forbidden.

Option B:3S1 → S'=1, L'=0 → S + L=1 → odd → allowed (Pauli). But parity condition: L' even → forbidden.

Option C:3D3 → S'=1, L'=2 → S + L=3 → odd → allowed (Pauli). But parity condition: L' even → forbidden.

Option D:3P0 → S'=1, L'=1 → S + L=2 → even → violates Pauli condition, which requires S+L to be odd. So option D is forbidden.

Wait, so for option D, S'=1, L'=1 → sum is 2, which is even. So the condition T = S + L +1 mod2 → 1 +1 +1 =3 → mod2=1 → T would be 1. But the question states T=0. So option D's final state would have T=1, which violates the condition.

So option D is not allowed because it violates the Pauli condition.

Wait, but earlier I thought option D's parity was allowed because L'=1 (odd), but the Pauli condition is not met. So option D is forbidden for two reasons.

So now, looking back at the options, which one is not permitted.

The problem is to find which partial wave is not permitted. So let's check each option against both conditions.

Option A:

- Parity: L' =2 (even) → P_final = (-1)^(2+1) =-1 → doesn't match initial +1. So parity condition not met.

- Pauli condition: S' =3, L'=2 → 3+2 =5 (odd) → OK.

So overall, parity condition not met → forbidden.

Option B:

- Parity: L'=0 (even) → P_final = (-1)^(0+1) =-1 → doesn't match. Forbidden.

- Pauli condition: S'=1, L'=0 → sum 1 (odd) → OK.

Option C:

- Parity: L'=2 (even) → P_final =-1 → forbidden.

- Pauli condition: S'=1, L'=2 → sum 3 (odd) → OK.

Option D:

- Parity: L'=1 (odd) → P_final = (-1)^(1+1) =1 → matches initial parity. OK.

- Pauli condition: S'=1, L'=1 → sum 2 (even) → T= (1+1)+1 mod2 → 3 mod2=1 → which doesn't match T=0. So violates Pauli condition → forbidden.

So among the options, only option D satisfies the parity condition but violates the Pauli condition. The others violate parity.

So the question is which partial wave is not permitted. The options that are forbidden are A, B, C, and D.

Wait, but the question says only one is not permitted. So perhaps the correct approach is to find which option is forbidden for both angular momentum and parity, or just one.

Wait, the problem also involves angular momentum conservation. So each option must satisfy:

1. The sum of the angular momenta (J_NN' and l_X) can be zero.

2. The parity condition is met.

3. The Pauli condition (S' + L' is odd) is met.

So let's reevaluate each option.

Option A: 7D1 + p.

- S' =3, L'=2 → S + L=5 → odd → Pauli condition met.

- L'=2 (even) → parity condition not met. So forbidden.

Option B:3S1 + p.

- S'=1, L'=0 → sum 1 → Pauli condition met.

- L'=0 (even) → parity not met. Forbbiden.

Option C:3D3 + f.

- S'=1, L'=2 → sum 3 → Pauli condition met.

- L'=2 (even) → parity not met. Forbidden.

Option D:3P0 + s.

- S'=1, L'=1 → sum 2 → even → Pauli condition not met. Forbidden.

- L'=1 (odd) → parity condition met.

- Angular momentum: J_NN' =0, l_X=0 → sum is 0 → allowed.

So option D meets the parity condition but violates the Pauli condition. So it's forbidden.

So the only options that meet all conditions are none. But the problem says which is not permitted. So perhaps the correct approach is to focus on angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system plus the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle must equal the initial orbital angular momentum, which is zero. So L_NN' + l_X =0 → L_NN' = l_X.

So in each option, check if L_NN' = l_X.

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → 2≠1 → no.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 → 0≠1 → no.

Option C: L'=2, l_X=3 → 2≠3 → no.

Option D: L'=1, l_X=0 → 1≠0 → no.

So none of the options meet this condition. But that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to approach it step by step.

The initial state is 1S0 → S=0, L=0, J=0.

The final state is NN' in a state with T=0. So the Pauli condition is S' + L' must be odd (since T=0 → S' + L' +1 ≡0 mod2 → S' + L' ≡1 mod2).

The emitted particle X has l, and parity -1.

Parity condition: (-1)^(L') * (-1) = +1 → (-1)^(L' +1) =1 → L' +1 even → L' odd.

So L' must be odd.

So the possible L' values are 1,3,5,...

So let's see which options have L' odd.

Option A: L'=2 → even → no.

Option B: L'=0 → even → no.

Option C:L'=2→ even → no.

Option D:L'=1 → odd → yes.

So only option D meets the parity condition.

Now, check if option D meets the Pauli condition.

In option D, the final NN' state is 3P0.

So S' =1 (since 3=2S+1 → S=1), L'=1.

So S' + L' =2 → even → which violates the condition because it needs to be odd. So option D violates the Pauli condition.

So option D is forbidden.

Now, regarding angular momentum: the sum of J_NN' and l_X must be zero.

Option D: J_NN' =0, l_X=0 → sum is 0 → allowed.

So option D meets the parity condition but violates Pauli.

So among the options, only option D meets parity but violates Pauli.

Other options:

Option A: violates parity → forbidden.

Option B: violates parity → forbidden.

Option C: violates parity → forbidden.

Option D: violates Pauli → forbidden.

So all options are forbidden except perhaps none. But the question says which is not permitted. So perhaps the correct forbidden option is option D.

Wait, but the question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer is option D.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Pauli Statistics Condition**: For the final NN state with \( T = 0 \), the condition \( T = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) must hold. This implies \( S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), meaning \( S + L \) must be odd.

2. **Parity Conservation**: The initial state has parity \( +1 \) (since \( L = 0 \) for \( 1S_0 \)). The final state's parity is the product of the parity of the NN' state (\( (-1)^{L'} \)) and the parity of the emitted particle \( X \) (intrinsic parity \( -1 \)). Thus, \( P_{\text{final}} = (-1)^{L'} \cdot (-1) = (-1)^{L' + 1} \). For parity conservation, \( P_{\text{final}} = P_{\text{initial}} = +1 \), which requires \( L' + 1 \) to be even. Hence, \( L' \) must be odd.

3. **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The initial state has \( J = 0 \). The final state's total angular momentum \( J_{\text{final}} \) must also be \( 0 \). The total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN' state's \( J_{\text{NN'}} \) and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum \( l_X \). This implies \( J_{\text{NN'}} + l_X = 0 \), meaning \( J_{\text{NN'}} = l_X \).

#### **Option B: \( 1S_0 \to 3S_1 + p \)**

#### **Option D: \( 1S_0 \to 3P_0 + s \)**
- **Final NN' State**: \( 3P_0 \) implies \( S' = 1 \) (from \( 2S + 1 = 3 \)) and \( L' = 1 \) (from \( P \)).
- **Pauli Condition**: \( S' + L' = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is even. Condition violated.
- **Parity Condition**: \( L' = 1 \), which is odd. Parity condition satisfied.
- **Angular Momentum Conservation**: \( J_{\text{NN'}} = 0 \) (from \( 3P_0 \)) and \( l_X = 0 \) (from \( s \)). \( J_{\text{NN'}} = l_X \), so angular momentum is conserved.
- **Conclusion**: Forbidden due to Pauli condition violation.
