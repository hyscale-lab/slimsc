Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question involves two reactions, each starting with different compounds, and then combining the products. After that, the combined products are run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is asking how many peaks each will show.

Let's break down each reaction.

First, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So the starting material is a ketone, right? The structure is hexan-3-one with a methoxy group on carbon 5. So the structure is CH2CH2-C-O-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So position 3 is the carbonyl. And at position 5, there's a methoxy group. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-OCH3 at position 5? No, wait, the numbering. Let me think: hexan-3-one is like:

CH2CH2-C-O-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me think again. Hexane has six carbons. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH2
Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, no, wait. No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the molecule is CH2CH2-CO-(CH2)3CH3? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me number the carbons:

1: CH3-
2: CH2-
3: C=O
4: CH2-
5: CH2-
6: CH3.

Wait, that's not possible because that would give a 6-carbon chain with the ketone at C3. Wait, perhaps the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, the methoxy is on carbon 5. So the structure is:

Positions 1 to 6:

1: CH3-
2: CH2-
3: C=O
4: CH2-
5: OCH3 (because it's 5-methoxy)
6: CH2CH3? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula is hexan-3-one, so the carbonyl is on C3. The 5th carbon has a methoxy group. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-O-CH3, but that's not correct because after C3, it's C4, C5, and C6. So from C3, which is the carbonyl, C4 is CH2, C5 is OCH3, and C6 is CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let's think of the structure as:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH2CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm complicating.

Wait, perhaps it's (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-OCH3 attached where? Let me perhaps write the structure as:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3, but that would be five carbons. Wait, no, hexan-3-one is six carbons with the ketone on C3. So:

Positions:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH2-OCH3
6: CH3.

Wait, that's possible. So the structure is:

CH2CH2(CO)CH2-OCH2CH3? No, wait. Let me count again. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. So in that case, C3 is the carbonyl. The 5th carbon (C5) would be the next one after C4, which is the CH2 after C3. So if the 5th carbon has a methoxy group, it would be OCH3 attached to C5.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3. No, wait, that would be seven carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed without it.

Anyway, the key point is that (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, and it's a strong enough base to deprotonate things, but in this case, after workup, it's acidic, so the alcohol gets protonated.

So Reaction I: the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. The configuration of the starting material is S, and since LAH is a strong reducing agent, it would proceed with some stereochemistry. Wait, LAH reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, and the stereochemistry depends on the mechanism. LAH is a strong hydride donor, and it's a two-step process: the hydride attack is from the less hindered side since the mechanism is a conjugate addition for ketones. Wait, no, LAH typically reduces ketones via a single-step, but in any case, the starting material is (S) configuration, so after reduction, how does that affect the product?

Wait, the starting material has a chiral center at C5 (since it's 5-methoxyhexan-3-one). Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, hexan-3-one has the carbonyl at C3. So the substituents around C5 are:

Wait, maybe I should consider the structure more carefully. Let me imagine the structure.

Hexan-3-one: CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. So the carbonyl is at position 3, with two CH2 groups on either side. But wait, in the starting material, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one: so the structure is CH2CH2C(O)CH2OCH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better written as:

Position 1: CH3
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: C=O
Position 4: CH2
Position 5: OCH3
Position 6: CH2CH3? No, wait, that can't be, because that would make it a seven-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(CH2)2CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-OCH2CH2CH3? No, that would be an ester, but it's a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

The compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the six-carbon chain has a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5.

So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3. Wait, that's five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let's think again. Hexan-3-one is six carbons with ketone at C3. So:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH2
6: CH3.

Wait, but then where's the methoxy? Oh, wait, the 5-methoxy would be on C5. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3. So it's CH3CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3. Wait, that would be four carbons, but hexan-3-one is six. I'm getting confused, perhaps. Maybe I should accept that I can't get the structure right without a diagram, but the key point is that it's a ketone, and when treated with LAH, it will be reduced to a secondary alcohol.

So Reaction I: the ketone becomes an alcohol. The starting material is (S) configuration. But how does that affect the product? When LAH reduces a ketone, it adds a hydride to the carbonyl carbon, which is planar, so the configuration of the starting molecule might not directly translate. Wait, no, the starting material's configuration is at a different carbonâ€”probably C5 has a chiral center.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the configuration is at C5. So when the ketone (C3) is reduced to an alcohol, where is the new chiral center?

Wait, the ketone is at C3, which is the carbonyl. When reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol, so the OH is on C3. So the product of Reaction I is 3-hexanol derivative with a methoxy group on C5 and an alcohol on C3.

But wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. So when that's reduced, the product would have the same configuration at C5 but an additional OH on C3.

Wait, no, the reduction of the ketone occurs at C3, so the configuration at C5 doesn't affect that. Wait, no: the configuration at C5 is part of the molecule, but the hydride attack on the ketone (C3) would be influenced by the existing groups.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is such that when the ketone is reduced, the OH adds from a specific face, leading to a certain configuration. But in any case, the product would have a new chiral center at C3.

Wait, because the starting ketone is at C3, which is adjacent to C4 and C2. So when it's reduced, the OH is added to C3, making it a chiral center if it wasn't before.

Wait, no, because the starting ketone at C3: if C3 has two identical substituents, reducing it won't create a chiral center. Wait, the starting ketone is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, I think the structure is:

Positions 1 to 6:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: OCH3
6: CH2CH3?

Wait, that can't be, because that would make it seven carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to proceed without the exact structure.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one becomes 3-hexanol derivative, with a methoxy group on C5. The reduction would create a secondary alcohol at C3, and since the starting material had a chiral center at C5, the product will have two chiral centers: C3 (new) and C5 (existing).

Wait, but when you reduce a ketone with LAH, the hydride attack is typically from the less hindered side. So the configuration of the new OH would depend on the structure.

But perhaps in this case, the new OH will be on the same side as the existing groups. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction doesn't affect the existing stereochemistry at C5; it just adds a new OH at C3.

Wait, but the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. So C5 has four different groups: the methoxy, two CH2 groups, and perhaps the C4 and C6. Wait, no. Let me think: in (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the C5 is attached to OCH3, and to C4 and C6. What else? So C3 is a carbonyl, so C4 is attached to C3 (CO) and C5. So C5 is attached to C4 (which is CH2), CO (but wait, C3 is a carbonyl, so C4 is CH2 connected to C3. C5 is attached to C4, OCH3, and perhaps C6.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's (S)-configuration at C5, which is attached to:

- a CH2 group (from C4)
- a OCH3 group
- a CH2 group (from C6)
- and the C3, which is the carbonyl.

Wait, that's four different groups, making C5 a chiral center. So when the ketone is reduced, the new OH is on C3. So the product will have OH on C3, and the existing configuration at C5.

So the product is (S)-something at C5 and R or S at C3, depending on the reduction.

Wait, but the reduction of the ketone to secondary alcohol would create a new chiral center if the carbonyl carbon wasn't already chiral. Since the starting ketone is at C3, which is connected to C2 and C4. If C3 has two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4), then reducing it would create a chiral center if those two groups are different. Wait, in 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps it's better to think that C3 is connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), and two other groups. Wait, no, a ketone is R2C=O. So in hexan-3-one, the ketone is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, hexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. So C3 is connected to two CH2 groups (C2 and C4), and the carbonyl. So when you reduce that, the C3 becomes a CHOH group, which would have two CH2 groups, but wait, no, the C3 would be connected to:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH2 (from C4)
- OH
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no. When you reduce a ketone (R2CO) to an alcohol (R2CHOH), the carbon becomes R2CHOH. So for hexan-3-one, the structure after reduction would be (CH2CH2)CH(OH)(CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, but that would make C3 connected to two CH2 groups, which are the same. So in this case, the product would have a new chiral center at C3 only if the two substituents are different. But if C3 was symmetric (same groups on both sides), then the reduction would not create a chiral center.

Wait, wait, the starting ketone is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the C5 is a chiral center because it's attached to OCH3, and three other groups. But the C3 is the carbonyl carbon, which in the starting material is not a chiral center because it's connected to two CH2 groups (assuming). So when reduced, the C3 would have four substituents: two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4), an OH, and a hydrogen. Wait, no, no. The reduction of a ketone R2CO to R2CH(OH)R' (if R and R' are different). Wait, in hexan-3-one, the structure is:

(CH2)2-CO-(CH2)3CH3. So when reduced, it becomes (CH2)2-CHOH-(CH2)3CH3. Does that create a chiral center? Because the substituents on C3 would be:

- CH2CH3 (from C2)
- CH2CH2CH3 (from C4)
Wait, no, C3 is connected to C2 (which is CH2CH3?), no, wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

Positions:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH2-OCH3
6: CH3.

Wait, maybe that's how the starting material looks. So the structure is CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? No, that can't be. I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I should proceed.

Assuming that after reduction, the product has a new chiral center at C3 (because it's attached to two different groups: one from C2, one from C4, plus OH and H). Alternatively, perhaps it's not a chiral center because the substituents are the same. Wait, if C3 is connected to two identical groups (like two CH2's), then adding OH and H would not create a chiral center. So perhaps the product of Reaction I is not a chiral molecule. Or maybe it is.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has two chiral centers: the original at C5 and the new at C3.

But I'm not entirely sure, so perhaps I should move on and come back if I need to.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup. Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3CO)2CH2, which is a diketone. NaBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both ketones. So each ketone group would be reduced to an alcohol.

Wait, but NaBH4 typically doesn't reduce diketones in certain conditions. Wait, no, NaBH4 can reduce ketones. But in the case of pentane-2,4-dione, where the two carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons, reducing with NaBH4 would give a diol.

Wait, but wait: when you have a 2,4-dione, like CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3, and you reduce it with NaBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, but it's a milder agent than LAH. Wait, no, NaBH4 can reduce ketones but not esters or amides. So in this case, each ketone would be reduced to a secondary alcohol.

So the product would be HOCH2CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)CO(CH2)COCH3. So the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So reducing each ketone would give CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So that's a vicinal diol, but wait, each carbonyl is on C2 and C4. So after reduction, it would be HOCH2-CHOH-(CH2)CH3? No, perhaps I should write it as:

Original: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

After reduction, each C=O becomes CH(OH). So the product is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So each of the two ketones becomes an alcohol.

So the product of Reaction II is a 2,4-pentanediol. But wait, pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups, so each is reduced to a secondary alcohol. So the product would have two OH groups on adjacent carbons: C2 and C4. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

But wait, wait a minute. Pentane is five carbons. So positions 1 to 5:

1: CH3
2: C=O
3: CH2
4: C=O
5: CH3.

So when reduced, each C=O becomes CH(OH), so the product is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, but this molecule has two OH groups on C2 and C4. So the molecule is HOCH2-CH(OH)CH2-CH2CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is HOCH2-CHOH-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, positions 2 and 4 have OH groups. Now, this molecule has two chiral centers: positions 2 and 4. Each of these would have four different substituents.

Wait, position 2: attached to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), OH, and perhaps a hydrogen? Or no, wait, each OH is on a secondary carbon, so attached to two CH groups.

Wait, no. Let me think: each OH is on C2 and C4.

At C2:

- attached to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), an OH, and another CH group.

Wait, maybe it's better to think that each C2 and C4 have four different groups. For C2: groups are CH3 (from C1), CH2 (from C3), OH, and a hydrogen (from the C2 itself). Hmm, but that would make it a chiral center. Similarly for C4: groups would be CH2 (from C3), CH3 (from C5), OH, and a hydrogen.

Wait, but wait. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. So in the case of C2 in the product:

- Group 1: CH3 (from C1)
- Group 2: CH2 (from C3)
- Group 3: OH
- Group 4: H (since the carbon is CH(OH)).

So yes, four different groups, making it a chiral center. Similarly for C4.

So the product of Reaction II is a vicinal diol with two chiral centers, both in the same configuration? Or are they different?

Wait, the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, which is symmetrical. So when you reduce it, the two OH groups may have the same configuration.

Wait, because the starting material is symmetrical, the reduction would lead to the same configuration on both C2 and C4.

Wait, no. Let me think about the mechanism. When NaBH4 reduces a ketone, it adds a hydride from the same face (since it's a planar carbonyl). So if the starting material is symmetrical, the two OH groups would be added in the same configuration, leading to both being R or both S, or perhaps opposite.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is symmetrical, so C2 and C4 are mirror images. So when the two ketones are reduced, they would form mirror image diastereomers or maybe the same.

Wait, actually, no. Because when the starting material is symmetrical, the product would also be symmetrical, leading to a meso compound. So both C2 and C4 have the same configuration, but because of the symmetry, the molecule as a whole is achiral.

Wait, let me think. The product is HOCH2-CHOH-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait, perhaps it's:

HOCH2-CH2-CHOH-CH2CH3. No, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, the product is (R,R) or (S,S) configuration at C2 and C4, but considering symmetry, perhaps it's a meso compound.

Wait, no, if the molecule is symmetrical, then the configurations would be opposite, leading to a meso form, which is achiral. Let me think about the structure again.

The structure after reduction is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So the molecule is symmetric with respect to the central CH2 group.

So C2 and C4 are mirror images. If the OH groups are in the same configuration (both R or both S), then the molecule would be meso, making it achiral. Because the molecule has a plane of symmetry, leading to a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps it's a meso compound because of the symmetry. So the product is (R,S) or (S,R), but due to the plane of symmetry, it's a meso form, making the molecule achiral.

Wait, let me think of tartaric acid as an example. It's a meso compound when both stereocenters are opposite. So in our case, if the two OH groups are on the same side (both R or both S), then the molecule is chiral, but if they are on opposite sides, it becomes meso, thus achiral.

So in the case of Reaction II, the product is a meso compound, making it achiral, because the two OHs are on opposite sides.

Wait, but how is that possible? When you reduce a symmetrical diketone, would the product be a meso compound?

Alternatively, perhaps the product has two chiral centers but is a meso compound, so it's achiral overall.

Therefore, the product of Reaction II is a meso compound, so it's not chiral and would show as a single peak in a chiral HPLC column.

Wait, but what if it's not a meso compound? Let me think again.

The product is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

The configuration at C2 and C4 would be the same if the reduction leads to both being R or both being S, but due to the symmetry, this would make the molecule chiral. Alternatively, if the configurations are opposite, the molecule would be meso and thus achiral.

Wait, but when you reduce a symmetrical diketone, like pentane-2,4-dione, which is symmetric, the reduction would produce a meso compound. Because the two reducing events are mirror images of each other, leading to opposite configurations.

So the product is a meso compound, thus achiral. So Reaction II gives an achiral product.

Now, let's bring it all together.

Reaction I gives a product with two chiral centers: C3 and C5. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH. The product is 3-hexanol with a methoxy group on C5.

So the product would have a new chiral center at C3, and the existing chiral center at C5 (which was S configuration). So the product has two chiral centers, making it a diastereomer if the configurations vary.

Wait, but the original configuration at C5 is S, and the new chiral center at C3 could be R or S, depending on the reduction.

Wait, but when LAH reduces a ketone, the hydride attack comes from the less hindered side, leading to the formation of the alcohol with a certain configuration.

But perhaps the product is a diastereomer, but we need to figure out how many stereoisomers are formed.

Wait, but regardless of that, the product of Reaction I is either a single stereoisomer or a mixture. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer (S configuration at C5), the product would have a specific configuration at C3 as well, leading to a single stereoisomer.

Wait, but that's only if the reaction leads to a new chiral center. If the reduction doesn't create a new chiral center (if the substituents on C3 are the same on both sides), then the product would only have the existing chiral center at C5.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should consider that Reaction I produces a single product with two chiral centers, making it a diastereomer, or perhaps a single enantiomer.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I gives a single enantiomer, and Reaction II gives a single meso compound (achiral). Then, combining them, we have two products.

Wait, but let's think again. The products from both reactions are combined. So what are the products?

Product I: from Reaction I: 3-hexanol with a methoxy on C5. So if it's a secondary alcohol with two chiral centers, perhaps it's a single stereoisomer if the reaction is stereospecific.

But wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When the ketone is reduced, the new OH is added, creating a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting material is chiral, the product will be a diastereomer, but would it form a single enantiomer?

Wait, perhaps not. Because the reaction is stereospecific, it could lead to a single diastereomer. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers, and the product of Reaction II is an achiral meso compound.

Now, when the two products are combined, we have two different compounds: one with two chiral centers (so potentially four stereoisomers, but in reality, it's a single stereoisomer from the reaction) and one achiral compound.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each reaction produces a single product. So Reaction I gives a single product (with two chiral centers), and Reaction II gives a single product (a meso compound, thus achiral).

So when combined, we have two different compounds: one is the product from I (with two chiral centers), and the other is the product from II (achiral).

Wait, but what are the actual structures?

Product I: 3-hexanol derivative with a methoxy on C5 and a new OH on C3. So the molecule has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

Product II: 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, so it's achiral.

Now, when both are combined, we have two different compounds. But how do they behave in the HPLC columns?

First, the normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on their polarity. The more polar, the more retained. So if the two products have different polarities, they would elute at different times, showing two peaks.

But wait, the two products are:

- Product I: two chiral centers, so it's a diastereomer or a single enantiomer. Wait, but if it's a single enantiomer, then in a normal-phase HPLC, it would elute as a single peak because the column doesn't separate based on chirality unless there's a chiral stationary phase.

Wait, no, normal-phase HPLC separates based on physical properties like polarity, not chirality. So if two compounds are non-chiral and different, they would give separate peaks. If they're chiral, but the column is normal-phase, each enantiomer would co-elute because the column can't distinguish them. But if it's a diastereomer, they would separate.

Wait, but in this case, each product is a single compound. So Product I is a single stereoisomer (if it's a specific diastereomer or enantiomer), and Product II is a single, achiral compound.

So when run on a normal-phase HPLC, each would give a single peak, leading to two peaks in total.

Wait, but no. Because Product I has two chiral centers, but in the reaction, it's a single stereoisomer. So in normal-phase HPLC, it would elute as a single peak. Similarly, Product II is a single, achiral compound, so it's also a single peak.

So in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

Now, what about the chiral HPLC column?

Chiral HPLC separates enantiomers and diastereomers based on their interaction with the chiral stationary phase. So if a compound has multiple chiral centers, its enantiomers would be separated, but if it's a diastereomer, they would also separate.

But in our case, each product would behave as follows:

Product I: a single stereoisomer (as it's formed from a single enantiomer starting material and a stereospecific reaction). So in the chiral column, it would elute as a single peak.

Product II: a meso compound, which is achiral. So in the chiral column, it would elute as a single peak as well because it's not chiral and doesn't interact differently with the column.

Wait, but wait. Meso compounds are achiral, but when run on a chiral HPLC column, do they elute as a single peak or not? Since they're achiral, their interaction with the chiral stationary phase would be the same for both theoretical enantiomers (but there are none because it's a meso compound). Wait, no, because meso compounds don't have enantiomers; they are superimposable on their mirror images. So in a chiral column, a meso compound would elute as a single peak.

So in the chiral HPLC, product I (single stereoisomer) gives one peak, and product II (meso, single compound) gives another. So two peaks.

Wait, but wait. Are the products from Reaction I and II the same or different?

Product I is a hexanol derivative with two chiral centers, and Product II is a pentanediol, a meso compound.

So when combined, the mixture would have two different compounds: one from each reaction. Each would give a single peak on both HPLC columns.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Reaction I gives a single stereoisomer (so one peak on chiral and one on normal), and Reaction II gives a single compound (so one peak on both columns). So the total would be two peaks on each column.

But looking at the options, none of them match that. The options are:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let's reevaluate.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ treated with LAH.

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent that can also affect protecting groups. Wait, the starting material has a methoxy group, which is an ether. Does LAH react with ethers? I think LAH typically doesn't reduce ethers under normal conditions.

So LAH would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, leaving the methoxy group intact. So the product is 3-hexanol with a methoxy on C5.

Now, the product would have two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

Wait, but the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. How does the addition of the OH at C3 affect the configuration?

The reaction adds an OH to C3, creating a new chiral center. So the product is a diastereomer, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have specific configurations at both C3 and C5.

But the question is, does the reaction produce a single stereoisomer or a racemic mixture? No, because LAH's reduction is stereospecific. It would add the hydride from a certain face, leading to a specific configuration at C3. So the product would have two chiral centers and be a single stereoisomer.

So, Reaction I produces a single diastereomer with two chiral centers.

Reaction II produces a meso compound, which is a single, achiral compound.

So when combining the products, we have two different compounds:

1. Product I: 3-hexanol with two chiral centers (single stereoisomer).
2. Product II: 2,4-pentanediol (meso, single compound).

So when run on a normal-phase HPLC, each would give a single peak, leading to two peaks total.

When run on a chiral HPLC column, Product I, being a single stereoisomer, would give one peak. Product II, being achiral, would also give one peak. So total of two peaks.

But looking at the options, none have two peaks. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some stereoisomerism.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let me think.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ reduced to 3-hexanol with methoxy at C5. The product would have two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

If the starting material is a single enantiomer (S at C5), the product would have a specific configuration at C3 based on the reduction.

Wait, but in reality, the reduction of a ketone with a chiral center nearby could lead to the formation of a new stereocenter, but would it form a single stereoisomer or a racemic mixture?

No, LAH typically gives a single stereoisomer because the reduction is stereospecific. So the product would be a single stereoisomer, but with two chiral centers, making it a diastereomer, not a pair of enantiomers.

So in the chiral HPLC, Product I would elute as a single peak. Product II, being meso, would also elute as a single peak. So two peaks in both columns.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm wrong in earlier analysis.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Reaction I produces two stereoisomers. But no, the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reaction is stereospecific, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I leads to a racemic mixture, but that's unlikely with LAH, which is a strong, bulky reducing agent.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the possibility that Reaction I produces a single enantiomer with two chiral centers, which would have four possible stereoisomers, but only one is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single enantiomer, but the product of Reaction II is a meso compound, leading to two peaks in each HPLC.

But according to the options, none of the options have two peaks. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider whether the products themselves can undergo any further reactions or if there are byproducts.

Wait, the reactions are 100% complete, so no byproducts. So the products are as expected.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Let's think differently.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ reduced to 3-hexanol with methoxy on C5.

The product is (3R,S)-something. Or perhaps it's a secondary alcohol with two chiral centers.

Wait, but perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single compound with two chiral centers, so it has four possible stereoisomers, but only one is formed.

So in the chiral HPLC, this product would elute as a single peak because it's a single stereoisomer.

Reaction II: gives a meso compound, which is a single peak in both HPLC columns.

So in total, the combined products would have two different compounds: Product I (with two chiral centers, single stereoisomer) and Product II (meso, single compound).

So in normal-phase HPLC: two peaks (each product is a separate compound).

In chiral HPLC: two peaks (each product is a separate compound, with Product I being a single stereoisomer and Product II being a single achiral compound).

But looking at the options, option B says 3 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal. Option D says 3 peaks in both.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the number of products. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe Reaction I produces more than one product. How?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which upon reduction gives two possible products due to the reduction's stereochemistry. But no, the reduction would proceed with a specific stereochemistry because the starting material is a single enantiomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a new chiral center, but the reaction doesn't produce a single configuration. But no, LAH would proceed with high stereoselectivity.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual structures and how many stereoisomers each product has.

Product I: 3-hexanol with methoxy on C5.

Structure: CH2CH2(OH)CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3?

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CH2CH(OH)CH2OCH3CH2CH3? No, not sure, but the key point is that it has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

The starting material is (S) at C5. The product's configuration at C3 would depend on the reduction, but the outcome would be a single stereoisomer with specific configurations at both centers.

So the product has two chiral centers but is a single stereoisomer, so when analyzed on a chiral column, it would give one peak.

Product II: meso compound, so it's a single compound, giving one peak on both columns.

So when combining, the two products are two different compounds, so on normal-phase, two peaks; on chiral, two peaks.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: maybe the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, but I'm not considering that.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two diastereomers. But no, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reaction is stereospecific, leading to a single product.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is not a diastereomer but a single enantiomer with two chiral centers. So in the chiral column, it would show as a single peak. But in the normal-phase, each product is a different compound, leading to two peaks.

Wait, but the options don't have two in chiral and two in normal.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the product of Reaction I is a racemic mixture, but that's unlikely with LAH.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the options again.

The options are:

A) 5 and 4.
B) 3 and 2.
C) 4 and 2.
D) 3 and 3.

Hmm, perhaps I should think that Reaction I produces four stereoisomers, but that's not possible because the starting material is a single enantiomer and the reaction is stereospecific.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single stereoisomer, and the product of Reaction II is a meso compound. So in chiral HPLC, each product is a single peak, leading to two peaks. But in the options, none match that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the product of Reaction I has two chiral centers, but not all of them are in the same molecule, leading to more peaks.

Wait, another mistake I might have made: perhaps the product of Reaction I has more than one chiral center, leading to more stereoisomers.

Wait, the product of Reaction I has two chiral centers, which would have four possible stereoisomers. But in reality, since the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reaction is stereospecific, only one diastereomer is formed.

So in the chiral column, it would appear as a single peak, and in the normal-phase, as a single peak.

Product II is a meso compound, so it's a single peak on both columns.

So combining both, two peaks in each column, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I missed that Reaction I produces two diastereomers. But that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single enantiomer with two chiral centers, which would have four possible stereoisomers, but the reaction produces only one, leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC because the column can separate enantiomers.

Wait, no. If the product is a single enantiomer with two chiral centers, then in chiral HPLC, it would be a single peak because it's a single compound. Only when there are enantiomers would they separate.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that in the chiral column, we see three peaks, and in the normal-phase, two. But I'm not seeing why.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I has two chiral centers, leading to four possible stereoisomers, but only two are formed (a racemic mixture?), but that contradicts the starting material being a single enantiomer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that each reaction produces multiple products.

Wait, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ reduced to 3-hexanol with methoxy on C5. The product would have two chiral centers. Depending on the reaction's stereoselectivity, perhaps it leads to two diastereomers, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a racemic mixture, but that's not the case with LAH.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I has two chiral centers, and the reaction produces a single diastereomer, which is a single stereoisomer.

So, in the combined products, we have:

- Product I: a single stereoisomer (two chiral centers)
- Product II: a single achiral compound (meso)

So when run on chiral HPLC:

- Product I: 1 peak
- Product II: 1 peak
Total: 2 peaks.

On normal-phase HPLC:

- Product I: 1 peak
- Product II: 1 peak
Total: 2 peaks.

But none of the options have two in both.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the products. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I gives a single product, but with two chiral centers. How many stereoisomers are possible for that product?

The product is 5-methoxy-3-hexanol. The two chiral centers are C3 and C5.

The possible stereoisomers are four: (R,R), (R,S), (S,R), (S,S).

But the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. The reaction's stereoselectivity would determine the configuration at C3.

Assuming that the reaction is stereospecific and leads to a single diastereomer, then the product would have a specific configuration at C3 and C5, leading to a single stereoisomer.

So in the chiral column, it would be a single peak, and in normal-phase, a single peak.

Reaction II: meso compound, so single peak in both columns.

So combined, two peaks on both columns. But no option matches. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I isn't a single stereoisomer. Maybe the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two stereoisomers.

But with the starting material being an S configuration at C5, perhaps the product ends up with two chiral centers, and the reaction produces two diastereomers.

Wait, but that's unlikely. LAH is a strong reducing agent, and the reaction is stereospecific, leading to a single product.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B says 3 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal. How could that be?

Perhaps Reaction I produces two stereoisomers, and Reaction II produces one.

But I don't see how that would happen. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about Reaction II.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II doesn't produce a meso compound but instead two enantiomers, leading to a racemic mixture.

Wait, no, because the starting material is symmetrical, so the product would be a meso compound.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Reaction II produces a diol that is not meso. Let me think again.

The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. When reduced, each ketone becomes an alcohol. So the product is HOCH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps it's HOCH2-CH2-CHOH-CH2CH3. No, perhaps the structure is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but no, the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. Reducing each ketone gives CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, if both OH groups are on the same side, it's (R,R) or (S,S), which are enantiomers. But due to symmetry, perhaps it's a meso compound.

Wait, no. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound. So if the two OH groups are on opposite sides, the molecule is meso.

So the product is a meso compound, so it's a single compound, achiral.

Thus, in the chiral HPLC, it would give a single peak.

So in the chiral HPLC, Product I (single stereoisomer) and Product II (meso) would give two peaks.

In normal-phase HPLC, same: two peaks.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single enantiomer with two chiral centers, which would have four possible stereoisomers. But since the product is a single stereoisomer, it would elute as a single peak in chiral HPLC.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I has two chiral centers, but the reaction produces two diastereomers, leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product should be a single diastereomer.

I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think of the options.

Option D says 3 peaks in both columns.

How could that be?

Perhaps Reaction I produces two stereoisomers, and Reaction II produces one, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I produces three products, but that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single compound with two chiral centers, which has four stereoisomers in total, but only one is formed, leading to one peak in chiral HPLC. And Reaction II produces one, leading to two peaks in both columns.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the product of Reaction II. Maybe it's not a meso compound but a chiral one.

Wait, if the product of Reaction II is a vicinal diol with two chiral centers but without a plane of symmetry, then it would be a chiral compound with two stereoisomers.

But in that case, because the starting material is symmetrical, the product would be a meso compound, thus achiral.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the product of Reaction II, and it's not a meso compound. Let me think.

Pentane-2,4-dione: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Reduction with NaBH4 gives CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

This structure is symmetric across the central CH2 group. So the two OH groups are mirror images, leading to a meso compound. Thus, it's achiral.

So in the chiral HPLC, it would elute as a single peak.

So combining, two products: each gives one peak in both columns.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that can't be the case.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product of Reaction I is a racemic mixture, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, which would give two peaks in the chiral HPLC but one in the normal-phase.

But the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would be a single stereoisomer.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I has two chiral centers, and the reaction produces a racemic mixture, leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC.

But again, that's unlikely with LAH.

I'm stuck. Based on the options, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 3 peaks in both.

But I can't see how that would happen. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of peaks from each product.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two stereoisomers, and Reaction II produces one.

But I can't see that happening.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I produces a single product with two chiral centers, leading to four possible stereoisomers, but only one is formed, so in the chiral HPLC, it's a single peak. Reaction II produces a single product, so chiral HPLC has two peaks.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, another approach: think about how many peaks each product would produce in each HPLC.

Product I: has two chiral centers. If it's a single stereoisomer, it would give one peak in both columns.

Product II: is a meso compound, so one peak in both columns.

So combined, two peaks in both columns. But no option matches.

Hmm. I think I've spent enough time. Based on the analysis, I think the correct answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single compound with two chiral centers, leading to four possible stereoisomers, but only one is formed, so one peak in chiral HPLC. Reaction II is a meso compound, so one peak. So two peaks in both.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: 3 peaks in both.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a diastereomer with two stereoisomers, and Reaction II is a meso compound. So in chiral HPLC, 2 (from I) +1 (from II)=3. In normal-phase, 2 (from I) +1 (from II)=3.

But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I produces two stereoisomers (racemic), leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC, and one in normal-phase. Reaction II is meso, one peak in both. So total chiral: 2+1=3; normal:2+1=3. So option D.

But why would Reaction I produce a racemic mixture? Because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product should be a single stereoisomer.

I think I'm stuck, but I'll go with option B: 3 and 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions and analyzing the products using normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. Here's the analysis:

### Reaction I:
- **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.
- **Reagent**: LAH (a strong reducing agent).
- **Product**: The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol, resulting in 3-hexanol with a methoxy group at C5. The product has two chiral centers: C3 (new) and C5 (existing, S configuration).
- **Outcome**: The reaction is stereospecific, and the starting material is a single enantiomer. Thus, the product is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

### Reaction II:
- **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione (a symmetrical diketone).
- **Reagent**: NaBH4 (reduces ketones to alcohols).
- **Product**: The two ketones are reduced to alcohols, forming 2,4-pentanediol. Due to the symmetry of the starting material, the product is a meso compound, which is achiral.

### Combined Products:
1. **Product I**: A single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.
2. **Product II**: A meso compound, which is achiral.

### Analysis on HPLC Columns:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:
   - Separates compounds based on polarity.
   - Product I and Product II are two distinct compounds with different polarities.
   - **Result**: Two peaks.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - Separates enantiomers and diastereomers.
   - Product I is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers, so it elutes as one peak.
   - Product II is a meso compound and achiral, so it elutes as one peak.
   - **Result**: Two peaks.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC. **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC. **Incorrect**.
- **Option C**: 4 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC. **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The analysis indicates that there should be two peaks in both normal-phase and chiral HPLC. However, none of the options match this result. Based on the reasoning provided, **Option B** is the closest match, despite inconsistencies in the reasoning.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question involves two reactions, each starting with different compounds, and then combining the products. After that, the combined products are run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is asking how many peaks each will show.

Let's break down each reaction.

First, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So the starting material is a ketone, right? The structure is hexan-3-one with a methoxy group on carbon 5. So the structure is CH2CH2-C-O-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So position 3 is the carbonyl. And at position 5, there's a methoxy group. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-OCH3 at position 5? No, wait, the numbering. Let me think: hexan-3-one is like:

CH2CH2-C-O-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me think again. Hexane has six carbons. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH2
Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, no, wait. No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the molecule is CH2CH2-CO-(CH2)3CH3? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me number the carbons:

1: CH3-
2: CH2-
3: C=O
4: CH2-
5: CH2-
6: CH3.

Wait, that's not possible because that would give a 6-carbon chain with the ketone at C3. Wait, perhaps the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, the methoxy is on carbon 5. So the structure is:

Positions 1 to 6:

1: CH3-
2: CH2-
3: C=O
4: CH2-
5: OCH3 (because it's 5-methoxy)
6: CH2CH3? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula is hexan-3-one, so the carbonyl is on C3. The 5th carbon has a methoxy group. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-O-CH3, but that's not correct because after C3, it's C4, C5, and C6. So from C3, which is the carbonyl, C4 is CH2, C5 is OCH3, and C6 is CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let's think of the structure as:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH2CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm complicating.

Wait, perhaps it's (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-OCH3 attached where? Let me perhaps write the structure as:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3, but that would be five carbons. Wait, no, hexan-3-one is six carbons with the ketone on C3. So:

Positions:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH2-OCH3
6: CH3.

Wait, that's possible. So the structure is:

CH2CH2(CO)CH2-OCH2CH3? No, wait. Let me count again. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. So in that case, C3 is the carbonyl. The 5th carbon (C5) would be the next one after C4, which is the CH2 after C3. So if the 5th carbon has a methoxy group, it would be OCH3 attached to C5.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3. No, wait, that would be seven carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed without it.

Anyway, the key point is that (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, and it's a strong enough base to deprotonate things, but in this case, after workup, it's acidic, so the alcohol gets protonated.

So Reaction I: the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. The configuration of the starting material is S, and since LAH is a strong reducing agent, it would proceed with some stereochemistry. Wait, LAH reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, and the stereochemistry depends on the mechanism. LAH is a strong hydride donor, and it's a two-step process: the hydride attack is from the less hindered side since the mechanism is a conjugate addition for ketones. Wait, no, LAH typically reduces ketones via a single-step, but in any case, the starting material is (S) configuration, so after reduction, how does that affect the product?

Wait, the starting material has a chiral center at C5 (since it's 5-methoxyhexan-3-one). Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, hexan-3-one has the carbonyl at C3. So the substituents around C5 are:

Wait, maybe I should consider the structure more carefully. Let me imagine the structure.

Hexan-3-one: CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. So the carbonyl is at position 3, with two CH2 groups on either side. But wait, in the starting material, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one: so the structure is CH2CH2C(O)CH2OCH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better written as:

Position 1: CH3
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: C=O
Position 4: CH2
Position 5: OCH3
Position 6: CH2CH3? No, wait, that can't be, because that would make it a seven-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(CH2)2CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-OCH2CH2CH3? No, that would be an ester, but it's a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

The compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the six-carbon chain has a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5.

So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3. Wait, that's five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let's think again. Hexan-3-one is six carbons with ketone at C3. So:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH2
6: CH3.

Wait, but then where's the methoxy? Oh, wait, the 5-methoxy would be on C5. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3. So it's CH3CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3. Wait, that would be four carbons, but hexan-3-one is six. I'm getting confused, perhaps. Maybe I should accept that I can't get the structure right without a diagram, but the key point is that it's a ketone, and when treated with LAH, it will be reduced to a secondary alcohol.

So Reaction I: the ketone becomes an alcohol. The starting material is (S) configuration. But how does that affect the product? When LAH reduces a ketone, it adds a hydride to the carbonyl carbon, which is planar, so the configuration of the starting molecule might not directly translate. Wait, no, the starting material's configuration is at a different carbonâ€”probably C5 has a chiral center.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the configuration is at C5. So when the ketone (C3) is reduced to an alcohol, where is the new chiral center?

Wait, the ketone is at C3, which is the carbonyl. When reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol, so the OH is on C3. So the product of Reaction I is 3-hexanol derivative with a methoxy group on C5 and an alcohol on C3.

But wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. So when that's reduced, the product would have the same configuration at C5 but an additional OH on C3.

Wait, no, the reduction of the ketone occurs at C3, so the configuration at C5 doesn't affect that. Wait, no: the configuration at C5 is part of the molecule, but the hydride attack on the ketone (C3) would be influenced by the existing groups.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is such that when the ketone is reduced, the OH adds from a specific face, leading to a certain configuration. But in any case, the product would have a new chiral center at C3.

Wait, because the starting ketone is at C3, which is adjacent to C4 and C2. So when it's reduced, the OH is added to C3, making it a chiral center if it wasn't before.

Wait, no, because the starting ketone at C3: if C3 has two identical substituents, reducing it won't create a chiral center. Wait, the starting ketone is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, I think the structure is:

Positions 1 to 6:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: OCH3
6: CH2CH3?

Wait, that can't be, because that would make it seven carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to proceed without the exact structure.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one becomes 3-hexanol derivative, with a methoxy group on C5. The reduction would create a secondary alcohol at C3, and since the starting material had a chiral center at C5, the product will have two chiral centers: C3 (new) and C5 (existing).

Wait, but when you reduce a ketone with LAH, the hydride attack is typically from the less hindered side. So the configuration of the new OH would depend on the structure.

But perhaps in this case, the new OH will be on the same side as the existing groups. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction doesn't affect the existing stereochemistry at C5; it just adds a new OH at C3.

Wait, but the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. So C5 has four different groups: the methoxy, two CH2 groups, and perhaps the C4 and C6. Wait, no. Let me think: in (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the C5 is attached to OCH3, and to C4 and C6. What else? So C3 is a carbonyl, so C4 is attached to C3 (CO) and C5. So C5 is attached to C4 (which is CH2), CO (but wait, C3 is a carbonyl, so C4 is CH2 connected to C3. C5 is attached to C4, OCH3, and perhaps C6.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's (S)-configuration at C5, which is attached to:

- a CH2 group (from C4)
- a OCH3 group
- a CH2 group (from C6)
- and the C3, which is the carbonyl.

Wait, that's four different groups, making C5 a chiral center. So when the ketone is reduced, the new OH is on C3. So the product will have OH on C3, and the existing configuration at C5.

So the product is (S)-something at C5 and R or S at C3, depending on the reduction.

Wait, but the reduction of the ketone to secondary alcohol would create a new chiral center if the carbonyl carbon wasn't already chiral. Since the starting ketone is at C3, which is connected to C2 and C4. If C3 has two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4), then reducing it would create a chiral center if those two groups are different. Wait, in 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps it's better to think that C3 is connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), and two other groups. Wait, no, a ketone is R2C=O. So in hexan-3-one, the ketone is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, hexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. So C3 is connected to two CH2 groups (C2 and C4), and the carbonyl. So when you reduce that, the C3 becomes a CHOH group, which would have two CH2 groups, but wait, no, the C3 would be connected to:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH2 (from C4)
- OH
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no. When you reduce a ketone (R2CO) to an alcohol (R2CHOH), the carbon becomes R2CHOH. So for hexan-3-one, the structure after reduction would be (CH2CH2)CH(OH)(CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, but that would make C3 connected to two CH2 groups, which are the same. So in this case, the product would have a new chiral center at C3 only if the two substituents are different. But if C3 was symmetric (same groups on both sides), then the reduction would not create a chiral center.

Wait, wait, the starting ketone is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the C5 is a chiral center because it's attached to OCH3, and three other groups. But the C3 is the carbonyl carbon, which in the starting material is not a chiral center because it's connected to two CH2 groups (assuming). So when reduced, the C3 would have four substituents: two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4), an OH, and a hydrogen. Wait, no, no. The reduction of a ketone R2CO to R2CH(OH)R' (if R and R' are different). Wait, in hexan-3-one, the structure is:

(CH2)2-CO-(CH2)3CH3. So when reduced, it becomes (CH2)2-CHOH-(CH2)3CH3. Does that create a chiral center? Because the substituents on C3 would be:

- CH2CH3 (from C2)
- CH2CH2CH3 (from C4)
Wait, no, C3 is connected to C2 (which is CH2CH3?), no, wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

Positions:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH2-OCH3
6: CH3.

Wait, maybe that's how the starting material looks. So the structure is CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? No, that can't be. I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I should proceed.

Assuming that after reduction, the product has a new chiral center at C3 (because it's attached to two different groups: one from C2, one from C4, plus OH and H). Alternatively, perhaps it's not a chiral center because the substituents are the same. Wait, if C3 is connected to two identical groups (like two CH2's), then adding OH and H would not create a chiral center. So perhaps the product of Reaction I is not a chiral molecule. Or maybe it is.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has two chiral centers: the original at C5 and the new at C3.

But I'm not entirely sure, so perhaps I should move on and come back if I need to.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup. Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3CO)2CH2, which is a diketone. NaBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both ketones. So each ketone group would be reduced to an alcohol.

Wait, but NaBH4 typically doesn't reduce diketones in certain conditions. Wait, no, NaBH4 can reduce ketones. But in the case of pentane-2,4-dione, where the two carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons, reducing with NaBH4 would give a diol.

Wait, but wait: when you have a 2,4-dione, like CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3, and you reduce it with NaBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, but it's a milder agent than LAH. Wait, no, NaBH4 can reduce ketones but not esters or amides. So in this case, each ketone would be reduced to a secondary alcohol.

So the product would be HOCH2CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)CO(CH2)COCH3. So the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So reducing each ketone would give CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So that's a vicinal diol, but wait, each carbonyl is on C2 and C4. So after reduction, it would be HOCH2-CHOH-(CH2)CH3? No, perhaps I should write it as:

Original: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

After reduction, each C=O becomes CH(OH). So the product is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So each of the two ketones becomes an alcohol.

So the product of Reaction II is a 2,4-pentanediol. But wait, pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups, so each is reduced to a secondary alcohol. So the product would have two OH groups on adjacent carbons: C2 and C4. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

But wait, wait a minute. Pentane is five carbons. So positions 1 to 5:

1: CH3
2: C=O
3: CH2
4: C=O
5: CH3.

So when reduced, each C=O becomes CH(OH), so the product is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, but this molecule has two OH groups on C2 and C4. So the molecule is HOCH2-CH(OH)CH2-CH2CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is HOCH2-CHOH-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, positions 2 and 4 have OH groups. Now, this molecule has two chiral centers: positions 2 and 4. Each of these would have four different substituents.

Wait, position 2: attached to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), OH, and perhaps a hydrogen? Or no, wait, each OH is on a secondary carbon, so attached to two CH groups.

Wait, no. Let me think: each OH is on C2 and C4.

At C2:

- attached to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), an OH, and another CH group.

Wait, maybe it's better to think that each C2 and C4 have four different groups. For C2: groups are CH3 (from C1), CH2 (from C3), OH, and a hydrogen (from the C2 itself). Hmm, but that would make it a chiral center. Similarly for C4: groups would be CH2 (from C3), CH3 (from C5), OH, and a hydrogen.

Wait, but wait. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. So in the case of C2 in the product:

- Group 1: CH3 (from C1)
- Group 2: CH2 (from C3)
- Group 3: OH
- Group 4: H (since the carbon is CH(OH)).

So yes, four different groups, making it a chiral center. Similarly for C4.

So the product of Reaction II is a vicinal diol with two chiral centers, both in the same configuration? Or are they different?

Wait, the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, which is symmetrical. So when you reduce it, the two OH groups may have the same configuration.

Wait, because the starting material is symmetrical, the reduction would lead to the same configuration on both C2 and C4.

Wait, no. Let me think about the mechanism. When NaBH4 reduces a ketone, it adds a hydride from the same face (since it's a planar carbonyl). So if the starting material is symmetrical, the two OH groups would be added in the same configuration, leading to both being R or both S, or perhaps opposite.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is symmetrical, so C2 and C4 are mirror images. So when the two ketones are reduced, they would form mirror image diastereomers or maybe the same.

Wait, actually, no. Because when the starting material is symmetrical, the product would also be symmetrical, leading to a meso compound. So both C2 and C4 have the same configuration, but because of the symmetry, the molecule as a whole is achiral.

Wait, let me think. The product is HOCH2-CHOH-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait, perhaps it's:

HOCH2-CH2-CHOH-CH2CH3. No, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, the product is (R,R) or (S,S) configuration at C2 and C4, but considering symmetry, perhaps it's a meso compound.

Wait, no, if the molecule is symmetrical, then the configurations would be opposite, leading to a meso form, which is achiral. Let me think about the structure again.

The structure after reduction is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So the molecule is symmetric with respect to the central CH2 group.

So C2 and C4 are mirror images. If the OH groups are in the same configuration (both R or both S), then the molecule would be meso, making it achiral. Because the molecule has a plane of symmetry, leading to a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps it's a meso compound because of the symmetry. So the product is (R,S) or (S,R), but due to the plane of symmetry, it's a meso form, making the molecule achiral.

Wait, let me think of tartaric acid as an example. It's a meso compound when both stereocenters are opposite. So in our case, if the two OH groups are on the same side (both R or both S), then the molecule is chiral, but if they are on opposite sides, it becomes meso, thus achiral.

So in the case of Reaction II, the product is a meso compound, making it achiral, because the two OHs are on opposite sides.

Wait, but how is that possible? When you reduce a symmetrical diketone, would the product be a meso compound?

Alternatively, perhaps the product has two chiral centers but is a meso compound, so it's achiral overall.

Therefore, the product of Reaction II is a meso compound, so it's not chiral and would show as a single peak in a chiral HPLC column.

Wait, but what if it's not a meso compound? Let me think again.

The product is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

The configuration at C2 and C4 would be the same if the reduction leads to both being R or both being S, but due to the symmetry, this would make the molecule chiral. Alternatively, if the configurations are opposite, the molecule would be meso and thus achiral.

Wait, but when you reduce a symmetrical diketone, like pentane-2,4-dione, which is symmetric, the reduction would produce a meso compound. Because the two reducing events are mirror images of each other, leading to opposite configurations.

So the product is a meso compound, thus achiral. So Reaction II gives an achiral product.

Now, let's bring it all together.

Reaction I gives a product with two chiral centers: C3 and C5. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH. The product is 3-hexanol with a methoxy group on C5.

So the product would have a new chiral center at C3, and the existing chiral center at C5 (which was S configuration). So the product has two chiral centers, making it a diastereomer if the configurations vary.

Wait, but the original configuration at C5 is S, and the new chiral center at C3 could be R or S, depending on the reduction.

Wait, but when LAH reduces a ketone, the hydride attack comes from the less hindered side, leading to the formation of the alcohol with a certain configuration.

But perhaps the product is a diastereomer, but we need to figure out how many stereoisomers are formed.

Wait, but regardless of that, the product of Reaction I is either a single stereoisomer or a mixture. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer (S configuration at C5), the product would have a specific configuration at C3 as well, leading to a single stereoisomer.

Wait, but that's only if the reaction leads to a new chiral center. If the reduction doesn't create a new chiral center (if the substituents on C3 are the same on both sides), then the product would only have the existing chiral center at C5.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should consider that Reaction I produces a single product with two chiral centers, making it a diastereomer, or perhaps a single enantiomer.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I gives a single enantiomer, and Reaction II gives a single meso compound (achiral). Then, combining them, we have two products.

Wait, but let's think again. The products from both reactions are combined. So what are the products?

Product I: from Reaction I: 3-hexanol with a methoxy on C5. So if it's a secondary alcohol with two chiral centers, perhaps it's a single stereoisomer if the reaction is stereospecific.

But wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When the ketone is reduced, the new OH is added, creating a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting material is chiral, the product will be a diastereomer, but would it form a single enantiomer?

Wait, perhaps not. Because the reaction is stereospecific, it could lead to a single diastereomer. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers, and the product of Reaction II is an achiral meso compound.

Now, when the two products are combined, we have two different compounds: one with two chiral centers (so potentially four stereoisomers, but in reality, it's a single stereoisomer from the reaction) and one achiral compound.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each reaction produces a single product. So Reaction I gives a single product (with two chiral centers), and Reaction II gives a single product (a meso compound, thus achiral).

So when combined, we have two different compounds: one is the product from I (with two chiral centers), and the other is the product from II (achiral).

Wait, but what are the actual structures?

Product I: 3-hexanol derivative with a methoxy on C5 and a new OH on C3. So the molecule has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

Product II: 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, so it's achiral.

Now, when both are combined, we have two different compounds. But how do they behave in the HPLC columns?

First, the normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on their polarity. The more polar, the more retained. So if the two products have different polarities, they would elute at different times, showing two peaks.

But wait, the two products are:

- Product I: two chiral centers, so it's a diastereomer or a single enantiomer. Wait, but if it's a single enantiomer, then in a normal-phase HPLC, it would elute as a single peak because the column doesn't separate based on chirality unless there's a chiral stationary phase.

Wait, no, normal-phase HPLC separates based on physical properties like polarity, not chirality. So if two compounds are non-chiral and different, they would give separate peaks. If they're chiral, but the column is normal-phase, each enantiomer would co-elute because the column can't distinguish them. But if it's a diastereomer, they would separate.

Wait, but in this case, each product is a single compound. So Product I is a single stereoisomer (if it's a specific diastereomer or enantiomer), and Product II is a single, achiral compound.

So when run on a normal-phase HPLC, each would give a single peak, leading to two peaks in total.

Wait, but no. Because Product I has two chiral centers, but in the reaction, it's a single stereoisomer. So in normal-phase HPLC, it would elute as a single peak. Similarly, Product II is a single, achiral compound, so it's also a single peak.

So in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

Now, what about the chiral HPLC column?

Chiral HPLC separates enantiomers and diastereomers based on their interaction with the chiral stationary phase. So if a compound has multiple chiral centers, its enantiomers would be separated, but if it's a diastereomer, they would also separate.

But in our case, each product would behave as follows:

Product I: a single stereoisomer (as it's formed from a single enantiomer starting material and a stereospecific reaction). So in the chiral column, it would elute as a single peak.

Product II: a meso compound, which is achiral. So in the chiral column, it would elute as a single peak as well because it's not chiral and doesn't interact differently with the column.

Wait, but wait. Meso compounds are achiral, but when run on a chiral HPLC column, do they elute as a single peak or not? Since they're achiral, their interaction with the chiral stationary phase would be the same for both theoretical enantiomers (but there are none because it's a meso compound). Wait, no, because meso compounds don't have enantiomers; they are superimposable on their mirror images. So in a chiral column, a meso compound would elute as a single peak.

So in the chiral HPLC, product I (single stereoisomer) gives one peak, and product II (meso, single compound) gives another. So two peaks.

Wait, but wait. Are the products from Reaction I and II the same or different?

Product I is a hexanol derivative with two chiral centers, and Product II is a pentanediol, a meso compound.

So when combined, the mixture would have two different compounds: one from each reaction. Each would give a single peak on both HPLC columns.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Reaction I gives a single stereoisomer (so one peak on chiral and one on normal), and Reaction II gives a single compound (so one peak on both columns). So the total would be two peaks on each column.

But looking at the options, none of them match that. The options are:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let's reevaluate.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ treated with LAH.

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent that can also affect protecting groups. Wait, the starting material has a methoxy group, which is an ether. Does LAH react with ethers? I think LAH typically doesn't reduce ethers under normal conditions.

So LAH would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, leaving the methoxy group intact. So the product is 3-hexanol with a methoxy on C5.

Now, the product would have two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

Wait, but the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. How does the addition of the OH at C3 affect the configuration?

The reaction adds an OH to C3, creating a new chiral center. So the product is a diastereomer, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have specific configurations at both C3 and C5.

But the question is, does the reaction produce a single stereoisomer or a racemic mixture? No, because LAH's reduction is stereospecific. It would add the hydride from a certain face, leading to a specific configuration at C3. So the product would have two chiral centers and be a single stereoisomer.

So, Reaction I produces a single diastereomer with two chiral centers.

Reaction II produces a meso compound, which is a single, achiral compound.

So when combining the products, we have two different compounds:

1. Product I: 3-hexanol with two chiral centers (single stereoisomer).
2. Product II: 2,4-pentanediol (meso, single compound).

So when run on a normal-phase HPLC, each would give a single peak, leading to two peaks total.

When run on a chiral HPLC column, Product I, being a single stereoisomer, would give one peak. Product II, being achiral, would also give one peak. So total of two peaks.

But looking at the options, none have two peaks. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some stereoisomerism.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let me think.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ reduced to 3-hexanol with methoxy at C5. The product would have two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

If the starting material is a single enantiomer (S at C5), the product would have a specific configuration at C3 based on the reduction.

Wait, but in reality, the reduction of a ketone with a chiral center nearby could lead to the formation of a new stereocenter, but would it form a single stereoisomer or a racemic mixture?

No, LAH typically gives a single stereoisomer because the reduction is stereospecific. So the product would be a single stereoisomer, but with two chiral centers, making it a diastereomer, not a pair of enantiomers.

So in the chiral HPLC, Product I would elute as a single peak. Product II, being meso, would also elute as a single peak. So two peaks in both columns.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm wrong in earlier analysis.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Reaction I produces two stereoisomers. But no, the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reaction is stereospecific, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I leads to a racemic mixture, but that's unlikely with LAH, which is a strong, bulky reducing agent.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the possibility that Reaction I produces a single enantiomer with two chiral centers, which would have four possible stereoisomers, but only one is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single enantiomer, but the product of Reaction II is a meso compound, leading to two peaks in each HPLC.

But according to the options, none of the options have two peaks. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider whether the products themselves can undergo any further reactions or if there are byproducts.

Wait, the reactions are 100% complete, so no byproducts. So the products are as expected.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Let's think differently.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ reduced to 3-hexanol with methoxy on C5.

The product is (3R,S)-something. Or perhaps it's a secondary alcohol with two chiral centers.

Wait, but perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single compound with two chiral centers, so it has four possible stereoisomers, but only one is formed.

So in the chiral HPLC, this product would elute as a single peak because it's a single stereoisomer.

Reaction II: gives a meso compound, which is a single peak in both HPLC columns.

So in total, the combined products would have two different compounds: Product I (with two chiral centers, single stereoisomer) and Product II (meso, single compound).

So in normal-phase HPLC: two peaks (each product is a separate compound).

In chiral HPLC: two peaks (each product is a separate compound, with Product I being a single stereoisomer and Product II being a single achiral compound).

But looking at the options, option B says 3 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal. Option D says 3 peaks in both.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the number of products. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe Reaction I produces more than one product. How?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which upon reduction gives two possible products due to the reduction's stereochemistry. But no, the reduction would proceed with a specific stereochemistry because the starting material is a single enantiomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a new chiral center, but the reaction doesn't produce a single configuration. But no, LAH would proceed with high stereoselectivity.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual structures and how many stereoisomers each product has.

Product I: 3-hexanol with methoxy on C5.

Structure: CH2CH2(OH)CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3?

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CH2CH(OH)CH2OCH3CH2CH3? No, not sure, but the key point is that it has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

The starting material is (S) at C5. The product's configuration at C3 would depend on the reduction, but the outcome would be a single stereoisomer with specific configurations at both centers.

So the product has two chiral centers but is a single stereoisomer, so when analyzed on a chiral column, it would give one peak.

Product II: meso compound, so it's a single compound, giving one peak on both columns.

So when combining, the two products are two different compounds, so on normal-phase, two peaks; on chiral, two peaks.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: maybe the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, but I'm not considering that.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two diastereomers. But no, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reaction is stereospecific, leading to a single product.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is not a diastereomer but a single enantiomer with two chiral centers. So in the chiral column, it would show as a single peak. But in the normal-phase, each product is a different compound, leading to two peaks.

Wait, but the options don't have two in chiral and two in normal.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the product of Reaction I is a racemic mixture, but that's unlikely with LAH.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the options again.

The options are:

A) 5 and 4.
B) 3 and 2.
C) 4 and 2.
D) 3 and 3.

Hmm, perhaps I should think that Reaction I produces four stereoisomers, but that's not possible because the starting material is a single enantiomer and the reaction is stereospecific.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single stereoisomer, and the product of Reaction II is a meso compound. So in chiral HPLC, each product is a single peak, leading to two peaks. But in the options, none match that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the product of Reaction I has two chiral centers, but not all of them are in the same molecule, leading to more peaks.

Wait, another mistake I might have made: perhaps the product of Reaction I has more than one chiral center, leading to more stereoisomers.

Wait, the product of Reaction I has two chiral centers, which would have four possible stereoisomers. But in reality, since the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reaction is stereospecific, only one diastereomer is formed.

So in the chiral column, it would appear as a single peak, and in the normal-phase, as a single peak.

Product II is a meso compound, so it's a single peak on both columns.

So combining both, two peaks in each column, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I missed that Reaction I produces two diastereomers. But that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single enantiomer with two chiral centers, which would have four possible stereoisomers, but the reaction produces only one, leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC because the column can separate enantiomers.

Wait, no. If the product is a single enantiomer with two chiral centers, then in chiral HPLC, it would be a single peak because it's a single compound. Only when there are enantiomers would they separate.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that in the chiral column, we see three peaks, and in the normal-phase, two. But I'm not seeing why.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I has two chiral centers, leading to four possible stereoisomers, but only two are formed (a racemic mixture?), but that contradicts the starting material being a single enantiomer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that each reaction produces multiple products.

Wait, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ reduced to 3-hexanol with methoxy on C5. The product would have two chiral centers. Depending on the reaction's stereoselectivity, perhaps it leads to two diastereomers, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a racemic mixture, but that's not the case with LAH.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I has two chiral centers, and the reaction produces a single diastereomer, which is a single stereoisomer.

So, in the combined products, we have:

- Product I: a single stereoisomer (two chiral centers)
- Product II: a single achiral compound (meso)

So when run on chiral HPLC:

- Product I: 1 peak
- Product II: 1 peak
Total: 2 peaks.

On normal-phase HPLC:

- Product I: 1 peak
- Product II: 1 peak
Total: 2 peaks.

But none of the options have two in both.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the products. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I gives a single product, but with two chiral centers. How many stereoisomers are possible for that product?

The product is 5-methoxy-3-hexanol. The two chiral centers are C3 and C5.

The possible stereoisomers are four: (R,R), (R,S), (S,R), (S,S).

But the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. The reaction's stereoselectivity would determine the configuration at C3.

Assuming that the reaction is stereospecific and leads to a single diastereomer, then the product would have a specific configuration at C3 and C5, leading to a single stereoisomer.

So in the chiral column, it would be a single peak, and in normal-phase, a single peak.

Reaction II: meso compound, so single peak in both columns.

So combined, two peaks on both columns. But no option matches. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I isn't a single stereoisomer. Maybe the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two stereoisomers.

But with the starting material being an S configuration at C5, perhaps the product ends up with two chiral centers, and the reaction produces two diastereomers.

Wait, but that's unlikely. LAH is a strong reducing agent, and the reaction is stereospecific, leading to a single product.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B says 3 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal. How could that be?

Perhaps Reaction I produces two stereoisomers, and Reaction II produces one.

But I don't see how that would happen. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about Reaction II.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II doesn't produce a meso compound but instead two enantiomers, leading to a racemic mixture.

Wait, no, because the starting material is symmetrical, so the product would be a meso compound.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Reaction II produces a diol that is not meso. Let me think again.

The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. When reduced, each ketone becomes an alcohol. So the product is HOCH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps it's HOCH2-CH2-CHOH-CH2CH3. No, perhaps the structure is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but no, the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. Reducing each ketone gives CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, if both OH groups are on the same side, it's (R,R) or (S,S), which are enantiomers. But due to symmetry, perhaps it's a meso compound.

Wait, no. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound. So if the two OH groups are on opposite sides, the molecule is meso.

So the product is a meso compound, so it's a single compound, achiral.

Thus, in the chiral HPLC, it would give a single peak.

So in the chiral HPLC, Product I (single stereoisomer) and Product II (meso) would give two peaks.

In normal-phase HPLC, same: two peaks.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single enantiomer with two chiral centers, which would have four possible stereoisomers. But since the product is a single stereoisomer, it would elute as a single peak in chiral HPLC.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I has two chiral centers, but the reaction produces two diastereomers, leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product should be a single diastereomer.

I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think of the options.

Option D says 3 peaks in both columns.

How could that be?

Perhaps Reaction I produces two stereoisomers, and Reaction II produces one, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I produces three products, but that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single compound with two chiral centers, which has four stereoisomers in total, but only one is formed, leading to one peak in chiral HPLC. And Reaction II produces one, leading to two peaks in both columns.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the product of Reaction II. Maybe it's not a meso compound but a chiral one.

Wait, if the product of Reaction II is a vicinal diol with two chiral centers but without a plane of symmetry, then it would be a chiral compound with two stereoisomers.

But in that case, because the starting material is symmetrical, the product would be a meso compound, thus achiral.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the product of Reaction II, and it's not a meso compound. Let me think.

Pentane-2,4-dione: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Reduction with NaBH4 gives CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

This structure is symmetric across the central CH2 group. So the two OH groups are mirror images, leading to a meso compound. Thus, it's achiral.

So in the chiral HPLC, it would elute as a single peak.

So combining, two products: each gives one peak in both columns.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that can't be the case.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product of Reaction I is a racemic mixture, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, which would give two peaks in the chiral HPLC but one in the normal-phase.

But the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would be a single stereoisomer.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I has two chiral centers, and the reaction produces a racemic mixture, leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC.

But again, that's unlikely with LAH.

I'm stuck. Based on the options, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 3 peaks in both.

But I can't see how that would happen. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of peaks from each product.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two stereoisomers, and Reaction II produces one.

But I can't see that happening.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I produces a single product with two chiral centers, leading to four possible stereoisomers, but only one is formed, so in the chiral HPLC, it's a single peak. Reaction II produces a single product, so chiral HPLC has two peaks.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, another approach: think about how many peaks each product would produce in each HPLC.

Product I: has two chiral centers. If it's a single stereoisomer, it would give one peak in both columns.

Product II: is a meso compound, so one peak in both columns.

So combined, two peaks in both columns. But no option matches.

Hmm. I think I've spent enough time. Based on the analysis, I think the correct answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single compound with two chiral centers, leading to four possible stereoisomers, but only one is formed, so one peak in chiral HPLC. Reaction II is a meso compound, so one peak. So two peaks in both.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: 3 peaks in both.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a diastereomer with two stereoisomers, and Reaction II is a meso compound. So in chiral HPLC, 2 (from I) +1 (from II)=3. In normal-phase, 2 (from I) +1 (from II)=3.

But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I produces two stereoisomers (racemic), leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC, and one in normal-phase. Reaction II is meso, one peak in both. So total chiral: 2+1=3; normal:2+1=3. So option D.

But why would Reaction I produce a racemic mixture? Because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product should be a single stereoisomer.

I think I'm stuck, but I'll go with option B: 3 and 2.


The problem involves two reactions and analyzing the products using normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. Here's the analysis:

### Reaction I:
- **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.
- **Reagent**: LAH (a strong reducing agent).
- **Product**: The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol, resulting in 3-hexanol with a methoxy group at C5. The product has two chiral centers: C3 (new) and C5 (existing, S configuration).
- **Outcome**: The reaction is stereospecific, and the starting material is a single enantiomer. Thus, the product is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

### Reaction II:
- **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione (a symmetrical diketone).
- **Reagent**: NaBH4 (reduces ketones to alcohols).
- **Product**: The two ketones are reduced to alcohols, forming 2,4-pentanediol. Due to the symmetry of the starting material, the product is a meso compound, which is achiral.

### Combined Products:
1. **Product I**: A single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.
2. **Product II**: A meso compound, which is achiral.

### Analysis on HPLC Columns:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:
   - Separates compounds based on polarity.
   - Product I and Product II are two distinct compounds with different polarities.
   - **Result**: Two peaks.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - Separates enantiomers and diastereomers.
   - Product I is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers, so it elutes as one peak.
   - Product II is a meso compound and achiral, so it elutes as one peak.
   - **Result**: Two peaks.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC. **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC. **Incorrect**.
- **Option C**: 4 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC. **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The analysis indicates that there should be two peaks in both normal-phase and chiral HPLC. However, none of the options match this result. Based on the reasoning provided, **Option B** is the closest match, despite inconsistencies in the reasoning.
