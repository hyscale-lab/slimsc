Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let's see. The problem is about mixing acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I think I need to figure out how much acid and base are present and see what's left after they react.

The first step is probably to calculate the moles of each substance in each solution. Let me write down the given data. 

We have:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't completely dissociate, but maybe since it's being mixed with strong acid and base, I need to consider all reactions.

2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions.

3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. Each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions, right?

Wait, but when mixing them, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base. So I need to calculate the total moles of H+ and the total moles of OH-, then see which one is in excess. If H+ is in excess, the solution will be acidic, and if OH- is in excess, it'll be basic. If they're exactly neutral, the solution would be neutral, but that's probably not the case here.

Let me start with each solution.

First, calculate moles for each:

1. CH3COOH:
Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters)
Volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L.
Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.5 L = 0.05 mol.

But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't release all H+ ions. But wait, when you mix it with a strong base, maybe the OH- will react with the H+ from all sources. Hmm, maybe I need to think about all H+ and OH- sources.

Wait, but the problem is about mixing all three solutions together. So the total volume will be 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

But first, let's find the moles of each component.

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. But since Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- per formula unit, the moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, the H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base. But which acids are present? Acetic acid (weak) and HCl (strong). So the H+ from HCl and some from CH3COOH will react with OH-.

Wait, but maybe we need to consider the total H+ and OH- in the mixture.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. So the H+ from CH3COOH isn't as straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps we can treat it as contributing a certain amount of H+.

But this might complicate things. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH, but since HCl is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate, so its H+ will be available in full. But CH3COOH only partially dissociates, so maybe the OH- will react with H+ from HCl first, and then any remaining OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, this might get complicated. Let me think. The OH- will react with any available H+.

So first, calculate the total H+ from all acids, and the total OH- from the base.

Wait, but CH3COOH is an acid, so it will contribute H+.

Wait, but the initial step is to find the net H+ or OH- after mixing. So maybe I should find the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid. So each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid. Let's say it produces 'x' moles of H+ per mole. But without knowing the exact dissociation, maybe we can't proceed that way. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, another thought: when mixing solutions, the strong acid and strong base will react completely. The weak acid will react only if there's excess base left after neutralizing the strong acid.

Alternatively, maybe the way to approach this is to calculate the total H+ from all acids and the total OH- from the base, subtract the smaller from the larger to see if there's excess, and then determine which is in excess and calculate pH accordingly.

But then, the problem is that CH3COOH is a weak acid. So how much H+ does it contribute? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of excess OH- will cause the solution to be basic, but if the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH is more, then the solution will be acidic.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed step by step.

First, find the moles of H+ from HCl.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol HCl → 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH- → 0.18 mol OH-.

CH3COOH: 0.05 mol → but it's a weak acid, so the H+ it contributes is less than 0.05.

Wait, but when you mix the solutions, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.

So first, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from HCl.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08.

Moles of OH-: 0.18.

So OH- will neutralize 0.08 mol H+, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH-.

Now, this remaining OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so let's think about how much H+ it can provide.

Wait, but when OH- is present, it can deprotonate the CH3COOH. So the OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

The reaction is: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So each mole of OH- consumes one mole of CH3COOH and produces one mole of acetate.

So initial moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 mol.

Moles of OH- after neutralizing HCl: 0.10 mol.

So OH- can react with 0.05 mol of CH3COOH, because that's all there is.

Wait, 0.10 mol OH- is more than 0.05 mol CH3COOH. So all the CH3COOH will react, and there will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH- left.

So after all reactions, the OH- remaining is 0.05 mol.

Wait, but wait, the volume is now the sum of all three solutions, which is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, pOH is the negative log of that.

Wait, let me calculate that.

Concentration of OH- = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667).

Log(0.0416667) is about log(4.16667e-2).

Log(4.16667e-2) = log(4.16667) + log(1e-2) ≈ 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802.

So pOH = 1.3802.

Then pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.3802 ≈ 12.6198.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps.

Wait, another approach: calculate the total H+ and total OH-.

Wait, let me list the moles again.

HCl: 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH: 0.05 mol. But since it's a weak acid, it contributes less H+. But when OH- is present, it will deprotonate CH3COOH, producing acetate ions and water.

Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol OH-.

So total H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) --> but the CH3COOH's H+ is less than 0.05.

But when OH- is added, it will first neutralize H+ from HCl (strong acid), then any remaining OH- will neutralize the weak acid's H+.

So HCl provides 0.08 mol H+.

OH- is 0.18 mol.

So 0.08 mol H+ reacts with 0.08 mol OH-, leaving 0.10 mol OH-.

This OH- will react with CH3COOH. Since CH3COOH has 0.05 mol, all of it will be neutralized, and 0.05 mol OH- remains.

Thus, the solution's excess is OH-, so the solution is basic.

The concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.0416667 M.

As calculated before, pOH is about 1.38, so pH is 12.62. So the answer is A.

Wait, but another thing to consider: any other sources of H+ or OH-?

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; it completely dissociates into Ba²+ and OH-.

HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate much, but in the presence of OH-, it will react to form acetate.

So all steps considered, I think the calculation is correct.

To determine the pH of the solution, we first calculate the moles of each component:

1. **CH₃COOH**:  
   Moles = Molarity × Volume = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
   CH₃COOH is a weak acid, so it contributes some H⁺ ions, but its dissociation is limited.

2. **HCl**:  
   Moles = Molarity × Volume = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
   HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates into \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Moles = Molarity × Volume = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into two OH⁻ ions, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

Next, we analyze the reaction between the acids and the base. The OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)₂ will neutralize the H⁺ ions from HCl and CH₃COOH:

1. **Neutralization of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   OH⁻ reacts with \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \), leaving:  
   \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- - 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

2. **Neutralization of H⁺ from CH₃COOH**:  
   The remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) reacts with CH₃COOH. Since CH₃COOH has \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \), all of it is neutralized, leaving:  
   \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- - 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

After neutralization, the solution contains \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \). The total volume of the solution is:  
\( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  

The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of OH}^-}{\text{volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
\]

Finally, the pH is:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let's see. The problem is about mixing acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other.

Wait, but when mixing them, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base. So I need to calculate the total moles of H+ and the total moles of OH-, then see which one is in excess. If H+ is in excess, the solution will be acidic, and if OH- is in excess, it'll be basic.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. But since Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- per formula unit, the moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed step by step.

First, find the moles of H+ from HCl.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol HCl → 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH- → 0.18 mol OH-.

CH3COOH: 0.05 mol → but it's a weak acid, so the H+ it contributes is less than 0.05.

Wait, but when you mix the solutions, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.

So first, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from HCl.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08.

Moles of OH-: 0.18.

So OH- will neutralize 0.08 mol H+, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH-.

Now, this remaining OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so let's think about how much H+ it can provide.

Wait, but when OH- is present, it can deprotonate the CH3COOH. So the OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

The reaction is: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So each mole of OH- consumes one mole of CH3COOH and produces one mole of acetate.

So initial moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 mol.

Moles of OH- after neutralizing HCl: 0.10 mol.

So OH- can react with 0.05 mol of CH3COOH, because that's all there is.

Wait, 0.10 mol OH- is more than 0.05 mol CH3COOH. So all the CH3COOH will react, and there will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH- left.

So after all reactions, the OH- remaining is 0.05 mol.

Wait, but wait, the volume is now the sum of all three solutions, which is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, pOH is the negative log of that.

Wait, let me calculate that.

Concentration of OH- = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667).

Log(0.0416667) is about log(4.16667e-2).

Log(4.16667e-2) = log(4.16667) + log(1e-2) ≈ 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802.

So pOH = 1.3802.

Then pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.3802 ≈ 12.6198.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps.

Wait, another approach: calculate the total H+ and total OH-.

Wait, let me list the moles again.

HCl: 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH: 0.05 mol. But since it's a weak acid, it contributes less H+. But when OH- is present, it will deprotonate CH3COOH, producing acetate ions and water.

Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol OH-.

So total H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) --> but the CH3COOH's H+ is less than 0.05.

But when OH- is added, it will first neutralize H+ from HCl (strong acid), then any remaining OH- will neutralize the weak acid's H+.

So HCl provides 0.08 mol H+.

OH- is 0.18 mol.

So 0.08 mol H+ reacts with 0.08 mol OH-, leaving 0.10 mol OH-.

This OH- will react with CH3COOH. Since CH3COOH has 0.05 mol, all of it will be neutralized, and 0.05 mol OH- remains.

Thus, the solution's excess is OH-, so the solution is basic.

The concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.0416667 M.

As calculated before, pOH is about 1.38, so pH is 12.62. So the answer is A.

Wait, but another thing to consider: any other sources of H+ or OH-?

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; it completely dissociates into Ba²+ and OH-.

HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate much, but in the presence of OH-, it will react to form acetate.

So all steps considered, I think the calculation is correct.


To determine the pH of the solution, we first calculate the moles of each component:

1. **CH₃COOH**:  
   Moles = Molarity × Volume = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
   CH₃COOH is a weak acid, so it contributes some H⁺ ions, but its dissociation is limited.

2. **HCl**:  
   Moles = Molarity × Volume = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
   HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates into \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Moles = Molarity × Volume = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into two OH⁻ ions, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

Next, we analyze the reaction between the acids and the base. The OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)₂ will neutralize the H⁺ ions from HCl and CH₃COOH:

1. **Neutralization of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   OH⁻ reacts with \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \), leaving:  
   \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- - 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

2. **Neutralization of H⁺ from CH₃COOH**:  
   The remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) reacts with CH₃COOH. Since CH₃COOH has \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \), all of it is neutralized, leaving:  
   \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- - 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

After neutralization, the solution contains \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \). The total volume of the solution is:  
\( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  

The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of OH}^-}{\text{volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
\]

Finally, the pH is:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**.  

Answer: A
