Okay, so I've got this question about the comoving distance of a quasar based on some observations. Hmm, let's try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I think I can figure this out.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that when quasars emit light, their emission lines can be broad, but I'm trying to connect this to redshift. Oh wait, the peak wavelength might be related to the Lyman-alpha emission line. Lyman-alpha is usually around 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But wait, the observed wavelength is longer, so that must mean it's redshifted.

So, the Lyman-alpha line is emitted at about 121.6 nm. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's a redshift z calculation. Let me think about how to calculate that. The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1. So plugging in the numbers: z = 790 / 121.6 - 1. Let me calculate that.

790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.5 (since 121.6 *6 is 729.6, and 121.6 *6.5 is about 789.8, which is really close to 790). So z is approximately 6.5-1=5.5. Wait no, wait, no. Wait, 790 /121.6 is roughly 6.5, right? So then z is 6.5-1=5.5. So the redshift z is about 5.5.

Now, the next part is figuring out the comoving distance for a universe with specific parameters. The given cosmological model is Lambda-CDM, with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m=0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda=0.7, and it's flat (so Omega_total is 1, which checks out because 0.3 +0.7=1).

Comoving distance D_C is the distance that would be measured by an observer to a distant object, integrating the expansion of the universe from the time of emission to now. The formula for comoving distance depends on the redshift and the cosmological parameters. The formula is something like D_C = (1+z) * integral from 0 to z of [1/sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z')^3w)] dz', but wait, no, more accurately, it's the integral of c/(H(a)) da, but since a = 1/(1+z), it's better to write it in terms of z.

Wait, let me get the correct formula. The comoving distance is D_C = (c / H0) * integral from 0 to z [ 1 / sqrt( Omega_m*(1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z')^{3(1+w)} ) ] dz'. Wait, but for dark energy modeled as a cosmological constant, w = -1. So the term becomes (1+z')^3(1-1) ) = (1+z')^0 =1. So the denominator becomes sqrt( Omega_m*(1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda )

Wait, yes, because dark energy contributes as (1+z')^3*(1 + w) where w= -1, so it becomes (1+z')^0. So the integrand is 1/sqrt(Ωm (1+z')^3 + Ωλ ). 

But calculating that integral for z=5.5 is tricky. I'm not going to compute it exactly because I don't remember the exact numbers, but I know that at high redshifts (z ~5), the matter density is significant, but dark energy starts to dominate at lower redshifts, say z < 1 or so. So for z=5.5, matter density would be higher, so the expansion rate is slower compared to dark energy dominated era.

Wait, but how does this affect the comoving distance? The comoving distance depends on the integral of 1/H(a), which for a matter dominated universe would be different than a dark energy dominated one. But since z=5.5 is quite high, the universe is matter dominated, so H(a) would be dominated by matter density. So the expansion during that period would be slower, meaning that the distance would be larger than some lower z case.

Alternatively, I can think about the lookback time. But perhaps an easier approach is to remember that for high redshifts (z~1), comoving distances are around a few Gpc. For higher z, say z=2, it's about 10 Gpc? Hmm, not sure. But wait, let's think about the current Hubble constant. H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. So 1/H0 is about 14 billion years, approximately. Because H0 = 70 = 7e4 m/s / Mpc. Wait, 1 Mpc is ~3.086e22 m. So 70 km/s/Mpc is 7e4 m/s / 3.086e22 m = approximately 2.27e-18 s^-1. To get the inverse H0 in seconds: 1/(2.27e-18) ≈ 4.4e17 seconds. Since a year is about 3.15e7 seconds, 4.4e17 / 3.15e7 ~ about 1.4e10 years, which is ~14 billion years. So 1/H0 is about 14 billion years.

But wait, the comoving distance D_C is (c/H0) multiplied by some factor from the integral. For a matter dominated universe (Omega_m=1, Omega_lambda=0), the comoving distance at high z is D_C = (c/H0) * (2/(3 H0)) (1 + z)^{3/2} }? Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas.

Alternatively, the comoving distance can be approximated for a matter dominated universe as D_C ≈ (c/H0) * (2/3) (1 + z)^{3/2}, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the integral for the comoving distance.

Wait, the integral is from 0 to z of 1/sqrt( Ωm (1+z')^3 + Ωλ ) dz'. For high z, (1+z')^3 term dominates, so we can approximate the integrand as 1/sqrt(Ωm (1+z')^3) ) = 1/(sqrt(Ωm) (1+z')^{3/2} )

So the integral becomes ∫0^z [1/(sqrt(Ωm) (1+z')^{3/2}) ) ] dz'

Let me make substitution u = 1+z'. Then du = dz', when z'=0, u=1; z'=z, u=1+z.

So integral becomes ∫1^{1+z} [1/(sqrt(Ωm) u^{3/2}) ) ] du

The integral of u^(-3/2) du is  -2 u^(-1/2) + C.

So evaluating from 1 to 1+z gives:

[ -2/(sqrt(u)) ) ] from 1 to 1+z.

Which is (-2/(sqrt(1+z)) ) + 2/(sqrt(1)) ) 

= 2 [ 1 - 1/ sqrt(1+z) ]

So the entire integral is (1/sqrt(Ωm)) ) * 2 [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

So putting it all together, D_C = (c/H0) * (1/(sqrt(Ωm)) ) * 2 [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

Wait, but wait, c is speed of light. Let's compute this.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s.

H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. So c/H0 is 3e5 /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc.

Then, 1/sqrt(Ωm) = 1/sqrt(0.3) ≈ 1.826.

So for z=5.5, 1 + z=6.5, sqrt(1+z) is sqrt(6.5)≈2.55. So 1/sqrt(1+z) ≈ 0.392.

So 1 - 0.392 = 0.608.

So the integral becomes 2 * 0.608 * 1.826 ≈ 2 * 0.608 * 1.826.

Calculate that: 0.608 *1.826≈1.11, multiplied by 2 is about 2.22.

So D_C ≈ (4285.7 Mpc ) * 2.22 ≈ 4285.7 *2.22 ≈ approx 9500 Mpc.

Wait, 4285.7 is approx 4.2857e3 Mpc. 4.2857e3 *2.22 is approximately 9.5e3 Mpc, which is about 9.5 Gpc.

Wait, but I'm using the matter-dominated approximation here. Since in reality, the universe is flat and has dark energy, which affects the expansion history. The presence of dark energy would cause the expansion to accelerate at lower redshifts, but at high z, matter dominates, so the integral would be similar to the matter only case.

Wait, but if the universe is flat and has dark energy, the integral would be less than the matter-only case because dark energy adds more energy, making the expansion faster, which would reduce the comoving distance. Or wait, no. Let me think again. The integrand is 1/sqrt( Ωm (1+z')^3 + Ωλ ). At high z, the first term dominates, so the integrand is similar to the matter-only case. But for lower z, the second term becomes more significant. So the overall integral would be a bit less than the matter-only case because in the dark energy scenario, the expansion is faster at lower redshifts, which would shorten the comoving distance compared to a matter-only universe. Wait, but the comoving distance depends on the integral of 1/H(a) da. Because H(a) is higher (due to dark energy accelerating expansion) at lower z, the integral would be smaller. So in this case, the comoving distance would be a bit less than the matter-only case of ~9.5 Gpc. So perhaps around 8-9 Gpc.

But wait, the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. So the matter dominated calculation gave us about 9.5 Gpc, but the correct calculation (with dark energy) would be a bit less. So maybe around 8-9 Gpc.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating this. Another approach is to remember that for a given H0, the comoving distance at high redshifts (z>>1) is approximately D_C ≈ (c/H0) * (2/3) (1 + z)^{3/2} / sqrt(Ωm). For z=5.5, 1+z=6.5.

So (1+z)^{3/2}= (6.5)^{1.5} = sqrt(6.5^3). 6.5^3 is 274.625. sqrt(274.625) is about 16.56.

So (2/3)*16.56 ≈ 11.04.

Multiply by (c/H0)= 3e5/(70) Mpc = approx 4285.7 Mpc.

So 4285.7 Mpc * 11.04 ≈ 47,300 Mpc, which is 47.3 Gpc. Wait, that can't be right because that's way higher than the options. Wait, perhaps this isn't the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (c/H0) * (2/(3*sqrt(Ωm))) ) * (1 + z)^{3/2} )

Wait, but that would be (3e5 /70) * (2/(3 * sqrt(0.3))) ) * (6.5)^(3/2 )

Let me compute that.

Compute each part:

c/H0 = 3e5 km/s /70 km/s/Mpc = 3e5/70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc.

Multiply by 2/(3 * sqrt(0.3)).

sqrt(0.3) is ~0.5477.

So 2/(3*0.5477) ≈ 2/(1.643) ≈ 1.217.

Multiply by (6.5)^(3/2)= sqrt(6.5^3)= sqrt(274.625)= ~16.56.

So 4285.7 *1.217 *16.56.

Wait, 4285.7 *1.217≈ 4285.7 *1.2 is 5142.8, plus 4285.7 *0.017≈72.85 → total ≈5215.65.

Multiply by 16.56: 5215.65 *16.56 ≈ let's approximate.

5215 *16 = 83,440.

5215 *0.56= 2,921. So total ≈86,361 Mpc ≈86 Gpc. That's way higher than any of the options. So something's wrong with this approach.

Maybe I'm using the wrong approach. Another way: I can recall that for the standard Lambda-CDM model with H0=70, Omega_m=0.3, the luminosity distance for a given z can be looked up in tables or computed numerically. But since I can't do that right now, I have to think of another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 790 nm is actually not Lyman-alpha. Let me think if there are any other lines that could peak around that wavelength. Wait, 790 nm is in the near infrared. Hydrogen's Lyman series has lines in the UV, but perhaps the Balmer series (like H-alpha) is in the visible. H-alpha has rest wavelength about 656 nm. So if the observed wavelength is 790, that's a redshift of (790/656) -1 ≈ 1.204. So z≈0.204.

Wait, that's a much lower redshift! So maybe I mixed up the lines. H-alpha is a prominent line in optical. So if the peak is at 790 nm, which is longer than 656 nm, that suggests that the object is moving away (redshifted) so z = (790/656) -1. Let me compute that.

790 divided by 656 is approximately 1.204. So z≈0.204.

Wait, that's a very different redshift. So this would imply that the quasar is much closer.

But why would the flux drop below 790 nm? The H-alpha emission line is at 656 nm, but if the quasar's emission is at 790 nm, then that's a redshift of about 0.204, so the comoving distance would be less.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the lines. Hydrogen's Lyman-alpha is 121.6 nm, Balmer-alpha is 656.3 nm. So if an emission line is observed at 790 nm, which is in the near-infrared, then it's either H-alpha from a galaxy at a certain z, or maybe another line. But if it's a quasar, maybe it's the Lyman-alpha line being observed redshifted.

Wait, wait, 790 nm is way longer than H-alpha's 656 nm. Let me see: If the quasar's emission is at 790 nm, and the rest frame is 121.6 nm (Lyman-alpha), then the redshift would be (790/121.6) -1 ≈ 790/121.6 is about 6.5, so z=5.5 as I thought earlier. But then, why does the flux drop below 790 nm? Because shorter wavelengths (bluer) would be absorbed by the intergalactic medium (like the Gunn-Peterson trough for Lyman-alpha at high z), so we wouldn't see emission lines in the rest frame UV being observed at such high z because the IGM would absorb them.

Wait, but in the question, the flux drops for wavelengths shorter than 790 nm. So if the peak is at 790, and the flux drops below that, perhaps that's the Lyman-alpha line. Wait, but Lyman-alpha is in the UV when emitted, but observed in the near-infrared if the redshift is high.

Wait, but if the quasar is at z=5.5, then the Lyman-alpha emission would be observed at 121.6*(1+5.5)= 121.6 *6.5=790.4 nm. So the observed line is at 790.4, which matches the peak. So the flux drops below that because the IGM absorption prevents us from seeing the UV part, which is now observed in the optical. So yes, the peak is the Lyman-alpha line, and the drop-off is due to the IGM.

So z=5.5.

Now, what's the comoving distance for z=5.5 in the given cosmology.

I think I have to find D_C = (c/H0) * ∫0^z [1/sqrt(Ωm (1+z')^3 + Ωλ ) ] dz'

But calculating this integral is a bit involved. Alternatively, I can use approximate formulas or remember that for high z, D_C is on the order of several Gpc.

But I remember that for z=1, the comoving distance is about 1.6 billion light-years, which is about 500 Mpc. Wait, no, maybe that's the proper distance. Wait, perhaps more accurately, using the cosmology parameters, D_C for z=5.5 can be found using a calculator or lookup table, but since I can't do that, I have to estimate.

Alternatively, I can think about the lookback time, but comoving distance is more directly used here.

Another approach: I can use the approximation for comoving distance for a flat universe with matter and dark energy.

The integral might be approximated as:

Integral = ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ωm (1+z')^3 + Ωλ ) ] dz'

But without dark energy, it would be ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ωm (1+z')^3 ) ] dz' = ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ωm) (1+z')^{-3/2} ] dz' 

Which as before gives 2/(3*sqrt(Ωm)) ) [ (1+z)^{3/2} -1 ]

But with dark energy, the integrand is lower for lower z, so the integral is a bit larger than the matter-only case.

Wait, no. Dark energy contributes more as the universe expands, so the integrand (1/sqrt(...)) would be lower at lower z, but higher at higher z.

Wait, no. Because at high z, the dark energy term is negligible, so the integrand is similar to the matter case. At lower z, the dark energy term becomes significant, and the integrand is higher because the denominator is bigger.

Wait, dark energy contributes positively to the denominator, so 1/sqrt( ... ) would be smaller. So the integrand is smaller when dark energy is significant, leading to a smaller integral. So the comoving distance would be smaller than in the matter-only case.

So for z=5.5, using both matter and dark energy, the comoving distance would be a bit less than the matter-only case.

Earlier, I calculated the matter-only case as about 9.5 Gpc. So with dark energy, perhaps around 8 Gpc.

Looking at the options, option D is 7 Gpc, option B is 8 Gpc, option C is 9 Gpc.

So between 8 and 9. Since the dark energy makes the distance a bit less than 9.5, maybe around 8 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the standard ruler or something else. Another thought: the comoving distance for z=5.5 in a flat universe with Ωm=0.3 and Ωλ=0.7 is about 8 Gpc.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, I can think about approximate values for high redshifts. 

Wait, some sources say that for high z, the comoving distance is approximately given by D_C ≈ (c/H0) * (1+z) / sqrt(Ωm) ) * (some factor). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can think of the scale factor a=1/(1+z)=1/6.5≈0.1538.

The integral would be from a=1/(1+z)=0.1538 to a=1. The integral becomes ∫0.1538^1 [1/(H(a)/c)] da.

H(a)= H0 * sqrt( Ωm a^{-3} + Ωλ )

So 1/(H(a)/c) = c/(H0) * 1/sqrt(Ωm a^{-3} + Ωλ )

= (c/H0) * 1/sqrt( Ωm (1/a)^3 + Ωλ )

Which is similar to the previous approach.

But without doing a numerical integration, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 790 nm is not Lyman-alpha but another line. Let me think about other possible lines. For example, He II 1640 is another emission line in the UV. Its rest wavelength is 1640 Å, which is 164 nm. Observed at 790 nm would give z=(790/164) -1≈4.81.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe it's some other line. But regardless, if I assume z=5.5, the comoving distance would be about 8 Gpc, given the options.

So among the options, 8 Gpc is option B, 7 Gpc is D, 9 is C.

Another thought: I recall that at z=2, comoving distance is about 3 Gpc, and at z=5, it's about 8 Gpc or so. So with z=5.5, it's likely around 8 Gpc.

So the answer should be B) 8 Gpc.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the comoving distance of the quasar, we start by analyzing the observed peak at 790 nm. This peak is interpreted as the Lyman-alpha emission line of hydrogen, which has a rest wavelength of 121.6 nm. The redshift \( z \) is calculated using the formula:

\[
z = \frac{\text{observed wavelength}}{\text{rest wavelength}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121.6} - 1 \approx 6.5 - 1 = 5.5
\]

Thus, the quasar has a redshift of \( z \approx 5.5 \).

Next, we calculate the comoving distance \( D_C \) for a universe defined by the Lambda-CDM model with the following parameters:
- Hubble constant \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \),
- Matter density parameter \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \),
- Dark energy density parameter \( \Omega_\lambda = 0.7 \),
- Flat universe (\( \Omega_{\text{total}} = 1 \)).

The comoving distance is given by:

\[
D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\lambda}} \, dz'
\]

Here, \( c \) is the speed of light. For \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), the term \( c/H_0 \) is approximately \( 4285.7 \, \text{Mpc} \). The integral depends on the cosmological parameters and the redshift \( z \). At high redshifts (\( z \gg 1 \)), the universe is matter-dominated, and the integral can be approximated. However, the presence of dark energy slightly modifies the expansion history, reducing the comoving distance compared to a matter-only universe.

For \( z = 5.5 \), the comoving distance is expected to be on the order of several gigaparsecs. Based on approximate calculations and known results for similar cosmological parameters, the comoving distance for \( z = 5.5 \) is approximately \( 8 \, \text{Gpc} \). This value aligns with the given options and accounts for the effects of both matter and dark energy.

Among the options provided:
- \( 6 \, \text{Gpc} \) (Option A) is too low.
- \( 8 \, \text{Gpc} \) (Option B) is consistent with the expected value.
- \( 9 \, \text{Gpc} \) (Option C) is too high.
- \( 7 \, \text{Gpc} \) (Option D) is close but slightly lower than the expected value.

Thus, the most reasonable estimate for the comoving distance is \( 8 \, \text{Gpc} \).

Okay, so I've got this question about the comoving distance of a quasar based on some observations. Hmm, let's try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I think I can figure this out.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that when quasars emit light, their emission lines can be broad, but I'm trying to connect this to redshift. Oh wait, the peak wavelength might be related to the Lyman-alpha emission line. Lyman-alpha is usually around 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But wait, the observed wavelength is longer, so that must mean it's redshifted.

So, the Lyman-alpha line is emitted at about 121.6 nm. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's a redshift z calculation. Let me think about how to calculate that. The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1. So plugging in the numbers: z = 790 / 121.6 - 1. Let me calculate that.

790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.5 (since 121.6 *6 is 729.6, and 121.6 *6.5 is about 789.8, which is really close to 790). So z is approximately 6.5-1=5.5. Wait no, wait, no. Wait, 790 /121.6 is roughly 6.5, right? So then z is 6.5-1=5.5. So the redshift z is about 5.5.

Now, the next part is figuring out the comoving distance for a universe with specific parameters. The given cosmological model is Lambda-CDM, with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m=0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda=0.7, and it's flat (so Omega_total is 1, which checks out because 0.3 +0.7=1).

Comoving distance D_C is the distance that would be measured by an observer to a distant object, integrating the expansion of the universe from the time of emission to now. The formula for comoving distance depends on the redshift and the cosmological parameters. The formula is something like D_C = (1+z) * integral from 0 to z of [1/sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z')^3w)] dz', but wait, no, more accurately, it's the integral of c/(H(a)) da, but since a = 1/(1+z), it's better to write it in terms of z.

Wait, let me get the correct formula. The comoving distance is D_C = (c / H0) * integral from 0 to z [ 1 / sqrt( Omega_m*(1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z')^{3(1+w)} ) ] dz'. Wait, but for dark energy modeled as a cosmological constant, w = -1. So the term becomes (1+z')^3(1-1) ) = (1+z')^0 =1. So the denominator becomes sqrt( Omega_m*(1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda )

Wait, yes, because dark energy contributes as (1+z')^3*(1 + w) where w= -1, so it becomes (1+z')^0. So the integrand is 1/sqrt(Ωm (1+z')^3 + Ωλ ). 

But calculating that integral for z=5.5 is tricky. I'm not going to compute it exactly because I don't remember the exact numbers, but I know that at high redshifts (z ~5), the matter density is significant, but dark energy starts to dominate at lower redshifts, say z < 1 or so. So for z=5.5, matter density would be higher, so the expansion rate is slower compared to dark energy dominated era.

Wait, but how does this affect the comoving distance? The comoving distance depends on the integral of 1/H(a), which for a matter dominated universe would be different than a dark energy dominated one. But since z=5.5 is quite high, the universe is matter dominated, so H(a) would be dominated by matter density. So the expansion during that period would be slower, meaning that the distance would be larger than some lower z case.

Alternatively, I can think about the lookback time. But perhaps an easier approach is to remember that for high redshifts (z~1), comoving distances are around a few Gpc. For higher z, say z=2, it's about 10 Gpc? Hmm, not sure. But wait, let's think about the current Hubble constant. H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. So 1/H0 is about 14 billion years, approximately. Because H0 = 70 = 7e4 m/s / Mpc. Wait, 1 Mpc is ~3.086e22 m. So 70 km/s/Mpc is 7e4 m/s / 3.086e22 m = approximately 2.27e-18 s^-1. To get the inverse H0 in seconds: 1/(2.27e-18) ≈ 4.4e17 seconds. Since a year is about 3.15e7 seconds, 4.4e17 / 3.15e7 ~ about 1.4e10 years, which is ~14 billion years. So 1/H0 is about 14 billion years.

But wait, the comoving distance D_C is (c/H0) multiplied by some factor from the integral. For a matter dominated universe (Omega_m=1, Omega_lambda=0), the comoving distance at high z is D_C = (c/H0) * (2/(3 H0)) (1 + z)^{3/2} }? Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas.

Alternatively, the comoving distance can be approximated for a matter dominated universe as D_C ≈ (c/H0) * (2/3) (1 + z)^{3/2}, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the integral for the comoving distance.

Wait, the integral is from 0 to z of 1/sqrt( Ωm (1+z')^3 + Ωλ ) dz'. For high z, (1+z')^3 term dominates, so we can approximate the integrand as 1/sqrt(Ωm (1+z')^3) ) = 1/(sqrt(Ωm) (1+z')^{3/2} )

So the integral becomes ∫0^z [1/(sqrt(Ωm) (1+z')^{3/2}) ) ] dz'

Let me make substitution u = 1+z'. Then du = dz', when z'=0, u=1; z'=z, u=1+z.

So integral becomes ∫1^{1+z} [1/(sqrt(Ωm) u^{3/2}) ) ] du

The integral of u^(-3/2) du is  -2 u^(-1/2) + C.

So evaluating from 1 to 1+z gives:

[ -2/(sqrt(u)) ) ] from 1 to 1+z.

Which is (-2/(sqrt(1+z)) ) + 2/(sqrt(1)) ) 

= 2 [ 1 - 1/ sqrt(1+z) ]

So the entire integral is (1/sqrt(Ωm)) ) * 2 [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

So putting it all together, D_C = (c/H0) * (1/(sqrt(Ωm)) ) * 2 [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

Wait, but wait, c is speed of light. Let's compute this.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s.

H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. So c/H0 is 3e5 /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc.

Then, 1/sqrt(Ωm) = 1/sqrt(0.3) ≈ 1.826.

So for z=5.5, 1 + z=6.5, sqrt(1+z) is sqrt(6.5)≈2.55. So 1/sqrt(1+z) ≈ 0.392.

So 1 - 0.392 = 0.608.

So the integral becomes 2 * 0.608 * 1.826 ≈ 2 * 0.608 * 1.826.

Calculate that: 0.608 *1.826≈1.11, multiplied by 2 is about 2.22.

So D_C ≈ (4285.7 Mpc ) * 2.22 ≈ 4285.7 *2.22 ≈ approx 9500 Mpc.

Wait, 4285.7 is approx 4.2857e3 Mpc. 4.2857e3 *2.22 is approximately 9.5e3 Mpc, which is about 9.5 Gpc.

Wait, but I'm using the matter-dominated approximation here. Since in reality, the universe is flat and has dark energy, which affects the expansion history. The presence of dark energy would cause the expansion to accelerate at lower redshifts, but at high z, matter dominates, so the integral would be similar to the matter only case.

Wait, but if the universe is flat and has dark energy, the integral would be less than the matter-only case because dark energy adds more energy, making the expansion faster, which would reduce the comoving distance. Or wait, no. Let me think again. The integrand is 1/sqrt( Ωm (1+z')^3 + Ωλ ). At high z, the first term dominates, so the integrand is similar to the matter-only case. But for lower z, the second term becomes more significant. So the overall integral would be a bit less than the matter-only case because in the dark energy scenario, the expansion is faster at lower redshifts, which would shorten the comoving distance compared to a matter-only universe. Wait, but the comoving distance depends on the integral of 1/H(a) da. Because H(a) is higher (due to dark energy accelerating expansion) at lower z, the integral would be smaller. So in this case, the comoving distance would be a bit less than the matter-only case of ~9.5 Gpc. So perhaps around 8-9 Gpc.

But wait, the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. So the matter dominated calculation gave us about 9.5 Gpc, but the correct calculation (with dark energy) would be a bit less. So maybe around 8-9 Gpc.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating this. Another approach is to remember that for a given H0, the comoving distance at high redshifts (z>>1) is approximately D_C ≈ (c/H0) * (2/3) (1 + z)^{3/2} / sqrt(Ωm). For z=5.5, 1+z=6.5.

So (1+z)^{3/2}= (6.5)^{1.5} = sqrt(6.5^3). 6.5^3 is 274.625. sqrt(274.625) is about 16.56.

So (2/3)*16.56 ≈ 11.04.

Multiply by (c/H0)= 3e5/(70) Mpc = approx 4285.7 Mpc.

So 4285.7 Mpc * 11.04 ≈ 47,300 Mpc, which is 47.3 Gpc. Wait, that can't be right because that's way higher than the options. Wait, perhaps this isn't the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (c/H0) * (2/(3*sqrt(Ωm))) ) * (1 + z)^{3/2} )

Wait, but that would be (3e5 /70) * (2/(3 * sqrt(0.3))) ) * (6.5)^(3/2 )

Let me compute that.

Compute each part:

c/H0 = 3e5 km/s /70 km/s/Mpc = 3e5/70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc.

Multiply by 2/(3 * sqrt(0.3)).

sqrt(0.3) is ~0.5477.

So 2/(3*0.5477) ≈ 2/(1.643) ≈ 1.217.

Multiply by (6.5)^(3/2)= sqrt(6.5^3)= sqrt(274.625)= ~16.56.

So 4285.7 *1.217 *16.56.

Wait, 4285.7 *1.217≈ 4285.7 *1.2 is 5142.8, plus 4285.7 *0.017≈72.85 → total ≈5215.65.

Multiply by 16.56: 5215.65 *16.56 ≈ let's approximate.

5215 *16 = 83,440.

5215 *0.56= 2,921. So total ≈86,361 Mpc ≈86 Gpc. That's way higher than any of the options. So something's wrong with this approach.

Maybe I'm using the wrong approach. Another way: I can recall that for the standard Lambda-CDM model with H0=70, Omega_m=0.3, the luminosity distance for a given z can be looked up in tables or computed numerically. But since I can't do that right now, I have to think of another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 790 nm is actually not Lyman-alpha. Let me think if there are any other lines that could peak around that wavelength. Wait, 790 nm is in the near infrared. Hydrogen's Lyman series has lines in the UV, but perhaps the Balmer series (like H-alpha) is in the visible. H-alpha has rest wavelength about 656 nm. So if the observed wavelength is 790, that's a redshift of (790/656) -1 ≈ 1.204. So z≈0.204.

Wait, that's a much lower redshift! So maybe I mixed up the lines. H-alpha is a prominent line in optical. So if the peak is at 790 nm, which is longer than 656 nm, that suggests that the object is moving away (redshifted) so z = (790/656) -1. Let me compute that.

790 divided by 656 is approximately 1.204. So z≈0.204.

Wait, that's a very different redshift. So this would imply that the quasar is much closer.

But why would the flux drop below 790 nm? The H-alpha emission line is at 656 nm, but if the quasar's emission is at 790 nm, then that's a redshift of about 0.204, so the comoving distance would be less.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the lines. Hydrogen's Lyman-alpha is 121.6 nm, Balmer-alpha is 656.3 nm. So if an emission line is observed at 790 nm, which is in the near-infrared, then it's either H-alpha from a galaxy at a certain z, or maybe another line. But if it's a quasar, maybe it's the Lyman-alpha line being observed redshifted.

Wait, wait, 790 nm is way longer than H-alpha's 656 nm. Let me see: If the quasar's emission is at 790 nm, and the rest frame is 121.6 nm (Lyman-alpha), then the redshift would be (790/121.6) -1 ≈ 790/121.6 is about 6.5, so z=5.5 as I thought earlier. But then, why does the flux drop below 790 nm? Because shorter wavelengths (bluer) would be absorbed by the intergalactic medium (like the Gunn-Peterson trough for Lyman-alpha at high z), so we wouldn't see emission lines in the rest frame UV being observed at such high z because the IGM would absorb them.

Wait, but in the question, the flux drops for wavelengths shorter than 790 nm. So if the peak is at 790, and the flux drops below that, perhaps that's the Lyman-alpha line. Wait, but Lyman-alpha is in the UV when emitted, but observed in the near-infrared if the redshift is high.

Wait, but if the quasar is at z=5.5, then the Lyman-alpha emission would be observed at 121.6*(1+5.5)= 121.6 *6.5=790.4 nm. So the observed line is at 790.4, which matches the peak. So the flux drops below that because the IGM absorption prevents us from seeing the UV part, which is now observed in the optical. So yes, the peak is the Lyman-alpha line, and the drop-off is due to the IGM.

So z=5.5.

Now, what's the comoving distance for z=5.5 in the given cosmology.

I think I have to find D_C = (c/H0) * ∫0^z [1/sqrt(Ωm (1+z')^3 + Ωλ ) ] dz'

But calculating this integral is a bit involved. Alternatively, I can use approximate formulas or remember that for high z, D_C is on the order of several Gpc.

But I remember that for z=1, the comoving distance is about 1.6 billion light-years, which is about 500 Mpc. Wait, no, maybe that's the proper distance. Wait, perhaps more accurately, using the cosmology parameters, D_C for z=5.5 can be found using a calculator or lookup table, but since I can't do that, I have to estimate.

Alternatively, I can think about the lookback time, but comoving distance is more directly used here.

Another approach: I can use the approximation for comoving distance for a flat universe with matter and dark energy.

The integral might be approximated as:

Integral = ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ωm (1+z')^3 + Ωλ ) ] dz'

But without dark energy, it would be ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ωm (1+z')^3 ) ] dz' = ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ωm) (1+z')^{-3/2} ] dz' 

Which as before gives 2/(3*sqrt(Ωm)) ) [ (1+z)^{3/2} -1 ]

But with dark energy, the integrand is lower for lower z, so the integral is a bit larger than the matter-only case.

Wait, no. Dark energy contributes more as the universe expands, so the integrand (1/sqrt(...)) would be lower at lower z, but higher at higher z.

Wait, no. Because at high z, the dark energy term is negligible, so the integrand is similar to the matter case. At lower z, the dark energy term becomes significant, and the integrand is higher because the denominator is bigger.

Wait, dark energy contributes positively to the denominator, so 1/sqrt( ... ) would be smaller. So the integrand is smaller when dark energy is significant, leading to a smaller integral. So the comoving distance would be smaller than in the matter-only case.

So for z=5.5, using both matter and dark energy, the comoving distance would be a bit less than the matter-only case.

Earlier, I calculated the matter-only case as about 9.5 Gpc. So with dark energy, perhaps around 8 Gpc.

Looking at the options, option D is 7 Gpc, option B is 8 Gpc, option C is 9 Gpc.

So between 8 and 9. Since the dark energy makes the distance a bit less than 9.5, maybe around 8 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the standard ruler or something else. Another thought: the comoving distance for z=5.5 in a flat universe with Ωm=0.3 and Ωλ=0.7 is about 8 Gpc.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, I can think about approximate values for high redshifts. 

Wait, some sources say that for high z, the comoving distance is approximately given by D_C ≈ (c/H0) * (1+z) / sqrt(Ωm) ) * (some factor). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can think of the scale factor a=1/(1+z)=1/6.5≈0.1538.

The integral would be from a=1/(1+z)=0.1538 to a=1. The integral becomes ∫0.1538^1 [1/(H(a)/c)] da.

H(a)= H0 * sqrt( Ωm a^{-3} + Ωλ )

So 1/(H(a)/c) = c/(H0) * 1/sqrt(Ωm a^{-3} + Ωλ )

= (c/H0) * 1/sqrt( Ωm (1/a)^3 + Ωλ )

Which is similar to the previous approach.

But without doing a numerical integration, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 790 nm is not Lyman-alpha but another line. Let me think about other possible lines. For example, He II 1640 is another emission line in the UV. Its rest wavelength is 1640 Å, which is 164 nm. Observed at 790 nm would give z=(790/164) -1≈4.81.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe it's some other line. But regardless, if I assume z=5.5, the comoving distance would be about 8 Gpc, given the options.

So among the options, 8 Gpc is option B, 7 Gpc is D, 9 is C.

Another thought: I recall that at z=2, comoving distance is about 3 Gpc, and at z=5, it's about 8 Gpc or so. So with z=5.5, it's likely around 8 Gpc.

So the answer should be B) 8 Gpc.


To determine the comoving distance of the quasar, we start by analyzing the observed peak at 790 nm. This peak is interpreted as the Lyman-alpha emission line of hydrogen, which has a rest wavelength of 121.6 nm. The redshift \( z \) is calculated using the formula:

\[
z = \frac{\text{observed wavelength}}{\text{rest wavelength}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121.6} - 1 \approx 6.5 - 1 = 5.5
\]

Thus, the quasar has a redshift of \( z \approx 5.5 \).

Next, we calculate the comoving distance \( D_C \) for a universe defined by the Lambda-CDM model with the following parameters:
- Hubble constant \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \),
- Matter density parameter \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \),
- Dark energy density parameter \( \Omega_\lambda = 0.7 \),
- Flat universe (\( \Omega_{\text{total}} = 1 \)).

The comoving distance is given by:

\[
D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\lambda}} \, dz'
\]

Here, \( c \) is the speed of light. For \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), the term \( c/H_0 \) is approximately \( 4285.7 \, \text{Mpc} \). The integral depends on the cosmological parameters and the redshift \( z \). At high redshifts (\( z \gg 1 \)), the universe is matter-dominated, and the integral can be approximated. However, the presence of dark energy slightly modifies the expansion history, reducing the comoving distance compared to a matter-only universe.

For \( z = 5.5 \), the comoving distance is expected to be on the order of several gigaparsecs. Based on approximate calculations and known results for similar cosmological parameters, the comoving distance for \( z = 5.5 \) is approximately \( 8 \, \text{Gpc} \). This value aligns with the given options and accounts for the effects of both matter and dark energy.

Among the options provided:
- \( 6 \, \text{Gpc} \) (Option A) is too low.
- \( 8 \, \text{Gpc} \) (Option B) is consistent with the expected value.
- \( 9 \, \text{Gpc} \) (Option C) is too high.
- \( 7 \, \text{Gpc} \) (Option D) is close but slightly lower than the expected value.

Thus, the most reasonable estimate for the comoving distance is \( 8 \, \text{Gpc} \).
