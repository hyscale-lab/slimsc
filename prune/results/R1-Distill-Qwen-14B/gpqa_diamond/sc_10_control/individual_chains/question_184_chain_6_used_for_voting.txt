Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering benzene rings can be tricky. Let me think: in aromatic compounds, the substituents are numbered in such a way that the numbers are as low as possible. So the nitro group is in position 3, ethoxy in position 1, and tert-butyl in position 2. Oh wait, maybe I should sketch the structure.

Alternatively, the substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions. So they are meta to each other in some way. Wait, no, 1 and 2 are adjacent, so the substituents are ortho and meta perhaps.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the positions. Let me assign the positions. The substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3. So if I imagine the benzene ring, the nitro group is in position 3, ethoxy in 1, tert-butyl in 2. So, the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. So, the substituents are ortho to each other (positions 1 and 2 are adjacent), and the nitro is meta to ethoxy.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the numbering, but perhaps I can figure it out as I go through the reaction steps.

Now, benzene is the starting material. The target molecule has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. So, I need to perform three substitution reactions on benzene. But the order in which I add these groups matters because each substitution will direct the next one.

Let me think about the directing effects of each group. Nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy is an ortho/para director, and tert-butyl is a para director because it's an alkyl group. Wait, no, tert-butyl is a bulky substituent and is an ortho/para director but tends to direct more to para because of steric hindrance in the ortho position.

Wait, but when a substituent is added, it directs the next incoming group to certain positions. So, the order of adding substituents will determine the positions of the others.

Let me plan the synthesis. I need to get all three substituents on the benzene ring. So, perhaps I should first add the nitro group. Nitration is a common reaction. But wait, the nitro group is a meta director, so when I add the next substituent, it will go to the meta position relative to nitro. Alternatively, maybe I should add the ethoxy group first, which is an activating group and an ortho/para director, which might help in positioning the other groups.

Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group, so it would make the ring less reactive towards further substitution. Whereas ethoxy is activating, which might make subsequent substitutions easier. Hmm, actually, the nitration is a strong deactivating step, so if I nitrate first, the next substitution would be difficult because the ring is deactivated. Alternatively, perhaps we add the activating groups first.

Wait, but in this case, the target molecule has a nitro group, which is a meta director. Let me think about the possible steps.

Another point: the nitro group is in position 3, ethoxy in 1, tert-butyl in 2. Wait, position 1 is next to position 2 and 6, so ethoxy is in position 1, nitro in position 3, which is adjacent to position 2. Wait, but that would make the nitro and ethoxy groups in positions 1 and 3, which are meta to each other, and the tert-butyl in position 2, which is adjacent to position 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the nitro is at position 3, the ethoxy at position 1, and tert-butyl at position 2. So, each is ortho to the next. So, the substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions.

So, the question is, in what order should these groups be added to achieve this arrangement.

One approach is to first add a group that will direct the next groups into the correct positions. Let me consider that the nitro group is a meta director, so if I add it first, the next substituent would come in the meta position relative to it. But maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, adding the ethoxy group first, which is an ortho/para director, would allow the next groups to be added in ortho or para positions.

Wait, but the target has three substituents, so perhaps the order is important. Let's think about the possible steps.

Let me outline possible reaction sequences:

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first. Then nitro, then ethoxy.

But wait, the tert-butyl is a strong activating group (since it's an alkyl group), so adding it first would make the ring more reactive. Then, nitrating would add in the ortho or para positions relative to tert-butyl. Then, adding ethoxy would go into another position.

But I'm not sure if that would lead to the correct arrangement.

Option 2: Add ethoxy first. Since ethoxy is activating and ortho/para directing. Then, nitrate, which would add in either the ortho or para position relative to ethoxy. Then, add tert-butyl.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director, but after nitration, the ring becomes deactivating, which might affect where the next substituent goes.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group first, then the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl. But wait, nitro is deactivating, so after nitration, the ring would be harder to substitute. So perhaps that's not ideal.

Another approach: maybe the nitro group is added after other groups because it's a strong deactivating group, which would make subsequent substitutions difficult.

Wait, but in the target, there are two activating groups (tert-butyl and ethoxy) and one deactivating (nitro). So the order might matter in terms of activating and deactivating.

Let me think about the steps each option proposes. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps. I'll need to analyze each option's steps to see which leads to the target molecule.

Looking at the options:

Each option starts with benzene and goes through a series of reactions. Let's look at each option's steps.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl group.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration.

iv) SO3/H2SO4 → Sulfonation.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → Diazotization.

vii) H3O+, H2O, heat → Hydrolysis (maybe of a diazonium salt).

viii) NaOH/EtBr → Williamson ether synthesis? Or perhaps elimination.

ix) Fe/HCl → Maybe a reduction or another substitution.

But wait, the steps are not in order. Let me list the steps for each option.

Wait, looking back, the options are a bit confusing. Let me check each option's steps.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: the target molecule has three substituents. So, the correct synthesis must have three substitution steps. Let's see what each option does.

Each option has multiple steps, so perhaps they involve more than just substitution reactions. Let's think about the possible reactions.

Reaction types to consider:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation (adds alkyl groups, like tert-butyl).
2. Nitration (adds nitro groups).
3. Sulfonation (adds sulfonic acid groups, which are strong meta directors).
4. Diazotization and coupling (like introducing amine groups or forming diazonium salts).
5. Hydrolysis of diazonium salts (can lead to phenols or other groups).
6. Williamson ether synthesis (introduces ether groups, like ethoxy).
7. Reductions (e.g., using Fe/HCl, which might reduce nitro groups to amino, but that's not in the target).

Wait, but the target has an ethoxy group, which would require either a substitution (like using a nitration followed by a reduction, but that would give an amine, which could then be substituted), or perhaps using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which is difficult unless the ring is highly activated. Alternatively, the ethoxy could be introduced via a substitution from a good leaving group in the ring, but that's not common.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Alternatively, it's more likely that the ethoxy group comes from a substitution via a good leaving group. But in that case, the ring would need to be strongly activated, perhaps by having strong activating groups adjacent.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a SN2 reaction, but that's unlikely on an aromatic ring. Another possibility is that it's introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction, but that seems more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after making a good leaving group, like a nitro group. But wait, nitro groups are meta directors, and substitution after that is tricky.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to first introduce the ethoxy group, then nitrate, then introduce the tert-butyl group. Or another order.

But let me think of the target structure. The positions are 1, 2, 3. So, for example, benzene with substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, how to get them in that arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is introduced first. Then, the next substituent (ethoxy) would go into the ortho or para position relative to the nitro. But nitro is meta directing, so that's tricky.

Alternatively, if I introduce ethoxy first, it's an activating group and ortho/para directing. So the next substituent (nitro) would go into the ortho or para position relative to ethoxy. Then, the tert-butyl group can be introduced.

But let's think step by step. Let's try to plan the synthesis.

Step 1: Introduce ethoxy group.

Benzene + something → ethoxybenzene (anisole). The reaction to introduce ethoxy is via a substitution. But how?

Wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation isn't possible for ethoxy since it's an ether; Friedel-Crafts adds alkyl groups, not ethers. So perhaps, to introduce an ether group, another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps we can perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires the ring to be strongly activated toward substitution, which is usually not the case. Alternatively, maybe introducing an ethyl group via Friedel-Crafts and then converting it to an ether. But that's probably not straightforward.

Wait, another approach: if we have a nitro group, we can reduce it to an amine, then perform a substitution to introduce the ethoxy group.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to consider that the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution using a leaving group, but that requires the ring to have a strong activating group adjacent.

Wait, maybe I can make the benzene ring have a good leaving group, like a nitro group, which is meta directing. But wait, nitro groups are meta directors but are deactivating. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group comes from a substitution after nitration.

Wait, no, maybe the ethoxy group comes first. Let me try again.

Alternative approach: The ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. But benzene doesn't typically undergo nucleophilic substitution. However, if we have a nitro group in the ring, which is a strong deactivating group, perhaps in certain conditions, a substitution can occur. Let me think: for example, if we have a nitro group para to a leaving group, perhaps substitution is possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

In each option, the steps are given. Each option has a series of steps. Let's see which one correctly adds the substituents in the right order.

Option D: starts with nitration (step i), then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction of nitro to amine?), then Friedel-Crafts (adds tert-butyl), then another nitration, etc. Wait, but that seems confusing.

Option C: starts with Friedel-Crafts (tert-butyl), then sulfonation, then nitration, then Fe/HCl, etc. Hmm.

Wait, but the target has three substituents. Let me think about each substituent's group and how they are added.

The target molecule has:

- 2-(tert-butyl): so a tert-butyl group at position 2.

- 1-ethoxy: ethoxy at position 1.

- 3-nitro: nitro at position 3.

So, the three substituents are at adjacent positions 1, 2, and 3.

So, perhaps the correct order is to add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Or any other order.

Wait, another approach: let's see what each reaction does.

Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group (tert-butyl) to benzene. Then, nitration would add a nitro group, which is meta to the tert-butyl.

Wait, but tert-butyl is a bulky group and a para director. So if I add tert-butyl first, then nitration would occur at the para position relative to it. But in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to the ethoxy at position 1 and the tert-butyl at position 2. Hmm, this seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is ortho to the tert-butyl, and the nitro is meta to the ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the order is:

1. Add tert-butyl (Friedel-Crafts).

2. Add ethoxy group (how?).

3. Add nitro group.

But how to add the ethoxy group via substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a nitration step. But again, nitro is a deactivating group, making substitution difficult.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first add the nitro group, then the tert-butyl, then the ethoxy. Let me see.

Wait, but nitro is meta-directing. If I nitrate benzene first, the next substituent will go meta to it. Then, adding tert-butyl, which is an activating group, would be directed to the meta positions relative to nitro. Then, adding ethoxy would go to ortho/para positions relative to the tert-butyl.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe looking at the options will help.

Looking at Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene, gives nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine. So, nitrobenzene → aniline.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, aniline is strongly activating, so the next substituent would add ortho or para to it.

But if we have aniline, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts? Wait, no, because Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. Aniline is very activating, so maybe it's possible.

But wait, aniline is a strong activating group, so adding tert-butyl to it via Friedel-Crafts would add in the ortho or para positions relative to the amino group.

After adding tert-butyl, we have a tert-butyl group and amino group on benzene. Then, step iv) is another nitration. Now, the amino group is a strong activating group, so the next nitration would add nitro group in the ortho or para position relative to the amino group. 

Wait, but the target molecule has a nitro group, so maybe this route is adding a second nitro group, which is not desired.

Hmm, perhaps this is not the right path.

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts (tert-butyl added).

ii) nitration → nitro group added.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduces nitro to amine.

iv) nitration again → add another nitro group? That doesn't seem right.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts (tert-butyl).

ii) sulfonation → adds a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong meta director.

iii) nitration → nitro group added.

Then, Fe/HCl (maybe reduces sulfonic acid?), but that's unlikely. Then, NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), etc. Not sure.

Option A seems to have a lot of steps which might not be necessary. Let me think about each option's reaction steps.

Wait, the target molecule has an ethoxy group, nitro, and tert-butyl. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after activating the ring with another group.

Wait, another way: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that's tricky unless the ring is strongly activated.

Alternatively, perhaps we first introduce a good leaving group, like a nitro group, then substitute it with ethoxy. But wait, nitro is a meta director, and substitution in aromatic rings is not straightforward.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution from an adjacent nitro group. Let's think: if we have nitro group in position 3, and then substitute a nitro group with ethoxy? But nitro groups are not good leaving groups. Alternatively, perhaps we can convert nitro to another group that can be a leaving group.

Wait, another approach: maybe perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add an ethyl group, then convert it to ethoxy. But Friedel-Crafts adds alkyl groups, which are then susceptible to oxidation or other reactions. But converting an ethyl group to ethoxy would require some kind of substitution, which is not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps we can perform a nitration to add a nitro group, then reduce it to an amino group, then perform a substitution to replace the amino group with ethoxy. But that's not exactly how it works; the amino group is a good leaving group under certain conditions.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring with a strong activating group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a benzene ring with a good leaving group, such as a nitro group that has been converted into a diazonium salt, which can then undergo a substitution with ethoxide.

Wait, but diazonium salts typically undergo substitution with a nucleophile like CN- or another group. If we have a diazonium salt, adding a strong base could lead to substitution with an oxide or something else. But I'm not sure how to get an ethoxy group from that.

Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution with a leaving group that's a good leaving group, like a tosylate or something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro group, which will be in the meta position relative to tert-butyl.

3. Then, introduce the ethoxy group in a position that's ortho to the nitro group.

Wait, but nitro is meta-directing, so adding ethoxy after nitration would go into the meta position relative to nitro, but that might not be adjacent to the tert-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl group in the meta position relative to nitro.

3. Now, introduce the ethoxy group. But how? Since nitro is deactivating, perhaps the ring is not reactive enough. So this approach may not work.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to add ethoxy first, then nitro, then tert-butyl.

Let me see: benzene → add ethoxy (anisole). Then nitrate in the ortho or para position. Then, add tert-butyl in another position.

Wait, but how do you add an ethoxy group? I'm stuck again because Friedel-Crafts doesn't add ethers; it adds alkyl groups. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Another thought: perhaps perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation to add an acetyl group, then reduce it to an ethyl group, and then perform a substitution to add ethoxy. But that seems complicated and may not yield the desired product.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction using a nitration step as a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl group in the ortho or para position relative to amino.

4. Then, substitute the amino group with ethoxy.

Wait, but how do you substitute an amino group with ethoxy? That's not straightforward. Amines are typically not good leaving groups unless under specific conditions. Maybe using some kind of Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement, but that's probably not applicable here.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of the steps in each option and see which leads to the desired product.

Looking at Option D:

i) Nitration → nitro group added.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts (tert-butyl) → add tert-butyl to benzene with amino group. Since amino is a strong activating group, the tert-butyl would add para to it.

iv) Nitration → nitrate the benzene with amino and tert-butyl groups. Where would the nitro group go?

Wait, amino is ortho/para directing. So the nitro would be added either ortho or para to the amino group. But the amino group is already attached, and the tert-butyl is at para. So perhaps the nitro would go into the ortho position relative to the amino group, but that might clash with the tert-butyl group.

This seems to complicate the structure, and the target has only one nitro group. So perhaps this is not the right option.

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts tert-butyl.

ii) Nitration → nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) Nitration again → add another nitro group.

But target has only one nitro group, so this can't be right.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonation → add sulfonic acid group.

iii) Nitration → nitro group added.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce sulfonic acid? Not likely; Fe/HCl usually reduces nitro groups.

v) Diazotization → form diazonium salt.

vi) Nitration again? No, target has one nitro.

This seems unclear.

Option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts tert-butyl.

ii) Nitration.

iv) Sulfonation → add sulfonic acid.

vi) Diazotization.

vii) Hydrolysis.

viii) NaOH and EtBr → perhaps Williamson.

ix) Fe/HCl → reduce.

This path seems to involve multiple steps, perhaps introducing several groups but I'm not sure how it leads to the target.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some steps. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D. Let me re-examine option D:

Steps in D:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → add tert-butyl group.

iv) Nitration → nitro group added (but target has only one nitro, so this can't be right).

Hmm, that's a problem. So option D adds a second nitro group, which is not desired.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check option D again.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → Williamson.

Wait, but this seems to have multiple steps, perhaps adding more substituents than needed. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: maybe the correct order is to add the ethoxy group via a substitution after activating the ring. For example, if a nitro group is present, perhaps the ethoxy can be introduced in a position that's ortho to it.

But I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should try to figure out which option correctly adds the substituents in the right order.

Let me think about the target molecule again. The substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, each substituent is adjacent to the next.

I think the correct sequence is to add the nitro group first, then the tert-butyl group, and then the ethoxy group. But how?

Wait, nitro is meta directing, so adding tert-butyl after nitro would put it in the meta position relative to nitro, which would be position 4 (if nitro is in position 3). But in the target, tert-butyl is in position 2, which is adjacent to position 1 (ethoxy) and 3 (nitro). Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the numbering right.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added first, then nitro, then tert-butyl.

If I add ethoxy first, the ring is activated. Then, nitration occurs in the ortho or para position relative to ethoxy. Then, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts would go into another position.

But let's think about the positions:

Suppose ethoxy is added in position 1. Then, nitration would be in position 3 (ortho to ethoxy). Then, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts would go to position 2 (ortho to ethoxy). But wait, the nitro is already in position 3. So, how would tert-butyl go to position 2 when the ring already has substituents in 1 and 3?

Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps after adding ethoxy and nitro, the tert-butyl can be added in the remaining position.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the directing effects again.

If ethoxy is in position 1, nitro in position 3 (which is meta to ethoxy?), then the tert-butyl could be added in position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy and adjacent to nitro.

But how to achieve that.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add ethoxy group. But how? Because Friedel-Crafts doesn't add ethers. So maybe via a substitution.

Wait, perhaps through a nitration, then reduction, then substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution using a leaving group, such as a nitro group that has been converted to a better leaving group.

But this is getting too vague. Let me try to think about each option again.

Looking at option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts (tert-butyl added).

ii) Nitration → nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) Nitration → another nitro group.

This seems to add two nitro groups, which is not desired.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts (tert-butyl).

ii) Sulfonation → adds sulfonic acid.

iii) Nitration → adds nitro.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces sulfonic acid? Unlikely.

v) Diazotization.

vi) Nitration again.

Hmm, not helpful.

Option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts tert-butyl.

ii) Nitration.

iv) Sulfonation.

vi) Diazotization.

vii) Hydrolysis.

viii) NaOH/EtBr.

ix) Fe/HCl.

This seems to involve several steps, perhaps adding multiple groups.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct order of substituents in the options.

The target has nitro, ethoxy, and tert-butyl.

Looking for the step where ethoxy is introduced. Probably via a substitution reaction, perhaps using a diazonium salt.

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after the ring has been strongly activated. For example, after adding a strong activating group like -NH2.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl → tert-butyl group adds in ortho or para to amino.

4. Introduce ethoxy group via substitution of the amino group. But how?

Wait, maybe using a diazonium salt. For example, convert the amino group to a diazonium salt, then perform a substitution with ethoxide.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the amino group can be converted into a leaving group, but I don't think that's standard.

Hmm, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Nitration → add nitro.

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl.

3. Substitute nitro with ethoxy.

But substitution of nitro is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added last.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro in the meta position relative to tert-butyl.

3. Then, introduce ethoxy via substitution.

But I'm not sure how to introduce ethoxy via substitution.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a strongly activated ring. So, perhaps after adding the nitro and tert-butyl groups, the ring is activated enough in a certain position to allow substitution with ethoxy.

But I'm not certain. 

Another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Grignard reaction, but I don't think that works on aromatic rings.

At this point, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for which option correctly introduces all three substituents in the right positions.

Looking at option D again:

i) Nitration → nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → add tert-butyl in ortho or para to amino.

iv) Nitration → add another nitro group. But this would lead to two nitro groups, which is not desired.

So option D is likely incorrect.

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

ii) Nitration → nitro group.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) Nitration → another nitro group.

Also incorrect.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonation → sulfonic acid.

iii) Nitration → nitro group.

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce sulfonic acid to SH group. Unlikely.

v) Diazotization.

vi) Nitration again.

I don't see this leading to the target.

Option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

ii) Nitration.

iv) Sulfonation.

vi) Diazotization.

vii) Hydrolysis.

viii) NaOH/EtBr → maybe Williamson.

ix) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce.

Hmm. Let's try to follow the steps in option A.

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → tert-butylbenzene.

2. Nitration → add nitro group. Nitro is meta-directing. So, nitro will be added in the meta position relative to tert-butyl. So, tert-butyl is in position 1, nitro in position 4.

3. Then, sulfonation → SO3 adds, which is a strong meta director. Where would it add? The ring already has tert-butyl (position 1) and nitro (position 4). Sulfon would go into the meta position relative to these groups. But position 3 is free, perhaps.

4. Then, diazotization with NaNO2/HCl → but where is the amine? Unless a substitution has occurred earlier, I don't see an amine here.

Wait, this seems off. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps after sulfonation, they do something else. Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

After adding tert-butyl and nitro, then sulfonate to activate a position for another substitution.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Perhaps I should consider that the correct option is option D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl in para to amine.

4. Diazotize the amine → form diazonium salt.

5. Substitute the diazonium group with ethoxy → via coupling or substitution.

But how? Diazonium salts can undergo substitution with nucleophiles. So, perhaps using NaNO2/HCl to form the diazonium chloride, then treating with ethanol in basic conditions (like NaOH) to substitute the diazonium group with ethoxy.

Wait, that makes sense. So the steps would be:

i) Nitration → nitro.

ii) Reduction → amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

iv) Diazotization → form diazonium.

v) Substitution → ethoxy.

vi) Any other steps?

So, let's see which option includes this sequence.

Looking at the options, perhaps option D includes these steps. Let me check:

Option D's steps:

i) Nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

iii) Friedel-Crafts.

iv) Nitration → but this adds another nitro, which we don't want.

So, option D is not correct.

Looking for an option that includes nitration, reduction, Friedel-Crafts, diazotization, substitution.

Hmm, none of the options seem to directly follow this sequence.

Wait, perhaps option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

ii) Nitration → nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) Nitration → another nitro. No, that's not right.

Option D has:

i) Nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iii) Friedel-Crafts.

iv) Nitration → another nitro.

Not desired.

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts.

ii) Nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl.

iv) Nitration again.

Hmm.

Option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts.

ii) Nitration.

iv) Sulfonation.

vi) Diazotization.

vii) Hydrolysis.

viii) NaOH/EtBr.

ix) Fe/HCl.

Option A's steps after adding tert-butyl and nitro:

iv) Sulfonation → add sulfonic acid.

vi) Diazotization → but where is the amine?

Wait, unless after sulfonation, there's a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps after sulfonation are to introduce another group.

I think I'm not getting anywhere. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, considering the target has nitro in position 3, ethoxy in 1, and tert-butyl in 2.

Perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro in meta to tert-butyl.

3. Add ethoxy in a position that is ortho to nitro and adjacent to tert-butyl.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first, then tert-butyl in meta, and then ethoxy in the ortho position to nitro.

Wait, if nitro is in position 3, then adding ethoxy in position 2 (ortho to nitro) and adjacent to tert-butyl in position 1.

But how to achieve that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is: nitro first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl.

But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that option D is the correct one, but I'm not entirely confident.

To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents (tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro) in the correct positions (1, 2, and 3, respectively) while considering the directing effects of each group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Considerations:
1. **Substituent Directing Effects**:
   - **Nitro (-NO₂)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.
   - **Ethoxy (-OCH₂CH₃)**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - **tert-Butyl (-C(CH₃)₃)**: Activating, ortho/para-directing but tends to direct more to para due to steric hindrance.

2. **Target Structure**:
   - The substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), meaning they are adjacent to each other in a 1,2,3 arrangement.

3. **Reaction Sequences**:
   - The order of adding substituents is critical due to the deactivating nature of the nitro group, which makes the ring less reactive for subsequent substitutions.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  2. Nitration.
  3. Sulfonation.
  4. Diazotization.
  5. Hydrolysis.
  6. Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr).
  7. Fe/HCl reduction.
- **Issues**:
  - The sequence introduces multiple groups, including sulfonic acid and diazonium intermediates, which do not align with the target structure. The steps do not clearly lead to the desired substitution pattern.

#### **Option B**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  2. Nitration.
  3. Reduction of nitro to amine (Fe/HCl).
  4. Nitration again.
- **Issues**:
  - Introduces two nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target structure that has only one nitro group. The sequence does not achieve the correct substitution pattern.

#### **Option C**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  2. Sulfonation.
  3. Nitration.
  4. Reduction of sulfonic acid (Fe/HCl).
  5. Diazotization.
  6. Nitration again.
  7. Hydrolysis.
  8. Dilute H₂SO₄.
  9. NaOH/EtBr.
- **Issues**:
  - The sequence involves multiple steps that introduce additional groups (e.g., sulfonic acid), which are not part of the target structure. The steps do not align with the desired substitution pattern.

#### **Option D**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Nitration.
  2. Reduction of nitro to amine (Fe/HCl).
  3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  4. Nitration again.
  5. Diazotization.
  6. Sulfonation.
  7. Dilute H₂SO₄.
  8. Hydrolysis.
  9. NaOH/EtBr.
- **Issues**:
  - Introduces two nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target structure. The sequence does not achieve the correct substitution pattern.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences provided fully align with the correct substitution pattern and the desired product. However, **Option D** comes closest to the required steps, despite introducing an extra nitro group. Based on the given choices, **Option D** is selected as the best possible answer.

Answer: D

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering benzene rings can be tricky. Let me think: in aromatic compounds, the substituents are numbered in such a way that the numbers are as low as possible. So the nitro group is in position 3, ethoxy in position 1, and tert-butyl in position 2. Oh wait, maybe I should sketch the structure.

Alternatively, the substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions. So they are meta to each other in some way. Wait, no, 1 and 2 are adjacent, so the substituents are ortho and meta perhaps.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the positions. Let me assign the positions. The substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3. So if I imagine the benzene ring, the nitro group is in position 3, ethoxy in 1, tert-butyl in 2. So, the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. So, the substituents are ortho to each other (positions 1 and 2 are adjacent), and the nitro is meta to ethoxy.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the numbering, but perhaps I can figure it out as I go through the reaction steps.

Now, benzene is the starting material. The target molecule has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. So, I need to perform three substitution reactions on benzene. But the order in which I add these groups matters because each substitution will direct the next one.

Let me think about the directing effects of each group. Nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy is an ortho/para director, and tert-butyl is a para director because it's an alkyl group. Wait, no, tert-butyl is a bulky substituent and is an ortho/para director but tends to direct more to para because of steric hindrance in the ortho position.

Wait, but when a substituent is added, it directs the next incoming group to certain positions. So, the order of adding substituents will determine the positions of the others.

Let me plan the synthesis. I need to get all three substituents on the benzene ring. So, perhaps I should first add the nitro group. Nitration is a common reaction. But wait, the nitro group is a meta director, so when I add the next substituent, it will go to the meta position relative to nitro. Alternatively, maybe I should add the ethoxy group first, which is an activating group and an ortho/para director, which might help in positioning the other groups.

Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group, so it would make the ring less reactive towards further substitution. Whereas ethoxy is activating, which might make subsequent substitutions easier. Hmm, actually, the nitration is a strong deactivating step, so if I nitrate first, the next substitution would be difficult because the ring is deactivated. Alternatively, perhaps we add the activating groups first.

Wait, but in this case, the target molecule has a nitro group, which is a meta director. Let me think about the possible steps.

Another point: the nitro group is in position 3, ethoxy in 1, tert-butyl in 2. Wait, position 1 is next to position 2 and 6, so ethoxy is in position 1, nitro in position 3, which is adjacent to position 2. Wait, but that would make the nitro and ethoxy groups in positions 1 and 3, which are meta to each other, and the tert-butyl in position 2, which is adjacent to position 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the nitro is at position 3, the ethoxy at position 1, and tert-butyl at position 2. So, each is ortho to the next. So, the substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions.

So, the question is, in what order should these groups be added to achieve this arrangement.

One approach is to first add a group that will direct the next groups into the correct positions. Let me consider that the nitro group is a meta director, so if I add it first, the next substituent would come in the meta position relative to it. But maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, adding the ethoxy group first, which is an ortho/para director, would allow the next groups to be added in ortho or para positions.

Wait, but the target has three substituents, so perhaps the order is important. Let's think about the possible steps.

Let me outline possible reaction sequences:

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first. Then nitro, then ethoxy.

But wait, the tert-butyl is a strong activating group (since it's an alkyl group), so adding it first would make the ring more reactive. Then, nitrating would add in the ortho or para positions relative to tert-butyl. Then, adding ethoxy would go into another position.

But I'm not sure if that would lead to the correct arrangement.

Option 2: Add ethoxy first. Since ethoxy is activating and ortho/para directing. Then, nitrate, which would add in either the ortho or para position relative to ethoxy. Then, add tert-butyl.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director, but after nitration, the ring becomes deactivating, which might affect where the next substituent goes.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group first, then the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl. But wait, nitro is deactivating, so after nitration, the ring would be harder to substitute. So perhaps that's not ideal.

Another approach: maybe the nitro group is added after other groups because it's a strong deactivating group, which would make subsequent substitutions difficult.

Wait, but in the target, there are two activating groups (tert-butyl and ethoxy) and one deactivating (nitro). So the order might matter in terms of activating and deactivating.

Let me think about the steps each option proposes. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps. I'll need to analyze each option's steps to see which leads to the target molecule.

Looking at the options:

Each option starts with benzene and goes through a series of reactions. Let's look at each option's steps.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl group.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration.

iv) SO3/H2SO4 → Sulfonation.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → Diazotization.

vii) H3O+, H2O, heat → Hydrolysis (maybe of a diazonium salt).

viii) NaOH/EtBr → Williamson ether synthesis? Or perhaps elimination.

ix) Fe/HCl → Maybe a reduction or another substitution.

But wait, the steps are not in order. Let me list the steps for each option.

Wait, looking back, the options are a bit confusing. Let me check each option's steps.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: the target molecule has three substituents. So, the correct synthesis must have three substitution steps. Let's see what each option does.

Each option has multiple steps, so perhaps they involve more than just substitution reactions. Let's think about the possible reactions.

Reaction types to consider:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation (adds alkyl groups, like tert-butyl).
2. Nitration (adds nitro groups).
3. Sulfonation (adds sulfonic acid groups, which are strong meta directors).
4. Diazotization and coupling (like introducing amine groups or forming diazonium salts).
5. Hydrolysis of diazonium salts (can lead to phenols or other groups).
6. Williamson ether synthesis (introduces ether groups, like ethoxy).
7. Reductions (e.g., using Fe/HCl, which might reduce nitro groups to amino, but that's not in the target).

Wait, but the target has an ethoxy group, which would require either a substitution (like using a nitration followed by a reduction, but that would give an amine, which could then be substituted), or perhaps using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which is difficult unless the ring is highly activated. Alternatively, the ethoxy could be introduced via a substitution from a good leaving group in the ring, but that's not common.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Alternatively, it's more likely that the ethoxy group comes from a substitution via a good leaving group. But in that case, the ring would need to be strongly activated, perhaps by having strong activating groups adjacent.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a SN2 reaction, but that's unlikely on an aromatic ring. Another possibility is that it's introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction, but that seems more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after making a good leaving group, like a nitro group. But wait, nitro groups are meta directors, and substitution after that is tricky.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to first introduce the ethoxy group, then nitrate, then introduce the tert-butyl group. Or another order.

But let me think of the target structure. The positions are 1, 2, 3. So, for example, benzene with substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, how to get them in that arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is introduced first. Then, the next substituent (ethoxy) would go into the ortho or para position relative to the nitro. But nitro is meta directing, so that's tricky.

Alternatively, if I introduce ethoxy first, it's an activating group and ortho/para directing. So the next substituent (nitro) would go into the ortho or para position relative to ethoxy. Then, the tert-butyl group can be introduced.

But let's think step by step. Let's try to plan the synthesis.

Step 1: Introduce ethoxy group.

Benzene + something → ethoxybenzene (anisole). The reaction to introduce ethoxy is via a substitution. But how?

Wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation isn't possible for ethoxy since it's an ether; Friedel-Crafts adds alkyl groups, not ethers. So perhaps, to introduce an ether group, another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps we can perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires the ring to be strongly activated toward substitution, which is usually not the case. Alternatively, maybe introducing an ethyl group via Friedel-Crafts and then converting it to an ether. But that's probably not straightforward.

Wait, another approach: if we have a nitro group, we can reduce it to an amine, then perform a substitution to introduce the ethoxy group.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to consider that the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution using a leaving group, but that requires the ring to have a strong activating group adjacent.

Wait, maybe I can make the benzene ring have a good leaving group, like a nitro group, which is meta directing. But wait, nitro groups are meta directors but are deactivating. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group comes from a substitution after nitration.

Wait, no, maybe the ethoxy group comes first. Let me try again.

Alternative approach: The ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. But benzene doesn't typically undergo nucleophilic substitution. However, if we have a nitro group in the ring, which is a strong deactivating group, perhaps in certain conditions, a substitution can occur. Let me think: for example, if we have a nitro group para to a leaving group, perhaps substitution is possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

In each option, the steps are given. Each option has a series of steps. Let's see which one correctly adds the substituents in the right order.

Option D: starts with nitration (step i), then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction of nitro to amine?), then Friedel-Crafts (adds tert-butyl), then another nitration, etc. Wait, but that seems confusing.

Option C: starts with Friedel-Crafts (tert-butyl), then sulfonation, then nitration, then Fe/HCl, etc. Hmm.

Wait, but the target has three substituents. Let me think about each substituent's group and how they are added.

The target molecule has:

- 2-(tert-butyl): so a tert-butyl group at position 2.

- 1-ethoxy: ethoxy at position 1.

- 3-nitro: nitro at position 3.

So, the three substituents are at adjacent positions 1, 2, and 3.

So, perhaps the correct order is to add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Or any other order.

Wait, another approach: let's see what each reaction does.

Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group (tert-butyl) to benzene. Then, nitration would add a nitro group, which is meta to the tert-butyl.

Wait, but tert-butyl is a bulky group and a para director. So if I add tert-butyl first, then nitration would occur at the para position relative to it. But in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to the ethoxy at position 1 and the tert-butyl at position 2. Hmm, this seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is ortho to the tert-butyl, and the nitro is meta to the ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the order is:

1. Add tert-butyl (Friedel-Crafts).

2. Add ethoxy group (how?).

3. Add nitro group.

But how to add the ethoxy group via substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a nitration step. But again, nitro is a deactivating group, making substitution difficult.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first add the nitro group, then the tert-butyl, then the ethoxy. Let me see.

Wait, but nitro is meta-directing. If I nitrate benzene first, the next substituent will go meta to it. Then, adding tert-butyl, which is an activating group, would be directed to the meta positions relative to nitro. Then, adding ethoxy would go to ortho/para positions relative to the tert-butyl.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe looking at the options will help.

Looking at Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene, gives nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine. So, nitrobenzene → aniline.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, aniline is strongly activating, so the next substituent would add ortho or para to it.

But if we have aniline, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts? Wait, no, because Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. Aniline is very activating, so maybe it's possible.

But wait, aniline is a strong activating group, so adding tert-butyl to it via Friedel-Crafts would add in the ortho or para positions relative to the amino group.

After adding tert-butyl, we have a tert-butyl group and amino group on benzene. Then, step iv) is another nitration. Now, the amino group is a strong activating group, so the next nitration would add nitro group in the ortho or para position relative to the amino group. 

Wait, but the target molecule has a nitro group, so maybe this route is adding a second nitro group, which is not desired.

Hmm, perhaps this is not the right path.

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts (tert-butyl added).

ii) nitration → nitro group added.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduces nitro to amine.

iv) nitration again → add another nitro group? That doesn't seem right.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts (tert-butyl).

ii) sulfonation → adds a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong meta director.

iii) nitration → nitro group added.

Then, Fe/HCl (maybe reduces sulfonic acid?), but that's unlikely. Then, NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), etc. Not sure.

Option A seems to have a lot of steps which might not be necessary. Let me think about each option's reaction steps.

Wait, the target molecule has an ethoxy group, nitro, and tert-butyl. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after activating the ring with another group.

Wait, another way: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that's tricky unless the ring is strongly activated.

Alternatively, perhaps we first introduce a good leaving group, like a nitro group, then substitute it with ethoxy. But wait, nitro is a meta director, and substitution in aromatic rings is not straightforward.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution from an adjacent nitro group. Let's think: if we have nitro group in position 3, and then substitute a nitro group with ethoxy? But nitro groups are not good leaving groups. Alternatively, perhaps we can convert nitro to another group that can be a leaving group.

Wait, another approach: maybe perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add an ethyl group, then convert it to ethoxy. But Friedel-Crafts adds alkyl groups, which are then susceptible to oxidation or other reactions. But converting an ethyl group to ethoxy would require some kind of substitution, which is not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps we can perform a nitration to add a nitro group, then reduce it to an amino group, then perform a substitution to replace the amino group with ethoxy. But that's not exactly how it works; the amino group is a good leaving group under certain conditions.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring with a strong activating group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a benzene ring with a good leaving group, such as a nitro group that has been converted into a diazonium salt, which can then undergo a substitution with ethoxide.

Wait, but diazonium salts typically undergo substitution with a nucleophile like CN- or another group. If we have a diazonium salt, adding a strong base could lead to substitution with an oxide or something else. But I'm not sure how to get an ethoxy group from that.

Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution with a leaving group that's a good leaving group, like a tosylate or something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro group, which will be in the meta position relative to tert-butyl.

3. Then, introduce the ethoxy group in a position that's ortho to the nitro group.

Wait, but nitro is meta-directing, so adding ethoxy after nitration would go into the meta position relative to nitro, but that might not be adjacent to the tert-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl group in the meta position relative to nitro.

3. Now, introduce the ethoxy group. But how? Since nitro is deactivating, perhaps the ring is not reactive enough. So this approach may not work.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to add ethoxy first, then nitro, then tert-butyl.

Let me see: benzene → add ethoxy (anisole). Then nitrate in the ortho or para position. Then, add tert-butyl in another position.

Wait, but how do you add an ethoxy group? I'm stuck again because Friedel-Crafts doesn't add ethers; it adds alkyl groups. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Another thought: perhaps perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation to add an acetyl group, then reduce it to an ethyl group, and then perform a substitution to add ethoxy. But that seems complicated and may not yield the desired product.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction using a nitration step as a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl group in the ortho or para position relative to amino.

4. Then, substitute the amino group with ethoxy.

Wait, but how do you substitute an amino group with ethoxy? That's not straightforward. Amines are typically not good leaving groups unless under specific conditions. Maybe using some kind of Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement, but that's probably not applicable here.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of the steps in each option and see which leads to the desired product.

Looking at Option D:

i) Nitration → nitro group added.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts (tert-butyl) → add tert-butyl to benzene with amino group. Since amino is a strong activating group, the tert-butyl would add para to it.

iv) Nitration → nitrate the benzene with amino and tert-butyl groups. Where would the nitro group go?

Wait, amino is ortho/para directing. So the nitro would be added either ortho or para to the amino group. But the amino group is already attached, and the tert-butyl is at para. So perhaps the nitro would go into the ortho position relative to the amino group, but that might clash with the tert-butyl group.

This seems to complicate the structure, and the target has only one nitro group. So perhaps this is not the right option.

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts tert-butyl.

ii) Nitration → nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) Nitration again → add another nitro group.

But target has only one nitro group, so this can't be right.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonation → add sulfonic acid group.

iii) Nitration → nitro group added.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce sulfonic acid? Not likely; Fe/HCl usually reduces nitro groups.

v) Diazotization → form diazonium salt.

vi) Nitration again? No, target has one nitro.

This seems unclear.

Option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts tert-butyl.

ii) Nitration.

iv) Sulfonation → add sulfonic acid.

vi) Diazotization.

vii) Hydrolysis.

viii) NaOH and EtBr → perhaps Williamson.

ix) Fe/HCl → reduce.

This path seems to involve multiple steps, perhaps introducing several groups but I'm not sure how it leads to the target.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some steps. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D. Let me re-examine option D:

Steps in D:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → add tert-butyl group.

iv) Nitration → nitro group added (but target has only one nitro, so this can't be right).

Hmm, that's a problem. So option D adds a second nitro group, which is not desired.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check option D again.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → Williamson.

Wait, but this seems to have multiple steps, perhaps adding more substituents than needed. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: maybe the correct order is to add the ethoxy group via a substitution after activating the ring. For example, if a nitro group is present, perhaps the ethoxy can be introduced in a position that's ortho to it.

But I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should try to figure out which option correctly adds the substituents in the right order.

Let me think about the target molecule again. The substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, each substituent is adjacent to the next.

I think the correct sequence is to add the nitro group first, then the tert-butyl group, and then the ethoxy group. But how?

Wait, nitro is meta directing, so adding tert-butyl after nitro would put it in the meta position relative to nitro, which would be position 4 (if nitro is in position 3). But in the target, tert-butyl is in position 2, which is adjacent to position 1 (ethoxy) and 3 (nitro). Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the numbering right.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added first, then nitro, then tert-butyl.

If I add ethoxy first, the ring is activated. Then, nitration occurs in the ortho or para position relative to ethoxy. Then, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts would go into another position.

But let's think about the positions:

Suppose ethoxy is added in position 1. Then, nitration would be in position 3 (ortho to ethoxy). Then, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts would go to position 2 (ortho to ethoxy). But wait, the nitro is already in position 3. So, how would tert-butyl go to position 2 when the ring already has substituents in 1 and 3?

Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps after adding ethoxy and nitro, the tert-butyl can be added in the remaining position.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the directing effects again.

If ethoxy is in position 1, nitro in position 3 (which is meta to ethoxy?), then the tert-butyl could be added in position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy and adjacent to nitro.

But how to achieve that.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add ethoxy group. But how? Because Friedel-Crafts doesn't add ethers. So maybe via a substitution.

Wait, perhaps through a nitration, then reduction, then substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution using a leaving group, such as a nitro group that has been converted to a better leaving group.

But this is getting too vague. Let me try to think about each option again.

Looking at option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts (tert-butyl added).

ii) Nitration → nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) Nitration → another nitro group.

This seems to add two nitro groups, which is not desired.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts (tert-butyl).

ii) Sulfonation → adds sulfonic acid.

iii) Nitration → adds nitro.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces sulfonic acid? Unlikely.

v) Diazotization.

vi) Nitration again.

Hmm, not helpful.

Option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts tert-butyl.

ii) Nitration.

iv) Sulfonation.

vi) Diazotization.

vii) Hydrolysis.

viii) NaOH/EtBr.

ix) Fe/HCl.

This seems to involve several steps, perhaps adding multiple groups.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct order of substituents in the options.

The target has nitro, ethoxy, and tert-butyl.

Looking for the step where ethoxy is introduced. Probably via a substitution reaction, perhaps using a diazonium salt.

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after the ring has been strongly activated. For example, after adding a strong activating group like -NH2.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl → tert-butyl group adds in ortho or para to amino.

4. Introduce ethoxy group via substitution of the amino group. But how?

Wait, maybe using a diazonium salt. For example, convert the amino group to a diazonium salt, then perform a substitution with ethoxide.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the amino group can be converted into a leaving group, but I don't think that's standard.

Hmm, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Nitration → add nitro.

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl.

3. Substitute nitro with ethoxy.

But substitution of nitro is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added last.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro in the meta position relative to tert-butyl.

3. Then, introduce ethoxy via substitution.

But I'm not sure how to introduce ethoxy via substitution.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a strongly activated ring. So, perhaps after adding the nitro and tert-butyl groups, the ring is activated enough in a certain position to allow substitution with ethoxy.

But I'm not certain. 

Another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Grignard reaction, but I don't think that works on aromatic rings.

At this point, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for which option correctly introduces all three substituents in the right positions.

Looking at option D again:

i) Nitration → nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → add tert-butyl in ortho or para to amino.

iv) Nitration → add another nitro group. But this would lead to two nitro groups, which is not desired.

So option D is likely incorrect.

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

ii) Nitration → nitro group.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) Nitration → another nitro group.

Also incorrect.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonation → sulfonic acid.

iii) Nitration → nitro group.

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce sulfonic acid to SH group. Unlikely.

v) Diazotization.

vi) Nitration again.

I don't see this leading to the target.

Option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

ii) Nitration.

iv) Sulfonation.

vi) Diazotization.

vii) Hydrolysis.

viii) NaOH/EtBr → maybe Williamson.

ix) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce.

Hmm. Let's try to follow the steps in option A.

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → tert-butylbenzene.

2. Nitration → add nitro group. Nitro is meta-directing. So, nitro will be added in the meta position relative to tert-butyl. So, tert-butyl is in position 1, nitro in position 4.

3. Then, sulfonation → SO3 adds, which is a strong meta director. Where would it add? The ring already has tert-butyl (position 1) and nitro (position 4). Sulfon would go into the meta position relative to these groups. But position 3 is free, perhaps.

4. Then, diazotization with NaNO2/HCl → but where is the amine? Unless a substitution has occurred earlier, I don't see an amine here.

Wait, this seems off. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps after sulfonation, they do something else. Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

After adding tert-butyl and nitro, then sulfonate to activate a position for another substitution.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Perhaps I should consider that the correct option is option D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl in para to amine.

4. Diazotize the amine → form diazonium salt.

5. Substitute the diazonium group with ethoxy → via coupling or substitution.

But how? Diazonium salts can undergo substitution with nucleophiles. So, perhaps using NaNO2/HCl to form the diazonium chloride, then treating with ethanol in basic conditions (like NaOH) to substitute the diazonium group with ethoxy.

Wait, that makes sense. So the steps would be:

i) Nitration → nitro.

ii) Reduction → amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

iv) Diazotization → form diazonium.

v) Substitution → ethoxy.

vi) Any other steps?

So, let's see which option includes this sequence.

Looking at the options, perhaps option D includes these steps. Let me check:

Option D's steps:

i) Nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

iii) Friedel-Crafts.

iv) Nitration → but this adds another nitro, which we don't want.

So, option D is not correct.

Looking for an option that includes nitration, reduction, Friedel-Crafts, diazotization, substitution.

Hmm, none of the options seem to directly follow this sequence.

Wait, perhaps option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

ii) Nitration → nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) Nitration → another nitro. No, that's not right.

Option D has:

i) Nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iii) Friedel-Crafts.

iv) Nitration → another nitro.

Not desired.

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts.

ii) Nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl.

iv) Nitration again.

Hmm.

Option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts.

ii) Nitration.

iv) Sulfonation.

vi) Diazotization.

vii) Hydrolysis.

viii) NaOH/EtBr.

ix) Fe/HCl.

Option A's steps after adding tert-butyl and nitro:

iv) Sulfonation → add sulfonic acid.

vi) Diazotization → but where is the amine?

Wait, unless after sulfonation, there's a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps after sulfonation are to introduce another group.

I think I'm not getting anywhere. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, considering the target has nitro in position 3, ethoxy in 1, and tert-butyl in 2.

Perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro in meta to tert-butyl.

3. Add ethoxy in a position that is ortho to nitro and adjacent to tert-butyl.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first, then tert-butyl in meta, and then ethoxy in the ortho position to nitro.

Wait, if nitro is in position 3, then adding ethoxy in position 2 (ortho to nitro) and adjacent to tert-butyl in position 1.

But how to achieve that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is: nitro first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl.

But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that option D is the correct one, but I'm not entirely confident.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents (tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro) in the correct positions (1, 2, and 3, respectively) while considering the directing effects of each group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Considerations:
1. **Substituent Directing Effects**:
   - **Nitro (-NO₂)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.
   - **Ethoxy (-OCH₂CH₃)**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - **tert-Butyl (-C(CH₃)₃)**: Activating, ortho/para-directing but tends to direct more to para due to steric hindrance.

2. **Target Structure**:
   - The substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), meaning they are adjacent to each other in a 1,2,3 arrangement.

3. **Reaction Sequences**:
   - The order of adding substituents is critical due to the deactivating nature of the nitro group, which makes the ring less reactive for subsequent substitutions.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  2. Nitration.
  3. Sulfonation.
  4. Diazotization.
  5. Hydrolysis.
  6. Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr).
  7. Fe/HCl reduction.
- **Issues**:
  - The sequence introduces multiple groups, including sulfonic acid and diazonium intermediates, which do not align with the target structure. The steps do not clearly lead to the desired substitution pattern.

#### **Option B**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  2. Nitration.
  3. Reduction of nitro to amine (Fe/HCl).
  4. Nitration again.
- **Issues**:
  - Introduces two nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target structure that has only one nitro group. The sequence does not achieve the correct substitution pattern.

#### **Option C**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  2. Sulfonation.
  3. Nitration.
  4. Reduction of sulfonic acid (Fe/HCl).
  5. Diazotization.
  6. Nitration again.
  7. Hydrolysis.
  8. Dilute H₂SO₄.
  9. NaOH/EtBr.
- **Issues**:
  - The sequence involves multiple steps that introduce additional groups (e.g., sulfonic acid), which are not part of the target structure. The steps do not align with the desired substitution pattern.

#### **Option D**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Nitration.
  2. Reduction of nitro to amine (Fe/HCl).
  3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  4. Nitration again.
  5. Diazotization.
  6. Sulfonation.
  7. Dilute H₂SO₄.
  8. Hydrolysis.
  9. NaOH/EtBr.
- **Issues**:
  - Introduces two nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target structure. The sequence does not achieve the correct substitution pattern.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences provided fully align with the correct substitution pattern and the desired product. However, **Option D** comes closest to the required steps, despite introducing an extra nitro group. Based on the given choices, **Option D** is selected as the best possible answer.
