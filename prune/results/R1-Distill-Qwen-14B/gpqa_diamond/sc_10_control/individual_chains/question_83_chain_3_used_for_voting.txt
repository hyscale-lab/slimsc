Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about titration. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let's see if I can work through it step by step.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid that's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options given are A to D.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I think I should figure out the concentrations after dilution and then determine what happens during the titration.

So, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. To find the new concentration, I'll use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So, M2 = (M1*V1)/V2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = (1)/40 = 0.0125 M. Oh wait, wait—no. 0.05 *20 is 1 mmol, right? Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters, 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L, so 0.05 *0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then, adding 20 cm³ brings the total volume to 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Because 20 cm³ (0.02 L) * 0.05 M is 0.001 mol. Diluted to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh yeah, that's right. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid. When diluted, it dissociates more, but for initial calculations, maybe the initial concentration is sufficient.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So the reaction consumes acetic acid and produces its conjugate base, acetate ions.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially present. Let's calculate that.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Wait, no, the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M, but wait no, the 0.05 M was before dilution. Wait, no—wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M, so that's 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then we dilute it with 20 cm³ water, so total volume 40 cm³. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, but the amount of acetic acid is still 0.001 mol.

So when titrating, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

So, 25% of the equivalence volume is 10 cm³ * 0.25 = 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Let me calculate the moles of NaOH added here: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the reaction is 1:1, this would neutralize 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

So, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol.

After adding 2.5 cm³ NaOH: moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) = 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is now original 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ NaOH = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute that.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → log(1.85) = 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) = 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Then, [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) = approximately 4.256. Looking at the options, the closest is option A which says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, but wait, let me check my calculations again.

Wait, another way to think: Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log(nA^-/nHA), because when volumes are same, the ratio is nA^-/nHA. So in this case, the moles of A^- is 0.00025, and moles of HA is 0.00075.

So ratio is 0.00025/0.00075 = 1/3. Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So approximately 4.26. So that's the first part.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a strong electrolyte; it dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The concentration of acetate ions will determine the pH. Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, the solution will be basic.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added = moles of acetic acid (0.001 mol). The total volume is 40 cm³ (original) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be calculated using Kw/Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.

So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] ≈ (x)(x)/ (0.02 - x) ≈ x²/(0.02) → since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 9.02 as the second value. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing Kb. Let me recheck.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. That part was correct.

Concentration [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M. So Kb = 5.405e-10.

x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11 → x ~ 1.04e-5 → pOH ~4.98 → pH ~9.02.

But none of the options have a pH near 9 at equivalence.

Wait, the options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C)4.73; 7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Maybe I should not approximate so much. Let me compute Kb more accurately.

Wait, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) → let's compute 1 /1.85 = approximately 0.5405. So 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. Correct.

So the calculation for [OH^-] is correct. So pH is about 9.02. But none of the options have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the moles at equivalence. Let me re-examine.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. So at equivalence, moles of NaOH added are 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So total volume is 40 +10=50 cm³.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So that part is correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Oh wait, wait—is the solution at equivalence point a buffer? No, it's a solution of the conjugate base. So the pH should be based on acetate's hydrolysis.

Another approach: perhaps using the formula for weak base pH.

The formula is pH = pKa + 0.5*pKb + something? Wait, no. Or perhaps using the formula pH = pKa + 0.5 (pKa - pKb)? No, wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the pH can be calculated using the formula for a solution of a weak base. The formula is:

pH = (pKa + pKb)/2 + log (sqrt(Kb * C)) )? No, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the pH can be found by:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw – pKb) ?

Wait, pKw is 14, pKa is ~4.733.

Wait, pKb = log(1/(Ka*Kw)) ?

Wait, no. Wait, Kw = Ka * Kb. So Kb = Kw / Ka → pKb = pKw – pKa.

pKw is 14, pKa is ~4.733 → pKb is 14 – 4.733 = 9.267.

Then, the pH of a solution of a weak base is given by:

pH = pKa + pKb / 2 + log(sqrt(C)) ?

Wait, no. Wait, maybe I should use the formula for a weak base:

For a weak base B with concentration C:

[B] + H2O ↔ BH+ + OH^-

The Kb expression is Kb = [BH+][OH^-]/[B].

Assuming x is small, [OH^-] ≈ sqrt(Kb * C).

So, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C).

Then, pOH = ½ (pKb - log C).

Wait, let's compute that.

pKb is 9.267.

log C is log(0.02) = log(2e-2) = log(2) + log(1e-2) = 0.3010 -2 = -1.699.

So pOH = ½ (9.267 - (-1.699)) = ½ (10.966) = 5.483.

So pH = 14 -5.483 = 8.517. Approximately 8.52.

Wait, that's interesting. So the pH at equivalence point is about 8.52? But earlier, when I computed using Kb = 5.405e-10 and C=0.02, I got pH around 9.02. Now, using this method, it's 8.52. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Kb calculation. Let me recheck.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 → let me compute it accurately.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 *1e-9 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Now, with Kb =5.405e-10 and C=0.02 M.

x² = Kb*C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 → [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH =4.98 → pH=9.02.

But using the other method, I got pH~8.52.

Hmm, conflicting results. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the second approach is flawed. Let me think again. I think the correct approach is to use the Kb and the concentration to find [OH^-], as I did first. So where is the discrepancy coming from?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach. Let me re-examine that.

The formula for a weak base: when the base is weak, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C), but this is only a good approximation when C is large and Kb is small. In this case, C is 0.02 M and Kb is 5.4e-10. So Kb*C is 1.08e-11, which is much less than 1e-6. So the approximation [OH^-] ≈ sqrt(Kb*C) is still valid.

Wait, but wait, when Kb*C is small, the assumption is that x is much smaller than C, so x² = Kb*C → x = sqrt(Kb*C) → [OH^-] = x = sqrt(Kb*C).

So why the two methods are giving different results?

Wait, perhaps the second approach I did earlier was incorrect. Let me calculate again.

Wait, using the method where pOH = ½ (pKb - log C) → pKb is 9.267, log C is log(0.02) = log(2e-2) = log(2) + log(1e-2) → 0.3010 -2 = -1.699.

So pOH = (9.267 - (-1.699)) / 2 = (10.966)/2 = 5.483 → pH=14-5.483=8.517.

But earlier, using Kb and C, I get pH=9.02. So these are conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the second approach isn't correct because the formula pOH = ½ (pKb - log C) isn't the correct approach. Maybe it's derived from another assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to set up the equation correctly.

The correct approach is to use:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Assuming that [CH3COOH] = [OH^-] = x, and [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02.

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → which is sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5 → [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

So why does the second method give a different number?

Wait, maybe the second approach I tried is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the second approach is for a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps the correct pH is around 9.02, but the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake earlier in the initial calculations.

Wait, let me go back. The options don't have 9.02 as an equivalence pH. The options have A) 4.26; 8.52, which is pH 8.52 at equivalence.

But according to my calculations, it should be around 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me check again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈4.733.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) → 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial moles. Let's recheck.

The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L= 0.001 mol. So at equivalence, 0.001 mol of NaOH is added. Volume is 40 cm³ +10 cm³=50 cm³. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm. So perhaps there's a miscalculation in the approach.

Wait, another approach: Maybe using the formula for the pH of a salt of a weak acid.

At equivalence, the solution is sodium acetate. Sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

The expression for Kb is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Assuming that [CH3COOH] = [OH^-] = x, and [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) → approximately 1.04e-5 M.

[OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have this. The closest option is A, which at equivalence is 8.52. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the dilution step. Let me recheck.

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted with 20 cm³ water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1 mmol) /40 cm³ → 0.025 M. Wait, wait: 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L. Volume is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 *0.02 = 0.001 mol. Diluted to 0.04 L → 0.001 /0.04 = 0.025 M. So that's correct.

So the initial concentration is correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the solution at equivalence is not just the acetate ion but perhaps something else. Wait, no, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, so it's the acetate ion in solution.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH using a more precise method without approximation.

Let me set up the equation without approximation.

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial concentration: [CH3COO^-] =0.02 M; [CH3COOH]=0; [OH^-]=0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: [CH3COO^-] =0.02 -x; [CH3COOH]=x; [OH^-]=x.

So Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x^2 =5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5 → [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

So no, the approximation holds because x is 1e-5, which is much less than 0.02.

Hmm. So why does the option A have 8.52 as the equivalence pH? Did I make a mistake in the initial setup?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I used the wrong value for Ka. Wait, Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is 4.73. So no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, but I'm considering the solution of sodium acetate in water. But wait, sodium acetate is a strong electrolyte; it dissociates completely. So yes, the acetate concentration is 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression without the approximation. Let's see:

Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, but let's see:

x² =5.405e-10*(0.02 -x) → x² =1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Rearranged: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

a=1; b=5.405e-10; c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant: b² +4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) → (2.92e-19) +4.324e-11 → approximately 4.324e-11.

sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x = [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ]/2.

The positive root is (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

Wait, but earlier approximation gave x=1.04e-5, which is around 1e-5. Now, the quadratic gives x≈3.29e-6. That's a big difference. So which is correct?

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic equation.

Wait, let me recompute the discriminant.

(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 *1e-20 → 29.218 *1e-20 →2.9218e-19.

4ac = 4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) →-4.324e-11. Wait, no, because the original equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0 → a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So discriminant is b² -4ac? No, discriminant is b² +4ac, because c is negative. So 5.405e-10^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) = 2.9218e-19 +4.324e-11 → 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.92e-19, so the sqrt is approximately sqrt(4.324e-11) → about 6.576e-6.

So x = [-5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ]/2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 )≈6.57e-6 → x≈3.285e-6.

So [OH^-] is 3.285e-6 → pOH≈5.483 → pH=8.517, which is about 8.52.

Wait, so now I'm getting pH around 8.52. So why the earlier approximation gave me a different result?

Ah, I think I see the mistake. Earlier, I thought that Kb*C =5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.08e-11 → x= sqrt(1.08e-11)=1.04e-5. But that's wrong because when the base is weak, the initial approximation x << C may not hold, and the quadratic solution is necessary. So in reality, x is about 3.28e-6, making [OH^-] 3.28e-6 → pOH≈5.48 → pH≈8.52.

So I think I messed up the initial approximation. The correct approach is to use the quadratic equation because when C is small (0.02 M), and Kb is not extremely small, the approximation x << C may not hold as accurately. Wait, but in this case, x is 3.28e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02 (which is 2e-2 → 2e-2 is 2e-2 M, which is much larger than 3.28e-6). So why was the approximation invalid?

Wait, no, in the quadratic solution, x is about 3.28e-6, which is much less than 0.02. So the approximation [CH3COO^-] ≈0.02 holds, and x is indeed much smaller than 0.02. So why did the quadratic solution give a different x than the approximation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic setup. Let me recheck.

The correct equation is x² = Kb*(0.02 -x). So x² = 5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

Expanding: x² =1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Bringing all terms to left: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

The quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b² +4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) → (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) → approximately 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)=6.576e-6.

So x= [-5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 = (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 → approx 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.483 → pH=8.517 → about 8.52.

So why earlier, without using the quadratic, I got [OH^-]=1.04e-5?

Because I incorrectly applied the formula. The correct approach is to consider that Kb = (x²)/(0.02 -x). If x is small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02, and x² ≈ Kb *0.02 →x= sqrt(Kb*0.02). But wait, that's exactly what I did earlier, and it gave x=1.04e-5, which contradicts the quadratic solution.

Wait, no, wait: no, earlier I assumed Kb = x² / C → x = sqrt(Kb*C). But according to the quadratic solution, that's not correct. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, let's plug x=1.04e-5 into the Kb expression.

x=1.04e-5 → x²=1.08e-10.

(1.08e-10)/(0.02 -1.04e-5) → denominator is approximately 0.01999896 → ~0.02.

So (1.08e-10)/(0.02) =5.4e-9. But Kb is 5.405e-10, which is an order of magnitude smaller. So this suggests that x=1.04e-5 is about 10 times too large.

Wait, so where did I go wrong? Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me recalculate the discriminant properly.

Wait, the equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

The discriminant D = b² +4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11).

(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 * 1e-20 → 29.218 *1e-20 → 2.9218e-19.

4ac =4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) → -4.324e-11. Wait, no, because c is negative, 4ac is negative. So D should be b² -4ac, but wait, c is negative, so 4ac is negative, so -4ac is positive. Hmm, perhaps I confused the signs.

Wait, the quadratic equation is ax² +bx +c=0, and the discriminant is D =b² -4ac.

In our case, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So D= (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → 2.9218e-19 +4.324e-11 → which is approximately 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So x = [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] /2.

Taking the positive root: (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 → approximately 6.576e-6/2 =3.288e-6.

So x=3.288e-6 → [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.483 → pH=8.517 ≈8.52.

So the correct pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52.

But why did the initial approximation give a much higher pH of ~9.02? Because when I assumed x² = Kb*C, I think I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, no, the formula Kb = (x²)/(C -x) is correct. When x is small, C -x ≈ C, so x ≈ sqrt(Kb*C). But in this case, that gave x=1.04e-5, which is larger than the x found via quadratic. So that suggests that the approximation is invalid here. But why?

Because Kb*C is 5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11, which is x². So x should be sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5. But that gives Kb= x²/(C -x) = (1.08e-10)/(0.02 -1.04e-5) → (1.08e-10)/(0.01999896) → about 5.405e-9, which is larger than Kb=5.405e-10 by a factor of 10.

So that suggests that the initial approximation is invalid here. Therefore, the quadratic solution must be used, giving x=3.288e-6, leading to pH=8.52.

So, putting it all together, at 25% titration, pH is about 4.26, and at equivalence, it's 8.52. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26; 8.52.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (diluted to 40.00 cm³ with water) with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

### Step 1: Initial Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution
The initial moles of acetic acid are calculated as:
\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]
After dilution to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration is:
\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 2: pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. The moles of NaOH added are:
\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]
This neutralizes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:
\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]
The moles of acetate ion formed are:
\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]
The total volume is now:
\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.5 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]
The concentrations are:
\[
[\text{Acetic acid}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Acetate}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{Acetate}]}{[\text{Acetic acid}]} \right),
\]
where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:
\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The total volume is:
\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm³} + 10 \, \text{cm³} = 50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]
The concentration of acetate ions is:
\[
[\text{Acetate}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]
Acetate ions hydrolyze in water:
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \(K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}\). Using the approximation \([OH^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot C}\):
\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]
The pOH is:
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]
and the pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]
However, a more precise calculation using the quadratic formula gives:
\[
[OH^-] \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}, \quad \text{pOH} \approx 5.48, \quad \text{pH} \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately 4.26, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about titration. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let's see if I can work through it step by step.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid that's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options given are A to D.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I think I should figure out the concentrations after dilution and then determine what happens during the titration.

So, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. To find the new concentration, I'll use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So, M2 = (M1*V1)/V2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = (1)/40 = 0.0125 M. Oh wait, wait—no. 0.05 *20 is 1 mmol, right? Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters, 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L, so 0.05 *0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then, adding 20 cm³ brings the total volume to 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Because 20 cm³ (0.02 L) * 0.05 M is 0.001 mol. Diluted to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh yeah, that's right. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid. When diluted, it dissociates more, but for initial calculations, maybe the initial concentration is sufficient.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So the reaction consumes acetic acid and produces its conjugate base, acetate ions.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially present. Let's calculate that.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Wait, no, the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M, but wait no, the 0.05 M was before dilution. Wait, no—wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M, so that's 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then we dilute it with 20 cm³ water, so total volume 40 cm³. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, but the amount of acetic acid is still 0.001 mol.

So when titrating, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

So, 25% of the equivalence volume is 10 cm³ * 0.25 = 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Let me calculate the moles of NaOH added here: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the reaction is 1:1, this would neutralize 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

So, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol.

After adding 2.5 cm³ NaOH: moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) = 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is now original 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ NaOH = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute that.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → log(1.85) = 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) = 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Then, [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) = approximately 4.256. Looking at the options, the closest is option A which says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, but wait, let me check my calculations again.

Wait, another way to think: Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log(nA^-/nHA), because when volumes are same, the ratio is nA^-/nHA. So in this case, the moles of A^- is 0.00025, and moles of HA is 0.00075.

So ratio is 0.00025/0.00075 = 1/3. Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So approximately 4.26. So that's the first part.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a strong electrolyte; it dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The concentration of acetate ions will determine the pH. Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, the solution will be basic.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added = moles of acetic acid (0.001 mol). The total volume is 40 cm³ (original) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be calculated using Kw/Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.

So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] ≈ (x)(x)/ (0.02 - x) ≈ x²/(0.02) → since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 9.02 as the second value. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing Kb. Let me recheck.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. That part was correct.

Concentration [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M. So Kb = 5.405e-10.

x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11 → x ~ 1.04e-5 → pOH ~4.98 → pH ~9.02.

But none of the options have a pH near 9 at equivalence.

Wait, the options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C)4.73; 7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Maybe I should not approximate so much. Let me compute Kb more accurately.

Wait, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) → let's compute 1 /1.85 = approximately 0.5405. So 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. Correct.

So the calculation for [OH^-] is correct. So pH is about 9.02. But none of the options have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the moles at equivalence. Let me re-examine.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. So at equivalence, moles of NaOH added are 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So total volume is 40 +10=50 cm³.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So that part is correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Oh wait, wait—is the solution at equivalence point a buffer? No, it's a solution of the conjugate base. So the pH should be based on acetate's hydrolysis.

Another approach: perhaps using the formula for weak base pH.

The formula is pH = pKa + 0.5*pKb + something? Wait, no. Or perhaps using the formula pH = pKa + 0.5 (pKa - pKb)? No, wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the pH can be calculated using the formula for a solution of a weak base. The formula is:

pH = (pKa + pKb)/2 + log (sqrt(Kb * C)) )? No, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the pH can be found by:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw – pKb) ?

Wait, pKw is 14, pKa is ~4.733.

Wait, pKb = log(1/(Ka*Kw)) ?

Wait, no. Wait, Kw = Ka * Kb. So Kb = Kw / Ka → pKb = pKw – pKa.

pKw is 14, pKa is ~4.733 → pKb is 14 – 4.733 = 9.267.

Then, the pH of a solution of a weak base is given by:

pH = pKa + pKb / 2 + log(sqrt(C)) ?

Wait, no. Wait, maybe I should use the formula for a weak base:

For a weak base B with concentration C:

[B] + H2O ↔ BH+ + OH^-

The Kb expression is Kb = [BH+][OH^-]/[B].

Assuming x is small, [OH^-] ≈ sqrt(Kb * C).

So, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C).

Then, pOH = ½ (pKb - log C).

Wait, let's compute that.

pKb is 9.267.

log C is log(0.02) = log(2e-2) = log(2) + log(1e-2) = 0.3010 -2 = -1.699.

So pOH = ½ (9.267 - (-1.699)) = ½ (10.966) = 5.483.

So pH = 14 -5.483 = 8.517. Approximately 8.52.

Wait, that's interesting. So the pH at equivalence point is about 8.52? But earlier, when I computed using Kb = 5.405e-10 and C=0.02, I got pH around 9.02. Now, using this method, it's 8.52. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Kb calculation. Let me recheck.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 → let me compute it accurately.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 *1e-9 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Now, with Kb =5.405e-10 and C=0.02 M.

x² = Kb*C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 → [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH =4.98 → pH=9.02.

But using the other method, I got pH~8.52.

Hmm, conflicting results. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the second approach is flawed. Let me think again. I think the correct approach is to use the Kb and the concentration to find [OH^-], as I did first. So where is the discrepancy coming from?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach. Let me re-examine that.

The formula for a weak base: when the base is weak, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C), but this is only a good approximation when C is large and Kb is small. In this case, C is 0.02 M and Kb is 5.4e-10. So Kb*C is 1.08e-11, which is much less than 1e-6. So the approximation [OH^-] ≈ sqrt(Kb*C) is still valid.

Wait, but wait, when Kb*C is small, the assumption is that x is much smaller than C, so x² = Kb*C → x = sqrt(Kb*C) → [OH^-] = x = sqrt(Kb*C).

So why the two methods are giving different results?

Wait, perhaps the second approach I did earlier was incorrect. Let me calculate again.

Wait, using the method where pOH = ½ (pKb - log C) → pKb is 9.267, log C is log(0.02) = log(2e-2) = log(2) + log(1e-2) → 0.3010 -2 = -1.699.

So pOH = (9.267 - (-1.699)) / 2 = (10.966)/2 = 5.483 → pH=14-5.483=8.517.

But earlier, using Kb and C, I get pH=9.02. So these are conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the second approach isn't correct because the formula pOH = ½ (pKb - log C) isn't the correct approach. Maybe it's derived from another assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to set up the equation correctly.

The correct approach is to use:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Assuming that [CH3COOH] = [OH^-] = x, and [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02.

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → which is sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5 → [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

So why does the second method give a different number?

Wait, maybe the second approach I tried is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the second approach is for a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps the correct pH is around 9.02, but the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake earlier in the initial calculations.

Wait, let me go back. The options don't have 9.02 as an equivalence pH. The options have A) 4.26; 8.52, which is pH 8.52 at equivalence.

But according to my calculations, it should be around 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me check again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈4.733.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) → 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial moles. Let's recheck.

The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L= 0.001 mol. So at equivalence, 0.001 mol of NaOH is added. Volume is 40 cm³ +10 cm³=50 cm³. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm. So perhaps there's a miscalculation in the approach.

Wait, another approach: Maybe using the formula for the pH of a salt of a weak acid.

At equivalence, the solution is sodium acetate. Sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

The expression for Kb is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Assuming that [CH3COOH] = [OH^-] = x, and [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) → approximately 1.04e-5 M.

[OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have this. The closest option is A, which at equivalence is 8.52. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the dilution step. Let me recheck.

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted with 20 cm³ water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1 mmol) /40 cm³ → 0.025 M. Wait, wait: 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L. Volume is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 *0.02 = 0.001 mol. Diluted to 0.04 L → 0.001 /0.04 = 0.025 M. So that's correct.

So the initial concentration is correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the solution at equivalence is not just the acetate ion but perhaps something else. Wait, no, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, so it's the acetate ion in solution.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH using a more precise method without approximation.

Let me set up the equation without approximation.

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial concentration: [CH3COO^-] =0.02 M; [CH3COOH]=0; [OH^-]=0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: [CH3COO^-] =0.02 -x; [CH3COOH]=x; [OH^-]=x.

So Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x^2 =5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5 → [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

So no, the approximation holds because x is 1e-5, which is much less than 0.02.

Hmm. So why does the option A have 8.52 as the equivalence pH? Did I make a mistake in the initial setup?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I used the wrong value for Ka. Wait, Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is 4.73. So no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, but I'm considering the solution of sodium acetate in water. But wait, sodium acetate is a strong electrolyte; it dissociates completely. So yes, the acetate concentration is 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression without the approximation. Let's see:

Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, but let's see:

x² =5.405e-10*(0.02 -x) → x² =1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Rearranged: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

a=1; b=5.405e-10; c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant: b² +4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) → (2.92e-19) +4.324e-11 → approximately 4.324e-11.

sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x = [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ]/2.

The positive root is (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

Wait, but earlier approximation gave x=1.04e-5, which is around 1e-5. Now, the quadratic gives x≈3.29e-6. That's a big difference. So which is correct?

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic equation.

Wait, let me recompute the discriminant.

(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 *1e-20 → 29.218 *1e-20 →2.9218e-19.

4ac = 4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) →-4.324e-11. Wait, no, because the original equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0 → a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So discriminant is b² -4ac? No, discriminant is b² +4ac, because c is negative. So 5.405e-10^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) = 2.9218e-19 +4.324e-11 → 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.92e-19, so the sqrt is approximately sqrt(4.324e-11) → about 6.576e-6.

So x = [-5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ]/2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 )≈6.57e-6 → x≈3.285e-6.

So [OH^-] is 3.285e-6 → pOH≈5.483 → pH=8.517, which is about 8.52.

Wait, so now I'm getting pH around 8.52. So why the earlier approximation gave me a different result?

Ah, I think I see the mistake. Earlier, I thought that Kb*C =5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.08e-11 → x= sqrt(1.08e-11)=1.04e-5. But that's wrong because when the base is weak, the initial approximation x << C may not hold, and the quadratic solution is necessary. So in reality, x is about 3.28e-6, making [OH^-] 3.28e-6 → pOH≈5.48 → pH≈8.52.

So I think I messed up the initial approximation. The correct approach is to use the quadratic equation because when C is small (0.02 M), and Kb is not extremely small, the approximation x << C may not hold as accurately. Wait, but in this case, x is 3.28e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02 (which is 2e-2 → 2e-2 is 2e-2 M, which is much larger than 3.28e-6). So why was the approximation invalid?

Wait, no, in the quadratic solution, x is about 3.28e-6, which is much less than 0.02. So the approximation [CH3COO^-] ≈0.02 holds, and x is indeed much smaller than 0.02. So why did the quadratic solution give a different x than the approximation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic setup. Let me recheck.

The correct equation is x² = Kb*(0.02 -x). So x² = 5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

Expanding: x² =1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Bringing all terms to left: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

The quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b² +4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) → (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) → approximately 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)=6.576e-6.

So x= [-5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 = (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 → approx 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.483 → pH=8.517 → about 8.52.

So why earlier, without using the quadratic, I got [OH^-]=1.04e-5?

Because I incorrectly applied the formula. The correct approach is to consider that Kb = (x²)/(0.02 -x). If x is small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02, and x² ≈ Kb *0.02 →x= sqrt(Kb*0.02). But wait, that's exactly what I did earlier, and it gave x=1.04e-5, which contradicts the quadratic solution.

Wait, no, wait: no, earlier I assumed Kb = x² / C → x = sqrt(Kb*C). But according to the quadratic solution, that's not correct. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, let's plug x=1.04e-5 into the Kb expression.

x=1.04e-5 → x²=1.08e-10.

(1.08e-10)/(0.02 -1.04e-5) → denominator is approximately 0.01999896 → ~0.02.

So (1.08e-10)/(0.02) =5.4e-9. But Kb is 5.405e-10, which is an order of magnitude smaller. So this suggests that x=1.04e-5 is about 10 times too large.

Wait, so where did I go wrong? Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me recalculate the discriminant properly.

Wait, the equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

The discriminant D = b² +4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11).

(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 * 1e-20 → 29.218 *1e-20 → 2.9218e-19.

4ac =4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) → -4.324e-11. Wait, no, because c is negative, 4ac is negative. So D should be b² -4ac, but wait, c is negative, so 4ac is negative, so -4ac is positive. Hmm, perhaps I confused the signs.

Wait, the quadratic equation is ax² +bx +c=0, and the discriminant is D =b² -4ac.

In our case, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So D= (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → 2.9218e-19 +4.324e-11 → which is approximately 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So x = [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] /2.

Taking the positive root: (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 → approximately 6.576e-6/2 =3.288e-6.

So x=3.288e-6 → [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.483 → pH=8.517 ≈8.52.

So the correct pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52.

But why did the initial approximation give a much higher pH of ~9.02? Because when I assumed x² = Kb*C, I think I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, no, the formula Kb = (x²)/(C -x) is correct. When x is small, C -x ≈ C, so x ≈ sqrt(Kb*C). But in this case, that gave x=1.04e-5, which is larger than the x found via quadratic. So that suggests that the approximation is invalid here. But why?

Because Kb*C is 5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11, which is x². So x should be sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5. But that gives Kb= x²/(C -x) = (1.08e-10)/(0.02 -1.04e-5) → (1.08e-10)/(0.01999896) → about 5.405e-9, which is larger than Kb=5.405e-10 by a factor of 10.

So that suggests that the initial approximation is invalid here. Therefore, the quadratic solution must be used, giving x=3.288e-6, leading to pH=8.52.

So, putting it all together, at 25% titration, pH is about 4.26, and at equivalence, it's 8.52. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26; 8.52.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (diluted to 40.00 cm³ with water) with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

### Step 1: Initial Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution
The initial moles of acetic acid are calculated as:
\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]
After dilution to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration is:
\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 2: pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. The moles of NaOH added are:
\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]
This neutralizes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:
\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]
The moles of acetate ion formed are:
\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]
The total volume is now:
\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.5 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]
The concentrations are:
\[
[\text{Acetic acid}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Acetate}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{Acetate}]}{[\text{Acetic acid}]} \right),
\]
where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:
\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The total volume is:
\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm³} + 10 \, \text{cm³} = 50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]
The concentration of acetate ions is:
\[
[\text{Acetate}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]
Acetate ions hydrolyze in water:
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \(K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}\). Using the approximation \([OH^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot C}\):
\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]
The pOH is:
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]
and the pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]
However, a more precise calculation using the quadratic formula gives:
\[
[OH^-] \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}, \quad \text{pOH} \approx 5.48, \quad \text{pH} \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately 4.26, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
