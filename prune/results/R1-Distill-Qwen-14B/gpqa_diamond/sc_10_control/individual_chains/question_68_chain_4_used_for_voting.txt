Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, let's try to think this through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the setup: there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu. The magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S_z. Oh wait, S_z is the spin component in the z-direction, right? So mu is proportional to the spin in the z-direction.

The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. So the particle's moment is aligned with the field. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. 

Wait, when the magnetic field is turned off, does that mean the particle is no longer in an external magnetic field? But then another field is applied along Y. Oh, right, so the particle is subjected to a magnetic field along Y now, after the initial B field along Z is turned off. 

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So the average <S_z> starts oscillating, and we need to find the frequency of that oscillation.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when a spin-1/2 particle is placed in a magnetic field, it has energy levels determined by the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B, right? Because the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field.

In the initial state, the field is along Z. So the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -γ S_z B. The energy levels here are E = ± (γ B / 2 ), since S_z can be ± ħ/2 for spin-1/2. Oh wait, wait. Spin matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H_initial would have eigenvalues ± (γ B (ħ/2 )) / ħ? Wait, maybe I should write mu as gamma times S_z, but in terms of units. 

Wait, maybe mu is given as mu = gamma * S_z. But S_z is in units of ħ/2. So mu would then be (gamma) * (ħ/2) * sigma_z, where sigma_z is the Pauli matrix. But perhaps I can think in terms of the Hamiltonian.

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the energy is H = - mu · B. So for B along Z, H = -gamma B S_z.

But S_z is ħ/2 * sigma_z. So H = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_z / 2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the factors. Let me think: S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energy eigenvalues would be E = -gamma B * (± ħ/2 ). So E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ). Wait, but sometimes the Hamiltonian is written as H = gamma B S_z, depending on the sign conventions. Hmm, maybe I should double-check the form.

Alternatively, I remember that the Zeeman Hamiltonian is H = - γ B S · n, where n is the direction of the field. So for B along Z, n is (0,0,1), so H = -γ B S_z. And since S_z in terms of Pauli matrices is (ħ/2) sigma_z, so H = - (gamma B) (ħ/2) sigma_z.

But wait, in any case, the point is that the initial state is an eigenstate of H_initial because the field is along Z. So the spin is aligned along Z. So the initial state is either |+z> or |-z>, I suppose.

But then the field is turned off, so the particle is in a state where there's no magnetic field for a moment. But then another field is turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -gamma B' S_y, where B' is the new magnetic field. Wait, but the magnitude is same, B. So B' = B. So H_final = - gamma B S_y.

Wait, no. The magnetic field is along Y, so the magnetic moment would interact with that. So H_final = -mu · B, and mu is gamma S. So H_final = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but wait: S is in units of ħ/2, right? So perhaps I should write S_y in terms of Pauli matrices. Because S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So H_final would be H = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

Wait, but the spin operators are S_x, S_y, S_z, each of which is (ħ/2) sigma_x, etc. So yeah, sigma matrices are the Pauli matrices.

So the Hamiltonian becomes H = (something) * sigma_y. Now, since the initial state was an eigenstate of H_initial = gamma B S_z, which in terms of sigma_z is proportional to sigma_z. So the initial state is either |+z> or |-z>, which are eigenstates of sigma_z.

But wait, when the field is turned off, the system is no longer in a magnetic field, so the Hamiltonian is zero, right? Or is it that the field is turned off and then the new field is applied? So the initial state is an eigenstate of H_initial, and then the Hamiltonian abruptly changes to H_final. So there's a sudden change in the Hamiltonian.

So the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously, but the Hamiltonian does. So the initial state is an eigenstate of H_initial, and now the system evolves under H_final.

So after the field change, the system is in a state |psi> which is an eigenstate of H_initial. Now, H_final is different.

To find the time evolution, we can write the state as |psi(t)> = exp(-i H_final t / ħ) |psi(0)>.

But the expectation value of S_z (or something else) would oscillate in time if H_final has components that cause transitions between different states.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the energy levels of H_final. H_final is proportional to sigma_y.

The energy eigenstates of H_final are the eigenstates of sigma_y. The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1, so the energies are E_+ = something and E_- = something else.

Wait, H_final = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y. So the eigenvalues are E = + (gamma B ħ/2 ) and E = - (gamma B ħ/2 ), right? Because sigma_y has eigenvalues ±1, so H_final has eigenvalues ± (-gamma B (ħ/2 )) ?

Wait, no. Let me compute it properly. H_final = - gamma B (ħ/2) * sigma_y. The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1, so the eigenvalues of H_final are E = ± [ - gamma B (ħ/2) * 1 ].

Wait, but that would be E = ± (-gamma B ħ/2 ). Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I made a sign mistake.

Wait, H_final is - gamma B S_y. Hmm, S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H_final = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So the eigenvalues of H_final are E = - gamma B (ħ/2 ) * (±1 ), right? Because sigma_y has eigenvalues ±1.

So E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2 ) * (+1) = - gamma B ħ/2.

E_- = - gamma B (ħ/2 ) * (-1) = + gamma B ħ/2.

Wait, that seems correct. So the energy levels are E_+ = - (gamma B ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B ħ/2.

Wait, but let's just think about the time evolution. The initial state is |+z> or |-z>, which are eigenstates of sigma_z, not sigma_y. So after the Hamiltonian changes, the state is still |+z>.

But under H_final, the state will evolve in time.

So the time evolution is given by |psi(t)> = exp( -i H_final t / ħ ) |+z>.

But H_final is proportional to sigma_y, so let's write H_final = (ħ/2) * ( - gamma B sigma_y ). So,

H_final = - (gamma B ħ/2 ) sigma_y.

So the time evolution operator is U = exp( -i H_final t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B sigma_y t ) / (2) ) ).

Because:

H_final t / ħ = [ - (gamma B ħ/2 ) sigma_y ] t / ħ = - (gamma B sigma_y t ) ( ħ t ) / (2 ħ ) ) = - (gamma B sigma_y t ) / 2.

So U becomes exp( i (gamma B sigma_y t )/(2) ).

Hmm, but to compute this exponential, perhaps I can use the identity that for any Pauli matrix sigma,

exp( i theta sigma ) = I cos(theta) + i sigma sin(theta).

So here, theta is (gamma B t ) / 2.

Wait, wait:

Wait, the exponent is (i gamma B sigma_y t ) / 2.

So let me write that as (i sigma_y theta ), where theta = gamma B t / 2.

Then, using the identity,

exp( i sigma_y theta ) = I cos(theta) + i sigma_y sin(theta).

So the time evolution operator U is [ cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta) ], where theta = (gamma B t )/2.

So U = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta).

Now, the initial state is |+z> which is the eigenstate of sigma_z, with eigenvalue +1.

Expressed in the basis of sigma_z, |+z> is (1, 0)^T, and |-z> is (0, 1)^T.

So let me compute U |+z>.

U = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta).

I is [[1,0],[0,1]], sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]].

So,

U = [[cos(theta), i sin(theta) ], [ -i sin(theta), cos(theta) ] ].

Wait, let me compute each component.

The matrix would be:

First row: cos(theta) + 0, i sin(theta) * (-i) ?

Wait, wait, let's compute the sigma_y term: i sigma_y sin(theta) = i * [[0, -i],[i, 0]] * sin(theta).

Which is:

[[0, -i^2], [i^2, 0]] sin(theta) = [[0, -(-1)], [-1, 0]] sin(theta) = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]] sin(theta).

So U = cos(theta) I + [[0,1],[-1,0]] sin(theta).

Which gives:

U = [[ cos(theta) + 0, 0 + sin(theta) ],
      [ 0 - sin(theta), cos(theta) + 0 ] ]

Wait, no. Let me recast it:

U = cos(theta) I + [[0, 1], [-1, 0]] sin(theta).

So,

U = [ [ cos(theta), 0 ],
       [ 0, cos(theta) ] ] + [ [ 0, sin(theta) ],
                                [ - sin(theta), 0 ] ]

Adding these together:

U = [ [ cos(theta) , sin(theta) ],
       [ - sin(theta), cos(theta) ] ].

Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me recalculate:

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the matrix multiplication.

Wait, U is the sum of I cos(theta) and sigma_y multiplied by i sin(theta). Oh wait no, no, because the Hamiltonian is H_final = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's take it step by step.

Wait, the time evolution operator is U = exp( -i H_final t / ħ )

H_final = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So, H_final t / ħ = (- gamma B sigma_y t ) / (2).

So,

U = exp( i (gamma B sigma_y t ) / 2 )

So, U = exp( i (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y )

So, substituting theta = gamma B t / 2,

U = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta).

So, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So, U becomes:

cos(theta) * [[1, 0],[0,1]] + i * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * sin(theta)

Compute each term:

First term (cos(theta) I):

[[ cos(theta), 0 ],
 [ 0, cos(theta) ] ]

Second term (i sigma_y sin(theta)):

i * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * sin(theta) = 

[[ 0, -i^2 sin(theta) ],
 [ i^2 sin(theta), 0 ] ]

Since i^2 = -1:

= [[0, sin(theta) ],
   [ - sin(theta), 0 ] ]

So the second term is [[0, sin(theta)], [ - sin(theta), 0 ] ]

So adding to the first term:

U = [ [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ],
       [ - sin(theta), cos(theta) ] ]

Wait, that makes sense, as it's a rotation matrix. Because for spin systems, a rotation around an axis can be represented by such matrices.

So, the state at time t is U |+z> = U * [1; 0].

So,

|psi(t)> = U * [1; 0] = [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T.

So,

psi_x = cos(theta)
psi_y = sin(theta)

Wait, no, wait: the state is a column vector.

Wait, U is 2x2 matrix, and |+z> is [1; 0].

So,

psi(t) = U [1; 0] = [ cos(theta) * 1 + sin(theta)*0,  - sin(theta)*1 + cos(theta)*0 ]^T ? Wait no, U is:

[ [ a, b ],
  [ c, d ] ]

So,

psi(t) = [ a*1 + b*0,
           c*1 + d *0 ]

Which is [ a, c ]^T.

Wait, in our case,

U = [[ cos(theta), sin(theta) ],
     [ - sin(theta), cos(theta) ] ]

So,

psi(t) = [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T.

So the state is |psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) | -z>.

Wait, because |+z> is [1;0], and |-z> is [0;1]. So,

psi(t) = cos(theta) |+z> + (- sin(theta)) |-z>.

So the state is a superposition of |+z> and |-z>.

Now, the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, <S_z>.

Wait, S_z is (ħ/2) sigma_z. So the expectation value <S_z> is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of sigma_z in the state |psi(t)>.

Sigma_z is diagonal, so <sigma_z> = <psi(t)| sigma_z | psi(t) >.

The state |psi(t)> is [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T.

Sigma_z is [[1, 0],[0, -1]].

So,

<sigma_z> = [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] * sigma_z * [ cos(theta); - sin(theta) ]

Compute:

= cos(theta) * (1 * cos(theta)) + (- sin(theta)) * (-1 * (- sin(theta)) )

Wait,

= cos(theta)^2 + (- sin(theta)) * (-1) * (- sin(theta)).

Wait, no, let me do it properly.

The product would be:

= cos(theta) * [1 * cos(theta) + 0 * (- sin(theta)) ] 
+ (- sin(theta)) * [ 0 * cos(theta) + (-1) * (- sin(theta)) ]

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute each element.

Sigma_z matrix:

Row 1: [1, 0]

Row 2: [0, -1]

So,

sigma_z |psi(t)> = [ 1 * cos(theta) + 0 * (- sin(theta)), 
                    0 * cos(theta) + (-1) * (- sin(theta)) ]^T

= [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T.

Then, <sigma_z> is the inner product of |psi(t)> with sigma_z |psi(t)>.

But wait, no, because <sigma_z> is |psi(t)>^dagger sigma_z |psi(t)>.

Wait, |psi(t)> is a column vector, so the dagger is the conjugate transpose. Since all terms are real here, it's just the transpose.

So,

<sigma_z> = [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] * sigma_z * [ cos(theta); - sin(theta) ]

= [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] * [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T.

Wait, sigma_z * |psi(t)> is [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T.

No, wait, sigma_z * |psi(t)> is:

sigma_z * [ cos(theta); - sin(theta) ]

= [ 1 * cos(theta) + 0*(- sin(theta) ), 
    0 * cos(theta) + (-1) * (- sin(theta)) ] 

= [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T.

Then, the inner product is [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] * [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T.

= cos(theta)^2 + (- sin(theta)) * sin(theta)
= cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta)
= cos(2 theta )

So, <sigma_z> = cos(2 theta )

Thus, <S_z> = (ħ/2) * <sigma_z> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

But theta is (gamma B t ) / 2.

So,

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, wait, no:

Wait, theta = gamma B t / 2.

So 2 theta = gamma B t.

So,

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but wait, the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, divided by 2 pi, perhaps? Or wait, the angular frequency is the coefficient.

So, the oscillation is at frequency omega = gamma B.

But wait, let's think: the average <S_z> oscillates as cos(omega t). The frequency of this oscillation is omega/(2 pi) if we're talking about cycles per second, but the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the coefficient of t. So the angular frequency is omega = gamma B.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is gamma B. Option A is gamma B/2.

Wait, but earlier I have <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t ).

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Because when I compute theta, it's gamma B t / 2.

So 2 theta = gamma B t.

So cos(2 theta) is cos( gamma B t )

Wait, I think that's correct.

So <S_z> oscillates as cos( gamma B t ), so the angular frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but the options have option B as gamma B, which would be the angular frequency.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me recheck the steps.

1. H_final is -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H_final = - (gamma B ħ/2 ) sigma_y.

2. The time evolution operator is U = exp( -i H_final t / ħ )

So,

U = exp( i (gamma B sigma_y t ) / 2 )

3. The matrix U is found using the identity for exponential of Pauli matrices, leading to U = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta), with theta = gamma B t / 2.

4. The state |psi(t)> is U |+z>, which gives [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T.

5. Compute <sigma_z> as the inner product of |psi(t)> with sigma_z |psi(t)>, which ended up being cos(2 theta).

6. Thus, <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( 2 theta ), and since theta is (gamma B t)/2, 2 theta is gamma B t.

So,

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Hmmm, but wait, wait a second. Spin is in units of ħ/2. So S_z can be ± ħ/2.

Wait, but when we compute <S_z>, we have (ħ/2) times the expectation value of sigma_z, which is cos(2 theta). So the maximum of <S_z> is (ħ/2)(1) = ħ/2, which makes sense. The minimum is -(ħ/2)(1) = - ħ/2. So the oscillation is between these two extremes.

But the question is about the frequency of oscillation. The function cos( gamma B t ) has an argument gamma B t, so the angular frequency is omega = gamma B.

So the oscillation occurs at frequency omega = gamma B. So the average of S_z oscillates with frequency gamma B.

Looking at the options:

Option B is gamma B.

But wait, I thought perhaps because the oscillation period is related to the energy difference between the states. Let me think about the energy levels.

The energy levels under H_final are E_+ = gamma B ħ/2 and E_- = - gamma B ħ/2. So the energy difference between the two states is 2 gamma B ħ/2 = gamma B ħ.

The frequency of oscillation in energy is determined by the energy difference. The energy oscillation frequency is (E_+ - E_-)/(hbar) = (gamma B ħ) ) / ħ = gamma B.

But wait, the time dependence comes from the exponential phase factors from each energy eigenstate. When you have a state that's a superposition of |E_+> and |E_->, the time dependence will involve terms like exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) and exp( -i E_- t / ħ ). The difference in phases leads to oscillations at (E_+ - E_-)/ ħ = (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So the correct answer should be option B: gamma B.

Wait, but one of the options is gamma B/sqrt(2), which is option D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of <S_z>.

Let me go back. When I calculated <sigma_z>, I found it to be cos(2 theta). So <S_z> is (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t ). So the oscillation is at frequency gamma B.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the oscillation in the expectation value is the difference between the energies divided by ħ, but I thought that's what I had.

Wait, let me think about another approach. The oscillation frequency of <S_z> can be determined by the energy splitting induced by the Hamiltonian.

The Hamiltonian after the field change is H_final = gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y, but wait, no, earlier calculation showed H_final is -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y. But the energy eigenvalues are E = ± gamma B ħ/2.

So the energy levels are E_+ = + gamma B ħ/2 and E_- = - gamma B ħ/2.

So the energy difference is Delta_E = E_+ - E_- = gamma B ħ.

The frequency omega is Delta_E / ħ = gamma B.

So yes, omega is gamma B, so the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So the correct answer is option B.

But wait, wait. Another thought: the initial state is an eigenstate of sigma_z, and the new Hamiltonian is sigma_y. So the state will precess around the Y-axis.

In such a case, the expectation value of sigma_z (and hence S_z) will oscillate sinusoidally with frequency equal to the Rabi frequency. The Rabi frequency is proportional to the energy splitting, which is gamma B.

So yes, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So the correct answer is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then turned off, and a new magnetic field of the same magnitude $B$ is applied along the $+y$ direction. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's moment, $\langle S_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in an eigenstate of $S_z$ (either $|+z\rangle$ or $|-z\rangle$) due to the initial magnetic field along $z$.

2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes:
   \[
   H_{\text{final}} = -\gamma B S_y = -\gamma B \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
   \]
   where $\sigma_y$ is the Pauli matrix for $y$-spin.

3. **Time Evolution**: The time evolution operator is:
   \[
   U(t) = \exp\left(-\frac{i H_{\text{final}} t}{\hbar}\right) = \exp\left(i \frac{\gamma B t}{2} \sigma_y\right).
   \]
   Using the identity for the exponential of a Pauli matrix, this becomes:
   \[
   U(t) = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)I + i\sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)\sigma_y.
   \]

4. **State at Time $t$**: The initial state $|+z\rangle$ evolves under $U(t)$ to:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = U(t)|+z\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|+z\rangle - \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|-z\rangle.
   \]

5. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**: The expectation value of $S_z$ is:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi(t) | \sigma_z | \psi(t) \rangle.
   \]
   Substituting $|\psi(t)\rangle$ and computing the inner product, it is found that:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

6. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation of $\langle S_z \rangle$ is governed by the cosine term, which oscillates with angular frequency $\omega = \gamma B$. This matches the energy splitting induced by the new Hamiltonian, as the energy levels of $H_{\text{final}}$ are $\pm \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}$, leading to a frequency difference of $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's moment is $\gamma B$.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, let's try to think this through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the setup: there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu. The magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S_z. Oh wait, S_z is the spin component in the z-direction, right? So mu is proportional to the spin in the z-direction.

The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. So the particle's moment is aligned with the field. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. 

Wait, when the magnetic field is turned off, does that mean the particle is no longer in an external magnetic field? But then another field is applied along Y. Oh, right, so the particle is subjected to a magnetic field along Y now, after the initial B field along Z is turned off. 

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So the average <S_z> starts oscillating, and we need to find the frequency of that oscillation.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when a spin-1/2 particle is placed in a magnetic field, it has energy levels determined by the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B, right? Because the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field.

In the initial state, the field is along Z. So the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -γ S_z B. The energy levels here are E = ± (γ B / 2 ), since S_z can be ± ħ/2 for spin-1/2. Oh wait, wait. Spin matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H_initial would have eigenvalues ± (γ B (ħ/2 )) / ħ? Wait, maybe I should write mu as gamma times S_z, but in terms of units. 

Wait, maybe mu is given as mu = gamma * S_z. But S_z is in units of ħ/2. So mu would then be (gamma) * (ħ/2) * sigma_z, where sigma_z is the Pauli matrix. But perhaps I can think in terms of the Hamiltonian.

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the energy is H = - mu · B. So for B along Z, H = -gamma B S_z.

But S_z is ħ/2 * sigma_z. So H = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_z / 2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the factors. Let me think: S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energy eigenvalues would be E = -gamma B * (± ħ/2 ). So E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ). Wait, but sometimes the Hamiltonian is written as H = gamma B S_z, depending on the sign conventions. Hmm, maybe I should double-check the form.

Alternatively, I remember that the Zeeman Hamiltonian is H = - γ B S · n, where n is the direction of the field. So for B along Z, n is (0,0,1), so H = -γ B S_z. And since S_z in terms of Pauli matrices is (ħ/2) sigma_z, so H = - (gamma B) (ħ/2) sigma_z.

But wait, in any case, the point is that the initial state is an eigenstate of H_initial because the field is along Z. So the spin is aligned along Z. So the initial state is either |+z> or |-z>, I suppose.

But then the field is turned off, so the particle is in a state where there's no magnetic field for a moment. But then another field is turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -gamma B' S_y, where B' is the new magnetic field. Wait, but the magnitude is same, B. So B' = B. So H_final = - gamma B S_y.

Wait, no. The magnetic field is along Y, so the magnetic moment would interact with that. So H_final = -mu · B, and mu is gamma S. So H_final = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but wait: S is in units of ħ/2, right? So perhaps I should write S_y in terms of Pauli matrices. Because S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So H_final would be H = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

Wait, but the spin operators are S_x, S_y, S_z, each of which is (ħ/2) sigma_x, etc. So yeah, sigma matrices are the Pauli matrices.

So the Hamiltonian becomes H = (something) * sigma_y. Now, since the initial state was an eigenstate of H_initial = gamma B S_z, which in terms of sigma_z is proportional to sigma_z. So the initial state is either |+z> or |-z>, which are eigenstates of sigma_z.

But wait, when the field is turned off, the system is no longer in a magnetic field, so the Hamiltonian is zero, right? Or is it that the field is turned off and then the new field is applied? So the initial state is an eigenstate of H_initial, and then the Hamiltonian abruptly changes to H_final. So there's a sudden change in the Hamiltonian.

So the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously, but the Hamiltonian does. So the initial state is an eigenstate of H_initial, and now the system evolves under H_final.

So after the field change, the system is in a state |psi> which is an eigenstate of H_initial. Now, H_final is different.

To find the time evolution, we can write the state as |psi(t)> = exp(-i H_final t / ħ) |psi(0)>.

But the expectation value of S_z (or something else) would oscillate in time if H_final has components that cause transitions between different states.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the energy levels of H_final. H_final is proportional to sigma_y.

The energy eigenstates of H_final are the eigenstates of sigma_y. The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1, so the energies are E_+ = something and E_- = something else.

Wait, H_final = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y. So the eigenvalues are E = + (gamma B ħ/2 ) and E = - (gamma B ħ/2 ), right? Because sigma_y has eigenvalues ±1, so H_final has eigenvalues ± (-gamma B (ħ/2 )) ?

Wait, no. Let me compute it properly. H_final = - gamma B (ħ/2) * sigma_y. The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1, so the eigenvalues of H_final are E = ± [ - gamma B (ħ/2) * 1 ].

Wait, but that would be E = ± (-gamma B ħ/2 ). Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I made a sign mistake.

Wait, H_final is - gamma B S_y. Hmm, S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H_final = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So the eigenvalues of H_final are E = - gamma B (ħ/2 ) * (±1 ), right? Because sigma_y has eigenvalues ±1.

So E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2 ) * (+1) = - gamma B ħ/2.

E_- = - gamma B (ħ/2 ) * (-1) = + gamma B ħ/2.

Wait, that seems correct. So the energy levels are E_+ = - (gamma B ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B ħ/2.

Wait, but let's just think about the time evolution. The initial state is |+z> or |-z>, which are eigenstates of sigma_z, not sigma_y. So after the Hamiltonian changes, the state is still |+z>.

But under H_final, the state will evolve in time.

So the time evolution is given by |psi(t)> = exp( -i H_final t / ħ ) |+z>.

But H_final is proportional to sigma_y, so let's write H_final = (ħ/2) * ( - gamma B sigma_y ). So,

H_final = - (gamma B ħ/2 ) sigma_y.

So the time evolution operator is U = exp( -i H_final t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B sigma_y t ) / (2) ) ).

Because:

H_final t / ħ = [ - (gamma B ħ/2 ) sigma_y ] t / ħ = - (gamma B sigma_y t ) ( ħ t ) / (2 ħ ) ) = - (gamma B sigma_y t ) / 2.

So U becomes exp( i (gamma B sigma_y t )/(2) ).

Hmm, but to compute this exponential, perhaps I can use the identity that for any Pauli matrix sigma,

exp( i theta sigma ) = I cos(theta) + i sigma sin(theta).

So here, theta is (gamma B t ) / 2.

Wait, wait:

Wait, the exponent is (i gamma B sigma_y t ) / 2.

So let me write that as (i sigma_y theta ), where theta = gamma B t / 2.

Then, using the identity,

exp( i sigma_y theta ) = I cos(theta) + i sigma_y sin(theta).

So the time evolution operator U is [ cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta) ], where theta = (gamma B t )/2.

So U = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta).

Now, the initial state is |+z> which is the eigenstate of sigma_z, with eigenvalue +1.

Expressed in the basis of sigma_z, |+z> is (1, 0)^T, and |-z> is (0, 1)^T.

So let me compute U |+z>.

U = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta).

I is [[1,0],[0,1]], sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]].

So,

U = [[cos(theta), i sin(theta) ], [ -i sin(theta), cos(theta) ] ].

Wait, let me compute each component.

The matrix would be:

First row: cos(theta) + 0, i sin(theta) * (-i) ?

Wait, wait, let's compute the sigma_y term: i sigma_y sin(theta) = i * [[0, -i],[i, 0]] * sin(theta).

Which is:

[[0, -i^2], [i^2, 0]] sin(theta) = [[0, -(-1)], [-1, 0]] sin(theta) = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]] sin(theta).

So U = cos(theta) I + [[0,1],[-1,0]] sin(theta).

Which gives:

U = [[ cos(theta) + 0, 0 + sin(theta) ],
      [ 0 - sin(theta), cos(theta) + 0 ] ]

Wait, no. Let me recast it:

U = cos(theta) I + [[0, 1], [-1, 0]] sin(theta).

So,

U = [ [ cos(theta), 0 ],
       [ 0, cos(theta) ] ] + [ [ 0, sin(theta) ],
                                [ - sin(theta), 0 ] ]

Adding these together:

U = [ [ cos(theta) , sin(theta) ],
       [ - sin(theta), cos(theta) ] ].

Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me recalculate:

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the matrix multiplication.

Wait, U is the sum of I cos(theta) and sigma_y multiplied by i sin(theta). Oh wait no, no, because the Hamiltonian is H_final = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's take it step by step.

Wait, the time evolution operator is U = exp( -i H_final t / ħ )

H_final = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So, H_final t / ħ = (- gamma B sigma_y t ) / (2).

So,

U = exp( i (gamma B sigma_y t ) / 2 )

So, U = exp( i (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y )

So, substituting theta = gamma B t / 2,

U = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta).

So, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So, U becomes:

cos(theta) * [[1, 0],[0,1]] + i * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * sin(theta)

Compute each term:

First term (cos(theta) I):

[[ cos(theta), 0 ],
 [ 0, cos(theta) ] ]

Second term (i sigma_y sin(theta)):

i * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * sin(theta) = 

[[ 0, -i^2 sin(theta) ],
 [ i^2 sin(theta), 0 ] ]

Since i^2 = -1:

= [[0, sin(theta) ],
   [ - sin(theta), 0 ] ]

So the second term is [[0, sin(theta)], [ - sin(theta), 0 ] ]

So adding to the first term:

U = [ [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ],
       [ - sin(theta), cos(theta) ] ]

Wait, that makes sense, as it's a rotation matrix. Because for spin systems, a rotation around an axis can be represented by such matrices.

So, the state at time t is U |+z> = U * [1; 0].

So,

|psi(t)> = U * [1; 0] = [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T.

So,

psi_x = cos(theta)
psi_y = sin(theta)

Wait, no, wait: the state is a column vector.

Wait, U is 2x2 matrix, and |+z> is [1; 0].

So,

psi(t) = U [1; 0] = [ cos(theta) * 1 + sin(theta)*0,  - sin(theta)*1 + cos(theta)*0 ]^T ? Wait no, U is:

[ [ a, b ],
  [ c, d ] ]

So,

psi(t) = [ a*1 + b*0,
           c*1 + d *0 ]

Which is [ a, c ]^T.

Wait, in our case,

U = [[ cos(theta), sin(theta) ],
     [ - sin(theta), cos(theta) ] ]

So,

psi(t) = [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T.

So the state is |psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) | -z>.

Wait, because |+z> is [1;0], and |-z> is [0;1]. So,

psi(t) = cos(theta) |+z> + (- sin(theta)) |-z>.

So the state is a superposition of |+z> and |-z>.

Now, the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, <S_z>.

Wait, S_z is (ħ/2) sigma_z. So the expectation value <S_z> is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of sigma_z in the state |psi(t)>.

Sigma_z is diagonal, so <sigma_z> = <psi(t)| sigma_z | psi(t) >.

The state |psi(t)> is [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T.

Sigma_z is [[1, 0],[0, -1]].

So,

<sigma_z> = [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] * sigma_z * [ cos(theta); - sin(theta) ]

Compute:

= cos(theta) * (1 * cos(theta)) + (- sin(theta)) * (-1 * (- sin(theta)) )

Wait,

= cos(theta)^2 + (- sin(theta)) * (-1) * (- sin(theta)).

Wait, no, let me do it properly.

The product would be:

= cos(theta) * [1 * cos(theta) + 0 * (- sin(theta)) ] 
+ (- sin(theta)) * [ 0 * cos(theta) + (-1) * (- sin(theta)) ]

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute each element.

Sigma_z matrix:

Row 1: [1, 0]

Row 2: [0, -1]

So,

sigma_z |psi(t)> = [ 1 * cos(theta) + 0 * (- sin(theta)), 
                    0 * cos(theta) + (-1) * (- sin(theta)) ]^T

= [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T.

Then, <sigma_z> is the inner product of |psi(t)> with sigma_z |psi(t)>.

But wait, no, because <sigma_z> is |psi(t)>^dagger sigma_z |psi(t)>.

Wait, |psi(t)> is a column vector, so the dagger is the conjugate transpose. Since all terms are real here, it's just the transpose.

So,

<sigma_z> = [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] * sigma_z * [ cos(theta); - sin(theta) ]

= [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] * [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T.

Wait, sigma_z * |psi(t)> is [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T.

No, wait, sigma_z * |psi(t)> is:

sigma_z * [ cos(theta); - sin(theta) ]

= [ 1 * cos(theta) + 0*(- sin(theta) ), 
    0 * cos(theta) + (-1) * (- sin(theta)) ] 

= [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T.

Then, the inner product is [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] * [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T.

= cos(theta)^2 + (- sin(theta)) * sin(theta)
= cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta)
= cos(2 theta )

So, <sigma_z> = cos(2 theta )

Thus, <S_z> = (ħ/2) * <sigma_z> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

But theta is (gamma B t ) / 2.

So,

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, wait, no:

Wait, theta = gamma B t / 2.

So 2 theta = gamma B t.

So,

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but wait, the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, divided by 2 pi, perhaps? Or wait, the angular frequency is the coefficient.

So, the oscillation is at frequency omega = gamma B.

But wait, let's think: the average <S_z> oscillates as cos(omega t). The frequency of this oscillation is omega/(2 pi) if we're talking about cycles per second, but the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the coefficient of t. So the angular frequency is omega = gamma B.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is gamma B. Option A is gamma B/2.

Wait, but earlier I have <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t ).

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Because when I compute theta, it's gamma B t / 2.

So 2 theta = gamma B t.

So cos(2 theta) is cos( gamma B t )

Wait, I think that's correct.

So <S_z> oscillates as cos( gamma B t ), so the angular frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but the options have option B as gamma B, which would be the angular frequency.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me recheck the steps.

1. H_final is -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H_final = - (gamma B ħ/2 ) sigma_y.

2. The time evolution operator is U = exp( -i H_final t / ħ )

So,

U = exp( i (gamma B sigma_y t ) / 2 )

3. The matrix U is found using the identity for exponential of Pauli matrices, leading to U = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta), with theta = gamma B t / 2.

4. The state |psi(t)> is U |+z>, which gives [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T.

5. Compute <sigma_z> as the inner product of |psi(t)> with sigma_z |psi(t)>, which ended up being cos(2 theta).

6. Thus, <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( 2 theta ), and since theta is (gamma B t)/2, 2 theta is gamma B t.

So,

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Hmmm, but wait, wait a second. Spin is in units of ħ/2. So S_z can be ± ħ/2.

Wait, but when we compute <S_z>, we have (ħ/2) times the expectation value of sigma_z, which is cos(2 theta). So the maximum of <S_z> is (ħ/2)(1) = ħ/2, which makes sense. The minimum is -(ħ/2)(1) = - ħ/2. So the oscillation is between these two extremes.

But the question is about the frequency of oscillation. The function cos( gamma B t ) has an argument gamma B t, so the angular frequency is omega = gamma B.

So the oscillation occurs at frequency omega = gamma B. So the average of S_z oscillates with frequency gamma B.

Looking at the options:

Option B is gamma B.

But wait, I thought perhaps because the oscillation period is related to the energy difference between the states. Let me think about the energy levels.

The energy levels under H_final are E_+ = gamma B ħ/2 and E_- = - gamma B ħ/2. So the energy difference between the two states is 2 gamma B ħ/2 = gamma B ħ.

The frequency of oscillation in energy is determined by the energy difference. The energy oscillation frequency is (E_+ - E_-)/(hbar) = (gamma B ħ) ) / ħ = gamma B.

But wait, the time dependence comes from the exponential phase factors from each energy eigenstate. When you have a state that's a superposition of |E_+> and |E_->, the time dependence will involve terms like exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) and exp( -i E_- t / ħ ). The difference in phases leads to oscillations at (E_+ - E_-)/ ħ = (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So the correct answer should be option B: gamma B.

Wait, but one of the options is gamma B/sqrt(2), which is option D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of <S_z>.

Let me go back. When I calculated <sigma_z>, I found it to be cos(2 theta). So <S_z> is (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t ). So the oscillation is at frequency gamma B.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the oscillation in the expectation value is the difference between the energies divided by ħ, but I thought that's what I had.

Wait, let me think about another approach. The oscillation frequency of <S_z> can be determined by the energy splitting induced by the Hamiltonian.

The Hamiltonian after the field change is H_final = gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y, but wait, no, earlier calculation showed H_final is -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y. But the energy eigenvalues are E = ± gamma B ħ/2.

So the energy levels are E_+ = + gamma B ħ/2 and E_- = - gamma B ħ/2.

So the energy difference is Delta_E = E_+ - E_- = gamma B ħ.

The frequency omega is Delta_E / ħ = gamma B.

So yes, omega is gamma B, so the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So the correct answer is option B.

But wait, wait. Another thought: the initial state is an eigenstate of sigma_z, and the new Hamiltonian is sigma_y. So the state will precess around the Y-axis.

In such a case, the expectation value of sigma_z (and hence S_z) will oscillate sinusoidally with frequency equal to the Rabi frequency. The Rabi frequency is proportional to the energy splitting, which is gamma B.

So yes, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So the correct answer is B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then turned off, and a new magnetic field of the same magnitude $B$ is applied along the $+y$ direction. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's moment, $\langle S_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in an eigenstate of $S_z$ (either $|+z\rangle$ or $|-z\rangle$) due to the initial magnetic field along $z$.

2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes:
   \[
   H_{\text{final}} = -\gamma B S_y = -\gamma B \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
   \]
   where $\sigma_y$ is the Pauli matrix for $y$-spin.

3. **Time Evolution**: The time evolution operator is:
   \[
   U(t) = \exp\left(-\frac{i H_{\text{final}} t}{\hbar}\right) = \exp\left(i \frac{\gamma B t}{2} \sigma_y\right).
   \]
   Using the identity for the exponential of a Pauli matrix, this becomes:
   \[
   U(t) = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)I + i\sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)\sigma_y.
   \]

4. **State at Time $t$**: The initial state $|+z\rangle$ evolves under $U(t)$ to:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = U(t)|+z\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|+z\rangle - \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|-z\rangle.
   \]

5. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**: The expectation value of $S_z$ is:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi(t) | \sigma_z | \psi(t) \rangle.
   \]
   Substituting $|\psi(t)\rangle$ and computing the inner product, it is found that:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

6. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation of $\langle S_z \rangle$ is governed by the cosine term, which oscillates with angular frequency $\omega = \gamma B$. This matches the energy splitting induced by the new Hamiltonian, as the energy levels of $H_{\text{final}}$ are $\pm \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}$, leading to a frequency difference of $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's moment is $\gamma B$.

**Answer: B**
