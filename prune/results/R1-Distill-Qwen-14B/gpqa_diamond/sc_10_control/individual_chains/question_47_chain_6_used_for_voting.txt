Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. The formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm.

Alright, starting with the IR data. The strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually from N-H stretches, right? So maybe there's an amine or amide group here. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or an ester or amide.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. That would have an amide group, so the carbonyl would be around 1650-1700. But wait, IR also shows those N-H stretches, which amides have. But the ethoxy group would show in NMR as a triplet around 1.2 ppm for CH2CH3, and the OCH2CH3 would be at like around 4 ppm as a quartet or something.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Here, the formamide has a carbonyl and an N-H. So IR would show the N-H (stretching around 3300 maybe) and the amide I band around 1650 maybe? But the given IR has 1720, which is higher than typical amides. Hmm, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Wait, formamide usually has a lower carbonyl stretch.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is an ester, so the carbonyl should be around 1740-1720. The NMR would show the amine as NH2, but in 1H NMR, amines are usually broad. Wait, but the IR shows N-H, so a primary amine or amide. Also, the propionate would have an ethyl group attached as ester. So the NMR would show triplet for the CH2CH3, and quartet for the OCH2. Wait, but the 1H NMR data shows a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) which is typical for a CH2CH3 group. Then a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which might be OCH2. And a broad signal at 4.0 ppm for maybe something else.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That's an ester. So the carbonyl would be around 1720, which matches the IR. The amine would be a primary amine (NH2), which would show N-H stretches in IR. But wait, primary amines have two N-H stretches, which could be why there are two bands in IR (3420 and 3325). The ethyl group as the ester would show triplet for CH2CH3 at around 1.2 ppm, and quartet for OCH2CH3 at around 4.1 maybe. Also, the benzoate ester would have aromatic protons.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (3H): likely a CH2CH3 group, so an ethyl group somewhere. Since it's a triplet, it's probably attached to an oxygen (like OCH2CH3), so an ester or ether.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H): could be an NH2 group? But NH2 in NMR usually is broad, but in some cases, it might exchange and not show up. Wait, in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Hmm, that's interesting. Alternatively, it could be a group like OCH2, but that's usually a quartet. Wait, perhaps it's an OCH2 connected to something else. Or maybe it's an amide's NH, but amides typically have one NH, but in this case, it's two H. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count: benzene rings, substituents.

Wait, the NMR shows at 4.5 ppm, quartet (2H). Quartet suggests it's next to another CH2, so perhaps an OCH2CH2 group? Or OCH2 connected to something else. Like in an ester group. For example, in ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would be a quartet at around 4.1 ppm, but here it's at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe adjacent to an electronegative group.

The aromatic protons at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted benzene. Because in para substitution, the protons are split into two doublets. So the substituents are on the para positions.

Putting this together: the compound is an ester attached to a para-substituted benzene ring, with an amino group.

Looking at the options, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Its structure would be OEt-COO-PhNH2. Wait, no, more precisely, the structure is benzene ring with NH2 and COOEt groups in para positions. So the ring has -NH2 and -COOEt in para.

So the ester group is OEt (CH2CH3O), and the carbonyl would be at 1720, which matches the IR.

In NMR: the ethyl group would be triplet at 1.2 ppm (3H). The OCH2CH3 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.2 ppm. But in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm. Wait, maybe the substituents are affecting the chemical shift. Alternatively, maybe it's a different group.

Wait, another possibility is that the NMR shows the ethyl ester's OCH2CH3 as a quartet. Let's see: the OCH2 would split into a quartet because the adjacent CH3 has three protons. So the quartet would be around 4.1 ppm, but in the data it's at 4.5. Hmm, that's a bit higher, but maybe due to conjugation or other effects. Alternatively, perhaps it's not the OCH2CH3, but another group.

Wait, looking at the NMR data again: 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet for 2H. Maybe it's an NH group? But for a primary amine, like NH2, which would be split into a singlet, but in the NMR, it's a broad signal. Alternatively, perhaps it's an amide group, but then the NH would be a singlet or maybe a triplet. Hmm. Wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative group, like O or N. For example, if it's -OCH2- where the CH2 is next to an oxygen but not split by adjacent protons. Or perhaps it's an N-CH2-O group.

Alternatively, perhaps this is an amino group, but in a different environment. Wait, but the IR has strong N-H stretches, so that suggests either an amine (like NH2) or amide (NH). NH2 would have two N-H stretches. So perhaps this is a secondary amine, but looking at the options, only option D has a primary amine.

Wait, let me think about each option's structure and NMR.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene ring with NH2 and COOEt groups on para positions.

The ester group would have:

- The ethyl group: triplet at 1.2 ppm (3H).

- The OCH2CH3: quartet (each CH2 proton) around 4.1-4.2 ppm. But in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Alternatively, maybe the OCH2 is split by something else.

Wait, maybe the quartet is for other groups. Let's see:

The 1H NMR:

1.20 (t, 3H) → CH2CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): what could this be? Maybe the NH2 group is deprotonated? But in 1H NMR, NH2 usually doesn't show up unless it's exchanging and under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an amino group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's an ethyl ester's OCH2CH3, but at 4.5 ppm. Or maybe it's attached to something else.

Wait, another approach: let's look at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure would be formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the formamide has a carbonyl (which would match the IR 1720) and N-H (IR 3420 and 3325). The ethoxy group would show a triplet at 1.2 (CH2CH3) and a quartet at around 4.0-4.1 (OCH2). The aromatic protons would be as substituents.

In the NMR data, we have a triplet at 1.2, quartet at 4.5, and a broad singlet at 4.0. Wait, maybe the quartet is the OCH2 from ethoxy, and the broad singlet is the NH from formamide.

Wait, formamide has a NH, which in NMR could be a broad signal. But in the NMR, there's a quartet at 4.5 and a broad singlet at 4.0. That doesn't seem to fit because the ethoxy's OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.1, but in the data, it's at 4.0 as a broad. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure would be benzene with NH2 and COOCH2CH2CH3 (since propionate is CH2CH2CH3O). Wait, propionate is CH2CH2CH3O- as the ester. So the propyl group would have triplet for CH2CH2CH3, but maybe the OCH2 would be at around 4.0-4.2. Let's see, the NMR data has a triplet at 1.2, which would be the CH2CH3 end of the propyl group. Then the OCH2 would be a quartet, maybe around 4.0 or so. But the NMR data has a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is higher. Also, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Maybe the NH2 is not showing up, but perhaps something else.

Wait, another thought: in the 1H NMR, the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) could be OCH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe like an ester. So perhaps it's the OCH2 from the ethyl ester, but that's usually lower shift. Or could it be part of an amide?

Alternatively, looking at the aromatic regions: 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). That suggests two sets of doublets, which would fit a para-substituted benzene with two substituents that each cause different shifts. For ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the substituents are NH2 and COOEt. The NH2 is a strong electron-withdrawing group, and the COOEt is also slightly electron-withdrawing. So the aromatic protons would be deshielded. The protons ortho to NH2 would be more deshielded, maybe higher ppm. Wait, but para to NH2 is the COOEt. So the aromatic protons would be in the positions ortho and para to substituents. Hmm, but in this case, the substituents are in para positions, so the ortho and meta would have H's. Wait, no, for a para-substituted benzene with two groups, the substitution would be in positions 1 and 4 (if benzene is six-membered). So the H's would be at 2,3,5,6 positions. So the H's would be meta to each substituent.

Wait, maybe I'm getting bogged down. Let's think about the options again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is OEt-COO- attached to para position of NH2 on benzene. The IR shows strong N-H (so NH2 is present), and carbonyl at 1720 (ester). The NMR would have:

- Ethyl group triplet at 1.2 (3H).

- OCH2CH3 quartet at ~4.2 (but in the data, it's at 4.5 as quartet). Hmm, maybe the OCH2 is at 4.5.

Wait, maybe the OCH2 is coupled with something else, making it a quartet. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.5 is the OCH2, and the 4.0 is another group.

Wait, in option D, the ethyl ester (OCH2CH3) would have the quartet at around 4.2. But the data shows a quartet at 4.5. Hmm, that's a bit off. Unless there's another group causing the shift.

Wait, maybe the quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2 from something else, like an amide? Or perhaps it's part of another structure.

Alternatively, looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide would have the structure HCONH- attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. The formamide's carbonyl would be at ~1720. The OCH2 from ethoxy would be a quartet around 4.0-4.1. So the NMR would have:

- triplet at 1.2 (CH2CH3).

- quartet at 4.1 (OCH2CH3).

- The HCONH would have the NH as a broad peak, perhaps around 4.0. But in the NMR data, there's a quartet at 4.5 and a broad singlet at 4.0. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 is the NH as a broad singlet, and the quartet at 4.5 is something else. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, considering the H NMR data:

At 4.5 ppm, quartet (2H). That's a good sign for an OCH2 group. So perhaps that's the OCH2 of an ethyl ester. Then the quartet would integrate to 2H, so OCH2.

The 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H). Maybe that's an NH2 group. But in the case of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 would be on the benzene ring, and in the NMR, it might not appear because it's exchanging or because it's a broad peak. Alternatively, the 4.0 ppm could be something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH from an amide. So maybe in the case of an amide, like option A. Let's think about option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3. So IR would show the amide's N-H (3420 and 3325, which matches), and the carbonyl at around 1650, but the given IR is 1720, which is higher, more like an ester or a ketone. Hmm, but amides usually have lower wavenumber for carbonyl. So that might not fit.

So going back, perhaps option D is the best fit. Let's think about the NMR again:

The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the CH2CH3 group, which is part of the ethyl ester. Then the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the OCH2CH3, which would be a quartet from coupling with the adjacent CH3. But I'm a bit confused because the typical shift for OCH2CH3 is around 4.1-4.2, but it's at 4.5 here. Maybe the substituents on the benzene ring are causing this shift to be higher. For example, if the benzoyl group is electron-withdrawing, the OCH2 would be deshielded, leading to a higher ppm.

The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2 group. However, NH2 protons usually appear as broad signals and can exchange rapidly, so they might not integrate well. But in the given data, this is a singlet, so maybe it's not NH2. Alternatively, it could be a different group.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not NH2 but something else. Let me think about the other options.

Looking at option B again: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide would have a NH group, which could appear as a singlet in the NMR. So the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2 (no, formamide is NH, not NH2). Wait, formamide is HCONH2. No, wait, formamide is HCONH2, but in the structure N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would have HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. Wait, no, that would be HCONH-Ph-OEt. So the NH would be a singlet, but in formamide, the NH is usually a broad peak.

Hmm, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH, but it's a singlet. Wait, the singlet suggests no neighboring protons. So if it's NH, it would be a singlet, but in practice, NH protons are usually broad and might not split into a singlet. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is another group. Looking at the NMR data, 7.0 and 8.0 ppm are aromatic, suggesting para substitution.

Wait, another approach: the integration. The triplet at 1.20 (3H) is from CH2CH3. The quartet at 4.5 (2H) is likely OCH2CH3. Then the 4.0 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group. But where would that come from? Maybe it's part of the carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an NCH2 group. For example, in a structure like CH2NH, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 connected to something else.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm (2H) is an NH2 group, but as a singlet. However, NH2 groups usually appear as broad singlets, but integrating to two H. So that fits. Then, in this case, the 4.0 ppm is NH2.

But in option D, the amino group is attached to the benzene ring as NH2. So in the NMR, that would be a singlet (since no adjacent H), but in reality, NH2 protons tend to exchange and might not show up or appear as a broad peak. So maybe that's why it's a broad singlet here.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the singlet is at 4.0 ppm. That's a bit higher than typical NH2, which usually appears lower, like around 1-5 ppm. But NH2 can be broader and variable.

So putting it all together:

The IR has N-H (from amine or amide) and carbonyl (ester or amide). The NMR has ethyl group, OCH2, aromatic, and NH2 or NH.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

IR: N-H (amine) and ester carbonyl (1720 cm-1).

NMR:

1.20 (t, 3H) → CH2CH3.

4.5 (q, 2H) → OCH2CH3.

4.0 (bs, 2H) → NH2 (but I'm not sure about the shift, but perhaps it's correct).

Aromatic: two doublets, which match para substitution.

So I think option D is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound C9H11NO2 is identified using the given IR and 1H NMR data.

### IR Analysis:
- **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These are strong N-H stretches, indicating the presence of an amine or amide group.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: This is a strong carbonyl stretch, consistent with an ester or amide group.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, characteristic of a CH2CH3 group, likely part of an ethyl group.
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, which could correspond to an NH2 group or another methylene group.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, typical of an OCH2 group in an ester.
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A (3-ethoxybenzamide)**: Contains an amide group, but the carbonyl stretch for an amide typically appears at a lower wavenumber (~1650 cm⁻¹), not 1720 cm⁻¹ as observed. This option is inconsistent with the IR data.
- **Option B (N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide)**: Contains a formamide group, which would have a carbonyl stretch around 1650 cm⁻¹, not 1720 cm⁻¹. Additionally, the NMR data does not support the presence of a formamide NH group.
- **Option C (4-aminophenyl propionate)**: Contains a propionate ester, but the NMR data does not show the expected triplet for the CH2 group in the propyl chain. The quartet at 4.5 ppm is more consistent with an ethyl ester.
- **Option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate)**: Contains an ethyl ester and a para-substituted benzene ring with an NH2 group. The IR data matches the ester carbonyl (1720 cm⁻¹) and the N-H stretches (3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹). The NMR data aligns well:
  - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: CH2CH3 group of the ethyl ester.
  - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: OCH2 group of the ethyl ester.
  - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: NH2 group on the benzene ring.
  - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Aromatic protons of a para-substituted benzene.

### Conclusion:
The IR and NMR data are consistent with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The compound has an ethyl ester group, a para-substituted benzene ring, and an NH2 group, all of which match the given spectral data.

Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. The formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm.

But the ethoxy group would show in NMR as a triplet around 1.2 ppm for CH2CH3, and the OCH2CH3 would be at like around 4 ppm as a quartet or something.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Here, the formamide has a carbonyl and an N-H. So IR would show the N-H (stretching around 3300 maybe) and the amide I band around 1650 maybe? But the given IR has 1720, which is higher than typical amides. Hmm, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Wait, formamide usually has a lower carbonyl stretch.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is an ester, so the carbonyl should be around 1740-1720. The NMR would show the amine as NH2, but in 1H NMR, amines are usually broad. Wait, but the IR shows N-H, so a primary amine or amide. Also, the propionate would have an ethyl group attached as ester. So the NMR would show triplet for the CH2CH3, and quartet for the OCH2. Wait, but the 1H NMR data shows a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) which is typical for a CH2CH3 group. Then a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which might be OCH2. And a broad signal at 4.0 ppm for maybe something else.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That's an ester. So the carbonyl would be around 1720, which matches the IR. The amine would be a primary amine (NH2), which would show N-H stretches in IR. But wait, primary amines have two N-H stretches, which could be why there are two bands in IR (3420 and 3325). The ethyl group as the ester would show triplet for CH2CH3 at around 1.2 ppm, and quartet for OCH2CH3 at around 4.1 maybe. Also, the benzoate ester would have aromatic protons.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (3H): likely a CH2CH3 group, so an ethyl group somewhere. Since it's a triplet, it's probably attached to an oxygen (like OCH2CH3), so an ester or ether.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H): could be an NH2 group? But NH2 in NMR usually is broad, but in some cases, it might exchange and not show up. Wait, in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Hmm, that's interesting. Alternatively, it could be a group like OCH2, but that's usually a quartet. Wait, perhaps it's an OCH2 connected to something else. Or maybe it's an amide's NH, but amides typically have one NH, but in this case, it's two H. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count: benzene rings, substituents.

Wait, the NMR shows at 4.5 ppm, quartet (2H). Quartet suggests it's next to another CH2, so perhaps an OCH2CH2 group? Or OCH2 connected to something else. Like in an ester group. For example, in ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would be a quartet at around 4.1 ppm, but here it's at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe adjacent to an electronegative group.

The aromatic protons at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted benzene. Because in para substitution, the protons are split into two doublets. So the substituents are on the para positions.

Putting this together: the compound is an ester attached to a para-substituted benzene ring, with an amino group.

Looking at the options, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Its structure would be OEt-COO-PhNH2. Wait, no, more precisely, the structure is benzene ring with NH2 and COOEt groups in para positions. So the ring has -NH2 and -COOEt in para.

So the ester group is OEt (CH2CH3O), and the carbonyl would be at 1720, which matches the IR.

In NMR: the ethyl group would be triplet at 1.2 ppm (3H). The OCH2CH3 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.2 ppm. But in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm. Wait, maybe the substituents are affecting the chemical shift. Alternatively, maybe it's a different group.

Wait, another possibility is that the NMR shows the ethyl ester's OCH2CH3 as a quartet. Let's see: the OCH2 would split into a quartet because the adjacent CH3 has three protons. So the quartet would be around 4.1 ppm, but in the data it's at 4.5. Hmm, that's a bit higher, but maybe due to conjugation or other effects. Alternatively, perhaps it's not the OCH2CH3, but another group.

Wait, looking at the NMR data again: 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet for 2H. Maybe it's an NH group? But for a primary amine, like NH2, which would be split into a singlet, but in the NMR, it's a broad signal. Alternatively, perhaps it's an amide group, but then the NH would be a singlet or maybe a triplet. Hmm. Wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative group, like O or N. For example, if it's -OCH2- where the CH2 is next to an oxygen but not split by adjacent protons. Or perhaps it's an N-CH2-O group.

Alternatively, perhaps this is an amino group, but in a different environment. Wait, but the IR has strong N-H stretches, so that suggests either an amine (like NH2) or amide (NH). NH2 would have two N-H stretches. So perhaps this is a secondary amine, but looking at the options, only option D has a primary amine.

Wait, let me think about each option's structure and NMR.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene ring with NH2 and COOEt groups on para positions.

The ester group would have:

- The ethyl group: triplet at 1.2 ppm (3H).

- The OCH2CH3: quartet (each CH2 proton) around 4.1-4.2 ppm. But in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Alternatively, maybe the OCH2 is split by something else.

Wait, maybe the quartet is for other groups. Let's see:

The 1H NMR:

1.20 (t, 3H) → CH2CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): what could this be? Maybe the NH2 group is deprotonated? But in 1H NMR, NH2 usually doesn't show up unless it's exchanging and under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an amino group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's an ethyl ester's OCH2CH3, but at 4.5 ppm. Or maybe it's attached to something else.

Wait, another approach: let's look at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure would be formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the formamide has a carbonyl (which would match the IR 1720) and N-H (IR 3420 and 3325). The ethoxy group would show a triplet at 1.2 (CH2CH3) and a quartet at around 4.0-4.1 (OCH2). The aromatic protons would be as substituents.

In the NMR data, we have a triplet at 1.2, quartet at 4.5, and a broad singlet at 4.0. Wait, maybe the quartet is the OCH2 from ethoxy, and the broad singlet is the NH from formamide.

Wait, formamide has a NH, which in NMR could be a broad signal. But in the NMR, there's a quartet at 4.5 and a broad singlet at 4.0. That doesn't seem to fit because the ethoxy's OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.1, but in the data, it's at 4.0 as a broad. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure would be benzene with NH2 and COOCH2CH2CH3 (since propionate is CH2CH2CH3O). Wait, propionate is CH2CH2CH3O- as the ester. So the propyl group would have triplet for CH2CH2CH3, but maybe the OCH2 would be at around 4.0-4.2. Let's see, the NMR data has a triplet at 1.2, which would be the CH2CH3 end of the propyl group. Then the OCH2 would be a quartet, maybe around 4.0 or so. But the NMR data has a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is higher. Also, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Maybe the NH2 is not showing up, but perhaps something else.

Wait, another thought: in the 1H NMR, the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) could be OCH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe like an ester. So perhaps it's the OCH2 from the ethyl ester, but that's usually lower shift. Or could it be part of an amide?

Alternatively, looking at the aromatic regions: 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). That suggests two sets of doublets, which would fit a para-substituted benzene with two substituents that each cause different shifts. For ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the substituents are NH2 and COOEt. The NH2 is a strong electron-withdrawing group, and the COOEt is also slightly electron-withdrawing. So the aromatic protons would be deshielded. The protons ortho to NH2 would be more deshielded, maybe higher ppm. Wait, but para to NH2 is the COOEt. So the aromatic protons would be in the positions ortho and para to substituents. Hmm, but in this case, the substituents are in para positions, so the ortho and meta would have H's. Wait, no, for a para-substituted benzene with two groups, the substitution would be in positions 1 and 4 (if benzene is six-membered). So the H's would be at 2,3,5,6 positions. So the H's would be meta to each substituent.

Wait, maybe I'm getting bogged down. Let's think about the options again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is OEt-COO- attached to para position of NH2 on benzene. The IR shows strong N-H (so NH2 is present), and carbonyl at 1720 (ester). The NMR would have:

- Ethyl group triplet at 1.2 (3H).

- OCH2CH3 quartet at ~4.2 (but in the data, it's at 4.5 as quartet). Hmm, maybe the OCH2 is at 4.5.

Wait, maybe the OCH2 is coupled with something else, making it a quartet. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.5 is the OCH2, and the 4.0 is another group.

Wait, in option D, the ethyl ester (OCH2CH3) would have the quartet at around 4.2. But the data shows a quartet at 4.5. Hmm, that's a bit off. Unless there's another group causing the shift.

Wait, maybe the quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2 from something else, like an amide? Or perhaps it's part of another structure.

Alternatively, looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide would have the structure HCONH- attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. The formamide's carbonyl would be at ~1720. The OCH2 from ethoxy would be a quartet around 4.0-4.1. So the NMR would have:

- triplet at 1.2 (CH2CH3).

- quartet at 4.1 (OCH2CH3).

- The HCONH would have the NH as a broad peak, perhaps around 4.0. But in the NMR data, there's a quartet at 4.5 and a broad singlet at 4.0. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 is the NH as a broad singlet, and the quartet at 4.5 is something else. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, considering the H NMR data:

At 4.5 ppm, quartet (2H). That's a good sign for an OCH2 group. So perhaps that's the OCH2 of an ethyl ester. Then the quartet would integrate to 2H, so OCH2.

The 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H). Maybe that's an NH2 group. But in the case of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 would be on the benzene ring, and in the NMR, it might not appear because it's exchanging or because it's a broad peak. Alternatively, the 4.0 ppm could be something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH from an amide. So maybe in the case of an amide, like option A. Let's think about option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3. So IR would show the amide's N-H (3420 and 3325, which matches), and the carbonyl at around 1650, but the given IR is 1720, which is higher, more like an ester or a ketone. Hmm, but amides usually have lower wavenumber for carbonyl. So that might not fit.

So going back, perhaps option D is the best fit. Let's think about the NMR again:

The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the CH2CH3 group, which is part of the ethyl ester. Then the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the OCH2CH3, which would be a quartet from coupling with the adjacent CH3. But I'm a bit confused because the typical shift for OCH2CH3 is around 4.1-4.2, but it's at 4.5 here. Maybe the substituents on the benzene ring are causing this shift to be higher. For example, if the benzoyl group is electron-withdrawing, the OCH2 would be deshielded, leading to a higher ppm.

The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2 group. However, NH2 protons usually appear as broad signals and can exchange rapidly, so they might not integrate well. But in the given data, this is a singlet, so maybe it's not NH2. Alternatively, it could be a different group.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not NH2 but something else. Let me think about the other options.

Looking at option B again: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide would have a NH group, which could appear as a singlet in the NMR. So the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2 (no, formamide is NH, not NH2). Wait, formamide is HCONH2. No, wait, formamide is HCONH2, but in the structure N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would have HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. Wait, no, that would be HCONH-Ph-OEt. So the NH would be a singlet, but in formamide, the NH is usually a broad peak.

Hmm, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH, but it's a singlet. Wait, the singlet suggests no neighboring protons. So if it's NH, it would be a singlet, but in practice, NH protons are usually broad and might not split into a singlet. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is another group. Looking at the NMR data, 7.0 and 8.0 ppm are aromatic, suggesting para substitution.

Wait, another approach: the integration. The triplet at 1.20 (3H) is from CH2CH3. The quartet at 4.5 (2H) is likely OCH2CH3. Then the 4.0 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group. But where would that come from? Maybe it's part of the carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an NCH2 group. For example, in a structure like CH2NH, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 connected to something else.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm (2H) is an NH2 group, but as a singlet. However, NH2 groups usually appear as broad singlets, but integrating to two H. So that fits. Then, in this case, the 4.0 ppm is NH2.

But in option D, the amino group is attached to the benzene ring as NH2. So in the NMR, that would be a singlet (since no adjacent H), but in reality, NH2 protons tend to exchange and might not show up or appear as a broad peak. So maybe that's why it's a broad singlet here.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the singlet is at 4.0 ppm. That's a bit higher than typical NH2, which usually appears lower, like around 1-5 ppm. But NH2 can be broader and variable.

So putting it all together:

The IR has N-H (from amine or amide) and carbonyl (ester or amide). The NMR has ethyl group, OCH2, aromatic, and NH2 or NH.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

IR: N-H (amine) and ester carbonyl (1720 cm-1).

NMR:

1.20 (t, 3H) → CH2CH3.

4.5 (q, 2H) → OCH2CH3.

4.0 (bs, 2H) → NH2 (but I'm not sure about the shift, but perhaps it's correct).

Aromatic: two doublets, which match para substitution.

So I think option D is the correct answer.


The compound C9H11NO2 is identified using the given IR and 1H NMR data.

### IR Analysis:
- **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These are strong N-H stretches, indicating the presence of an amine or amide group.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: This is a strong carbonyl stretch, consistent with an ester or amide group.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, characteristic of a CH2CH3 group, likely part of an ethyl group.
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, which could correspond to an NH2 group or another methylene group.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, typical of an OCH2 group in an ester.
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A (3-ethoxybenzamide)**: Contains an amide group, but the carbonyl stretch for an amide typically appears at a lower wavenumber (~1650 cm⁻¹), not 1720 cm⁻¹ as observed. This option is inconsistent with the IR data.
- **Option B (N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide)**: Contains a formamide group, which would have a carbonyl stretch around 1650 cm⁻¹, not 1720 cm⁻¹. Additionally, the NMR data does not support the presence of a formamide NH group.
- **Option C (4-aminophenyl propionate)**: Contains a propionate ester, but the NMR data does not show the expected triplet for the CH2 group in the propyl chain. The quartet at 4.5 ppm is more consistent with an ethyl ester.
- **Option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate)**: Contains an ethyl ester and a para-substituted benzene ring with an NH2 group. The IR data matches the ester carbonyl (1720 cm⁻¹) and the N-H stretches (3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹). The NMR data aligns well:
  - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: CH2CH3 group of the ethyl ester.
  - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: OCH2 group of the ethyl ester.
  - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: NH2 group on the benzene ring.
  - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Aromatic protons of a para-substituted benzene.

### Conclusion:
The IR and NMR data are consistent with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The compound has an ethyl ester group, a para-substituted benzene ring, and an NH2 group, all of which match the given spectral data.
