Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm going to take it step by step. Okay, let's read the question again.

So, the state |alpha> is described as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The task is to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and also find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, the operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli matrices, specifically the X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 0 on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal, but here it's scaled by hbar/2. So the operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Wait, but to be precise, let's think about the matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, the elements would be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

So this operator doesn't correspond to the standard spin-z operator, which would be diagonal. Instead, it's the spin-x operator. Because the spin-x operator is (hbar/2) sigma_x, which is exactly this matrix.

So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of sigma_x, right? The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, but the problem says to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So first, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize the operator A and find the eigenvectors, then express |alpha> in that basis to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, which has eigenvalues ±1, the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)(1) and (hbar/2)(-1), i.e., ± hbar/2. But the question is about the probability of measuring each eigenstate, so the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes when the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of A.

So, first, let me normalize the state |alpha>.

The state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So the first step is to find the normalization constant.

The state |alpha> is equal to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, multiplied by some constant c. Wait, no, the problem says it's proportional to that, so |alpha> = c*(1+i)|up> + c*(2 - i)|down>.

Wait, no: Wait, the statement is that |alpha> is proportional to that sum. So |alpha> = K * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

So to find K, the normalization is 1 = |K|^2 [ |(1+i)|^2 + |(2 - i)|^2 ].

Compute |1+i|^2: 1^2 + 1^2 = 2.

Compute |2 -i|^2: 2^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the sum is 2+5=7. So |K|^2 * 7 =1 → |K|=1/sqrt(7). So K=1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next step is to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, what are the eigenstates of A? Let me think. The operator A is (hbar/2) sigma_x.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, and similarly for |−x>.

So let me denote |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So we can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to write |alpha> in the basis of |+x> and |-x>, and then find the coefficients, whose squares will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to compute the expectation value of the operator A, but wait, the question also asks for the average value.

Wait, but let's proceed step by step.

First, express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me compute the components.

Express |alpha> as:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

We can find a and b by expanding |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

So the probability of measuring the eigenvalue +hbar/2 is |< +x | alpha > |^2, and similarly for the other eigenstate.

So let's compute < +x | alpha >.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] |alpha>.

But |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Let me compute the numerator.

(1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) ) = 3 + 0i =3.

So < +x | alpha > = (3)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

The probability is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, the inner product for |-x> is < -x | alpha >.

| -x > is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < -x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Compute the numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) )= (-1) + 2i.

So < -x | alpha > = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) )= (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The probability is |(-1 + 2i)|^2 / (14) → (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, but wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.64286 and 5/14 is 0.357. But wait, 9 +5 =14, so these add up to 1, which is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, which is close to 9/14 (~0.6428) and 5/14 (~0.357). So 0.64 and 0.36 are approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inner product for |−x>.

Wait, let me compute < alpha | +x > and < alpha | -x > again.

Wait, wait, no: the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and we want to compute their inner products with |alpha>.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the coefficients of |alpha> in the |+x> and |-x> basis.

Wait, another approach: |alpha> is in the |up> and |down> basis, and we need to change to the |+x> and |-x> basis.

So,

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

We can write |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So substituting,

|alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Grouping terms:

= [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

But |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So equating coefficients:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7),
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So, two equations:

(1) a + b = (1+i) / sqrt(2/7) → sqrt(7/2) (1+i),

(2) a - b = (2 -i) / sqrt(2/7) → sqrt(7/2) (2 -i).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to solve for a and b.

From equations (1) and (2):

Adding (1) and (2):

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(7/2) → sqrt(7/2) (3) → 3 sqrt(7/2).

So a = (3 sqrt(7/2)) / 2.

Similarly, subtracting (2) from (1):

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(7/2) → sqrt(7/2) ( -1 + 2i ).

So b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(7/2) ] / 2.

Wait, that seems a bit messy. But perhaps the mod squared would be easier.

The probability for |+x> is |a|^2, and for |-x> is |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:

a = (3 sqrt(7/2)) / 2.

So |a|^2 = (9 * (7/2)) ) /4 = (63/2) /4 = 63/(8)=7.875 → wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Wait, that's a mistake. Wait, a is (3 sqrt(7/2)) / 2.

Wait, sqrt(7/2) is sqrt(3.5) ≈1.87, so 3 times that is about 5.6, divided by 2 → about 2.8. So |a|^2 would be (2.8)^2 = about 7.84, which is way over 1. That can't be correct because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Ah, perhaps I shouldn't have expressed a in terms of sqrt(7/2). Let me try a different approach.

Let me represent a and b as complex numbers and solve the system of equations.

Equation 1: a + b = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) → (1+i) * sqrt(2/7).

Equation 2: a - b = (2-i)/sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) → (2-i) * sqrt(2/7).

So,

Equation 1: a + b = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)
Equation 2: a - b = (2 -i) * sqrt(2/7)

Adding 1 and 2: 2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7) → [3] * sqrt(2/7) → a = (3/2) sqrt(2/7).

Similarly, subtracting 2 from 1: 2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7) → ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7) → b = [ (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2.

Now, compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:

a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = (3/2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)).

|a|^2 = (9 * 2) / (4 *7) ) = 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈0.64286.

Similarly, compute |b|^2.

b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2.

So |b|^2 = | (-1 +2i) |^2 * (2/7) ) /4.

| (-1 + 2i) |^2 is (1)^2 + (2)^2 =1+4=5.

So |b|^2 = (5) * (2/7) ) /4 → (10/7) /4 = 10/(28) =5/14 ≈0.35714.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which is close to these.

Now, what about the average value of the operator A?

The average value is <A> = < alpha | A | alpha >.

Since A is a Hermitian operator, this can be computed as the sum over eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities, but perhaps it's easier to compute directly.

Alternatively, perhaps express A in the computational basis (|up> and |down>) and compute the expectation value.

A is a 2x2 matrix:

A = [ [ 0, hbar/2 ], [hbar/2, 0 ] ]

So,

<A> = (1/7) [ (1+i)* (0)(1+i)* + ... wait, perhaps more carefully:

|alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, all multiplied by 1/sqrt(7).

So,

<alpha| = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 - i) <up| + (2 + i) <down| ]

So,

<A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute A|alpha>:

A|alpha> = (hbar/2) [ <up|down> (1+i) |up> + <down|up> (2 -i) |down> ]

Wait, no. Let's compute it correctly.

Wait, A is represented as:

A = [[0, hbar/2],
     [hbar/2, 0]]

So when A acts on |alpha>, it's:

A |alpha> = (hbar/2) [ <up| down> |up> (1+i) + <down| up> |down> (2 -i) ]

Wait, perhaps a better way is to write:

|alpha> = a |up> + b |down>,

so A |alpha> = (0 a + (hbar/2) b ) |up> + ( (hbar/2) a + 0 b ) |down> → (hbar/2 b) |up> + (hbar/2 a) |down>.

So,

A|alpha> = (hbar/2) [ b |up> + a |down> ]

Now, <alpha| A |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 -i) <up| + (2 +i) <down| ] multiplied by (hbar/2) [ b |up> + a |down> ].

But let's compute it step by step.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= (1/7) [ (1 -i) <up| + (2 +i) <down| ] * (hbar/2) [ (2 -i) |up> + (1+i) |down> ]

Wait, no. Wait, because A |alpha> = (hbar/2) [ (2 -i) |up> + (1 +i) |down> ]

Wait, let me correct that.

Wait, A |alpha> =

A ( a |up> + b |down> ) = (0 * a + (hbar/2) b ) |up> + ( (hbar/2) a + 0 * b ) |down>

So A |alpha> = (hbar/2) b |up> + (hbar/2) a |down>.

So,

<alpha| A |alpha> = (1/7) [ (1 - i) <up| + (2 + i) <down| ] * [ (hbar/2) b |up> + (hbar/2) a |down> ]

But |up> and |down> are orthonormal, so:

= (1/7) [ (1 -i) (hbar/2) b <up|up> + (1 -i) (hbar/2) a <up|down> + (2 +i) (hbar/2) b <down|up> + (2 +i) (hbar/2) a <down|down> ]

But <up|down> =0, <down|up>=0.

So,

= (1/7)(hbar/2) [ (1 -i) b + (2 +i) a ].

Now, a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So,

= (1/7)(hbar/2) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) / sqrt(7) + (2 +i)(1 +i)/ sqrt(7) ) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(7):

= (1/7)(hbar/2) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Factor 1/(7 * sqrt(7)) ) → 1/(7^(3/2)).

Wait, let me compute numerator:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = (1*2) + (1*(-i)) + (-i*2) + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i + i^2 → 2 -3i -1 → 1 -3i.

Similarly, (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2i +i*1 +i^2 → 2 + 3i -1 →1 + 3i.

Adding them together: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So,

= (1/7)(hbar/2) * 2 / sqrt(7) )

Simplify:

(1/7)(hbar/2) * 2 / sqrt(7) = (1/7) * (hbar/2) * 2 / sqrt(7) )

The 2's cancel: (1/7) * hbar / sqrt(7) ) = hbar/(7 sqrt(7)) ).

Wait, but 7 sqrt(7) is 7^(3/2), which can be written as sqrt(343).

But perhaps there's a better way to represent it. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the numerator came out to 2, so:

= (1/7) * (hbar/2) * [2 / sqrt(7) ]

The 2s cancel out, so it becomes (1/7) * hbar / sqrt(7) → hbar/(7 sqrt(7)).

Wait, that seems a bit small. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I computed (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i), I got 2. Let me recompute.

(1 -i)(2 -i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i + i^2 → 2 -3i -1 → 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2i +i*1 +i^2 → 2 +3i -1 →1 +3i.

So adding them: 1 -3i +1 +3i = 2.

Yes, that's correct.

So,

= (1/7) (hbar/2) * 2 / sqrt(7) ) = (1/7) * (hbar/ sqrt(7) ) ) → hbar/(7 sqrt(7)).

Wait, 7 sqrt(7) is 7* 2.6458 ≈18.52. So hbar / 18.52 is a small value.

But looking at the options, option A says average is hbar/7, which is larger than what I'm getting. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach to calculate the expectation value.

Wait, another approach: since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) times the expectation of sigma_x in state |alpha>.

The expectation of sigma_x is (alpha_x + beta_x), where |alpha> is (a|up> + b|down>), and a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Wait, no. The expectation of sigma_x is (a * <up| + b* <down| ) sigma_x (a |up> + b |down> ).

Sigma_x in the computational basis is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So,

<sigma_x> = (a* <up| + b* <down| ) [[0,1],[1,0]] (a |up> + b |down> )

= a* a <up|up> 0 + a* b* <up| down> 1 + b* a <down| up> 1 + b* b <down| down> 0.

Wait, perhaps more carefully:

Actually, the matrix multiplication would be:

sigma_x (a |up> + b |down> ) = a |down> + b |up>.

So,

<sigma_x> = (a* <up| + b* <down|) (a |down> + b |up>) )

= a* b <up| up> + a* a <up| down> + b* a <down| down> + b* b <down| up>.

But <up|down> = 0, and <down|up> =0.

So,

= a* b (1) + b* a (1) → a* b + b* a.

= 2 Re(a* b).

So,

<sigma_x> = 2 Re( a* b ).

Compute a and b:

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7),
b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

a* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7),
b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7.

Multiply numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i +i^2 → 2-3i -1 →1-3i.

So,

a* b = (1 -3i)/7,

Re(a* b) = 1/7.

So,

<sigma_x> = 2 * (1/7) = 2/7.

Thus, the expectation value of A is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

Ah, so the average value is hbar/7.

So now, the probabilities were 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7 → yes, that's matching.

So the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The first step is to normalize this state. The normalization constant \( K \) is determined by ensuring \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = 1 \). The normalization factor is found to be \( K = 1/\sqrt{7} \), so the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator corresponds to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \). The task is to compute the probabilities of measuring the particle in these eigenstates and the average value of \( A \).

### Step 1: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates
The probability of measuring the eigenvalue \( +\hbar/2 \) (associated with \( |+x\rangle \)) is given by \( |\langle +x | \alpha \rangle|^2 \), and the probability of measuring \( -\hbar/2 \) (associated with \( |-x\rangle \)) is \( |\langle -x | \alpha \rangle|^2 \).

1. Compute \( \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \):
   \[
   \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]
   The probability is:
   \[
   |\langle +x | \alpha \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643.
   \]

2. Compute \( \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \):
   \[
   \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]
   The probability is:
   \[
   |\langle -x | \alpha \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
   \]

### Step 2: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by \( \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Using the fact that \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is computed as:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \, \text{Re} \left( a^* b \right),
\]
where \( a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \). Calculating \( a^* b \):

\[
a^* b = \frac{(1-i)(2-i)}{7} = \frac{1-3i}{7}, \quad \text{Re}(a^* b) = \frac{1}{7}.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{7} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

The average value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \hbar/7 \). These results match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm going to take it step by step. Okay, let's read the question again.

So, the state |alpha> is described as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The task is to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and also find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, the operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli matrices, specifically the X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 0 on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal, but here it's scaled by hbar/2. So the operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Wait, but to be precise, let's think about the matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, the elements would be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

So this operator doesn't correspond to the standard spin-z operator, which would be diagonal. Instead, it's the spin-x operator. Because the spin-x operator is (hbar/2) sigma_x, which is exactly this matrix.

So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of sigma_x, right? The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, but the problem says to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So first, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize the operator A and find the eigenvectors, then express |alpha> in that basis to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, which has eigenvalues ±1, the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)(1) and (hbar/2)(-1), i.e., ± hbar/2. But the question is about the probability of measuring each eigenstate, so the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes when the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of A.

So, first, let me normalize the state |alpha>.

The state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So the first step is to find the normalization constant.

The state |alpha> is equal to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, multiplied by some constant c. Wait, no, the problem says it's proportional to that, so |alpha> = c*(1+i)|up> + c*(2 - i)|down>.

Wait, no: Wait, the statement is that |alpha> is proportional to that sum. So |alpha> = K * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

So to find K, the normalization is 1 = |K|^2 [ |(1+i)|^2 + |(2 - i)|^2 ].

Compute |1+i|^2: 1^2 + 1^2 = 2.

Compute |2 -i|^2: 2^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the sum is 2+5=7. So |K|^2 * 7 =1 → |K|=1/sqrt(7). So K=1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next step is to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, what are the eigenstates of A? Let me think. The operator A is (hbar/2) sigma_x.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, and similarly for |−x>.

So let me denote |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So we can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to write |alpha> in the basis of |+x> and |-x>, and then find the coefficients, whose squares will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to compute the expectation value of the operator A, but wait, the question also asks for the average value.

Wait, but let's proceed step by step.

First, express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me compute the components.

Express |alpha> as:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

We can find a and b by expanding |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

So the probability of measuring the eigenvalue +hbar/2 is |< +x | alpha > |^2, and similarly for the other eigenstate.

So let's compute < +x | alpha >.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] |alpha>.

But |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Let me compute the numerator.

(1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) ) = 3 + 0i =3.

So < +x | alpha > = (3)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

The probability is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, the inner product for |-x> is < -x | alpha >.

| -x > is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < -x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Compute the numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) )= (-1) + 2i.

So < -x | alpha > = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) )= (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The probability is |(-1 + 2i)|^2 / (14) → (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, but wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.64286 and 5/14 is 0.357. But wait, 9 +5 =14, so these add up to 1, which is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, which is close to 9/14 (~0.6428) and 5/14 (~0.357). So 0.64 and 0.36 are approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inner product for |−x>.

Wait, let me compute < alpha | +x > and < alpha | -x > again.

Wait, wait, no: the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and we want to compute their inner products with |alpha>.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the coefficients of |alpha> in the |+x> and |-x> basis.

Wait, another approach: |alpha> is in the |up> and |down> basis, and we need to change to the |+x> and |-x> basis.

So,

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

We can write |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So substituting,

|alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Grouping terms:

= [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

But |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So equating coefficients:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7),
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So, two equations:

(1) a + b = (1+i) / sqrt(2/7) → sqrt(7/2) (1+i),

(2) a - b = (2 -i) / sqrt(2/7) → sqrt(7/2) (2 -i).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to solve for a and b.

From equations (1) and (2):

Adding (1) and (2):

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(7/2) → sqrt(7/2) (3) → 3 sqrt(7/2).

So a = (3 sqrt(7/2)) / 2.

Similarly, subtracting (2) from (1):

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(7/2) → sqrt(7/2) ( -1 + 2i ).

So b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(7/2) ] / 2.

Wait, that seems a bit messy. But perhaps the mod squared would be easier.

The probability for |+x> is |a|^2, and for |-x> is |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:

a = (3 sqrt(7/2)) / 2.

So |a|^2 = (9 * (7/2)) ) /4 = (63/2) /4 = 63/(8)=7.875 → wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Wait, that's a mistake. Wait, a is (3 sqrt(7/2)) / 2.

Wait, sqrt(7/2) is sqrt(3.5) ≈1.87, so 3 times that is about 5.6, divided by 2 → about 2.8. So |a|^2 would be (2.8)^2 = about 7.84, which is way over 1. That can't be correct because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Ah, perhaps I shouldn't have expressed a in terms of sqrt(7/2). Let me try a different approach.

Let me represent a and b as complex numbers and solve the system of equations.

Equation 1: a + b = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) → (1+i) * sqrt(2/7).

Equation 2: a - b = (2-i)/sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) → (2-i) * sqrt(2/7).

So,

Equation 1: a + b = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)
Equation 2: a - b = (2 -i) * sqrt(2/7)

Adding 1 and 2: 2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7) → [3] * sqrt(2/7) → a = (3/2) sqrt(2/7).

Similarly, subtracting 2 from 1: 2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7) → ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7) → b = [ (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2.

Now, compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:

a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = (3/2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)).

|a|^2 = (9 * 2) / (4 *7) ) = 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈0.64286.

Similarly, compute |b|^2.

b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2.

So |b|^2 = | (-1 +2i) |^2 * (2/7) ) /4.

| (-1 + 2i) |^2 is (1)^2 + (2)^2 =1+4=5.

So |b|^2 = (5) * (2/7) ) /4 → (10/7) /4 = 10/(28) =5/14 ≈0.35714.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which is close to these.

Now, what about the average value of the operator A?

The average value is <A> = < alpha | A | alpha >.

Since A is a Hermitian operator, this can be computed as the sum over eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities, but perhaps it's easier to compute directly.

Alternatively, perhaps express A in the computational basis (|up> and |down>) and compute the expectation value.

A is a 2x2 matrix:

A = [ [ 0, hbar/2 ], [hbar/2, 0 ] ]

So,

<A> = (1/7) [ (1+i)* (0)(1+i)* + ... wait, perhaps more carefully:

|alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, all multiplied by 1/sqrt(7).

So,

<alpha| = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 - i) <up| + (2 + i) <down| ]

So,

<A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute A|alpha>:

A|alpha> = (hbar/2) [ <up|down> (1+i) |up> + <down|up> (2 -i) |down> ]

Wait, no. Let's compute it correctly.

Wait, A is represented as:

A = [[0, hbar/2],
     [hbar/2, 0]]

So when A acts on |alpha>, it's:

A |alpha> = (hbar/2) [ <up| down> |up> (1+i) + <down| up> |down> (2 -i) ]

Wait, perhaps a better way is to write:

|alpha> = a |up> + b |down>,

so A |alpha> = (0 a + (hbar/2) b ) |up> + ( (hbar/2) a + 0 b ) |down> → (hbar/2 b) |up> + (hbar/2 a) |down>.

So,

A|alpha> = (hbar/2) [ b |up> + a |down> ]

Now, <alpha| A |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 -i) <up| + (2 +i) <down| ] multiplied by (hbar/2) [ b |up> + a |down> ].

But let's compute it step by step.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= (1/7) [ (1 -i) <up| + (2 +i) <down| ] * (hbar/2) [ (2 -i) |up> + (1+i) |down> ]

Wait, no. Wait, because A |alpha> = (hbar/2) [ (2 -i) |up> + (1 +i) |down> ]

Wait, let me correct that.

Wait, A |alpha> =

A ( a |up> + b |down> ) = (0 * a + (hbar/2) b ) |up> + ( (hbar/2) a + 0 * b ) |down>

So A |alpha> = (hbar/2) b |up> + (hbar/2) a |down>.

So,

<alpha| A |alpha> = (1/7) [ (1 - i) <up| + (2 + i) <down| ] * [ (hbar/2) b |up> + (hbar/2) a |down> ]

But |up> and |down> are orthonormal, so:

= (1/7) [ (1 -i) (hbar/2) b <up|up> + (1 -i) (hbar/2) a <up|down> + (2 +i) (hbar/2) b <down|up> + (2 +i) (hbar/2) a <down|down> ]

But <up|down> =0, <down|up>=0.

So,

= (1/7)(hbar/2) [ (1 -i) b + (2 +i) a ].

Now, a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So,

= (1/7)(hbar/2) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) / sqrt(7) + (2 +i)(1 +i)/ sqrt(7) ) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(7):

= (1/7)(hbar/2) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Factor 1/(7 * sqrt(7)) ) → 1/(7^(3/2)).

Wait, let me compute numerator:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = (1*2) + (1*(-i)) + (-i*2) + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i + i^2 → 2 -3i -1 → 1 -3i.

Similarly, (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2i +i*1 +i^2 → 2 + 3i -1 →1 + 3i.

Adding them together: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So,

= (1/7)(hbar/2) * 2 / sqrt(7) )

Simplify:

(1/7)(hbar/2) * 2 / sqrt(7) = (1/7) * (hbar/2) * 2 / sqrt(7) )

The 2's cancel: (1/7) * hbar / sqrt(7) ) = hbar/(7 sqrt(7)) ).

Wait, but 7 sqrt(7) is 7^(3/2), which can be written as sqrt(343).

But perhaps there's a better way to represent it. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the numerator came out to 2, so:

= (1/7) * (hbar/2) * [2 / sqrt(7) ]

The 2s cancel out, so it becomes (1/7) * hbar / sqrt(7) → hbar/(7 sqrt(7)).

Wait, that seems a bit small. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I computed (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i), I got 2. Let me recompute.

(1 -i)(2 -i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i + i^2 → 2 -3i -1 → 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2i +i*1 +i^2 → 2 +3i -1 →1 +3i.

So adding them: 1 -3i +1 +3i = 2.

Yes, that's correct.

So,

= (1/7) (hbar/2) * 2 / sqrt(7) ) = (1/7) * (hbar/ sqrt(7) ) ) → hbar/(7 sqrt(7)).

Wait, 7 sqrt(7) is 7* 2.6458 ≈18.52. So hbar / 18.52 is a small value.

But looking at the options, option A says average is hbar/7, which is larger than what I'm getting. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider a different approach to calculate the expectation value.

Wait, another approach: since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) times the expectation of sigma_x in state |alpha>.

The expectation of sigma_x is (alpha_x + beta_x), where |alpha> is (a|up> + b|down>), and a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Wait, no. The expectation of sigma_x is (a * <up| + b* <down| ) sigma_x (a |up> + b |down> ).

Sigma_x in the computational basis is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So,

<sigma_x> = (a* <up| + b* <down| ) [[0,1],[1,0]] (a |up> + b |down> )

= a* a <up|up> 0 + a* b* <up| down> 1 + b* a <down| up> 1 + b* b <down| down> 0.

Wait, perhaps more carefully:

Actually, the matrix multiplication would be:

sigma_x (a |up> + b |down> ) = a |down> + b |up>.

So,

<sigma_x> = (a* <up| + b* <down|) (a |down> + b |up>) )

= a* b <up| up> + a* a <up| down> + b* a <down| down> + b* b <down| up>.

But <up|down> = 0, and <down|up> =0.

So,

= a* b (1) + b* a (1) → a* b + b* a.

= 2 Re(a* b).

So,

<sigma_x> = 2 Re( a* b ).

Compute a and b:

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7),
b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

a* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7),
b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7.

Multiply numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i +i^2 → 2-3i -1 →1-3i.

So,

a* b = (1 -3i)/7,

Re(a* b) = 1/7.

So,

<sigma_x> = 2 * (1/7) = 2/7.

Thus, the expectation value of A is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

Ah, so the average value is hbar/7.

So now, the probabilities were 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7 → yes, that's matching.

So the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The first step is to normalize this state. The normalization constant \( K \) is determined by ensuring \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = 1 \). The normalization factor is found to be \( K = 1/\sqrt{7} \), so the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator corresponds to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \). The task is to compute the probabilities of measuring the particle in these eigenstates and the average value of \( A \).

### Step 1: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates
The probability of measuring the eigenvalue \( +\hbar/2 \) (associated with \( |+x\rangle \)) is given by \( |\langle +x | \alpha \rangle|^2 \), and the probability of measuring \( -\hbar/2 \) (associated with \( |-x\rangle \)) is \( |\langle -x | \alpha \rangle|^2 \).

1. Compute \( \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \):
   \[
   \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]
   The probability is:
   \[
   |\langle +x | \alpha \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643.
   \]

2. Compute \( \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \):
   \[
   \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]
   The probability is:
   \[
   |\langle -x | \alpha \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
   \]

### Step 2: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by \( \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Using the fact that \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is computed as:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \, \text{Re} \left( a^* b \right),
\]
where \( a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \). Calculating \( a^* b \):

\[
a^* b = \frac{(1-i)(2-i)}{7} = \frac{1-3i}{7}, \quad \text{Re}(a^* b) = \frac{1}{7}.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{7} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

The average value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \hbar/7 \). These results match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
