Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is higher when the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on with our line of sight. The formula for the probability is something like (R_star + R_planet)^2 over (a_planet)^2, but wait, no, that's the area of the disk. Or maybe it's the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the star's as seen from Earth. Wait, no, I think the transit probability is actually the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (a) projected in the plane of the sky. Let me get this straight.

Wait, no, the transit probability is calculated as the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Because for a random orientation of the orbital plane, the probability that the planet's orbit crosses our line of sight is roughly (R_star / a)^2, but wait that's the area. Oh wait, I think the probability is more accurately given by the formula: P = (R_star / a) * (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3)) ) or something? No, that might be for something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The transit probability is the fraction of the planet's orbit where the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. For a circular orbit, the probability depends on the relative size of the star and the planet's orbit. So the probability is approximately (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / sin(i)), where i is the inclination of the orbit. But since the inclination is random, the average probability is (R_star / a_planet) * something else. Wait, no, I think the average (geometric) probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by something else.

Wait, no, I think the geometric probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by the square root of (some factor). Or maybe it's (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (something else). Let me think: the probability is the ratio of the area where the planet can transit to the total possible area. So the planet's orbital plane must be such that its path in front of the star. The probability is (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to simplify. The probability of a transit is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet. But wait, no, that's the condition for a transit to occur; the planet must be within that distance for a transit. But since we're considering the probability based on alignment, it's the ratio of R_star to a_planet, because the planet's orbital plane has to be such that the planet's path crosses in front of the star. So the probability is approximately (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + (M_planet / (M_star) )^(1/3))))). Or maybe it's just (R_star / a_planet) times something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's try to recall a formula. Oh right, the transit probability (P) is approximately (R_star / a_planet) * (sin i), but since the inclination i is random, the average probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by the probability that the orbit is edge-on enough. Wait, no, perhaps it's the ratio (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that factor is 1. So maybe the probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by something else. Wait, no, perhaps the transit probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (something else). Alternatively, perhaps the probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (1 / (something with the mass ratio)).

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula. But since I can't, I'll try to think.

The transit probability is given by P = (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet. But wait, that's the condition for a transit to happen. Wait, no, that's the condition for the planet to pass in front. But the probability is the chance that the orbit is aligned such that this happens. So the probability is the ratio of the star's size to the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, I think that's it. The transit probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by some factor. But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by a factor that accounts for the planet's size relative to the star, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (R_planet / R_star), which would make it (R_planet / a_planet). But that seems small.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the area. The probability is the ratio of the area where the planet can transit to the total possible area. The area where transit can occur is a circle with radius R_star, and the total possible area is a circle with radius a_planet. So the probability would be (R_star^2) / (a_planet^2), but since both planets have the same host star radius, let's see.

Wait, but according to this, the probability would be (R_star / a)^2. But wait, I think that's not correct because a is the semi-major axis, so the planet's orbit is much larger, meaning that the probability would be small.

Wait, but let me check: if the host star's radius is R, and the planet's orbit is a, then the probability is (R/a)^2. Because the planet has to be exactly in the plane, and the area where it can transit is the star's disk, so the probability is (R/a)^2.

Wait, no, that can't be right because (R/a) is a small number, so squaring it would make it even smaller. But I think that's correct. Let me see: for example, if a planet is at 1 AU and the star has a radius of 0.005 AU, then (0.005/1)^2 = 2.5e-5, which is 0.0025% chance, which sounds really low, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, but in reality, the transit probability depends on the relative sizes. So if the star is larger, the probability is higher. So in this question, the host stars have the same radius. So for Planet_1 and Planet_2, R_star is the same.

So for each planet, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet)^2.

Wait, but let's think again. The probability of a transit is given by P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3))))). Hmm, I'm not sure about that formula. Alternatively, I think I've heard that the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (something else), but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + (R_planet / R_star)^2 )) or something like that. I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is simply (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (R_planet / R_star), which simplifies to R_planet / a_planet. But that seems off because if R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it would make the probability too small.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (1 + (R_planet / R_star)), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about how the transit probability relates to the orbital distance and the star's radius. The probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The probability is given by (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by some function of the planet's size relative to the star. But since the question says both planets are Earth-like, perhaps their radii are similar to Earth's, which is much smaller than the star's radius. So, R_planet << R_star. Therefore, the transit probability would be approximately (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by a factor that's about 1.

But wait, looking at the options, the probabilities are around 1.5x, 2.25x, 1.65x, etc. So that suggests that the transit probability is either higher or lower, but in the same order of magnitude.

But wait, the question says both planets are Earth-like, so their radii are similar. So, perhaps the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet). Because if that's the case, then P ~ R_star / a_planet.

Given that, let's compute the transit probabilities.

But wait, the host stars have the same radii. So R_star for both is same. So P is inversely proportional to a_planet.

So, Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period. Let's see, the orbital period (P) is related to the semi-major axis (a) via Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star)) * a^3.

But since both planets are detected via the RV method, their minimum masses are known, and their orbital periods are given.

Wait, the problem states that both planets have the same mass. So, M_planet_1 = M_planet_2.

But the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 / 3.

We can relate a and P using Kepler's third law. The formula is P² ∝ a³ / (M_star). So, for each planet, P² = (4π² G)⁻¹ * (a^3) * (M_star + M_planet) ≈ (a^3) * (M_star) because planet mass is much smaller.

So, P² ∝ a³ / M_star.

So, for Planet_1: P1 = P2 /3.

So, (P1)^2 = (P2/3)^2 = (P2²) / 9.

Also, a1³ / M1 = (P1²) * (G M1 /4π²) → Hmm, perhaps it's better to express a1 in terms of a2.

Wait, let's write:

For Planet_1: P1² = (4π² a1³) / (G (M1 + m1)) )

Similarly, for Planet_2: P2² = (4π² a2³) / (G (M2 + m2)) )

Since m1 = m2 and M1 = 2 M2.

So,

P1² / P2² = [ (a1^3) / (M1) ) ] / [ (a2^3) / M2 ) ]

But M1 = 2 M2, so:

= [ (a1^3) / (2 M2) ) ] * [ M2 / a2^3 ) ]

= (a1^3) / (2 a2^3) )

But P1 = P2/3, so P1² = P2² / 9.

So,

( (a1^3) / (2 a2^3) ) ) = 1/9

So,

(a1^3) / (a2^3) ) = (2/9)

Taking cube root,

a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is roughly 0.6, because 0.6³ = 0.216, which is close to 0.2222.

So, a1 ≈ a2 * 0.6.

Meaning that Planet_1 is orbiting much closer to its star than Planet_2.

Since the transit probability is proportional to R_star / a_planet, and R_star is the same for both, because both host stars have the same radii.

So, P1 ∝ 1/a1 and P2 ∝ 1/a2.

So P1 / P2 = (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = a2/a1.

We found a1 = 0.6 a2 → a2/a1 = (1 / 0.6) = 5/3 ≈ 1.6667.

So, P1 is approximately 1.6667 times P2.

Wait, but wait, the transit probability is (R_star / a_planet). Since R_star is same for both, P1 is (R/a1) and P2 is (R/a2). So P1 = (R/a1) = (R / (0.6 a2 )) = (1/0.6) * (R/a2 ) = (5/3) P2.

So, P1 is 5/3 times P2, which is approximately 1.666 times higher.

So, Planet_1's transit probability is about 1.666 times higher than Planet_2's.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher. Option D says 2.7 times, which is higher than our calculation. Option A and B are about Planet_2 being better, which doesn't fit because Planet_1 has higher probability.

So the correct choice would be C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star, and \( a_{\text{planet}} \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \)), the transit probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Periods and Semi-Major Axes
The orbital period \( P \) and semi-major axis \( a \) are related by Kepler's third law:
\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_{\text{star}}}
\]
For Planet_1 and Planet_2, the host stars have masses \( M_{\text{star,1}} = 2M_{\text{star,2}} \), and the orbital periods satisfy \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \). Substituting into Kepler's law:
\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_{\text{star,1}}}{a_2^3 / M_{\text{star,2}}}
\]
\[
\frac{(P_2/3)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / (2M_{\text{star,2}})}{a_2^3 / M_{\text{star,2}}}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}
\]
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{2}{9}
\]
Taking the cube root:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6
\]
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \).

### Step 2: Transit Probability Comparison
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}} \). Since \( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \), the ratio of transit probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1}}{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]
Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.6a_2} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67
\]
Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.67 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the transit probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and its transit probability is approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2's.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The transit probability ratio is not 2.7.

### Final Answer
Planet_1 has a higher transit probability due to its shorter orbital period and closer orbit to its host star. The transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.

Wait, but in reality, the transit probability depends on the relative sizes. So if the star is larger, the probability is higher. So in this question, the host stars have the same radius. So for Planet_1 and Planet_2, R_star is the same.

Given that, let's compute the transit probabilities.

But wait, the host stars have the same radii. So R_star for both is same. So P is inversely proportional to a_planet.

So, Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period. Let's see, the orbital period (P) is related to the semi-major axis (a) via Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star)) * a^3.

But since both planets are detected via the RV method, their minimum masses are known, and their orbital periods are given.

Wait, the problem states that both planets have the same mass. So, M_planet_1 = M_planet_2.

But the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 / 3.

We can relate a and P using Kepler's third law. The formula is P² ∝ a³ / (M_star). So, for each planet, P² = (4π² G)⁻¹ * (a^3) * (M_star + M_planet) ≈ (a^3) * (M_star) because planet mass is much smaller.

So, P² ∝ a³ / M_star.

So, for Planet_1: P1 = P2 /3.

So, (P1)^2 = (P2/3)^2 = (P2²) / 9.

Also, a1³ / M1 = (P1²) * (G M1 /4π²) → Hmm, perhaps it's better to express a1 in terms of a2.

Wait, let's write:

For Planet_1: P1² = (4π² a1³) / (G (M1 + m1)) )

Similarly, for Planet_2: P2² = (4π² a2³) / (G (M2 + m2)) )

Since m1 = m2 and M1 = 2 M2.

So,

P1² / P2² = [ (a1^3) / (M1) ) ] / [ (a2^3) / M2 ) ]

But M1 = 2 M2, so:

= [ (a1^3) / (2 M2) ) ] * [ M2 / a2^3 ) ]

= (a1^3) / (2 a2^3) )

But P1 = P2/3, so P1² = P2² / 9.

So,

( (a1^3) / (2 a2^3) ) ) = 1/9

So,

(a1^3) / (a2^3) ) = (2/9)

Taking cube root,

a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is roughly 0.6, because 0.6³ = 0.216, which is close to 0.2222.

So, a1 ≈ a2 * 0.6.

Meaning that Planet_1 is orbiting much closer to its star than Planet_2.

Since the transit probability is proportional to R_star / a_planet, and R_star is the same for both, because both host stars have the same radii.

So, P1 ∝ 1/a1 and P2 ∝ 1/a2.

So P1 / P2 = (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = a2/a1.

We found a1 = 0.6 a2 → a2/a1 = (1 / 0.6) = 5/3 ≈ 1.6667.

So, P1 is approximately 1.6667 times P2.

Wait, but wait, the transit probability is (R_star / a_planet). Since R_star is same for both, P1 is (R/a1) and P2 is (R/a2). So P1 = (R/a1) = (R / (0.6 a2 )) = (1/0.6) * (R/a2 ) = (5/3) P2.

So, P1 is 5/3 times P2, which is approximately 1.666 times higher.

So, Planet_1's transit probability is about 1.666 times higher than Planet_2's.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher. Option D says 2.7 times, which is higher than our calculation. Option A and B are about Planet_2 being better, which doesn't fit because Planet_1 has higher probability.

So the correct choice would be C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star, and \( a_{\text{planet}} \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_{\text{star,1}}}{a_2^3 / M_{\text{star,2}}}
\]
\[
\frac{(P_2/3)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / (2M_{\text{star,2}})}{a_2^3 / M_{\text{star,2}}}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}
\]
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{2}{9}
\]
Taking the cube root:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6
\]
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \).

### Step 2: Transit Probability Comparison
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}} \). Since \( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \), the ratio of transit probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1}}{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]
Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.6a_2} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67
\]
Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.67 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the transit probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and its transit probability is approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2's.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The transit probability ratio is not 2.7.

### Final Answer
Planet_1 has a higher transit probability due to its shorter orbital period and closer orbit to its host star. The transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.
