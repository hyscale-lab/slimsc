Okay, so I'm faced with this physics problem about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom's transition energy. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. They want me to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the energy due to the magnetic interaction) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers, which I remember is around the Balmer series, maybe the H-alpha line. 

Wait, the options are about whether the average H (I assume that's the Hamiltonian expectation value) is much larger, much smaller, or similar to ΔE. So I need to compute or compare the two energies.

First, I need to find the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetic coupling arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton. But wait, in the case of the hydrogen atom, the orbital magnetic moment is considered here because the question mentions the orbital magnetic quantum number m. Or is it the spin? Hmm, the question says "paramagnetic coupling term," which usually refers to the interaction due to the spin magnetic moment. Oh wait, but wait, in the context of the hydrogen atom, for the ground state, the electron is in s-orbital, so its orbital angular momentum is zero. But maybe this is about the fine structure or something else.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing terms here. Let me think again. The paramagnetic term is the Zeeman effect—splitting due to an external magnetic field. The energy shift due to the magnetic field is given by the Zeeman term, ΔE_magnetic = -μ·B. So the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field is μ_B multiplied by m times B, perhaps, but I need to get the exact formula.

The Bohr magneton μ_B is equal to (eħ)/(2m_e), where e is the elementary charge, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and m_e is the electron mass. So μ_B ≈ 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T.

The paramagnetic term (Zeeman energy) for a state with magnetic quantum number m is ΔE_param = -μ_B * m * B. But wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can take values from -l to +l in integer steps. For hydrogen, in the ground state, l=0, so m=0, so the energy shift is zero. Hmm, that's confusing. So maybe the question refers to another state where m isn't zero.

Wait, the problem states "small values of m"—so maybe m is small, but not necessarily zero. So perhaps for higher l values, but with small m. Hmm, but for hydrogen, the energy levels are mainly determined by the principal quantum number n, but the fine structure also depends on l and m. But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.

Wait, the problem is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which is the energy due to the magnetic field) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition they're referring to is the one with wavelength 0.4861 micrometers, which is the Balmer-alpha line, I think. So that transition is between n=2 and n=3, but wait no, actually, Balmer series is from n>2 to n=2. 0.486 microns is the H-alpha line, which is n=3 to n=2. So the energy difference ΔE is the energy of that photon.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. So let me compute that.

h ≈ 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s
c ≈ 3.0 x 10^8 m/s
λ = 0.4861 micrometers = 0.4861 x 10^-6 meters.

So E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) ≈ 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = approx 1.9878e-25. Then divided by 0.4861e-6 is same as multiplying by 1e6/0.4861. Let me compute this:

1.9878e-25 * (1e6 / 0.4861) = 1.9878e-25 * approx 2057 ≈ 4.07e-22 J.

Wait, that's the photon energy. So ΔE is about 4e-22 J.

Now, what's the paramagnetic coupling term, the energy shift due to the magnetic field? The Zeeman effect says the energy shift is proportional to m * μ_B * B. So for each m, the shift is ΔE_param = m * μ_B * B.

But wait, the average value of the Hamiltonian in this case is the energy shift due to the magnetic field. So <H> would be m * μ_B * B. But what's m here? The problem says "small values of m"—so perhaps m is small, like m=1 or m=0. Wait, but for hydrogen, the ground state is l=0, m=0, so no shift. Maybe the problem is considering states with higher l, but small m compared to other factors.

Wait, but wait, the options are about whether <H> is much larger, much smaller, or comparable to ΔE. So I need to compute the magnitude of <H> and compare it with ΔE.

Assuming m is small, say m=1, then <H> would be μ_B * B. μ_B is about 9.27e-24 J/T, B is 1 T, so <H> ≈ 9.27e-24 J.

But wait, wait, the paramagnetic coupling term is the Zeeman term. But in the hydrogen atom, the energy levels are split by the Zeeman effect when an external magnetic field is applied. The splitting is given by ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * m * B. So for each m, the energy shift is m times that.

But for the hydrogen atom, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can be 0, ±1, ..., ±l. So, for example, for l=1 (p orbital), m can be -1, 0, +1. So the maximum energy shift would be about 9.27e-24 J * B * m. But with B=1 T, and m=1, it's about 9.27e-24 J.

Wait, but the transition energy ΔE is about 4e-22 J. So 9e-24 is about 1/40th of 4e-22. So <H> is much smaller than ΔE.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the numbers.

μ_B ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T. So for m=1, <H> = μ_B * B * m = 9.274e-24 * 1 * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.

ΔE is 4.07e-22 J. So 9e-24 is about 0.023 times 4e-22. So <H> is about 2% of ΔE, which is not much smaller, but not negligible either? Hmm, but the options are 'much greater than', 'much smaller than', etc. So 2% is not 'much smaller than', but perhaps in the problem's context, the paramagnetic term is considered small compared to ΔE.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the paramagnetic coupling term is the orbital contribution, which is smaller than the spin contribution. Oh wait, the spin g-factor is different. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the spin magnetic moment and the orbital magnetic moment.

Wait, the problem specifies the orbital magnetic quantum number m, so the paramagnetic coupling here is due to the orbital magnetic moment. The orbital magnetic moment has a g-factor of approximately 1 (g_l ≈ 1), while the spin g-factor is about 2 (g_s ≈ 2). So the magnetic moment for orbital is μ_orbital = μ_B * m. So the energy shift is ΔE = μ_B * m * B.

So using m=1, as before, so 9.27e-24 J.

ΔE is 4e-22 J. So 9.27e-24 is 0.023175 times 4e-22, so about 2% of ΔE. So <H> is much less than ΔE? Well, 2% is not 'much less', but in the context of physics problems, if the ratio is less than 10%, it's often considered much smaller. But sometimes, it's about orders of magnitude.

Wait, but 4e-22 J is about 40 times larger than 9e-24 J. So <H> is about 1/40th of ΔE. So that's a factor of about 40. So 1e1 difference. So <H> is about 10 times smaller than ΔE.

Wait, but wait, if m is 1, then for each m, the shift is about 9e-24 J, which is about 0.023 times 4e-22 J. So <H> is about 2% of ΔE, which is several orders of magnitude smaller? Wait, 4e-22 is 40 times 1e-21, and 9e-24 is 0.9 times 1e-23. So 1e-23 is 100 times smaller than 1e-21. So 4e-22 is 40e-22, and 9e-24 is 0.9e-23, so 9e-24 is 0.0225 times 4e-22, which is about 2.25% of ΔE.

Hmm, so about 2% is not that much, but perhaps in this context, since the options are 'much greater', 'much less', etc., perhaps <H> is much smaller than ΔE. So the correct option would be C) <H> << ΔE.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think another way: perhaps the transition energy ΔE is of the order of 1e-18 J (but wait, I calculated 4e-22 J). Wait, let me double-check the photon energy calculation.

Wait, the wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, so 486.1 nm. So λ = 486.1e-9 meters. So E = hc/λ. Let me compute hc: h=6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s. hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / (486.1e-9 m) = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 m. Let's compute that.

Compute denominator: 486.1e-9 m is 4.861e-7 m.

1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = (1.9878 /4.861) * 1e-18.

1.9878 / 4.861 ≈ 0.4085. So E ≈ 0.4085e-18 J = 4.085e-19 J.

Wait, I must have made a mistake earlier in the exponents. Because 1e-25 / 1e-7 is 1e-18, so 1.987e-25 / 4.86e-7 = about 4e-19 J.

Wait, that makes more sense because the Balmer-alpha transition is in the visible range, which corresponds to higher energy than near-infrared or other longer wavelengths.

So ΔE is about 4e-19 J, not 4e-22 J. So that was my earlier mistake. So I should correct that.

So going back: E_photon = 4.085e-19 J.

Now, the paramagnetic term is μ_B * B. Because for m=1, it's μ_B * 1 * B. So μ_B is about 9.27e-24 J/T, B=1 T, so that gives 9.27e-24 J.

Comparing 9.27e-24 J (paramagnetic term) to 4.085e-19 J (ΔE), the ratio is 9.27e-24 /4.085e-19 ≈ 2.27e-5. So the paramagnetic term is about 2.27e-5 times the transition energy. That's about 0.00227% of ΔE. So definitely, the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

So <H> is much less than ΔE. So the correct option is C) <H> << ΔE.

Wait, but wait, what if m is larger? The problem states that m is small. So m=1 or m=2, but for hydrogen, the higher m values are possible for higher n's. But even for m=5 (like in higher orbitals), the paramagnetic term would be 5 * 9.27e-24 = 4.635e-23 J, which is still much smaller than 4e-19 J.

Wait, that's 4.63e-23 J, and 4e-19 J is 4e1 times larger. So even with m=5, it's 4.6e-23 / 4e-19 = 1.15e-4, which is about 0.0115% of ΔE. Still way smaller.

Therefore, the paramagnetic term is much less than the transition energy. So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Transition Energy (\( \Delta E \))**:  
   The wavelength of the transition is \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \, \text{nm} = 4.861 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).  
   The energy of the photon is given by \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{4.861 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 4.085 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (\( \langle H \rangle \))**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the electron's magnetic moment with the external magnetic field. For a magnetic field \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) and small values of the orbital magnetic quantum number \( m \), the energy shift is given by:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = \mu_B \cdot m \cdot B,
   \]  
   where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton.  
   Assuming \( m = 1 \) (the smallest non-zero value for \( m \)), we find:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = (9.274 \times 10^{-24})(1)(1) = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Comparison**:  
   The ratio of the paramagnetic coupling term to the transition energy is:  
   \[
   \frac{\langle H \rangle}{\Delta E} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{4.085 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]  
   This means \( \langle H \rangle \) is approximately \( 0.00227\% \) of \( \Delta E \), which is significantly smaller. Even for larger small values of \( m \) (e.g., \( m = 5 \)), the paramagnetic term remains much smaller than \( \Delta E \).

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom. The correct option is:

**Answer: C**

So that transition is between n=2 and n=3, but wait no, actually, Balmer series is from n>2 to n=2. 0.486 microns is the H-alpha line, which is n=3 to n=2. So the energy difference ΔE is the energy of that photon.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. So let me compute that.

h ≈ 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s
c ≈ 3.0 x 10^8 m/s
λ = 0.4861 micrometers = 0.4861 x 10^-6 meters.

So E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) ≈ 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = approx 1.9878e-25. Then divided by 0.4861e-6 is same as multiplying by 1e6/0.4861. Let me compute this:

1.9878e-25 * (1e6 / 0.4861) = 1.9878e-25 * approx 2057 ≈ 4.07e-22 J.

Wait, that's the photon energy. So ΔE is about 4e-22 J.

Now, what's the paramagnetic coupling term, the energy shift due to the magnetic field? The Zeeman effect says the energy shift is proportional to m * μ_B * B. So for each m, the shift is ΔE_param = m * μ_B * B.

But wait, the average value of the Hamiltonian in this case is the energy shift due to the magnetic field. So <H> would be m * μ_B * B. But what's m here? The problem says "small values of m"—so perhaps m is small, like m=1 or m=0. Wait, but for hydrogen, the ground state is l=0, m=0, so no shift. Maybe the problem is considering states with higher l, but small m compared to other factors.

Wait, but wait, the options are about whether <H> is much larger, much smaller, or comparable to ΔE. So I need to compute the magnitude of <H> and compare it with ΔE.

Assuming m is small, say m=1, then <H> would be μ_B * B. μ_B is about 9.27e-24 J/T, B is 1 T, so <H> ≈ 9.27e-24 J.

Wait, but the transition energy ΔE is about 4e-22 J. So 9e-24 is about 1/40th of 4e-22. So <H> is much smaller than ΔE.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the numbers.

μ_B ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T. So for m=1, <H> = μ_B * B * m = 9.274e-24 * 1 * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.

ΔE is 4.07e-22 J. So 9e-24 is about 0.023 times 4e-22. So <H> is about 2% of ΔE, which is not much smaller, but not negligible either? Hmm, but the options are 'much greater than', 'much smaller than', etc. So 2% is not 'much smaller than', but perhaps in the problem's context, the paramagnetic term is considered small compared to ΔE.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the paramagnetic coupling term is the orbital contribution, which is smaller than the spin contribution. Oh wait, the spin g-factor is different. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the spin magnetic moment and the orbital magnetic moment.

Wait, the problem specifies the orbital magnetic quantum number m, so the paramagnetic coupling here is due to the orbital magnetic moment. The orbital magnetic moment has a g-factor of approximately 1 (g_l ≈ 1), while the spin g-factor is about 2 (g_s ≈ 2). So the magnetic moment for orbital is μ_orbital = μ_B * m. So the energy shift is ΔE = μ_B * m * B.

So using m=1, as before, so 9.27e-24 J.

ΔE is 4e-22 J. So 9.27e-24 is 0.023175 times 4e-22, so about 2% of ΔE. So <H> is much less than ΔE? Well, 2% is not 'much less', but in the context of physics problems, if the ratio is less than 10%, it's often considered much smaller. But sometimes, it's about orders of magnitude.

Wait, but 4e-22 J is about 40 times larger than 9e-24 J. So <H> is about 1/40th of ΔE. So that's a factor of about 40. So 1e1 difference. So <H> is about 10 times smaller than ΔE.

Wait, but wait, if m is 1, then for each m, the shift is about 9e-24 J, which is about 0.023 times 4e-22 J. So <H> is about 2% of ΔE, which is several orders of magnitude smaller? Wait, 4e-22 is 40 times 1e-21, and 9e-24 is 0.9 times 1e-23. So 1e-23 is 100 times smaller than 1e-21. So 4e-22 is 40e-22, and 9e-24 is 0.9e-23, so 9e-24 is 0.0225 times 4e-22, which is about 2.25% of ΔE.

Hmm, so about 2% is not that much, but perhaps in this context, since the options are 'much greater', 'much less', etc., perhaps <H> is much smaller than ΔE. So the correct option would be C) <H> << ΔE.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think another way: perhaps the transition energy ΔE is of the order of 1e-18 J (but wait, I calculated 4e-22 J). Wait, let me double-check the photon energy calculation.

Wait, the wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, so 486.1 nm. So λ = 486.1e-9 meters. So E = hc/λ. Let me compute hc: h=6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s. hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / (486.1e-9 m) = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 m. Let's compute that.

Compute denominator: 486.1e-9 m is 4.861e-7 m.

1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = (1.9878 /4.861) * 1e-18.

1.9878 / 4.861 ≈ 0.4085. So E ≈ 0.4085e-18 J = 4.085e-19 J.

Wait, I must have made a mistake earlier in the exponents. Because 1e-25 / 1e-7 is 1e-18, so 1.987e-25 / 4.86e-7 = about 4e-19 J.

Wait, that makes more sense because the Balmer-alpha transition is in the visible range, which corresponds to higher energy than near-infrared or other longer wavelengths.

So ΔE is about 4e-19 J, not 4e-22 J. So that was my earlier mistake. So I should correct that.

So going back: E_photon = 4.085e-19 J.

Now, the paramagnetic term is μ_B * B. Because for m=1, it's μ_B * 1 * B. So μ_B is about 9.27e-24 J/T, B=1 T, so that gives 9.27e-24 J.

Comparing 9.27e-24 J (paramagnetic term) to 4.085e-19 J (ΔE), the ratio is 9.27e-24 /4.085e-19 ≈ 2.27e-5. So the paramagnetic term is about 2.27e-5 times the transition energy. That's about 0.00227% of ΔE. So definitely, the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

So <H> is much less than ΔE. So the correct option is C) <H> << ΔE.

Wait, but wait, what if m is larger? The problem states that m is small. So m=1 or m=2, but for hydrogen, the higher m values are possible for higher n's. But even for m=5 (like in higher orbitals), the paramagnetic term would be 5 * 9.27e-24 = 4.635e-23 J, which is still much smaller than 4e-19 J.

Wait, that's 4.63e-23 J, and 4e-19 J is 4e1 times larger. So even with m=5, it's 4.6e-23 / 4e-19 = 1.15e-4, which is about 0.0115% of ΔE. Still way smaller.

Therefore, the paramagnetic term is much less than the transition energy. So the correct answer is option C.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Transition Energy (\( \Delta E \))**:  
   The wavelength of the transition is \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \, \text{nm} = 4.861 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).  
   The energy of the photon is given by \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{4.861 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 4.085 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (\( \langle H \rangle \))**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the electron's magnetic moment with the external magnetic field. For a magnetic field \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) and small values of the orbital magnetic quantum number \( m \), the energy shift is given by:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = \mu_B \cdot m \cdot B,
   \]  
   where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton.  
   Assuming \( m = 1 \) (the smallest non-zero value for \( m \)), we find:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = (9.274 \times 10^{-24})(1)(1) = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Comparison**:  
   The ratio of the paramagnetic coupling term to the transition energy is:  
   \[
   \frac{\langle H \rangle}{\Delta E} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{4.085 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]  
   This means \( \langle H \rangle \) is approximately \( 0.00227\% \) of \( \Delta E \), which is significantly smaller. Even for larger small values of \( m \) (e.g., \( m = 5 \)), the paramagnetic term remains much smaller than \( \Delta E \).

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom. The correct option is:

**Answer: C**
