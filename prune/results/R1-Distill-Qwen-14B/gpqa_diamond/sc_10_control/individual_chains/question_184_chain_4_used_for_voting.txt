Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering benzene rings can sometimes be confusing. Position 1 is where the ethoxy group is attached. Then, position 2 has the tert-butyl group, and position 3 has the nitro group. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 on the ring. Now, the substituents are ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert-butyl (C(CH3)3), and nitro (NO2). 

The question is about the order in which these groups are introduced. Because the substituents are in specific positions, the order of their addition will affect where they end up on the ring due to directing effects.

I remember that nitro groups are meta directors, while ethoxy groups (which are oxygen-containing) are ortho/para directors. Tert-butyl is a bulky group and an alkyl chain, so it's an ortho/para director as well, but it's bulky, so it might prefer para or maybe meta due to steric hindrance.

Wait, the target has nitro at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. So, let's think about the order of adding these groups.

Let me recall that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents already present on the ring direct the incoming electrophile. So the order of addition will determine the positions.

One approach is to figure out which group should be added first. Nitro is a strong meta director, so if it's added later, it might influence the positions of the other groups. Alternatively, if other substituents are added first, their directing effects would influence where the nitro group ends up.

Wait, but the target has all three substituents. So, perhaps the nitro group is added last. Because nitro is a strong deactivating group, adding it earlier might make the ring less reactive for subsequent substitutions, especially if there are activating groups. Alternatively, maybe it's added in a position that is directed by the existing substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are added first, then the nitro group is introduced in the correct position.

Let me think about the possible steps. Each step in the options is a reaction that adds a substituent. The options list various possible sequences.

Let's list the substituents we need to add: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups.

Possible steps:

1. Alkylation (adding tert-butyl group) via Friedel-Crafts. But wait, tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 is a Friedel-Crafts reagent, which would add the tert-butyl group. However, Friedel-Crafts only works if the ring is activated towards electrophilic substitution. If we have activating groups, that's fine. But if the ring is deactivated, it won't work.

2. Nitration (adding nitro group) using HNO3 and H2SO4.

3. Ethoxylationâ€”adding an ethoxy group. That's usually via a nucleophilic substitution after making a leaving group, perhaps via a tosylate or using something like Williamson ether synthesis. Or, maybe via a substitution reaction where the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 mechanism.

Wait, but benzene can't directly have an ethoxy group added via electrophilic substitution. Oh wait, wait. To add an ethoxy group, you'd probably have to use a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strongly activating group to make the ring susceptible.

Alternatively, perhaps you can introduce a nitro group first, but nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't work after that. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps the order is adding the tert-butyl first, then the ethoxy, then the nitro group. Or some other order.

Wait, another approach: the target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, in terms of numbering, positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a way. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's say position 1 is ethoxy. Then position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, the substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions, which are adjacent in a sequence.

But wait, how would that happen? Let me think, perhaps the first substituent is ethoxy. Then the next is tert-butyl, which would be directed by the ethoxy group. Then the third is nitro, which would be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, ethoxy is an activating group (ortho/para director). So when you add the next substituent (tert-butyl), where would it go? If ethoxy is in position 1, the next substituent could go to position 2 or 4 (ortho or para). But since the target has substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3, perhaps the tert-butyl is added in position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy.

But wait, before that, is the ethoxy group added first? Because ethoxy is an activating group, which would facilitate the Friedel-Crafts alkylation for the tert-butyl group. Alternatively, the Friedel-Crafts might not work if the ring is deactivated elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the first step is adding the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts. Then, add the ethoxy group. But how? Because ethoxylation via electrophilic substitution isn't straightforward. Because after adding a Friedel-Crafts group (tert-butyl), the ring is deactivated (since Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group, which is activating as it's an alkyl group but it's ortho/para directing. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an activating group, so the ring should remain reactive.

Wait, no: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds a substituent that's activating (alkyl groups are activating because they're electron-donating through sigma bonds). So, after adding the tert-butyl group, the ring is activated, so adding another group via electrophilic substitution should be possible.

Wait, but if the first substituent is tert-butyl, which is an activating group, then adding ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution is possible. But how would you introduce an ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution? Because ethoxy is an ether, and electrophilic substitution would typically add groups like nitro or sulfonic acid, not ethers.

Wait a second. Oh! To add an ether group via electrophilic substitution, perhaps you can't. Maybe you need to use a different method. Oh, right, perhaps you can do an etherification via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strongly deactivating group, which would deactivate the ring in certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after a leaving group is present. Let me think: maybe introduce a nitro group first, then do some kind of displacement. Wait, but nitro is deactivating, which makes the ring less reactive, but perhaps in certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method. Maybe first, we add a nitro group, then use some kind of reduction, but that seems off.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The target has an ethoxy group attached to the benzene ring. To introduce an ethoxy group, one common method is to use a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But nucleophilic substitution on aromatic rings requires that the ring is activated towards nucleophilic attack, which typically requires strong electron-withdrawing groups, like nitro groups, in positions that activate certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction where a leaving group is present. For example, if we have a tosyl group attached, it could be replaced by an ethoxide ion. But that would require the tosyl group to be present first.

Wait, but how would we get the tosyl group on the benzene ring?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction. Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acyl group, which is a meta director and deactivating. Then, perhaps reducing the acyl group to an alcohol, and then converting the alcohol to an ether. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a nitration step. Wait, let's think step by step.

Optionally, let's think about the possible steps:

1. Add tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts (tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3). So the ring has a tert-butyl group.

2. Next, add the nitro group. Since the tert-butyl is an ortho/para director, the nitro group could go in the para or ortho positions relative to tert-butyl.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro group is in position 3. So if the tert-butyl is in position 2, the nitro is in position 3, which is meta to the ethoxy group. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added after the ethoxy group.

Wait, maybe the correct order is to first add the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro. Or perhaps the nitro is added first.

Wait, let me think about the directing effects:

- Nitro group is meta director. So if nitro is added first, the next substituent would go meta to it.

- Ethoxy is ortho/para director. So if ethoxy is added next, the third substituent (tert-butyl) would go ortho or para to ethoxy.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to approach it systematically.

Our target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's imagine the benzene ring. Let me draw it mentally.

Positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. 

So, position 1 is ethoxy (let's say at the top), position 2 (right next to it) has tert-butyl, and position 3 (next to that) has nitro.

So, substituents are in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

Let me think about the possible order of adding these groups.

If I start with benzene and add the tert-butyl group first via Friedel-Crafts. Then, the ring has a tert-butyl group. Next, I add an ethoxy group. Wait, but how? Because after Friedel-Crafts, the ring is still activated, but introducing an ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution isn't straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via another method. Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a different pathway, such as a nucleophilic substitution after some activation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. Let me think: perhaps we can first introduce a nitro group, then use that to direct the next substituent, and then introduce the ethoxy group.

Wait, maybe the steps are:

1. Nitration: add nitro group first.

2. Then, introduce a leaving group in a position that will be replaced by ethoxy.

Wait, nitro is meta director. So if I add nitro first, then the next substituent (like tert-butyl) would go meta to it. But then how would the ethoxy group get in?

Alternatively, perhaps the order is ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But how would I introduce ethoxy first? Because adding an ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution isn't possible. Wait, perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution. But that requires a strong activating group, which isn't present initially.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the ethoxy group is not introduced directly but via some other means. For example, perhaps after introducing a nitro group, which is a strong deactivating group, the ring becomes activated in certain positions for nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, no, nitro is deactivating. So nucleophilic substitution typically occurs on rings that are electron-deficient, which would be activated by strong deactivating groups. So if I have a nitro group, perhaps I can introduce a leaving group in a position, which can then be replaced by ethoxy.

Wait, but how to get the leaving group?

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a directing group. For example, if I have a nitro group at position 3, then the ethoxy group can be introduced at position 1 via some method, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a tosyl group as a leaving group. Let's say I first introduce a tosyl group at the desired position, then substitute it with ethoxide.

But how to get the tosyl group there? Tosyl groups are typically introduced via tosylation of an alcohol. So if I have a hydroxyl group, I can tosylate it.

Wait, maybe the steps are:

1. Add tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro group in the correct position.

3. Then, introduce a hydroxyl group in the desired position (for ethoxy substitution).

But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options given and think about each possible sequence.

Looking at the options, each has a sequence of steps. Let's see:

Option A: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) SO3/H2SO4; iv) NaNO2/HCl; v) dilute H2SO4; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat; vii) NaOH/EtBr; viii) Fe/HCl; ix) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Let me parse each step.

i) t-BuCl with AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Adds t-Bu group.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration. Adds nitro group.

iii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonation. Adds a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H).

iv) NaNO2/HCl: diazotization. Typically used for making diazonium salts, which can undergo substitution.

v) dilute H2SO4.

vi) H3O+ and heat: hydrolysis, perhaps of a diazonium salt.

vii) NaOH and EtBr: perhaps an SN2 substitution, adding an ethoxy group via Williamson.

viii) Fe/HCl: a reducing agent, perhaps used to reduce nitro groups or something else.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4: another nitration.

Hmm, but the target has only one nitro group. So this option seems to have multiple nitration steps, which may not be correct. Or perhaps it's a way to substitute.

Option B: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) Fe/HCl; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat; vii) NaOH/EtBr; viii) SO3/H2SO4; ix) dilute H2SO4.

Same as A but with different steps. Let me see. It starts with t-Bu, then nitrates, then Fe/HCl (maybe a reducing step?), then another nitration, then diazotization, hydrolysis, substitution, sulfonation, and dilute H2SO4.

Not sure if this leads to the correct substituents.

Option C: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3; ii) SO3/H2SO4; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; iv) Fe/HCl; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) HNO3/H2SO4; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat; viii) dilute H2SO4; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

So steps: Friedel-Crafts alkylation, sulfonation, nitration, reduction, diazotization, nitration, hydrolysis, dilute H2SO4, substitution.

Again, multiple nitrations and other steps. Not sure.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) SO3/H2SO4; vii) dilute H2SO4; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

So first nitrate, then Fe/HCl (maybe reduce nitro?), then add t-Bu, then nitrate again, diazotization, sulfonate, dilute H2SO4, hydrolysis, substitution.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Nitrate the ring in the correct position.

3. Then, substitute a leaving group with ethoxy.

But how would that work?

Wait, perhaps after nitration, we have a nitro group which is a meta director. Then, perhaps we can introduce a leaving group which can be replaced by ethoxy.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added using a nucleophilic substitution. For that, the ring must have a good leaving group in the desired position. One way to introduce a leaving group is via tosylation of an alcohol, but then you need to have an alcohol group in the correct position.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro group in the correct position via nitration.

3. Add hydroxyl group in the desired position (for ethoxy), perhaps via some directing.

Wait, but after nitration (which is deactivating), adding an -OH group via electrophilic substitution might not be feasible because the ring is deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy group.

Wait, let's think again. If I add the ethoxy group first, then the tert-butyl can be added in a position directed by ethoxy, and then nitro can be added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

But as I thought earlier, adding ethoxy via electrophilic substitution isn't straightforward. But perhaps, if I use a different method, like introducing a leaving group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps we can introduce the ethoxy group via a substitution after the ring has a nitro group. Because nitro is a strong deactivating group, which directs incoming substituents to meta positions.

Wait, but wait, nitro is a meta director. So if I have a nitro group, any new substituent would go meta to it.

Hmm, perhaps the order is:

1. Add ethoxy group.

But wait, how? I'm stuck here.

Let me think differently. The target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's consider the positions they are in.

Ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, substituents are in adjacent positions.

Now, considering the directing effects:

- Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director.

- tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para director.

- Nitro is deactivating, meta director.

So, if I add nitro last, it would be directed by the existing substituents. But if nitro is added earlier, perhaps the other substituents are directed accordingly.

Another approach: Considering the substituents in the target, the sequence of addition should ensure that each new substituent is added in the correct position as directed by the existing substituents.

Optionally, perhaps the order is:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Then, add ethoxy group via some method.

3. Then, nitrate.

But how to add the ethoxy group?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after a leaving group is present.

So, suppose after adding the tert-butyl group, I introduce a nitro group, then convert a position into a good leaving group, and substitute that with ethoxy.

Wait, but adding a nitro group would deactivate the ring, making electrophilic substitution difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps I can introduce a tosyl group as a leaving group. But how?

Wait, perhaps if I first nitrate the benzene ring, then perform some reactions to introduce a leaving group, but that seems tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method. Wait, perhaps using a Grignard reagent or something else, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction after activating the ring with a strong activating group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a strongly activated ring, perhaps with a nitro group.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director and deactivating. Let me think: if I have a nitro group on benzene, then I can introduce a leaving group in the meta position, which could then be substituted with ethoxy.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.

2. Then, introduce a leaving group (like a tosyl group) in the meta position relative to nitro, which would be position 3 (if nitro is at position 1, then tosyl would be at position 3).

3. Then, perform a nucleophilic substitution with ethoxide to replace the tosyl group with ethoxy.

But that seems possible. Then, after that, add the tert-butyl group.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating group, so Friedel-Crafts alkylation (for tert-butyl) might not work. Because Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring.

Hmm, that's a problem. So if we have nitro on the ring, Friedel-Crafts won't proceed.

So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the ring is sulfonated. Because sulfonic acid groups are strong deactivating (meta directors), but perhaps they can direct the substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add the tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, and then nitro.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. Adding tert-butyl first would activate the ring, making nitration easier.

Let's try:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation: add tert-butyl at position 1.

2. Nitration: since tert-butyl is an activating group, we can nitrate. The nitro group would go ortho or para to the tert-butyl.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to the ethoxy (position 1) and the tert-butyl (position 2). So, perhaps the nitro is meta to the ethoxy, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first, then tert-butyl, then ethoxy.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look at the options and see which one logically adds the substituents in the correct order.

Looking at the options, each option has a series of steps. Let's think about each step.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro group to amine? But that's not helpful, perhaps.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But nitro is deactivating, so this step might not work. Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring, which nitro doesn't provide.

So option D's step iii might not proceed, so D is likely incorrect.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3: adds t-Bu to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate. Since t-Bu is activating, this should add nitro in the ortho or para position.

Wait, but where? If t-Bu is in position 1, nitro can be in position 2 or 4.

Hmm, in the target, nitro is in position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). So, if the nitro is added after t-Bu, perhaps it goes in position 2 (ortho to t-Bu). But that would conflict with the target's structure.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added in a position that allows the ethoxy to be added later.

Wait, but how?

Option A's step iii is sulfonation with SO3/H2SO4. That adds a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta director.

Step iv: NaNO2/HCl: diazotization. That's for making diazonium salts, perhaps for substitution.

Step v: dilute H2SO4.

Step vi: H3O+ and heat: hydrolysis of diazonium salt to form a phenol.

Step vii: NaOH and EtBr: SN2 substitution, perhaps introducing ethoxy.

Wait, but how does the substitution happen? If after hydrolysis, we have a phenol, then treating with NaOH and EtBr would perform an etherification, turning the phenol into an ethoxy group.

Wait, but phenol is a strong activating group, so perhaps after substitution, the ethoxy group is added.

Hmm, perhaps the steps in option A are:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Nitrate.

3. Sulfonate.

4. Diazotize (make diazonium salt).

5. Hydrolyze to phenol.

6. Substitute phenol with ethoxy.

But wait, the target has nitro, t-Bu, and ethoxy.

But the steps in option A have multiple steps of nitration and substitution. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Add t-Bu, nitrate, sulfonate, then substitute to get ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add t-Bu (option A step i).

2. Nitrate (step ii). Now the ring has t-Bu and nitro. Nitro is meta to t-Bu? Or ortho.

Wait, t-Bu is activating, so nitration would occur ortho/para to t-Bu.

3. Sulfonate (step iii). Now, the ring has t-Bu, nitro, and sulfonic acid. But I'm not sure where.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to approach this by considering the correct order of substituents based on the target structure.

Let me try to outline the correct order:

The target has nitro at position 3, t-Bu at 2, and ethoxy at 1.

Assuming the numbering is such that the ethoxy is at position 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

So, the substituents are in adjacent positions.

The order in which they are added will affect their positions.

Let me imagine:

1. First, add ethoxy. But as discussed, this is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps add t-Bu first.

Assuming t-Bu is first:

After adding t-Bu, the ring is activated (ortho/para director).

2. Next, nitrate. The nitro group will go ortho or para to t-Bu. Let's say para is position 4 (assuming t-Bu is position 1). But in the target, nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (1) and t-Bu (2). Hmm, so perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Add ethoxy.

But again, how?

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after the ring has a leaving group. For example:

1. Add a nitro group first (step i: nitrate benzene).

2. Then, introduce a leaving group (like tosyl group) ortho to nitro, which would be position 2.

3. Substitute the tosyl group with t-Bu.

Wait, but after nitration, the ring is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work.

Hmm, this is getting really complicated. Maybe I should think about which option's steps logically lead to the target.

Looking at option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3: add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro group to amine? Not sure.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate again? Maybe not.

v) NaNO2/HCl: diazo.

vi) H3O+/heat: hydrolyze to phenol.

vii) NaOH/EtBr: substitute phenol to ethoxy.

viii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4: perhaps desulfonate?

But not sure how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps option D's steps:

i) nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3: add t-Bu. But if the ring has an amine group, which is activating, then Friedel-Crafts would work.

Wait, if we nitrate first (i), then reduce nitro to amine (ii), then add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts (iii). Now the ring has amine and t-Bu.

But then, step iv is HNO3, which would nitrate again. But the target has only one nitro group. So maybe that's not it.

I think I'm going around in circles. Another approach: let's consider the substitution pattern.

The target has three substituents in adjacent positions (1,2,3). Let's think about how each substituent could have been directed.

If ethoxy is added first, then t-Bu would be ortho or para to it. But adding ethoxy is tricky.

Alternatively, if t-Bu is added first, then ethoxy is added ortho or para to it. Then nitro is added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, let's say:

1. Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts (in position 1).

2. Add ethoxy via some method in position 2 (ortho to t-Bu).

But as I don't know how to add ethoxy, perhaps this is a dead end.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after having a leaving group, which is directed by the t-Bu.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Nitrate, adding nitro in para to t-Bu (position 4).

3. Then, introduce a leaving group in position 3 (meta to nitro, which is position 4).

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after t-Bu, then a leaving group is introduced in position 3 (meta to nitro), then substituted with ethoxy.

But how to introduce a leaving group?

Hmm.

Wait, considering the options, perhaps option B is correct. Let me see:

Option B's steps:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3: add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate. Now, nitro is in ortho or para to t-Bu.

Assuming nitro is para to t-Bu, which is position 4.

iii) Fe/HCl: perhaps reduce nitro to amine. But I'm not sure why that would be done.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate again. Hmm, but that would add another nitro group, which the target doesn't have.

Alternatively, maybe step iii is not a reduction but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps step iii is a nitration in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

i) t-Bu added.

ii) nitrate: nitro in position 2 (ortho to t-Bu, which is position 1).

iii) Fe/HCl: maybe remove nitro group? Or reduce it.

Wait, Fe/HCl is a reducing agent. Perhaps it's used to reduce the nitro group to an amine.

So, after nitration and reduction, the ring has t-Bu and amine.

But then adding another nitro group (step iv) seems odd.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Another idea: the ethoxy group must be introduced via a substitution after a leaving group is present. The leaving group must be positioned where the ethoxy group is to go.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Nitrate to add nitro in a position that will direct the leaving group.

3. Introduce a leaving group (like tosyl) in the correct position.

4. Substitute the leaving group with ethoxy.

But how to arrange this.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Nitrate in a position that is meta to where the ethoxy will be.

3. Then, introduce a leaving group in the target position for ethoxy.

But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, using a good leaving group that's positioned correctly.

Wait, let me think about the options again. Looking for a sequence where:

- t-Bu is added first.

- Then, nitro is added in a position that allows for the correct substitution.

- Then, ethoxy is added via substitution.

Option A's steps after adding t-Bu and nitro involve sulfonation, which adds a strong deactivating group, which might not be helpful for adding ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is adding t-Bu, then nitro, then sulfonate, then substitute.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the nitration steps.

The target has one nitro group. So the correct option should have only one nitration step, or perhaps two if one is removed.

Looking at the options:

Option A has two nitration steps (steps ii and ix).

Option B: steps ii and iv are nitrations.

Option C: steps iii and vi.

Option D: steps i and iv.

The target has only one nitro group, so maybe only one nitration is needed. But some options have multiple, which might be used for different substituents.

Wait, perhaps some steps involve the removal of a nitro group.

Wait, another possibility: nitro groups can be reduced to amines, which can then be used in other reactions.

But in the target, there's no amine, so any nitro groups added must remain.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced, then reduced, then another nitro added. But that seems unlikely.

At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the target molecule, the substituents are at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro). So, perhaps the nitro group was the last to be added.

So, the order would be:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Nitrate.

But how to add ethoxy in step 2.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after the t-Bu is added.

Wait, if the ring has t-Bu, which is activating, then after adding t-Bu, perhaps a nitro group is added in the correct position, then a leaving group is introduced in the position where ethoxy is needed, and then substituted.

But I'm not seeing it clearly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, option D's steps:

i) Nitrate benzene: gives nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro to amine. So we have aniline now.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Now, since aniline is activating (strongly activating), Friedel-Crafts can add t-Bu group.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate again. So now, we have two nitro groups? No, the target has only one. So maybe this is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is not a nitration but another reaction.

Hmm, this is getting too time-consuming. Considering the time I have, perhaps the correct option is option D. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach. The target has substituents that are all meta to each other? Or adjacent.

Wait, in the target, substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3. So, the ethoxy is at 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3.

So, the order of addition should be such that each new substituent is added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

Assuming ethoxy is added first, then t-Bu would be added ortho or para to it. Then nitro would be added in a position directed by both.

But again, ethoxy addition is the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Nitrate, adding nitro ortho to t-Bu (position 2).

3. Then, substitute a leaving group in position 3 (which is adjacent to nitro) with ethoxy.

But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence in option D is:

i) Nitrate (adds nitro at position 1).

ii) Reduce nitro to amine (now, amine at position 1).

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds t-Bu in position 2 (ortho to amine).

iv) Nitrate again? Hmm, but target has only one nitro.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is not a nitration but another substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after the nitro and t-Bu are in place.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the options, the correct sequence likely involves adding t-Bu first, then nitro, then substituting a leaving group with ethoxy. Looking for an option that has t-Bu, then nitro, then a substitution step.

Looking at option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3.

ii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonate. Adds a sulfonic acid group.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl: reduce.

v) NaNO2/HCl: diazo.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate again.

vii) H3O+/heat: hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr: substitution.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The target has ethoxy, which is probably added via substitution. So the steps involving NaOH/EtBr and others are substitution steps.

Looking at option A:

After adding t-Bu and nitro, sulfonate, then diazo, hydrolyze to phenol, substitute with ethoxy.

Wait, if the steps after adding t-Bu and nitro create a leaving group, then substituting with ethoxy would place it in a certain position.

But I'm not confident. Based on the options, I think the correct answer is option D.

Wait, no. Option D starts with nitration, which would add nitro to benzene. Then, Fe/HCl reduces nitro to amine. Then, Friedel-Crafts adds t-Bu. Then, nitrate again, which would add another nitro group. But the target has only one nitro.

So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option B.

But I'm not certain. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to choose based on the most plausible steps.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The analysis focuses on the order of addition of these groups, considering their directing effects and the feasibility of the reactions.

### Key Analysis of the Target Structure and Reactions:
1. **Substituent Positions and Directing Effects**:
   - The ethoxy group (OCHâ‚‚CHâ‚ƒ) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.
   - The tert-butyl group (C(CHâ‚ƒ)â‚ƒ) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.
   - The nitro group (NOâ‚‚) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.
   - The substituents are arranged in adjacent positions (1, 2, 3), which complicates the sequence of addition.

2. **Challenges in Adding the Ethoxy Group**:
   - Introducing an ethoxy group directly via electrophilic substitution is not straightforward. Instead, it likely involves a substitution reaction after introducing a leaving group.

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes multiple nitration and sulfonation steps, which may not align with the target structure. The sequence involves adding a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivator, complicating subsequent reactions.
   - **Option B**: Starts with tert-butyl addition, followed by nitration and reduction. However, the sequence includes multiple nitration steps, which is inconsistent with the target having only one nitro group.
   - **Option C**: Begins with tert-butyl addition, followed by sulfonation and nitration. The sequence appears overly complex and does not clearly align with the target structure.
   - **Option D**: Starts with nitration, followed by reduction and tert-butyl addition. However, the sequence includes multiple nitration steps, leading to more than one nitro group, which contradicts the target structure.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating the options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the target structure. However, based on the plausibility of the steps and the reasoning provided, **Option D** is selected as the most likely answer, despite some inconsistencies.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering benzene rings can sometimes be confusing. Position 1 is where the ethoxy group is attached. Then, position 2 has the tert-butyl group, and position 3 has the nitro group. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 on the ring. Now, the substituents are ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert-butyl (C(CH3)3), and nitro (NO2). 

The question is about the order in which these groups are introduced. Because the substituents are in specific positions, the order of their addition will affect where they end up on the ring due to directing effects.

I remember that nitro groups are meta directors, while ethoxy groups (which are oxygen-containing) are ortho/para directors. Tert-butyl is a bulky group and an alkyl chain, so it's an ortho/para director as well, but it's bulky, so it might prefer para or maybe meta due to steric hindrance.

Wait, the target has nitro at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. So, let's think about the order of adding these groups.

Let me recall that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents already present on the ring direct the incoming electrophile. So the order of addition will determine the positions.

One approach is to figure out which group should be added first. Nitro is a strong meta director, so if it's added later, it might influence the positions of the other groups. Alternatively, if other substituents are added first, their directing effects would influence where the nitro group ends up.

Wait, but the target has all three substituents. So, perhaps the nitro group is added last. Because nitro is a strong deactivating group, adding it earlier might make the ring less reactive for subsequent substitutions, especially if there are activating groups. Alternatively, maybe it's added in a position that is directed by the existing substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are added first, then the nitro group is introduced in the correct position.

Let me think about the possible steps. Each step in the options is a reaction that adds a substituent. The options list various possible sequences.

Let's list the substituents we need to add: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups.

Possible steps:

1. Alkylation (adding tert-butyl group) via Friedel-Crafts. But wait, tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 is a Friedel-Crafts reagent, which would add the tert-butyl group. However, Friedel-Crafts only works if the ring is activated towards electrophilic substitution. If we have activating groups, that's fine. But if the ring is deactivated, it won't work.

2. Nitration (adding nitro group) using HNO3 and H2SO4.

3. Ethoxylationâ€”adding an ethoxy group. That's usually via a nucleophilic substitution after making a leaving group, perhaps via a tosylate or using something like Williamson ether synthesis. Or, maybe via a substitution reaction where the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 mechanism.

Wait, but benzene can't directly have an ethoxy group added via electrophilic substitution. Oh wait, wait. To add an ethoxy group, you'd probably have to use a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strongly activating group to make the ring susceptible.

Alternatively, perhaps you can introduce a nitro group first, but nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't work after that. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps the order is adding the tert-butyl first, then the ethoxy, then the nitro group. Or some other order.

Wait, another approach: the target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, in terms of numbering, positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a way. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's say position 1 is ethoxy. Then position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, the substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions, which are adjacent in a sequence.

But wait, how would that happen? Let me think, perhaps the first substituent is ethoxy. Then the next is tert-butyl, which would be directed by the ethoxy group. Then the third is nitro, which would be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, ethoxy is an activating group (ortho/para director). So when you add the next substituent (tert-butyl), where would it go? If ethoxy is in position 1, the next substituent could go to position 2 or 4 (ortho or para). But since the target has substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3, perhaps the tert-butyl is added in position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy.

But wait, before that, is the ethoxy group added first? Because ethoxy is an activating group, which would facilitate the Friedel-Crafts alkylation for the tert-butyl group. Alternatively, the Friedel-Crafts might not work if the ring is deactivated elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the first step is adding the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts. Then, add the ethoxy group. But how? Because ethoxylation via electrophilic substitution isn't straightforward. Because after adding a Friedel-Crafts group (tert-butyl), the ring is deactivated (since Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group, which is activating as it's an alkyl group but it's ortho/para directing. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an activating group, so the ring should remain reactive.

Wait, no: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds a substituent that's activating (alkyl groups are activating because they're electron-donating through sigma bonds). So, after adding the tert-butyl group, the ring is activated, so adding another group via electrophilic substitution should be possible.

Wait, but if the first substituent is tert-butyl, which is an activating group, then adding ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution is possible. But how would you introduce an ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution? Because ethoxy is an ether, and electrophilic substitution would typically add groups like nitro or sulfonic acid, not ethers.

Wait a second. Oh! To add an ether group via electrophilic substitution, perhaps you can't. Maybe you need to use a different method. Oh, right, perhaps you can do an etherification via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strongly deactivating group, which would deactivate the ring in certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after a leaving group is present. Let me think: maybe introduce a nitro group first, then do some kind of displacement. Wait, but nitro is deactivating, which makes the ring less reactive, but perhaps in certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method. Maybe first, we add a nitro group, then use some kind of reduction, but that seems off.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The target has an ethoxy group attached to the benzene ring. To introduce an ethoxy group, one common method is to use a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But nucleophilic substitution on aromatic rings requires that the ring is activated towards nucleophilic attack, which typically requires strong electron-withdrawing groups, like nitro groups, in positions that activate certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction where a leaving group is present. For example, if we have a tosyl group attached, it could be replaced by an ethoxide ion. But that would require the tosyl group to be present first.

Wait, but how would we get the tosyl group on the benzene ring?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction. Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acyl group, which is a meta director and deactivating. Then, perhaps reducing the acyl group to an alcohol, and then converting the alcohol to an ether. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a nitration step. Wait, let's think step by step.

Optionally, let's think about the possible steps:

1. Add tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts (tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3). So the ring has a tert-butyl group.

2. Next, add the nitro group. Since the tert-butyl is an ortho/para director, the nitro group could go in the para or ortho positions relative to tert-butyl.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro group is in position 3. So if the tert-butyl is in position 2, the nitro is in position 3, which is meta to the ethoxy group. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added after the ethoxy group.

Wait, maybe the correct order is to first add the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro. Or perhaps the nitro is added first.

Wait, let me think about the directing effects:

- Nitro group is meta director. So if nitro is added first, the next substituent would go meta to it.

- Ethoxy is ortho/para director. So if ethoxy is added next, the third substituent (tert-butyl) would go ortho or para to ethoxy.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to approach it systematically.

Our target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's imagine the benzene ring. Let me draw it mentally.

Positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. 

So, position 1 is ethoxy (let's say at the top), position 2 (right next to it) has tert-butyl, and position 3 (next to that) has nitro.

So, substituents are in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

Let me think about the possible order of adding these groups.

If I start with benzene and add the tert-butyl group first via Friedel-Crafts. Then, the ring has a tert-butyl group. Next, I add an ethoxy group. Wait, but how? Because after Friedel-Crafts, the ring is still activated, but introducing an ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution isn't straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via another method. Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a different pathway, such as a nucleophilic substitution after some activation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. Let me think: perhaps we can first introduce a nitro group, then use that to direct the next substituent, and then introduce the ethoxy group.

Wait, maybe the steps are:

1. Nitration: add nitro group first.

2. Then, introduce a leaving group in a position that will be replaced by ethoxy.

Wait, nitro is meta director. So if I add nitro first, then the next substituent (like tert-butyl) would go meta to it. But then how would the ethoxy group get in?

Alternatively, perhaps the order is ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But how would I introduce ethoxy first? Because adding an ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution isn't possible. Wait, perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution. But that requires a strong activating group, which isn't present initially.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the ethoxy group is not introduced directly but via some other means. For example, perhaps after introducing a nitro group, which is a strong deactivating group, the ring becomes activated in certain positions for nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, no, nitro is deactivating. So nucleophilic substitution typically occurs on rings that are electron-deficient, which would be activated by strong deactivating groups. So if I have a nitro group, perhaps I can introduce a leaving group in a position, which can then be replaced by ethoxy.

Wait, but how to get the leaving group?

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a directing group. For example, if I have a nitro group at position 3, then the ethoxy group can be introduced at position 1 via some method, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a tosyl group as a leaving group. Let's say I first introduce a tosyl group at the desired position, then substitute it with ethoxide.

But how to get the tosyl group there? Tosyl groups are typically introduced via tosylation of an alcohol. So if I have a hydroxyl group, I can tosylate it.

Wait, maybe the steps are:

1. Add tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro group in the correct position.

3. Then, introduce a hydroxyl group in the desired position (for ethoxy substitution).

But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options given and think about each possible sequence.

Looking at the options, each has a sequence of steps. Let's see:

Option A: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) SO3/H2SO4; iv) NaNO2/HCl; v) dilute H2SO4; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat; vii) NaOH/EtBr; viii) Fe/HCl; ix) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Let me parse each step.

i) t-BuCl with AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Adds t-Bu group.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration. Adds nitro group.

iii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonation. Adds a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H).

iv) NaNO2/HCl: diazotization. Typically used for making diazonium salts, which can undergo substitution.

v) dilute H2SO4.

vi) H3O+ and heat: hydrolysis, perhaps of a diazonium salt.

vii) NaOH and EtBr: perhaps an SN2 substitution, adding an ethoxy group via Williamson.

viii) Fe/HCl: a reducing agent, perhaps used to reduce nitro groups or something else.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4: another nitration.

Hmm, but the target has only one nitro group. So this option seems to have multiple nitration steps, which may not be correct. Or perhaps it's a way to substitute.

Option B: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) Fe/HCl; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat; vii) NaOH/EtBr; viii) SO3/H2SO4; ix) dilute H2SO4.

Same as A but with different steps. Let me see. It starts with t-Bu, then nitrates, then Fe/HCl (maybe a reducing step?), then another nitration, then diazotization, hydrolysis, substitution, sulfonation, and dilute H2SO4.

Not sure if this leads to the correct substituents.

Option C: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3; ii) SO3/H2SO4; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; iv) Fe/HCl; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) HNO3/H2SO4; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat; viii) dilute H2SO4; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

So steps: Friedel-Crafts alkylation, sulfonation, nitration, reduction, diazotization, nitration, hydrolysis, dilute H2SO4, substitution.

Again, multiple nitrations and other steps. Not sure.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) SO3/H2SO4; vii) dilute H2SO4; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

So first nitrate, then Fe/HCl (maybe reduce nitro?), then add t-Bu, then nitrate again, diazotization, sulfonate, dilute H2SO4, hydrolysis, substitution.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Nitrate the ring in the correct position.

3. Then, substitute a leaving group with ethoxy.

But how would that work?

Wait, perhaps after nitration, we have a nitro group which is a meta director. Then, perhaps we can introduce a leaving group which can be replaced by ethoxy.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added using a nucleophilic substitution. For that, the ring must have a good leaving group in the desired position. One way to introduce a leaving group is via tosylation of an alcohol, but then you need to have an alcohol group in the correct position.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro group in the correct position via nitration.

3. Add hydroxyl group in the desired position (for ethoxy), perhaps via some directing.

Wait, but after nitration (which is deactivating), adding an -OH group via electrophilic substitution might not be feasible because the ring is deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy group.

Wait, let's think again. If I add the ethoxy group first, then the tert-butyl can be added in a position directed by ethoxy, and then nitro can be added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

But as I thought earlier, adding ethoxy via electrophilic substitution isn't straightforward. But perhaps, if I use a different method, like introducing a leaving group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps we can introduce the ethoxy group via a substitution after the ring has a nitro group. Because nitro is a strong deactivating group, which directs incoming substituents to meta positions.

Wait, but wait, nitro is a meta director. So if I have a nitro group, any new substituent would go meta to it.

Hmm, perhaps the order is:

1. Add ethoxy group.

But wait, how? I'm stuck here.

Let me think differently. The target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's consider the positions they are in.

Ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, substituents are in adjacent positions.

Now, considering the directing effects:

- Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director.

- tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para director.

- Nitro is deactivating, meta director.

So, if I add nitro last, it would be directed by the existing substituents. But if nitro is added earlier, perhaps the other substituents are directed accordingly.

Another approach: Considering the substituents in the target, the sequence of addition should ensure that each new substituent is added in the correct position as directed by the existing substituents.

Optionally, perhaps the order is:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Then, add ethoxy group via some method.

3. Then, nitrate.

But how to add the ethoxy group?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after a leaving group is present.

So, suppose after adding the tert-butyl group, I introduce a nitro group, then convert a position into a good leaving group, and substitute that with ethoxy.

Wait, but adding a nitro group would deactivate the ring, making electrophilic substitution difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps I can introduce a tosyl group as a leaving group. But how?

Wait, perhaps if I first nitrate the benzene ring, then perform some reactions to introduce a leaving group, but that seems tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method. Wait, perhaps using a Grignard reagent or something else, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction after activating the ring with a strong activating group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a strongly activated ring, perhaps with a nitro group.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director and deactivating. Let me think: if I have a nitro group on benzene, then I can introduce a leaving group in the meta position, which could then be substituted with ethoxy.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.

2. Then, introduce a leaving group (like a tosyl group) in the meta position relative to nitro, which would be position 3 (if nitro is at position 1, then tosyl would be at position 3).

3. Then, perform a nucleophilic substitution with ethoxide to replace the tosyl group with ethoxy.

But that seems possible. Then, after that, add the tert-butyl group.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating group, so Friedel-Crafts alkylation (for tert-butyl) might not work. Because Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring.

Hmm, that's a problem. So if we have nitro on the ring, Friedel-Crafts won't proceed.

So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the ring is sulfonated. Because sulfonic acid groups are strong deactivating (meta directors), but perhaps they can direct the substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add the tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, and then nitro.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. Adding tert-butyl first would activate the ring, making nitration easier.

Let's try:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation: add tert-butyl at position 1.

2. Nitration: since tert-butyl is an activating group, we can nitrate. The nitro group would go ortho or para to the tert-butyl.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to the ethoxy (position 1) and the tert-butyl (position 2). So, perhaps the nitro is meta to the ethoxy, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first, then tert-butyl, then ethoxy.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look at the options and see which one logically adds the substituents in the correct order.

Looking at the options, each option has a series of steps. Let's think about each step.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro group to amine? But that's not helpful, perhaps.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But nitro is deactivating, so this step might not work. Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring, which nitro doesn't provide.

So option D's step iii might not proceed, so D is likely incorrect.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3: adds t-Bu to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate. Since t-Bu is activating, this should add nitro in the ortho or para position.

Wait, but where? If t-Bu is in position 1, nitro can be in position 2 or 4.

Hmm, in the target, nitro is in position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). So, if the nitro is added after t-Bu, perhaps it goes in position 2 (ortho to t-Bu). But that would conflict with the target's structure.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added in a position that allows the ethoxy to be added later.

Wait, but how?

Option A's step iii is sulfonation with SO3/H2SO4. That adds a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta director.

Step iv: NaNO2/HCl: diazotization. That's for making diazonium salts, perhaps for substitution.

Step v: dilute H2SO4.

Step vi: H3O+ and heat: hydrolysis of diazonium salt to form a phenol.

Step vii: NaOH and EtBr: SN2 substitution, perhaps introducing ethoxy.

Wait, but how does the substitution happen? If after hydrolysis, we have a phenol, then treating with NaOH and EtBr would perform an etherification, turning the phenol into an ethoxy group.

Wait, but phenol is a strong activating group, so perhaps after substitution, the ethoxy group is added.

Hmm, perhaps the steps in option A are:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Nitrate.

3. Sulfonate.

4. Diazotize (make diazonium salt).

5. Hydrolyze to phenol.

6. Substitute phenol with ethoxy.

But wait, the target has nitro, t-Bu, and ethoxy.

But the steps in option A have multiple steps of nitration and substitution. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Add t-Bu, nitrate, sulfonate, then substitute to get ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add t-Bu (option A step i).

2. Nitrate (step ii). Now the ring has t-Bu and nitro. Nitro is meta to t-Bu? Or ortho.

Wait, t-Bu is activating, so nitration would occur ortho/para to t-Bu.

3. Sulfonate (step iii). Now, the ring has t-Bu, nitro, and sulfonic acid. But I'm not sure where.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to approach this by considering the correct order of substituents based on the target structure.

Let me try to outline the correct order:

The target has nitro at position 3, t-Bu at 2, and ethoxy at 1.

Assuming the numbering is such that the ethoxy is at position 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

So, the substituents are in adjacent positions.

The order in which they are added will affect their positions.

Let me imagine:

1. First, add ethoxy. But as discussed, this is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps add t-Bu first.

Assuming t-Bu is first:

After adding t-Bu, the ring is activated (ortho/para director).

2. Next, nitrate. The nitro group will go ortho or para to t-Bu. Let's say para is position 4 (assuming t-Bu is position 1). But in the target, nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (1) and t-Bu (2). Hmm, so perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Add ethoxy.

But again, how?

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after the ring has a leaving group. For example:

1. Add a nitro group first (step i: nitrate benzene).

2. Then, introduce a leaving group (like tosyl group) ortho to nitro, which would be position 2.

3. Substitute the tosyl group with t-Bu.

Wait, but after nitration, the ring is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work.

Hmm, this is getting really complicated. Maybe I should think about which option's steps logically lead to the target.

Looking at option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3: add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro group to amine? Not sure.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate again? Maybe not.

v) NaNO2/HCl: diazo.

vi) H3O+/heat: hydrolyze to phenol.

vii) NaOH/EtBr: substitute phenol to ethoxy.

viii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4: perhaps desulfonate?

But not sure how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps option D's steps:

i) nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3: add t-Bu. But if the ring has an amine group, which is activating, then Friedel-Crafts would work.

Wait, if we nitrate first (i), then reduce nitro to amine (ii), then add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts (iii). Now the ring has amine and t-Bu.

But then, step iv is HNO3, which would nitrate again. But the target has only one nitro group. So maybe that's not it.

I think I'm going around in circles. Another approach: let's consider the substitution pattern.

The target has three substituents in adjacent positions (1,2,3). Let's think about how each substituent could have been directed.

If ethoxy is added first, then t-Bu would be ortho or para to it. But adding ethoxy is tricky.

Alternatively, if t-Bu is added first, then ethoxy is added ortho or para to it. Then nitro is added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, let's say:

1. Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts (in position 1).

2. Add ethoxy via some method in position 2 (ortho to t-Bu).

But as I don't know how to add ethoxy, perhaps this is a dead end.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after having a leaving group, which is directed by the t-Bu.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Nitrate, adding nitro in para to t-Bu (position 4).

3. Then, introduce a leaving group in position 3 (meta to nitro, which is position 4).

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after t-Bu, then a leaving group is introduced in position 3 (meta to nitro), then substituted with ethoxy.

But how to introduce a leaving group?

Hmm.

Wait, considering the options, perhaps option B is correct. Let me see:

Option B's steps:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3: add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate. Now, nitro is in ortho or para to t-Bu.

Assuming nitro is para to t-Bu, which is position 4.

iii) Fe/HCl: perhaps reduce nitro to amine. But I'm not sure why that would be done.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate again. Hmm, but that would add another nitro group, which the target doesn't have.

Alternatively, maybe step iii is not a reduction but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps step iii is a nitration in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

i) t-Bu added.

ii) nitrate: nitro in position 2 (ortho to t-Bu, which is position 1).

iii) Fe/HCl: maybe remove nitro group? Or reduce it.

Wait, Fe/HCl is a reducing agent. Perhaps it's used to reduce the nitro group to an amine.

So, after nitration and reduction, the ring has t-Bu and amine.

But then adding another nitro group (step iv) seems odd.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Another idea: the ethoxy group must be introduced via a substitution after a leaving group is present. The leaving group must be positioned where the ethoxy group is to go.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Nitrate to add nitro in a position that will direct the leaving group.

3. Introduce a leaving group (like tosyl) in the correct position.

4. Substitute the leaving group with ethoxy.

But how to arrange this.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Nitrate in a position that is meta to where the ethoxy will be.

3. Then, introduce a leaving group in the target position for ethoxy.

But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, using a good leaving group that's positioned correctly.

Wait, let me think about the options again. Looking for a sequence where:

- t-Bu is added first.

- Then, nitro is added in a position that allows for the correct substitution.

- Then, ethoxy is added via substitution.

Option A's steps after adding t-Bu and nitro involve sulfonation, which adds a strong deactivating group, which might not be helpful for adding ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is adding t-Bu, then nitro, then sulfonate, then substitute.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the nitration steps.

The target has one nitro group. So the correct option should have only one nitration step, or perhaps two if one is removed.

Looking at the options:

Option A has two nitration steps (steps ii and ix).

Option B: steps ii and iv are nitrations.

Option C: steps iii and vi.

Option D: steps i and iv.

The target has only one nitro group, so maybe only one nitration is needed. But some options have multiple, which might be used for different substituents.

Wait, perhaps some steps involve the removal of a nitro group.

Wait, another possibility: nitro groups can be reduced to amines, which can then be used in other reactions.

But in the target, there's no amine, so any nitro groups added must remain.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced, then reduced, then another nitro added. But that seems unlikely.

At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the target molecule, the substituents are at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro). So, perhaps the nitro group was the last to be added.

So, the order would be:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Nitrate.

But how to add ethoxy in step 2.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after the t-Bu is added.

Wait, if the ring has t-Bu, which is activating, then after adding t-Bu, perhaps a nitro group is added in the correct position, then a leaving group is introduced in the position where ethoxy is needed, and then substituted.

But I'm not seeing it clearly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, option D's steps:

i) Nitrate benzene: gives nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro to amine. So we have aniline now.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Now, since aniline is activating (strongly activating), Friedel-Crafts can add t-Bu group.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate again. So now, we have two nitro groups? No, the target has only one. So maybe this is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is not a nitration but another reaction.

Hmm, this is getting too time-consuming. Considering the time I have, perhaps the correct option is option D. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach. The target has substituents that are all meta to each other? Or adjacent.

Wait, in the target, substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3. So, the ethoxy is at 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3.

So, the order of addition should be such that each new substituent is added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

Assuming ethoxy is added first, then t-Bu would be added ortho or para to it. Then nitro would be added in a position directed by both.

But again, ethoxy addition is the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Nitrate, adding nitro ortho to t-Bu (position 2).

3. Then, substitute a leaving group in position 3 (which is adjacent to nitro) with ethoxy.

But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence in option D is:

i) Nitrate (adds nitro at position 1).

ii) Reduce nitro to amine (now, amine at position 1).

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds t-Bu in position 2 (ortho to amine).

iv) Nitrate again? Hmm, but target has only one nitro.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is not a nitration but another substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after the nitro and t-Bu are in place.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the options, the correct sequence likely involves adding t-Bu first, then nitro, then substituting a leaving group with ethoxy. Looking for an option that has t-Bu, then nitro, then a substitution step.

Looking at option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3.

ii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonate. Adds a sulfonic acid group.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl: reduce.

v) NaNO2/HCl: diazo.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate again.

vii) H3O+/heat: hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr: substitution.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The target has ethoxy, which is probably added via substitution. So the steps involving NaOH/EtBr and others are substitution steps.

Looking at option A:

After adding t-Bu and nitro, sulfonate, then diazo, hydrolyze to phenol, substitute with ethoxy.

Wait, if the steps after adding t-Bu and nitro create a leaving group, then substituting with ethoxy would place it in a certain position.

But I'm not confident. Based on the options, I think the correct answer is option D.

Wait, no. Option D starts with nitration, which would add nitro to benzene. Then, Fe/HCl reduces nitro to amine. Then, Friedel-Crafts adds t-Bu. Then, nitrate again, which would add another nitro group. But the target has only one nitro.

So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option B.

But I'm not certain. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to choose based on the most plausible steps.


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The analysis focuses on the order of addition of these groups, considering their directing effects and the feasibility of the reactions.

### Key Analysis of the Target Structure and Reactions:
1. **Substituent Positions and Directing Effects**:
   - The ethoxy group (OCHâ‚‚CHâ‚ƒ) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.
   - The tert-butyl group (C(CHâ‚ƒ)â‚ƒ) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.
   - The nitro group (NOâ‚‚) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.
   - The substituents are arranged in adjacent positions (1, 2, 3), which complicates the sequence of addition.

2. **Challenges in Adding the Ethoxy Group**:
   - Introducing an ethoxy group directly via electrophilic substitution is not straightforward. Instead, it likely involves a substitution reaction after introducing a leaving group.

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes multiple nitration and sulfonation steps, which may not align with the target structure. The sequence involves adding a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivator, complicating subsequent reactions.
   - **Option B**: Starts with tert-butyl addition, followed by nitration and reduction. However, the sequence includes multiple nitration steps, which is inconsistent with the target having only one nitro group.
   - **Option C**: Begins with tert-butyl addition, followed by sulfonation and nitration. The sequence appears overly complex and does not clearly align with the target structure.
   - **Option D**: Starts with nitration, followed by reduction and tert-butyl addition. However, the sequence includes multiple nitration steps, leading to more than one nitro group, which contradicts the target structure.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating the options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the target structure. However, based on the plausibility of the steps and the reasoning provided, **Option D** is selected as the most likely answer, despite some inconsistencies.
