Okay, so I have this astronomy question to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. 

Hmm, the key here is to figure out the apparent V magnitudes of each star because each spectrograph has a different brightness limit for the stars they can observe. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, which means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V mag ≤16.

Wait, wait. The question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. Oh, wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its apparent magnitude is less than or equal to 17. Because, for example, a 1st magnitude star is brighter than a 6th. So the limit is m ≤17 for ESPRESSO and m ≤16 for HIRES. 

So each star must have an apparent V magnitude that is ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES) to be detectable by both? No, wait, no. Wait, the question says which can be detected with both. So both spectrographs must be able to observe the same star. So the star's apparent V mag must be ≤17 (so ESPRESSO can see it), and also ≤16 (so HIRES can see it). Because if it's brighter than 16, HIRES can't see it. So the apparent V magnitude has to be ≤16. Because if it's brighter than 16 (like 16.5), HIRES can't see it because the limit is 16.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So if a star is 17 mag, it's exactly at the limit—maybe ESPRESSO can observe it. But what's the exact phrasing? "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star is 17 mag or brighter (i.e., having a lower apparent magnitude value), can ESPRESSO observe it? Because "brighter than 17" would mean m <17, but sometimes magnitude scales are confusing. For example, if a star is 17.0 mag, it's at the limit. So, according to the problem statement, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, which probably means m ≤17.

Wait, no. If a star is brighter (has a lower apparent magnitude) than 17, then m is less than 17. So the limit is m ≤17 for ESPRESSO. For HIRES, it's m ≤16.

So to be detected by both, the star's apparent V magnitude has to be ≤17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and ≤16 (so HIRES can see it). So the star's apparent V must be ≤16. Because that's the more restrictive condition.

Wait, but let me double-check. If a star's apparent magnitude is 16.5, then HIRES can't observe it (since its limit is 16), but ESPRESSO can (since 16.5 <17). So a star with apparent mag 16.5 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES. But we're looking for stars that can be detected by both. So the star's apparent V must be ≤16.

But wait, some stars may have their apparent magnitudes affected by extinction due to dust. For example, Star3 and Star4 have E(B-V) given. So I need to correct those for extinction to get their true apparent magnitudes.

The problem statement says that the total absorption in the V band is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. I think that refers to A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So the observed (apparent) magnitude is the intrinsic magnitude plus the extinction (distance modulus plus extinction). So the formula for a star's apparent magnitude considering extinction is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V, where M is the absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs, and A_V is the extinction in V band.

Wait, no. Let's think about this. The observed apparent magnitude m is equal to the star's true apparent magnitude (without extinction) plus the extinction A_V. Because extinction makes the star appear dimmer, so m = m_true + A_V. Alternatively, the formula is m = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V because the true apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be M + 5 log (d/10), and then we add A_V for extinction.

Wait, no. Let me recall the distance modulus. The intrinsic (absolute) magnitude M relates to the apparent magnitude m via m = M + 5 log (d) -5. Because m = M + 5 log (d/10) → d is in parsecs. So when you have extinction, the observed m is m_obs = m_true + A_V. So m_obs = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V.

So for each star, I can compute m_obs. Let's go through each star.

Star1: RA=15 deg, DEC=-75, M=15.5, d=10 pc.

Compute m = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V.

Wait, but Star1's absolute V is given as 15.5. Its distance is 10 pc. So:

distance modulus: 5 log (10/10) = 5 log(1) = 0. So m_true = M + 0 =15.5.

What about extinction? Star1 has no E(B-V) given, so A_V is 0. So m_obs =15.5 + 0=15.5.

So Star1's apparent V mag is 15.5. Which is ≤16, so HIRES can see it. Also, 15.5 ≤17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So Star1 is detectable by both.

Wait, but the question is about being detected by both. So Star1 would be a candidate.

Star2: RA=30, DEC=55, m_v=16.5, d=5 pc.

Wait, Star2's apparent V is given as 16.5. So we don't need to calculate it; it's already given. So its m_obs is 16.5.

But what about extinction? Star2 has no E(B-V) given, so no extinction. So m_obs is 16.5.

HIRES can observe stars with m ≤16. So 16.5 is higher than 16 → HIRES can't observe it. But ESPRESSO can (since 16.5 ≤17). So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

So Star2 is out.

Star3: RA=11h, DEC=48, m_v=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, d=15 pc.

Wait, wait, no: the question says Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5, but also E(B-V)=0.6. Wait, but in the problem statement, when it says "apparent V magnitude" for Star2, that's the observed magnitude. For Star3, the apparent V magnitude of 15.5 is before extinction? No, no, I think the way it's written is that Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but it has E(B-V)=0.6. So how does that affect it? Wait, no. Let me read the description again.

Star3: apparent V mag of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6, located at 15 pc. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to E(B-V) with coefficient 3.1.

Wait, so the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, but the extinction is 3.1 * E(B-V)=3.1 * 0.6=1.86. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_V =15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But wait, no. Let me think.

Wait no, m_observed is the apparent magnitude after extinction. So the formula is m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_V. So m_intrinsic = m_obs - A_V.

So if Star3's observed m is 15.5, but A_V is 1.86, then m_intrinsic would be 15.5 - 1.86 =13.64.

But why would we need the intrinsic magnitude? Because perhaps the question is about the absolute magnitude? No, the problem is about apparent magnitude for detectability.

Wait, but the key is whether the observed apparent magnitude (m_obs) is ≤16 for HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO.

Wait, Star3's m_obs is 15.5. So it's within both limits. So HIRES can see it, and ESPRESSO can. So Star3 is a candidate.

Wait, but let me make sure. Wait, the way the problem is presented, Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6, so the observed magnitude is 15.5. Or is the 15.5 the intrinsic? No, the problem states Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5 and E(B-V) = 0.6. So the observed magnitude is 15.5, but the intrinsic would be 15.5 - 1.86 =13.64. But for the purpose of the question, since the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, which is observed, that's what matters.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Because sometimes, when you're given a star's intrinsic properties and distance, you calculate the apparent magnitude. But in the case of Star3, it's given the apparent magnitude. So perhaps the E(B-V) is a red herring because for the purpose of detectability, the observed magnitude is what matters. So if Star3's observed m is 15.5, it's within both limits.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but the E(B-V) is given. How does that affect the observed magnitude? Because sometimes, the extinction would affect the apparent magnitude.

Wait, no. If the star's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, that's the observed magnitude, so it already includes the extinction. So we don't need to adjust it. So Star3's m is 15.5, which is ≤16 and ≤17 → detectable by both.

Star4: RA=85, DEC=-48, absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, d=10 pc.

So Star4's M is 15.5, distance d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=3.1 * 0.4=1.24.

So compute m_obs = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V.

M is 15.5, d=10 → 5 log(10/10)=0. So m_true (without extinction) would be 15.5 + 0 =15.5.

But wait, no, the formula is m_obs = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V.

Wait, no. The formula is m_obs = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V.

So M + 5 log (10/10) is 15.5 + 0 =15.5. Then add A_V, which is 1.24. So m_obs=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So Star4's observed apparent V magnitude is 16.74.

So what's the limit for each spectrograph? ESPRESSO: m ≤17 → 16.74 is okay. HIRES: m ≤16 → 16.74 >16. So HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Star5: RA=10h, DEC=60, absolute V mag 16.5, d=5 pc.

Compute m_obs = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V.

M=16.5, d=5 → 5 log (5/10)=5 log (0.5)=5*(-0.3010)= -1.505.

So m_true (without extinction) is 16.5 -1.505 =14.995.

Assuming no extinction (E(B-V) not given for Star5), so A_V=0.

So m_obs =14.995 +0=15.0. So m is about 15.0.

Which is ≤16 and ≤17. So both spectrographs can see it. So Star5 is a candidate.

Wait, but let me double-check: M=16.5, d=5.

Distance modulus is 5*log(5/10) → 5 * log(0.5)=5*(-0.3010)= -1.505. So m_true =16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995. So m_obs=14.995, which is ~15.0. So yes, within both.

So now, let's list each star's detectability:

- Star1: m=15.5 → can be detected by both.
- Star2: m=16.5 → detected by ESPRESSO only.
- Star3: m=15.5 → both.
- Star4: m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.
- Star5: m=15.0 → both.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → but Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5 → yes, both can be detected by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be detected by HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

Wait, but Star1's m is 15.5, which is within HIRES' limit (≤16). So Star1 can be detected by both.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of the options include Star1. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 m=16.74, which is above HIRES limit.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 m=16.5, so HIRES can't.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So the correct answer would be B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait Star1: m=15.5. So why it's not an option? Let's see the options again.

The options are:

A) 4 and5 → no.

B)3 and5 → yes.

C)2 and3 → no.

D)1 and4 → Star4 can't.

Wait, but the question is, which stars can be detected with both spectrographs? So Star1 can be as well. But in the options, only B includes two stars that can be detected by both. So why isn't Star1 an option?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Star1's m.

Wait, Star1's data: absolute V mag M=15.5, distance d=10 pc.

So m_true = M + 5 log (d/10) =15.5 +0=15.5. And E(B-V) is zero, so m_obs =15.5.

So yes, m=15.5. Both spectrographs can detect it. So why is it not in any of the options except D?

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is Star1 and Star4. But Star4's m is 16.74 which is above HIRES limit. So Star4 can't be detected by both. So option D is incorrect.

So why isn't Star1 included in any of the options except D, which is incorrect? So what's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check the question again.

Question: Which of the following stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO spectrograph and the HIRES spectrograph?

So both spectrographs need to detect the same star.

So the stars are:

Star1: m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star3: m=15.5 → both can.

Star5: m=15.0 → both can.

So the possible candidates are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

So the options should have combinations of these. But the options given are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → no.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can, so this is correct.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't.

So the correct answer is B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait, I thought Star1 could as well. But the question's options don't include any option with Star1 and another. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Star1's m.

Wait, no. Star1's m=15.5 is correct. So why isn't it part of an option?

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D is Star1 and Star4. But Star4's m is 16.74, so it's not detectable by HIRES.

So the correct stars are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But the options only include B: 3 and5; and D: 1 and4 (which is incorrect). So the only correct combination is B.

So the answer should be B.

To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both spectrographs. Additionally, extinction (A_V) must be considered for stars with given E(B-V) values, using the relation \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) \).

### Analysis of Each Star:
1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), no extinction (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \) (HIRES limit) and \( m = 15.5 \leq 17 \) (ESPRESSO limit).  
   - **Detectable by both spectrographs.**

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \), no extinction (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).  
   - \( m = 16.5 > 16 \) (HIRES limit) but \( m = 16.5 \leq 17 \) (ESPRESSO limit).  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Extinction:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86
     \]  
   - The apparent magnitude already accounts for extinction, so \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \) (HIRES limit) and \( m = 15.5 \leq 17 \) (ESPRESSO limit).  
   - **Detectable by both spectrographs.**

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).  
   - Extinction:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) + A_V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - \( m = 16.74 > 16 \) (HIRES limit) but \( m = 16.74 \leq 17 \) (ESPRESSO limit).  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \), no extinction (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.0 \leq 16 \) (HIRES limit) and \( m = 15.0 \leq 17 \) (ESPRESSO limit).  
   - **Detectable by both spectrographs.**

### Conclusion:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**. Among the given options, only **Star3 and Star5** satisfy the criteria for both spectrographs.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I have this astronomy question to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. 

Hmm, the key here is to figure out the apparent V magnitudes of each star because each spectrograph has a different brightness limit for the stars they can observe. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, which means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V mag ≤16.

Wait, wait. The question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. Oh, wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its apparent magnitude is less than or equal to 17. Because, for example, a 1st magnitude star is brighter than a 6th. So the limit is m ≤17 for ESPRESSO and m ≤16 for HIRES. 

So each star must have an apparent V magnitude that is ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES) to be detectable by both? No, wait, no. Wait, the question says which can be detected with both. So both spectrographs must be able to observe the same star. So the star's apparent V mag must be ≤17 (so ESPRESSO can see it), and also ≤16 (so HIRES can see it). Because if it's brighter than 16, HIRES can't see it. So the apparent V magnitude has to be ≤16. Because if it's brighter than 16 (like 16.5), HIRES can't see it because the limit is 16.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So if a star is 17 mag, it's exactly at the limit—maybe ESPRESSO can observe it. But what's the exact phrasing? "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star is 17 mag or brighter (i.e., having a lower apparent magnitude value), can ESPRESSO observe it? Because "brighter than 17" would mean m <17, but sometimes magnitude scales are confusing. For example, if a star is 17.0 mag, it's at the limit. So, according to the problem statement, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, which probably means m ≤17.

Wait, no. If a star is brighter (has a lower apparent magnitude) than 17, then m is less than 17. So the limit is m ≤17 for ESPRESSO. For HIRES, it's m ≤16.

So to be detected by both, the star's apparent V magnitude has to be ≤17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and ≤16 (so HIRES can see it). So the star's apparent V must be ≤16. Because that's the more restrictive condition.

Wait, but let me double-check. If a star's apparent magnitude is 16.5, then HIRES can't observe it (since its limit is 16), but ESPRESSO can (since 16.5 <17). So a star with apparent mag 16.5 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES. But we're looking for stars that can be detected by both. So the star's apparent V must be ≤16.

But wait, some stars may have their apparent magnitudes affected by extinction due to dust. For example, Star3 and Star4 have E(B-V) given. So I need to correct those for extinction to get their true apparent magnitudes.

The problem statement says that the total absorption in the V band is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. I think that refers to A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So the observed (apparent) magnitude is the intrinsic magnitude plus the extinction (distance modulus plus extinction). So the formula for a star's apparent magnitude considering extinction is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V, where M is the absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs, and A_V is the extinction in V band.

Wait, no. Let's think about this. The observed apparent magnitude m is equal to the star's true apparent magnitude (without extinction) plus the extinction A_V. Because extinction makes the star appear dimmer, so m = m_true + A_V. Alternatively, the formula is m = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V because the true apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be M + 5 log (d/10), and then we add A_V for extinction.

Wait, no. Let me recall the distance modulus. The intrinsic (absolute) magnitude M relates to the apparent magnitude m via m = M + 5 log (d) -5. Because m = M + 5 log (d/10) → d is in parsecs. So when you have extinction, the observed m is m_obs = m_true + A_V. So m_obs = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V.

So for each star, I can compute m_obs. Let's go through each star.

Star1: RA=15 deg, DEC=-75, M=15.5, d=10 pc.

Compute m = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V.

Wait, but Star1's absolute V is given as 15.5. Its distance is 10 pc. So:

distance modulus: 5 log (10/10) = 5 log(1) = 0. So m_true = M + 0 =15.5.

What about extinction? Star1 has no E(B-V) given, so A_V is 0. So m_obs =15.5 + 0=15.5.

So Star1's apparent V mag is 15.5. Which is ≤16, so HIRES can see it. Also, 15.5 ≤17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So Star1 is detectable by both.

Wait, but the question is about being detected by both. So Star1 would be a candidate.

Star2: RA=30, DEC=55, m_v=16.5, d=5 pc.

Wait, Star2's apparent V is given as 16.5. So we don't need to calculate it; it's already given. So its m_obs is 16.5.

But what about extinction? Star2 has no E(B-V) given, so no extinction. So m_obs is 16.5.

HIRES can observe stars with m ≤16. So 16.5 is higher than 16 → HIRES can't observe it. But ESPRESSO can (since 16.5 ≤17). So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

So Star2 is out.

Star3: RA=11h, DEC=48, m_v=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, d=15 pc.

Wait, wait, no: the question says Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5, but also E(B-V)=0.6. Wait, but in the problem statement, when it says "apparent V magnitude" for Star2, that's the observed magnitude. For Star3, the apparent V magnitude of 15.5 is before extinction? No, no, I think the way it's written is that Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but it has E(B-V)=0.6. So how does that affect it? Wait, no. Let me read the description again.

Star3: apparent V mag of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6, located at 15 pc. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to E(B-V) with coefficient 3.1.

Wait, so the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, but the extinction is 3.1 * E(B-V)=3.1 * 0.6=1.86. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_V =15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But wait, no. Let me think.

Wait no, m_observed is the apparent magnitude after extinction. So the formula is m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_V. So m_intrinsic = m_obs - A_V.

So if Star3's observed m is 15.5, but A_V is 1.86, then m_intrinsic would be 15.5 - 1.86 =13.64.

But why would we need the intrinsic magnitude? Because perhaps the question is about the absolute magnitude? No, the problem is about apparent magnitude for detectability.

Wait, but the key is whether the observed apparent magnitude (m_obs) is ≤16 for HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO.

Wait, Star3's m_obs is 15.5. So it's within both limits. So HIRES can see it, and ESPRESSO can. So Star3 is a candidate.

Wait, but let me make sure. Wait, the way the problem is presented, Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6, so the observed magnitude is 15.5. Or is the 15.5 the intrinsic? No, the problem states Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5 and E(B-V) = 0.6. So the observed magnitude is 15.5, but the intrinsic would be 15.5 - 1.86 =13.64. But for the purpose of the question, since the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, which is observed, that's what matters.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Because sometimes, when you're given a star's intrinsic properties and distance, you calculate the apparent magnitude. But in the case of Star3, it's given the apparent magnitude. So perhaps the E(B-V) is a red herring because for the purpose of detectability, the observed magnitude is what matters. So if Star3's observed m is 15.5, it's within both limits.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but the E(B-V) is given. How does that affect the observed magnitude? Because sometimes, the extinction would affect the apparent magnitude.

Wait, no. If the star's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, that's the observed magnitude, so it already includes the extinction. So we don't need to adjust it. So Star3's m is 15.5, which is ≤16 and ≤17 → detectable by both.

Star4: RA=85, DEC=-48, absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, d=10 pc.

So Star4's M is 15.5, distance d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=3.1 * 0.4=1.24.

So compute m_obs = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V.

M is 15.5, d=10 → 5 log(10/10)=0. So m_true (without extinction) would be 15.5 + 0 =15.5.

But wait, no, the formula is m_obs = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V.

Wait, no. The formula is m_obs = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V.

So M + 5 log (10/10) is 15.5 + 0 =15.5. Then add A_V, which is 1.24. So m_obs=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So Star4's observed apparent V magnitude is 16.74.

So what's the limit for each spectrograph? ESPRESSO: m ≤17 → 16.74 is okay. HIRES: m ≤16 → 16.74 >16. So HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Star5: RA=10h, DEC=60, absolute V mag 16.5, d=5 pc.

Compute m_obs = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V.

M=16.5, d=5 → 5 log (5/10)=5 log (0.5)=5*(-0.3010)= -1.505.

So m_true (without extinction) is 16.5 -1.505 =14.995.

Assuming no extinction (E(B-V) not given for Star5), so A_V=0.

So m_obs =14.995 +0=15.0. So m is about 15.0.

Which is ≤16 and ≤17. So both spectrographs can see it. So Star5 is a candidate.

Wait, but let me double-check: M=16.5, d=5.

Distance modulus is 5*log(5/10) → 5 * log(0.5)=5*(-0.3010)= -1.505. So m_true =16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995. So m_obs=14.995, which is ~15.0. So yes, within both.

So now, let's list each star's detectability:

- Star1: m=15.5 → can be detected by both.
- Star2: m=16.5 → detected by ESPRESSO only.
- Star3: m=15.5 → both.
- Star4: m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.
- Star5: m=15.0 → both.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → but Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5 → yes, both can be detected by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be detected by HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

Wait, but Star1's m is 15.5, which is within HIRES' limit (≤16). So Star1 can be detected by both.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of the options include Star1. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 m=16.74, which is above HIRES limit.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 m=16.5, so HIRES can't.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So the correct answer would be B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait Star1: m=15.5. So why it's not an option? Let's see the options again.

The options are:

A) 4 and5 → no.

B)3 and5 → yes.

C)2 and3 → no.

D)1 and4 → Star4 can't.

Wait, but the question is, which stars can be detected with both spectrographs? So Star1 can be as well. But in the options, only B includes two stars that can be detected by both. So why isn't Star1 an option?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Star1's m.

Wait, Star1's data: absolute V mag M=15.5, distance d=10 pc.

So m_true = M + 5 log (d/10) =15.5 +0=15.5. And E(B-V) is zero, so m_obs =15.5.

So yes, m=15.5. Both spectrographs can detect it. So why is it not in any of the options except D?

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is Star1 and Star4. But Star4's m is 16.74 which is above HIRES limit. So Star4 can't be detected by both. So option D is incorrect.

So why isn't Star1 included in any of the options except D, which is incorrect? So what's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check the question again.

Question: Which of the following stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO spectrograph and the HIRES spectrograph?

So both spectrographs need to detect the same star.

So the stars are:

Star1: m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star3: m=15.5 → both can.

Star5: m=15.0 → both can.

So the possible candidates are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

So the options should have combinations of these. But the options given are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → no.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can, so this is correct.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't.

So the correct answer is B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait, I thought Star1 could as well. But the question's options don't include any option with Star1 and another. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Star1's m.

Wait, no. Star1's m=15.5 is correct. So why isn't it part of an option?

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D is Star1 and Star4. But Star4's m is 16.74, so it's not detectable by HIRES.

So the correct stars are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But the options only include B: 3 and5; and D: 1 and4 (which is incorrect). So the only correct combination is B.

So the answer should be B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both spectrographs. Additionally, extinction (A_V) must be considered for stars with given E(B-V) values, using the relation \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) \).

### Analysis of Each Star:
1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), no extinction (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \) (HIRES limit) and \( m = 15.5 \leq 17 \) (ESPRESSO limit).  
   - **Detectable by both spectrographs.**

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \), no extinction (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).  
   - \( m = 16.5 > 16 \) (HIRES limit) but \( m = 16.5 \leq 17 \) (ESPRESSO limit).  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Extinction:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86
     \]  
   - The apparent magnitude already accounts for extinction, so \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \) (HIRES limit) and \( m = 15.5 \leq 17 \) (ESPRESSO limit).  
   - **Detectable by both spectrographs.**

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).  
   - Extinction:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) + A_V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - \( m = 16.74 > 16 \) (HIRES limit) but \( m = 16.74 \leq 17 \) (ESPRESSO limit).  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \), no extinction (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.0 \leq 16 \) (HIRES limit) and \( m = 15.0 \leq 17 \) (ESPRESSO limit).  
   - **Detectable by both spectrographs.**

### Conclusion:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**. Among the given options, only **Star3 and Star5** satisfy the criteria for both spectrographs.

**Answer: B**
