Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question here. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question says: Assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. How does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx? And the options are A to D, each with a different power of 1/plx.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax angle (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So as parallax increases, the distance decreases.

Now, the stars are uniformly distributed. That probably means that the number density of stars in space is constant. So the same number of stars exist in a given volume, regardless of where you are in the universe within that distribution.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So it's like, for a range of plx values, how many stars do you count?

Let me think about how the number of stars depends on distance. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume dV is proportional to dV. But dV in 3D space is something like 4πd² dd, where d is the distance (the radius), because the volume of a spherical shell is surface area times thickness. So the number of stars in a shell between d and d+dd is proportional to d² dd.

But the question is about parallax. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So maybe I can rewrite d in terms of plx.

So, the number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to d² dd. But dd is the thickness in distance. How does that translate to a change in parallax?

Let me think. If plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So if plx changes by a small amount dplx, the corresponding dd is the change in distance. Let's compute dd in terms of dplx.

Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because plx is inversely proportional to d, so if plx increases by dplx, d decreases by (d (d plx)/d plx) = d = 1/plx, so the derivative is -1/plx². So, dd = - (d plx) / (plx²) ) = -d plx / plx² = - d/(plx²) dplx. Wait, perhaps it's better to relate the two differentials.

So, plx = 1/d ⇒ d = 1/plx.

Take the derivative of both sides with respect to plx:

dd/dplx = -1/(plx²) ⇒ dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

But since d is positive, and plx is positive, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But for the purpose of counting the number of stars, the absolute values matter.

So, the number of stars in a shell with parallax plx is proportional to d² dd. Substituting d=1/plx and dd= - (1/plx²) dplx,

Number of stars = ( (1/plx)^2 ) * ( 1/plx² dplx )

Wait, wait. Because the number of stars in a shell is proportional to d^2 dd. So substituting:

N ∝ d² * |dd|.

So,

N = k * d² * |dd|

Substitute d = 1/plx, and |dd| = (1/plx²) dplx.

So,

N = k * ( (1/plx)^2 ) * (1/plx²) dplx )

= k * (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, for a small change in plx (dplx), the number of stars is N = k * (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars per unit plx (dplx=1) would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but let me think again. The number of stars per unit plx is N/(dplx) = k * (1/plx^4).

So, the number of stars per unit range of plx decreases as plx increases, following 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the options are about how the number changes with plx. So the number is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking back at the options: option A is ~1/plx^4. So the correct answer should be A.

But wait, let me make sure. Another approach: the volume around the Earth at a certain distance d is a sphere of radius d. But when considering a thin shell between d and d+dd, the volume is 4πd² dd.

Since the number of stars is uniform in space, the number per unit volume is a constant, say n. So the number of stars in that shell is N = n * 4π d² dd.

But we're looking at how many stars are in a certain range of plx. So, plx = 1/d ⇒ d = 1/plx.

So, substituting into N, we have:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd)

But what is dd in terms of dplx? Let's see, d = 1/plx ⇒ dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, taking absolute value, |dd| = (1/plx²) dplx.

So, N = n *4π * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx²) dplx )

= n *4π * (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars in a small range of plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4 * dplx.

So, the number per unit plx (dplx=1) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Hence, the correct answer is option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density of stars is constant.

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell of radius \( d \) and thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume becomes \( 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left|dd\right| \). To express \( dd \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \), we use the relationship \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \), where \( d\text{plx} \) is the small change in parallax.

Substituting \( dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) (ignoring the negative sign for simplicity), the number of stars in a shell is:

\[
N \propto \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot d\text{plx}.
\]

Simplifying, this becomes:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \cdot d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of parallax is obtained by dividing \( N \) by \( d\text{plx} \), resulting in:

\[
\text{Number of stars per unit plx} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**

N = k * d² * |dd|

Substitute d = 1/plx, and |dd| = (1/plx²) dplx.

So,

N = k * ( (1/plx)^2 ) * (1/plx²) dplx )

= k * (1/plx^4) dplx.

= n *4π * (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars in a small range of plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4 * dplx.

So, the number per unit plx (dplx=1) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Hence, the correct answer is option A.
