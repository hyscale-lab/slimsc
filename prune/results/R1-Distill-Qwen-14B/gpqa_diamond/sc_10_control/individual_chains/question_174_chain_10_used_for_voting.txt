Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, okay, let me try to break it down step by step.

So the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Oh, right, rest-mass energy is given by E=mc², but since we're dealing with energy here, I don't need to worry about the actual mass values maybe. 

Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. Wait, so if the masses are in a 2:1 ratio, the more massive one is 2/3 of the total, and the lighter one is 1/3? Or wait, no. Because the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Oh wait, the initial nucleus has mass M, right? No, wait, in terms of rest mass. So the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. Then after fission, the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99*M. So each fragment has a rest mass, and their sum is 99% of the original.

Wait, the question says the sum is 99% of the initial mass M. So if the initial mass is M, the two fragments have masses m1 and m2, such that m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Also, one fragment is twice as massive as the other, so m1 = 2 m2.

So substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the sum equation: 2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M, and m1 = 0.66 M. So the heavier fragment is 0.66 M, and the lighter is 0.33 M.

The problem asks for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. But it's the difference between the correct relativistic calculation and the classical approximation. So I need to compute T1 relativistically and then subtract the classical T1.

Wait, but the nucleus was at rest initially, so the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. 

So in the center-of-momentum frame, they have equal and opposite velocities. But since they have different masses, their speeds would be different. But in the lab frame (which is the initial rest frame), their momenta must cancel out.

I think I should use conservation of energy and momentum here. Let me try to model this.

First, the initial energy is the rest mass energy of M: 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies. So:

Initial energy = 300 GeV = (m1 c² + m2 c²) + (T1 + T2)

But since m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, their rest energy is 0.99 M c². Wait, but M c² is 300 GeV, so m1 + m2 is 0.99 * M → 0.99 * (300 GeV) = 297 GeV. So:

300 GeV = 297 GeV + (T1 + T2) → T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Hmm, because 300 - 297 is 3 GeV.

Now, using conservation of momentum. The initial momentum is zero, so the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So:

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1
p2 = gamma2 m2 v2

And p1 = -p2 → gamma1 m1 v1 = - gamma2 m2 v2.

But since they move in opposite directions, their velocities are opposite. So maybe I can take magnitudes and say gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, using relativistic energy-momentum relations.

Each fragment's total energy is E1 = (m1 c²) gamma1, and E2 = (m2 c²) gamma2.

Also, the momentum p1 = gamma1 m1 v1 = (gamma1 m1 c) (v1/c) = (gamma1 m1 c) β1, where β = v/c.

Similarly, p2 = gamma2 m2 beta2 c.

But since p1 = -p2, their magnitudes are equal: |p1| = |p2| → gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

Hmm, maybe it's easier to write in terms of energy.

We have the total energy after fission: E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Also, the momenta are equal in magnitude: |p1| = |p2|.

So let's write the relativistic energies and momenta.

E1² = (m1 c²)² + (p1 c)²
E2² = (m2 c²)² + (p2 c)²

But since p1 c = p2 c (in magnitude), let's denote p c as a variable, say, p^2 c² = (E1² - (m1 c²)^2) = (E2^2 - (m2 c²)^2).

So,

E1² - (m1 c²)^2 = E2^2 - (m2 c²)^2.

So,

E1² - E2^2 = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

But E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Hmm, can I write E1 = (300 GeV) + E2? No, wait: E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Wait, E1 is the energy of the first fragment. Wait, the initial energy is 300 GeV, so that's E_initial = E1 + E2.

So, yes, E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So let me let E1 = 300 - E2.

Substituting into the equation from the momenta:

(300 - E2)^2 - E2^2 = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

Expand the left side:

(300^2 - 2*300*E2 + E2^2) - E2^2 = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

Simplify:

300^2 - 600 E2 = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

Now, compute m1 and m2 in terms of M.

We have m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

So m1^2 - m2^2 = (0.66 M)^2 - (0.33 M)^2 = (0.4356 M²) - (0.1089 M²) = 0.3267 M².

So the right side becomes 0.3267 M² c^4.

But M c² is given as 300 GeV. So M² c^4 is (300 GeV)^2 / c² * c^4 → Wait, maybe better to manipulate units.

Wait, M c² is 300 GeV. So M² c^4 = (300 GeV)^2.

So,

Right side: 0.3267 * (300 GeV)^2.

Putting it back into the equation:

300^2 GeV^2 - 600 E2 GeV = 0.3267 * 300^2 GeV^2.

Let me compute the numbers.

300^2 is 90,000 GeV².

So,

90,000 GeV² - 600 E2 GeV = 0.3267 * 90,000 GeV².

0.3267 * 90,000 ≈ Let me compute that.

90,000 * 0.3267 = 90,000 * 0.3 = 27,000; 90,000 * 0.0267 ≈ 2,403 → total ≈ 29,403 GeV².

So,

90,000 - 600 E2 = 29,403.

Subtract 29,403 from both sides:

90,000 - 29,403 = 600 E2 → 60,597 = 600 E2.

So E2 = 60,597 / 600 → approximately 100.995 GeV.

Wait, 60,597 divided by 600: 600 * 100 = 60,000; 60,597 - 60,000 = 597 → 597 /600 = 0.995. So E2 ≈ 100.995 GeV.

So E1 = 300 - 100.995 → 199.005 GeV.

Wait, but I think I might have messed up the units somewhere. Let me check.

Wait, M c² is 300 GeV, so m1 c² is 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV. Similarly, m2 c² is 99 GeV.

So E1 is the total energy of the first fragment, which is 199.005 GeV. Its rest energy is 198 GeV. So the kinetic energy T1 is E1 - m1 c² = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV.

Similarly, E2 is ~100.995 GeV, which is m2 c² (99 GeV) plus T2, so T2 is about 1.995 GeV.

Wait, but the sum of T1 and T2 was supposed to be 3 GeV (from 300 - 297 = 3). Let me check: 1.005 + 1.995 ≈ 3 GeV. Yep, that adds up.

Now, the question is about the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1. So I need to calculate the classical (non-relativistic) approximation of T1 and then find the difference.

In the classical approach, we assume velocities are low, so kinetic energy is (1/2) m v², and momentum is m v.

So, let's model the classical scenario.

The initial momentum is zero, so the two fragments' momenta must be equal and opposite. So, m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Wait, but in the classical case, since m1 > m2, the velocities will be in opposite directions, with the lighter fragment moving faster.

But since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero, so m1 v1 = - m2 v2. So, m1 v1 = - m2 (-v2) → m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Wait, so if the heavier fragment has velocity v, the lighter one has velocity (m1/m2) v, but in the opposite direction. Hmm, no, wait: Let me think.

Wait, m1 v1 = - m2 v2. So, v2 = -(m1/m2) v1.

But since m1 is twice m2, m1 = 2 m2.

So, v2 = -(2 m2 / m2) v1 = -2 v1.

So the lighter fragment's speed is twice that of the heavy fragment, in the opposite direction.

Now, using conservation of energy.

The initial kinetic energy is zero, as the nucleus is at rest.

After fission, the total kinetic energy is (1/2) m1 v1² + (1/2) m2 v2².

But wait, v2 is -2 v1, so:

KE_total = (1/2) m1 v1² + (1/2) m2 (4 v1²) ) = (1/2)(m1 + 4 m2) v1².

But m1 = 2 m2, so:

KE_total = (1/2)(2 m2 + 4 m2) v1² = (1/2)(6 m2) v1² = 3 m2 v1².

But the total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energy.

Wait, in the classical case, the rest mass energies are considered as part of the initial energy? Hmm, maybe in the non-relativistic case, the rest mass energy is considered fixed, and the kinetic energy comes from the splitting.

Wait, but the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the sum of the rest energies is 0.99 M c², which is 297 GeV, as before. So the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, same as in the relativistic case.

So in the classical approach, KE_total = 3 GeV.

So,

3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV.

But m2 = 0.33 M, and M c² is 300 GeV. So m2 c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.

So m2 = 99 GeV / c².

Wait, but in the classical approximation, we might be using non-relativistic equations, so perhaps we can express m2 in terms of GeV/c² directly.

Wait, solving for v1², let's see.

3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV → m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

But m2 is 99 GeV/c². So,

(99 GeV/c²) * v1² = 1 GeV → v1² = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c²) ) → v1² = (1/99) c² → v1 = c * sqrt(1/99) ≈ (0.1 c), since sqrt(1/99) is about 0.1005.

But wait, in the classical approach, I'm assuming velocities are non-relativistic, so v1 is much less than c. But in this case, v1 is about 0.1 c, which is 30,000 km/s, which is quite high. So the classical approximation might not be very accurate here.

Hmm, but let's proceed.

The kinetic energy of the heavy fragment is (1/2) m1 v1².

But m1 is 198 GeV/c².

So,

T1_classical = (1/2) * (198 GeV/c²) * v1².

We know from earlier, m2 v1² = 1 GeV → v1² = 1 GeV / (99 GeV/c²) ) = c² / 99.

So,

T1_classical = (1/2) * (198 GeV/c²) * (c² / 99 ) → (1/2) * (198 /99) GeV → (1/2) * 2 GeV → 1 GeV.

So the classical T1 is 1 GeV. The correct relativistic T1 is approximately 1.005 GeV. So the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Wait, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV.

So the correct T1 is about 1.005 GeV, and the classical is 1 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, in the relativistic case, I found T1 to be approximately 1.005 GeV. The classical calculation gave T1_classical as 1 GeV. So the difference is 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. So the correct answer is 5 MeV.

Looking at the options, option B is 5 MeV.

To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process using both relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) approximations.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Rest-Mass Energy**: The atomic nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.
2. **Fission Products**: The nucleus splits into two fragments with a mass ratio of 2:1. The total rest mass of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass, i.e., \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \).
   - From the mass ratio \( m_1 = 2m_2 \), we find:
     \[
     m_1 = 0.66M, \quad m_2 = 0.33M.
     \]
3. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies of the fragments and their kinetic energies:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{rest},1} + E_{\text{rest},2} + T_1 + T_2.
   \]
   Substituting \( E_{\text{initial}} = 300 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E_{\text{rest},1} + E_{\text{rest},2} = 0.99 \times 300 = 297 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:
   \[
   T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

### Relativistic Calculation:
Using conservation of momentum and energy, the relativistic kinetic energy of the heavier fragment (\( T_1 \)) is calculated to be approximately:
\[
T_1 \approx 1.005 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Classical Approximation:
In the classical (non-relativistic) approximation, the kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is derived using the relations:
\[
m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2, \quad T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
From these, the classical kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is:
\[
T_1^{\text{classical}} = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Classical Values:
The difference between the relativistic and classical values of \( T_1 \) is:
\[
\Delta T_1 = T_1 - T_1^{\text{classical}} = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The difference between the correct relativistic value of \( T_1 \) and the classical approximation is **5 MeV**.

Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, okay, let me try to break it down step by step.

So the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Oh, right, rest-mass energy is given by E=mc², but since we're dealing with energy here, I don't need to worry about the actual mass values maybe. 

Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. Wait, so if the masses are in a 2:1 ratio, the more massive one is 2/3 of the total, and the lighter one is 1/3? Or wait, no. Because the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Oh wait, the initial nucleus has mass M, right? No, wait, in terms of rest mass. So the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. Then after fission, the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99*M. So each fragment has a rest mass, and their sum is 99% of the original.

Wait, the question says the sum is 99% of the initial mass M. So if the initial mass is M, the two fragments have masses m1 and m2, such that m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Also, one fragment is twice as massive as the other, so m1 = 2 m2.

So substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the sum equation: 2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M, and m1 = 0.66 M. So the heavier fragment is 0.66 M, and the lighter is 0.33 M.

The problem asks for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. But it's the difference between the correct relativistic calculation and the classical approximation. So I need to compute T1 relativistically and then subtract the classical T1.

Wait, but the nucleus was at rest initially, so the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. 

So in the center-of-momentum frame, they have equal and opposite velocities. But since they have different masses, their speeds would be different. But in the lab frame (which is the initial rest frame), their momenta must cancel out.

I think I should use conservation of energy and momentum here. Let me try to model this.

First, the initial energy is the rest mass energy of M: 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies. So:

Initial energy = 300 GeV = (m1 c² + m2 c²) + (T1 + T2)

But since m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, their rest energy is 0.99 M c². Wait, but M c² is 300 GeV, so m1 + m2 is 0.99 * M → 0.99 * (300 GeV) = 297 GeV. So:

300 GeV = 297 GeV + (T1 + T2) → T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Hmm, because 300 - 297 is 3 GeV.

Now, using conservation of momentum. The initial momentum is zero, so the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So:

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1
p2 = gamma2 m2 v2

And p1 = -p2 → gamma1 m1 v1 = - gamma2 m2 v2.

But since they move in opposite directions, their velocities are opposite. So maybe I can take magnitudes and say gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, using relativistic energy-momentum relations.

Each fragment's total energy is E1 = (m1 c²) gamma1, and E2 = (m2 c²) gamma2.

Also, the momentum p1 = gamma1 m1 v1 = (gamma1 m1 c) (v1/c) = (gamma1 m1 c) β1, where β = v/c.

Similarly, p2 = gamma2 m2 beta2 c.

But since p1 = -p2, their magnitudes are equal: |p1| = |p2| → gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

Hmm, maybe it's easier to write in terms of energy.

We have the total energy after fission: E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Also, the momenta are equal in magnitude: |p1| = |p2|.

So let's write the relativistic energies and momenta.

E1² = (m1 c²)² + (p1 c)²
E2² = (m2 c²)² + (p2 c)²

But since p1 c = p2 c (in magnitude), let's denote p c as a variable, say, p^2 c² = (E1² - (m1 c²)^2) = (E2^2 - (m2 c²)^2).

So,

E1² - (m1 c²)^2 = E2^2 - (m2 c²)^2.

So,

E1² - E2^2 = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

But E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Hmm, can I write E1 = (300 GeV) + E2? No, wait: E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Wait, E1 is the energy of the first fragment. Wait, the initial energy is 300 GeV, so that's E_initial = E1 + E2.

So, yes, E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So let me let E1 = 300 - E2.

Substituting into the equation from the momenta:

(300 - E2)^2 - E2^2 = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

Expand the left side:

(300^2 - 2*300*E2 + E2^2) - E2^2 = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

Simplify:

300^2 - 600 E2 = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

Now, compute m1 and m2 in terms of M.

We have m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

So m1^2 - m2^2 = (0.66 M)^2 - (0.33 M)^2 = (0.4356 M²) - (0.1089 M²) = 0.3267 M².

So the right side becomes 0.3267 M² c^4.

But M c² is given as 300 GeV. So M² c^4 is (300 GeV)^2 / c² * c^4 → Wait, maybe better to manipulate units.

Wait, M c² is 300 GeV. So M² c^4 = (300 GeV)^2.

So,

Right side: 0.3267 * (300 GeV)^2.

Putting it back into the equation:

300^2 GeV^2 - 600 E2 GeV = 0.3267 * 300^2 GeV^2.

Let me compute the numbers.

300^2 is 90,000 GeV².

So,

90,000 GeV² - 600 E2 GeV = 0.3267 * 90,000 GeV².

0.3267 * 90,000 ≈ Let me compute that.

90,000 * 0.3267 = 90,000 * 0.3 = 27,000; 90,000 * 0.0267 ≈ 2,403 → total ≈ 29,403 GeV².

So,

90,000 - 600 E2 = 29,403.

Subtract 29,403 from both sides:

90,000 - 29,403 = 600 E2 → 60,597 = 600 E2.

So E2 = 60,597 / 600 → approximately 100.995 GeV.

Wait, 60,597 divided by 600: 600 * 100 = 60,000; 60,597 - 60,000 = 597 → 597 /600 = 0.995. So E2 ≈ 100.995 GeV.

So E1 = 300 - 100.995 → 199.005 GeV.

Wait, but I think I might have messed up the units somewhere. Let me check.

Wait, M c² is 300 GeV, so m1 c² is 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV. Similarly, m2 c² is 99 GeV.

So E1 is the total energy of the first fragment, which is 199.005 GeV. Its rest energy is 198 GeV. So the kinetic energy T1 is E1 - m1 c² = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV.

Similarly, E2 is ~100.995 GeV, which is m2 c² (99 GeV) plus T2, so T2 is about 1.995 GeV.

Wait, but the sum of T1 and T2 was supposed to be 3 GeV (from 300 - 297 = 3). Let me check: 1.005 + 1.995 ≈ 3 GeV. Yep, that adds up.

Now, the question is about the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1. So I need to calculate the classical (non-relativistic) approximation of T1 and then find the difference.

In the classical approach, we assume velocities are low, so kinetic energy is (1/2) m v², and momentum is m v.

So, let's model the classical scenario.

The initial momentum is zero, so the two fragments' momenta must be equal and opposite. So, m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Wait, but in the classical case, since m1 > m2, the velocities will be in opposite directions, with the lighter fragment moving faster.

But since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero, so m1 v1 = - m2 v2. So, m1 v1 = - m2 (-v2) → m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Wait, so if the heavier fragment has velocity v, the lighter one has velocity (m1/m2) v, but in the opposite direction. Hmm, no, wait: Let me think.

Wait, m1 v1 = - m2 v2. So, v2 = -(m1/m2) v1.

But since m1 is twice m2, m1 = 2 m2.

So, v2 = -(2 m2 / m2) v1 = -2 v1.

So the lighter fragment's speed is twice that of the heavy fragment, in the opposite direction.

Now, using conservation of energy.

The initial kinetic energy is zero, as the nucleus is at rest.

After fission, the total kinetic energy is (1/2) m1 v1² + (1/2) m2 v2².

But wait, v2 is -2 v1, so:

KE_total = (1/2) m1 v1² + (1/2) m2 (4 v1²) ) = (1/2)(m1 + 4 m2) v1².

But m1 = 2 m2, so:

KE_total = (1/2)(2 m2 + 4 m2) v1² = (1/2)(6 m2) v1² = 3 m2 v1².

But the total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energy.

Wait, in the classical case, the rest mass energies are considered as part of the initial energy? Hmm, maybe in the non-relativistic case, the rest mass energy is considered fixed, and the kinetic energy comes from the splitting.

Wait, but the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the sum of the rest energies is 0.99 M c², which is 297 GeV, as before. So the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, same as in the relativistic case.

So in the classical approach, KE_total = 3 GeV.

So,

3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV.

But m2 = 0.33 M, and M c² is 300 GeV. So m2 c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.

So m2 = 99 GeV / c².

Wait, but in the classical approximation, we might be using non-relativistic equations, so perhaps we can express m2 in terms of GeV/c² directly.

Wait, solving for v1², let's see.

3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV → m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

But m2 is 99 GeV/c². So,

(99 GeV/c²) * v1² = 1 GeV → v1² = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c²) ) → v1² = (1/99) c² → v1 = c * sqrt(1/99) ≈ (0.1 c), since sqrt(1/99) is about 0.1005.

But wait, in the classical approach, I'm assuming velocities are non-relativistic, so v1 is much less than c. But in this case, v1 is about 0.1 c, which is 30,000 km/s, which is quite high. So the classical approximation might not be very accurate here.

Hmm, but let's proceed.

The kinetic energy of the heavy fragment is (1/2) m1 v1².

But m1 is 198 GeV/c².

So,

T1_classical = (1/2) * (198 GeV/c²) * v1².

We know from earlier, m2 v1² = 1 GeV → v1² = 1 GeV / (99 GeV/c²) ) = c² / 99.

So,

T1_classical = (1/2) * (198 GeV/c²) * (c² / 99 ) → (1/2) * (198 /99) GeV → (1/2) * 2 GeV → 1 GeV.

So the classical T1 is 1 GeV. The correct relativistic T1 is approximately 1.005 GeV. So the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Wait, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV.

So the correct T1 is about 1.005 GeV, and the classical is 1 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, in the relativistic case, I found T1 to be approximately 1.005 GeV. The classical calculation gave T1_classical as 1 GeV. So the difference is 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. So the correct answer is 5 MeV.

Looking at the options, option B is 5 MeV.


To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process using both relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) approximations.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Rest-Mass Energy**: The atomic nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.
2. **Fission Products**: The nucleus splits into two fragments with a mass ratio of 2:1. The total rest mass of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass, i.e., \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \).
   - From the mass ratio \( m_1 = 2m_2 \), we find:
     \[
     m_1 = 0.66M, \quad m_2 = 0.33M.
     \]
3. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies of the fragments and their kinetic energies:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{rest},1} + E_{\text{rest},2} + T_1 + T_2.
   \]
   Substituting \( E_{\text{initial}} = 300 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E_{\text{rest},1} + E_{\text{rest},2} = 0.99 \times 300 = 297 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:
   \[
   T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

### Relativistic Calculation:
Using conservation of momentum and energy, the relativistic kinetic energy of the heavier fragment (\( T_1 \)) is calculated to be approximately:
\[
T_1 \approx 1.005 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Classical Approximation:
In the classical (non-relativistic) approximation, the kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is derived using the relations:
\[
m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2, \quad T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
From these, the classical kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is:
\[
T_1^{\text{classical}} = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Classical Values:
The difference between the relativistic and classical values of \( T_1 \) is:
\[
\Delta T_1 = T_1 - T_1^{\text{classical}} = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The difference between the correct relativistic value of \( T_1 \) and the classical approximation is **5 MeV**.
