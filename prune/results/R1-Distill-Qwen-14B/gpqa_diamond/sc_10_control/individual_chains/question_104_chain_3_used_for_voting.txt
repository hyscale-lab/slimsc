Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet orbits, causing the star to move a little. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbital period.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. The key here is the periodic shift in their spectral lines: 5 mas for planet #1 and 7 mas for planet #2. Wait, but how does this shift relate to the orbital period?

I think the RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_s), and the orbital period (P). The formula is K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) )) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (P)^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e^2)) )) ) — but wait, that might be more detailed than needed. Since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that simplifies things.

Alternatively, I think there's a simplified version when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's. Since Neptune is much less massive than the Sun, M_p << M_s, so M_s + M_p ≈ M_s. So the formula simplifies. Let me think: K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_s^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ), assuming i is 90 degrees (edge-on), so sin i is 1.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much less than M_s, we can approximate (M_s + M_p) as M_s. So:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_s^(2/3) )

But wait, since both stars have the same mass, M_s is same for both. And both planets have similar masses to Neptune, so M_p is same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because all other factors are same except P.

Wait, the problem states that the shifts are 5 and 7 mas. I think the shift is proportional to the velocity. So if planet #1 has a velocity semi-amplitude K1, and planet #2 has K2, then K1/K2 = (v1)/(v2) = 5/7.

But according to the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait no, wait, because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * const, same for K2. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let me re-express this. Since K1 = (const) / P1^(1/3) and K2 = (const) / P2^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, no. Let me think again. From the formula, K is proportional to (M_p/M_s^(2/3)) * (1/P^(1/3)). Since M_p and M_s are same for both planets, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P.

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

But K1 is 5, K2 is 7, so 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1 => P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3.

But the question is, how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So that's P2/P1.

Compute (5/7)^3: 5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. So 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is roughly 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be P2/P1 = 0.364, so it's shorter, not longer. Wait, wait, no, the question says "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1." So if P2 is shorter, it's 0.36 times as long. So P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait, but the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's shorter, not longer. So the ratio is 0.36, which is option A: ~0.36.

But wait, the options are A) ~0.36, which would be the case. So the answer is option A.

The problem involves determining how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, given that both planets are detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude, \( K \), is proportional to \( 1/P^{1/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Since the stars and planets have the same masses, \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning \( K_1/K_2 = (P_2/P_1)^{1/3} \).

From the problem, the RV shifts for planet #1 and planet #2 are 5 mas and 7 mas, respectively. Thus, \( K_1/K_2 = 5/7 \). Substituting into the proportionality, we have:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Cubing both sides gives:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}.
\]

Calculating \( (5/7)^3 \), we find:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is \( \sim 0.36 \).

But since M_p is much less than M_s, we can approximate (M_s + M_p) as M_s. So:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_s^(2/3) )

But wait, since both stars have the same mass, M_s is same for both. And both planets have similar masses to Neptune, so M_p is same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because all other factors are same except P.

Wait, the problem states that the shifts are 5 and 7 mas. I think the shift is proportional to the velocity. So if planet #1 has a velocity semi-amplitude K1, and planet #2 has K2, then K1/K2 = (v1)/(v2) = 5/7.

But according to the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait no, wait, because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * const, same for K2. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let me re-express this. Since K1 = (const) / P1^(1/3) and K2 = (const) / P2^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, no. Let me think again. From the formula, K is proportional to (M_p/M_s^(2/3)) * (1/P^(1/3)). Since M_p and M_s are same for both planets, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P.

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

But K1 is 5, K2 is 7, so 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1 => P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3.

But the question is, how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So that's P2/P1.

Compute (5/7)^3: 5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. So 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is roughly 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be P2/P1 = 0.364, so it's shorter, not longer. Wait, wait, no, the question says "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1." So if P2 is shorter, it's 0.36 times as long. So P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait, but the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's shorter, not longer. So the ratio is 0.36, which is option A: ~0.36.
