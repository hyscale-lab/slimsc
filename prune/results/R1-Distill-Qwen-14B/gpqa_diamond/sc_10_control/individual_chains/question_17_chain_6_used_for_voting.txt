Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember something about complexes and dissociation constants.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds to Ca²+ ions. The pH is ideal, so I guess that means all the EDTA is in its correct form to bind the Ca²+ without any issues. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is a standard condition, so maybe some constants are given for that temperature.

The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. Wait, K is the formation constant, right? Formation constant tells us how much the complex is formed. So a high K means the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So the question is asking for [Ca²+], the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA, but with such a high K, I think the amount of dissociation is going to be really small.

Let me think about the reaction. The Ca-EDTA complex, let's call it CaY²-, dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4-. So the reaction is:

CaY²- ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4-

The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10. But wait, sometimes K is written as the formation of the complex, which would be the reverse of this. Oh wait, no. Formation constant is for the formation of the complex from its ions. So Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]). Alternatively, the dissociation constant Kd would be 1/Kf. Because the dissociation is the reverse reaction. 

Wait, so Kd = 1/Kf. So Kd here would be 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. But I'm not sure if I need to use Kf or Kd for this problem. Let's clarify.

The problem gives KCa-EDTA = 5e10. I think in this context, that's the formation constant Kf. So the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free Ca²+ should be low.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote that as [CaY²-]0 = 0.02 M. When it dissociates, let the change be x. So at equilibrium, [CaY²-] = 0.02 - x, [Ca²+] = x, [Y^4-] = x. But wait, because each mole of CaY²- that dissociates produces one mole of each ion, right? So yes, [Ca²+] = x, [Y^4-] = x.

So the expression for Kf is [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = Kf. Plugging in the values:

(0.02 - x)/(x * x) = 5e10.

Since Kf is so large (5e10 is a big number), x must be very small compared to 0.02. So I can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Then the equation becomes:

0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

Multiply both sides by x²:

0.02 = 5e10 * x².

Solve for x²:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that again. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5)e-12 = 0.4e-12. Which is 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6. So sqrt(4e-13) would be 2e-6.5, which is 2 * 1e-6.5. Hmm, 10^-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but x is the concentration of Ca²+ ions, so [Ca²+] ≈ x ≈ 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but let's make sure I didn't mix up Kf and Kd. Let me double-check. Formation constant Kf is very large, so the complex doesn't dissociate much, meaning [Ca²+] should be very low. Which matches with our calculation. So yes, the correct answer is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻) with a formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we analyze the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

Let the initial concentration of the complex be \([CaY^{2-}]_0 = 0.02 \, \text{M}\). At equilibrium, the concentration of free calcium ions \([Ca^{2+}]\) and free EDTA ions \([Y^{4-}]\) are both equal to \(x\), while the concentration of the complex is approximately \(0.02 - x\). Using the formation constant expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}
\]

Since \(K_f\) is very large (\(5 \times 10^{10}\)), the dissociation is minimal, so \(x \ll 0.02\). Thus, \(0.02 - x \approx 0.02\), simplifying the equation to:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions \([Ca^{2+}]\) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)**.
