Okay, I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. So, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what's given.

Alright, the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³. Wait, cm³ is the same as mL, right? So that's 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Mw stands for molecular weight, I think. So for KH2PO4, the Mw is 136.09 g/mol, and for Na2HPO4·2H2O, it's 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, I guess. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12.

Orthophosphate ions are PO4^3-, right? So I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution.

Wait, but the salts provided are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about their dissociations.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. H2PO4^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become HPO4^2-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2(HPO4·2H2O). Wait, no, actually, Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. The formula is Na2HPO4, which when dissolved, gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. The 2H2O just means it's hydrated, but in solution, the H2O might just contribute to the solution's water content, but the ions are Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the two salts are providing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Hmm. So in solution, we'll have a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about PO4^3-, which is the orthophosphate ion. But in the solution, we don't have any PO4^3- directly. Oh wait, but both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can dissociate further. H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-.

So the possible sources of PO4^3- in solution would be from the dissociation of HPO4^2-. But wait, the solution is made by mixing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So their ions are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the solution is probably a buffer solution because we have a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-).

So the solution is a buffer consisting of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the pH of the solution will determine how much of each is present, which in turn affects the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but we're looking for PO4^3- concentration. How can that happen?

Let me think about the phosphate species in solution. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. The deprotonation steps are:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^-
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-

So PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

But in a solution that has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the presence of H2PO4^- (which is a stronger acid than HPO4^2-) will shift the HPO4^2- to dissociate further. But wait, because H2PO4^- is a stronger acid than HPO4^2-, it can donate a proton to HPO4^2-.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the pH and the species present. Since the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are adjacent in the deprotonation series, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the pH of the solution would be around the pKa2 of H3PO4. Because H2PO4^- (Ka1 ~ 7.5e-3) and HPO4^2- (Ka2 ~6.2e-8). So the buffer is between the first and second dissociation steps, but wait, no: H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, so the relevant K here is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

Wait, the buffer equation is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base to the acid. So in this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the conjugate base is HPO4^2-.

So the pH of the solution should be close to the pKa2, which is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21 (since pKa = -log(Ka)). So the solution is slightly basic because pH > pKa when the base is in excess.

Wait, but how much of each is present? Let me calculate the moles of each.

First, find moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00g, Mw 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007337 mol.

Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005612 mol.

Wait, but wait: the formula for Na2HPO4 is Na2(HPO4). So each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Similarly, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

So in solution, the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = (0.007337 mol) / 0.2 L = 0.036685 M.

[HPO4^2-] = (0.005612 mol) / 0.2 L = 0.02806 M.

So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02806 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.765.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are involved), pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) → let me calculate that. 6.2e-8 → log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

So pH = 7.2076 + log(0.765) → log(0.765) is about -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.115 ≈ 7.0926. So the pH is around 7.09.

Now, the PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-: HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. So the expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Wait, but [H+] can be found from the pH. pH is 7.0926, so [H+] = 10^(-7.0926). Let's compute that.

10^(-7.0926) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0926). 10^(-0.0926) ≈ 0.875. So [H+] ≈ 8.75e-8 M.

So putting it all together:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.02806 M) / (8.75e-8 M).

Let me compute this step by step.

First, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Denominator: 8.75e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = 5.0508e-14 / 8.75e-8 ≈ 5.77e-7 M.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 5.0508e-14 divided by 8.75e-8.

5.0508e-14 / 8.75e-8 = (5.0508 /8.75) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.577 * 1e-6 ≈ 5.77e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest option is option D: 3.97e-7, or option B:5.48e-7, or C:2.81e-7.

Hmm, 5.77e-7 isn't exactly one of the options. Maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me re-calculate each step.

First, moles of KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol.

136.09 is approximately 136.1. So 1/136.1 ≈ 0.007337 mol. Correct.

Moles of Na2HPO4: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005612 mol. Correct.

Volume is 0.2 L → concentrations are 0.036685 M and 0.02806 M, respectively.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log (0.02806 / 0.036685) → 7.2076 + log(0.765).

Log(0.765) → Let's calculate that more accurately.

Log(0.765) is log(7.65e-1) → log(7.65) is about 0.884, so 0.884 -1 = -0.116.

So pH is 7.2076 - 0.116 ≈ 7.0916.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0916) → let's compute this exactly.

7.0916 → 7 + 0.0916.

10^-7 is 1e-7. 10^(-0.0916) → let's calculate it.

We can approximate using natural logs: ln(10^x) = x ln 10. So ln(y) = x → y = e^(x).

Alternatively, using a calculator approach: 0.0916.

We can approximate 10^-0.0916 is approximately 0.875. But maybe more accurately.

Let me think: 10^(-0.1) is about 0.794, and 10^(-0.09) is about 0.812.

Wait, 0.0916 is between 0.09 and 0.1.

Compute 10^(-0.09) ≈ 0.812.

10^(-0.0916) → let me compute using logarithm tables or a series.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator is better, but I'll proceed with an approximate value.

Let me compute 10^0.0916:

Take ln(10^0.0916) = 0.0916 * ln(10) ≈ 0.0916 * 2.302585 ≈ 0.2109.

e^0.2109 ≈ 1.235. So 10^0.0916 ≈ 1.235 → so 10^-0.0916 ≈ 1/1.235 ≈ 0.810.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.810 ≈ 8.10e-8 M.

Wait, I think more precise calculation is needed, but perhaps 8.75e-8 is a better approximation. Wait, in my earlier calculation, I thought that pH was about 7.0926, which would give [H+] as 8.75e-8. Let me double-check that.

Wait, 10^-7.0926 = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0926) → 1e-7 * 0.875 → 8.75e-8 M. So yes, that's correct.

So [H+] is 8.75e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02806 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.75e-8)

Let me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Divide by denominator: 5.0508e-14 / 8.75e-8 = (5.0508 /8.75) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.577 * 1e-6 → 5.77e-7 M.

Hmm, but the options don't have this number. The options are A)6.24e-7, B)5.48e-7, C)2.81e-7, D)3.97e-7.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and that the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward, considering that the solution is a buffer, and the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible, but the given options are all in the 1e-7 range, so it's not negligible.

Wait another thought: perhaps the initial assumption that the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is correct, but the actual concentration of PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2- under the given pH.

So perhaps I should compute the [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 and the [HPO4^2-] concentration and the [H+] calculated from the buffer.

Let me re-approach this.

We have [HPO4^2-] = 0.02806 M.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We've already computed [H+] as 8.75e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) /8.75e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Divide by 8.75e-8 → 5.0508e-14 /8.75e-8 = (5.0508 /8.75) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.577 * 1e-6 → 5.77e-7 M.

Hmm, but none of the options match. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let me double-check that.

Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So yes, the equation is correct.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I should calculate the exact pH using more precise values.

Wait, let's compute [H+] more accurately.

pH = 7.2076 + log(0.765) → log(0.765).

Let me compute log(0.765) accurately.

Log(0.765) = log(7.65e-1) = log(7.65) + (-1).

Log(7.65) is approximately 0.8846 (since 10^0.8846 ≈7.65).

So, log(0.765) = 0.8846 -1 = -0.1154.

Thus, pH = 7.2076 - 0.1154 = 7.0922.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0922) → let's compute 10^(-7.0922).

Let me compute 10^0.0922. Hmm. 10^0.09 is about 1.23, as before.

Wait, 0.0922 → perhaps I can compute 10^0.0922 using logarithm tables.

Wait, another approach: Using the Taylor series expansion for 10^x around x=0.

But perhaps that's complicated. Alternatively, using a calculator-like approach.

Wait, 10^0.0922 ≈ 1.235 (as before), so 10^(-0.0922) = 1 / 1.235 ≈ 0.810.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.81 ≈ 8.1e-8 M.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8.75e-8. Hmm. So perhaps I should use more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value.

Wait, 10^(-7.0922) → exact value.

Let me compute 7.0922 = 7 + 0.0922.

So 10^(-7.0922) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0922) = 1e-7 * (10^(-0.0922)).

Compute 10^(-0.0922):

We can use the fact that ln(10^(-0.0922)) = -0.0922 * ln(10) ≈ -0.0922 * 2.302585 ≈ -0.2124.

So e^(-0.2124) ≈ 0.809.

So 10^(-0.0922) ≈ 0.809.

Thus, [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.809 = 8.09e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.09e-8).

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 ≈ 5.0508e-14.

Denominator: 8.09e-8.

So 5.0508e-14 /8.09e-8 → 5.0508 /8.09 ≈ 0.6246 → 0.6246e-6 → 6.246e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.24e-7 M. Which matches option A.

But wait, earlier calculation with [H+] as 8.75e-8 gave 5.77e-7, but with more accurate [H+] as 8.09e-8, it's 6.24e-7, which is option A.

But looking back, the options are:

A)6.24x10^-7 M

B)5.48x10^-7 M 

C)2.81x10^-7 M

D)3.97x10^-7 M 

So option A is 6.24e-7, which matches our latest calculation.

But wait, earlier when I thought [H+] was 8.75e-8, I got 5.77e-7, but with more accurate [H+] as 8.09e-8, I get 6.24e-7, which is option A.

But wait, what's the correct [H+] from the pH?

Wait, perhaps I should compute [H+] more accurately from the pH of 7.0922.

pH =7.0922 → [H+] = 10^(-7.0922) → let's compute this using a calculator approach.

Compute 10^(-7.0922) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0922).

Compute 10^(-0.0922):

We can use logarithms or a calculator, but perhaps using the formula:

log(8) ≈ 0.9031, log(7.9) is about 0.8976, log(7.8) is 0.8921, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that 10^(-0.0922) = 1 / 10^(0.0922).

We can compute 10^0.0922.

0.0922 is approximately 0.09.

10^0.09 = 1.23 (as before).

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use a more precise method.

Let me compute 10^0.0922.

We can use the Taylor expansion for 10^x around x=0, but that's cumbersome. Alternatively, perhaps use the natural exponent and relation 10^x = e^(x ln 10).

So x=0.0922, ln(10)=2.302585.

So 0.0922 * ln(10) ≈ 0.0922 * 2.302585 ≈ 0.2124.

e^0.2124 ≈ 1.236.

So 10^0.0922 ≈ 1.236 → 10^(-0.0922) = 1/1.236 ≈ 0.809.

So [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.809 = 8.09e-8 M.

So, using this, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.09e-8) ≈ (5.0508e-14) / (8.09e-8) ≈ 6.247e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.24e-7 M, so option A.

But wait, why is the answer not present in the options? Wait, option A is 6.24e-7, which is exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer should be A.

But wait, looking back, the problem statement says to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, yes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution might have a different approach, like considering the total phosphate concentration and then the fraction that is PO4^3-.

But in this case, the main source of PO4^3- is the dissociation of HPO4^2-, which is the only source in the solution, since H2PO4^- can't donate two protons at once (it would become PO4^3- via H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- → PO4^3-).

But in solution, both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, so the PO4^3- comes only from HPO4^2-.

Wait, another point: perhaps the initial assumption is that the solution is a buffer, but the actual pH could be such that some of the HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-.

But I think the approach I took is correct.

So the correct answer should be option A) 6.24e-7 M.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and use the provided equilibrium constants. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociations are as follows:

1. **KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻**  
   - Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007337 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = \( \frac{0.007337}{0.2} \approx 0.036685 \, \text{M} \).

2. **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O → 2Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻**  
   - Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005612 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = \( \frac{0.005612}{0.2} \approx 0.02806 \, \text{M} \).

The solution is a buffer with H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation of H₃PO₄ (\( \text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \)):

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
\]

\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log \left( \frac{0.02806}{0.036685} \right) \approx 7.2076 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.2076 - 0.115 \approx 7.0926
\]

The concentration of \( [\text{H}^+] \) is calculated as:

\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.0926} \approx 8.09 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}.
\]

The concentration of PO₄³⁻ is determined by the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ (\( \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \)):

\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H}^+]},
\]

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02806)}{8.09 \times 10^{-8}} \approx \frac{5.0508 \times 10^{-14}}{8.09 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution is approximately \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).

**Answer: A**

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. So, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what's given.

Alright, the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³. Wait, cm³ is the same as mL, right? So that's 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Mw stands for molecular weight, I think. So for KH2PO4, the Mw is 136.09 g/mol, and for Na2HPO4·2H2O, it's 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, I guess. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12.

Orthophosphate ions are PO4^3-, right? So I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution.

Wait, but the salts provided are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about their dissociations.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. H2PO4^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become HPO4^2-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2(HPO4·2H2O). Wait, no, actually, Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. The formula is Na2HPO4, which when dissolved, gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. The 2H2O just means it's hydrated, but in solution, the H2O might just contribute to the solution's water content, but the ions are Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the two salts are providing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Hmm. So in solution, we'll have a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about PO4^3-, which is the orthophosphate ion. But in the solution, we don't have any PO4^3- directly. Oh wait, but both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can dissociate further. H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-.

So the possible sources of PO4^3- in solution would be from the dissociation of HPO4^2-. But wait, the solution is made by mixing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So their ions are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the solution is probably a buffer solution because we have a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-).

So the solution is a buffer consisting of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the pH of the solution will determine how much of each is present, which in turn affects the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but we're looking for PO4^3- concentration. How can that happen?

Let me think about the phosphate species in solution. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. The deprotonation steps are:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^-
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-

So PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

But in a solution that has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the presence of H2PO4^- (which is a stronger acid than HPO4^2-) will shift the HPO4^2- to dissociate further. But wait, because H2PO4^- is a stronger acid than HPO4^2-, it can donate a proton to HPO4^2-.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the pH and the species present. Since the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are adjacent in the deprotonation series, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the pH of the solution would be around the pKa2 of H3PO4. Because H2PO4^- (Ka1 ~ 7.5e-3) and HPO4^2- (Ka2 ~6.2e-8). So the buffer is between the first and second dissociation steps, but wait, no: H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, so the relevant K here is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

Wait, the buffer equation is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base to the acid. So in this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the conjugate base is HPO4^2-.

So the pH of the solution should be close to the pKa2, which is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21 (since pKa = -log(Ka)). So the solution is slightly basic because pH > pKa when the base is in excess.

Wait, but how much of each is present? Let me calculate the moles of each.

First, find moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00g, Mw 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007337 mol.

Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005612 mol.

Wait, but wait: the formula for Na2HPO4 is Na2(HPO4). So each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Similarly, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

So in solution, the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = (0.007337 mol) / 0.2 L = 0.036685 M.

[HPO4^2-] = (0.005612 mol) / 0.2 L = 0.02806 M.

So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02806 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.765.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are involved), pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) → let me calculate that. 6.2e-8 → log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

So pH = 7.2076 + log(0.765) → log(0.765) is about -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.115 ≈ 7.0926. So the pH is around 7.09.

Now, the PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-: HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. So the expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Wait, but [H+] can be found from the pH. pH is 7.0926, so [H+] = 10^(-7.0926). Let's compute that.

10^(-7.0926) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0926). 10^(-0.0926) ≈ 0.875. So [H+] ≈ 8.75e-8 M.

So putting it all together:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.02806 M) / (8.75e-8 M).

Let me compute this step by step.

First, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Denominator: 8.75e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = 5.0508e-14 / 8.75e-8 ≈ 5.77e-7 M.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 5.0508e-14 divided by 8.75e-8.

5.0508e-14 / 8.75e-8 = (5.0508 /8.75) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.577 * 1e-6 ≈ 5.77e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest option is option D: 3.97e-7, or option B:5.48e-7, or C:2.81e-7.

Hmm, 5.77e-7 isn't exactly one of the options. Maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me re-calculate each step.

First, moles of KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol.

136.09 is approximately 136.1. So 1/136.1 ≈ 0.007337 mol. Correct.

Moles of Na2HPO4: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005612 mol. Correct.

Volume is 0.2 L → concentrations are 0.036685 M and 0.02806 M, respectively.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log (0.02806 / 0.036685) → 7.2076 + log(0.765).

Log(0.765) → Let's calculate that more accurately.

Log(0.765) is log(7.65e-1) → log(7.65) is about 0.884, so 0.884 -1 = -0.116.

So pH is 7.2076 - 0.116 ≈ 7.0916.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0916) → let's compute this exactly.

7.0916 → 7 + 0.0916.

10^-7 is 1e-7. 10^(-0.0916) → let's calculate it.

We can approximate using natural logs: ln(10^x) = x ln 10. So ln(y) = x → y = e^(x).

Alternatively, using a calculator approach: 0.0916.

We can approximate 10^-0.0916 is approximately 0.875. But maybe more accurately.

Let me think: 10^(-0.1) is about 0.794, and 10^(-0.09) is about 0.812.

Wait, 0.0916 is between 0.09 and 0.1.

Compute 10^(-0.09) ≈ 0.812.

10^(-0.0916) → let me compute using logarithm tables or a series.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator is better, but I'll proceed with an approximate value.

Let me compute 10^0.0916:

Take ln(10^0.0916) = 0.0916 * ln(10) ≈ 0.0916 * 2.302585 ≈ 0.2109.

e^0.2109 ≈ 1.235. So 10^0.0916 ≈ 1.235 → so 10^-0.0916 ≈ 1/1.235 ≈ 0.810.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.810 ≈ 8.10e-8 M.

Wait, I think more precise calculation is needed, but perhaps 8.75e-8 is a better approximation. Wait, in my earlier calculation, I thought that pH was about 7.0926, which would give [H+] as 8.75e-8. Let me double-check that.

Wait, 10^-7.0926 = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0926) → 1e-7 * 0.875 → 8.75e-8 M. So yes, that's correct.

So [H+] is 8.75e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02806 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.75e-8)

Let me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Divide by denominator: 5.0508e-14 / 8.75e-8 = (5.0508 /8.75) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.577 * 1e-6 → 5.77e-7 M.

Hmm, but the options don't have this number. The options are A)6.24e-7, B)5.48e-7, C)2.81e-7, D)3.97e-7.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and that the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward, considering that the solution is a buffer, and the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible, but the given options are all in the 1e-7 range, so it's not negligible.

Wait another thought: perhaps the initial assumption that the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is correct, but the actual concentration of PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2- under the given pH.

So perhaps I should compute the [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 and the [HPO4^2-] concentration and the [H+] calculated from the buffer.

Let me re-approach this.

We have [HPO4^2-] = 0.02806 M.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We've already computed [H+] as 8.75e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) /8.75e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Divide by 8.75e-8 → 5.0508e-14 /8.75e-8 = (5.0508 /8.75) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.577 * 1e-6 → 5.77e-7 M.

Hmm, but none of the options match. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let me double-check that.

Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So yes, the equation is correct.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I should calculate the exact pH using more precise values.

Wait, let's compute [H+] more accurately.

pH = 7.2076 + log(0.765) → log(0.765).

Let me compute log(0.765) accurately.

Log(0.765) = log(7.65e-1) = log(7.65) + (-1).

Log(7.65) is approximately 0.8846 (since 10^0.8846 ≈7.65).

So, log(0.765) = 0.8846 -1 = -0.1154.

Thus, pH = 7.2076 - 0.1154 = 7.0922.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0922) → let's compute 10^(-7.0922).

Let me compute 10^0.0922. Hmm. 10^0.09 is about 1.23, as before.

Wait, 0.0922 → perhaps I can compute 10^0.0922 using logarithm tables.

Wait, another approach: Using the Taylor series expansion for 10^x around x=0.

But perhaps that's complicated. Alternatively, using a calculator-like approach.

Wait, 10^0.0922 ≈ 1.235 (as before), so 10^(-0.0922) = 1 / 1.235 ≈ 0.810.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.81 ≈ 8.1e-8 M.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8.75e-8. Hmm. So perhaps I should use more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value.

Wait, 10^(-7.0922) → exact value.

Let me compute 7.0922 = 7 + 0.0922.

So 10^(-7.0922) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0922) = 1e-7 * (10^(-0.0922)).

Compute 10^(-0.0922):

We can use the fact that ln(10^(-0.0922)) = -0.0922 * ln(10) ≈ -0.0922 * 2.302585 ≈ -0.2124.

So e^(-0.2124) ≈ 0.809.

So 10^(-0.0922) ≈ 0.809.

Thus, [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.809 = 8.09e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.09e-8).

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 ≈ 5.0508e-14.

Denominator: 8.09e-8.

So 5.0508e-14 /8.09e-8 → 5.0508 /8.09 ≈ 0.6246 → 0.6246e-6 → 6.246e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.24e-7 M. Which matches option A.

But wait, earlier calculation with [H+] as 8.75e-8 gave 5.77e-7, but with more accurate [H+] as 8.09e-8, it's 6.24e-7, which is option A.

But looking back, the options are:

A)6.24x10^-7 M

B)5.48x10^-7 M 

C)2.81x10^-7 M

D)3.97x10^-7 M 

So option A is 6.24e-7, which matches our latest calculation.

But wait, earlier when I thought [H+] was 8.75e-8, I got 5.77e-7, but with more accurate [H+] as 8.09e-8, I get 6.24e-7, which is option A.

But wait, what's the correct [H+] from the pH?

Wait, perhaps I should compute [H+] more accurately from the pH of 7.0922.

pH =7.0922 → [H+] = 10^(-7.0922) → let's compute this using a calculator approach.

Compute 10^(-7.0922) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0922).

Compute 10^(-0.0922):

We can use logarithms or a calculator, but perhaps using the formula:

log(8) ≈ 0.9031, log(7.9) is about 0.8976, log(7.8) is 0.8921, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that 10^(-0.0922) = 1 / 10^(0.0922).

We can compute 10^0.0922.

0.0922 is approximately 0.09.

10^0.09 = 1.23 (as before).

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use a more precise method.

Let me compute 10^0.0922.

We can use the Taylor expansion for 10^x around x=0, but that's cumbersome. Alternatively, perhaps use the natural exponent and relation 10^x = e^(x ln 10).

So x=0.0922, ln(10)=2.302585.

So 0.0922 * ln(10) ≈ 0.0922 * 2.302585 ≈ 0.2124.

e^0.2124 ≈ 1.236.

So 10^0.0922 ≈ 1.236 → 10^(-0.0922) = 1/1.236 ≈ 0.809.

So [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.809 = 8.09e-8 M.

So, using this, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.09e-8) ≈ (5.0508e-14) / (8.09e-8) ≈ 6.247e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.24e-7 M, so option A.

But wait, why is the answer not present in the options? Wait, option A is 6.24e-7, which is exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer should be A.

But wait, looking back, the problem statement says to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, yes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution might have a different approach, like considering the total phosphate concentration and then the fraction that is PO4^3-.

But in this case, the main source of PO4^3- is the dissociation of HPO4^2-, which is the only source in the solution, since H2PO4^- can't donate two protons at once (it would become PO4^3- via H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- → PO4^3-).

But in solution, both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, so the PO4^3- comes only from HPO4^2-.

Wait, another point: perhaps the initial assumption is that the solution is a buffer, but the actual pH could be such that some of the HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-.

But I think the approach I took is correct.

So the correct answer should be option A) 6.24e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and use the provided equilibrium constants. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociations are as follows:

1. **KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻**  
   - Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007337 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = \( \frac{0.007337}{0.2} \approx 0.036685 \, \text{M} \).

2. **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O → 2Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻**  
   - Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005612 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = \( \frac{0.005612}{0.2} \approx 0.02806 \, \text{M} \).

The solution is a buffer with H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation of H₃PO₄ (\( \text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \)):

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
\]

\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log \left( \frac{0.02806}{0.036685} \right) \approx 7.2076 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.2076 - 0.115 \approx 7.0926
\]

The concentration of \( [\text{H}^+] \) is calculated as:

\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.0926} \approx 8.09 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}.
\]

The concentration of PO₄³⁻ is determined by the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ (\( \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \)):

\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H}^+]},
\]

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02806)}{8.09 \times 10^{-8}} \approx \frac{5.0508 \times 10^{-14}}{8.09 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution is approximately \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).

**Answer: A**
