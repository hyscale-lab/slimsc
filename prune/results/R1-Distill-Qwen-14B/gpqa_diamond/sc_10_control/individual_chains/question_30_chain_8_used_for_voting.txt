Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about dyes and the colors they emit or absorb. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says a textile dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons and emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. They're asking what color is absorbed. Wait, wait, wait. I remember that when a compound emits light, that's after it has absorbed some other light. Oh right, the complementary color. Because when something absorbs a certain wavelength, it emits or reflects the complementary color.

So first, I need to figure out the wavelength corresponding to 2.3393 eV. Oh wait, wait. No, the energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. But usually, the energy absorbed determines the color absorbed, and the emitted color is the complementary. Or maybe I got that wrong.

Let me recall the energy equation. The energy E is related to wavelength λ by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. Oh wait, but the energy given is the emitted one, so that might actually be the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV.

Wait, no, wait. The energy of the emitted light would be the energy that the molecule transitions down. So when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state, and then when it relaxes, it emits a photon of that energy. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted one? Or is it the same?

Wait, I'm getting confused. So the absorption and emission are connected. The energy absorbed is the energy gap between the ground and excited states. When the molecule emits, it releases that same energy. So the energy emitted is the same as the energy absorbed, right? Because the molecule goes from the excited state (higher energy) back to the ground state (lower energy), releasing a photon of energy E.

So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, then that's the energy of the absorbed photon. Wait, no. Wait, wait. No, the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E, which promotes it to a higher energy state. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon of energy E. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the emitted photon. But wait, isn't that not always the case? Like, sometimes molecules can emit lower energy photons if there are multiple transitions, but I think in this case, it's a conjugated system, so it's a single emission.

So, the question is about the color absorbed. The energy absorbed is 2.3393 eV, so I can find the wavelength. Let me compute that.

The energy E is 2.3393 eV. Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. But since E is in eV, maybe I should use the conversion factor that 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J.

So E in J is 2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 3.746e-19 J.

Then wavelength λ = hc/E.

Let me compute hc. h is 6.626e-34, c is 3e8, so hc is about 1.986e-25 J·m.

Divide that by E (3.746e-19 J):

λ = (1.986e-25) / (3.746e-19) = approximately 5.299e-7 meters, which is 529.9 nm.

So the wavelength is about 530 nm. Now, what color is that? I remember the visible spectrum ranges from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). The colors in order are violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, red.

Wait, 530 nm is in the green region. Because blue is around 450-495 nm, green is 495-570 nm. So 530 is green. So the emitted light is green.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So if the dye emits green, the absorbed light must be the complementary color. What's the complement of green? The color wheel: green is opposite magenta, which is a combination of red and violet. But wait, in terms of color absorption, the absorbed color is the one that's not emitted. So the compound absorbs the energy corresponding to green and emits the complementary color?

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. When a substance absorbs certain wavelengths (colors) and reflects or emits others. The color we see is the one that's not absorbed, which is the complementary color of the absorbed one.

Alternatively, if a dye emits green light, that suggests it absorbed a photon of green and then emitted green? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if it absorbs green, it would typically emit at a longer or shorter wavelength, but that's in fluorescence. Wait, no. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited, and then when it de-excites, it emits a photon. The energy of the emitted photon is the same as the absorbed one only if it's a direct transition. But in conjugated systems, I think the emission is usually at a longer wavelength than the absorption (red shift). So the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed.

Wait, that's right! Fluorescence often involves a red shift, meaning the emitted light has lower energy (longer wavelength) than the absorbed. So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed energy would be higher.

Wait, so the question is about the energy of the emitted light. So the absorbed energy would be higher than 2.3393 eV.

So let me recalculate. Let me find the wavelength for 2.3393 eV again.

Wait, 2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 3.746e-19 J.

λ = hc/E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.746e-19) = (1.9878e-25) / (3.746e-19) ≈ 5.3e-7 meters, which is 530 nm, green light.

But since the emission is at 530 nm, the absorption must be at a shorter wavelength, higher energy. Because when you absorb a higher energy photon (shorter wavelength), the molecule gets excited, and upon relaxing, emits a lower energy photon (longer wavelength).

So what's the color absorbed? If the emission is green (530 nm), the absorption is at a shorter wavelength. Let's think about possible colors.

Wait, but how much shorter? The energy difference between absorption and emission will determine the transition energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy for the absorption. However, the question says the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, but the dye's extensively conjugated pi-electrons probably mean that the absorption is in the visible range. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the energy of the absorbed photon. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it's the energy of that photon that determines the transition. The emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed, as per fluorescence.

But the question is, what color is absorbed? So the wavelength of the absorbed photon would be shorter than 530 nm, so higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, but the question gives only the emitted energy. So perhaps the emitted light's energy is 2.3393 eV, but the absorbed is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is that the dye emits light at a certain energy, so the color we see is that energy. But the absorbed color would be the one not seen.

Wait, no. Let me think about the color of light absorbed. For example, if a dye emits red, it would have absorbed a higher energy (blue or green), because red is a longer wavelength. So the absorbed color is the one that's not emitted. So if the emitted color is green, the absorbed color is the one that's not green. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when a substance absorbs certain wavelengths, it reflects others. The color we see is what's not absorbed.

Wait, but in this case, the question is about the color absorbed, not the color emitted.

So if the dye emits green, that would mean it absorbed a higher-energy photon (blue, perhaps), and when it de-excites, it emits green. But that doesn't fit because the emission energy should be lower than the absorption.

Wait, but perhaps the question is simply that the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, so that corresponds to green, but the question is about the absorbed color. So the absorbed color is the same as the emitted? No, that can't be right because then it would absorb and emit the same color, which wouldn't make sense for a dye.

Ah, wait, perhaps the question is using the term "emits" in the context of fluorescence or phosphorescence. So the molecule absorbs a higher-energy photon, then emits a lower-energy photon.

So the absorbed energy is higher than the emitted. So the emitted wavelength is longer (lower energy) than the absorbed.

So for the emitted energy of 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm (green), the absorbed wavelength must be shorter than that, meaning higher energy, which would be in the blue or violet region.

So the color absorbed would be in the blue or violet range. Looking at the options:

Options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So possible answers are B or C.

Now, I need to figure out if the absorbed color is violet or blue.

Wait, what's the approximate energy for blue and violet?

Violet is around 400-440 nm, which is higher energy than blue (450-495 nm). So the energy for violet would be higher than blue.

Wait, but our emitted wavelength is 530 nm (green), so the absorbed must be shorter than that. Let's compute the energy for, say, 450 nm (blue), which is about 2.75 eV (since E = 1240 / λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / 450 ≈ 2.75 eV). Wait, 1240 is the product hc in eV·nm. So for 450 nm, E is 1240 / 450 ≈ 2.756 eV.

The emitted energy is 2.3393 eV (530 nm). So the absorbed energy is about 2.75 eV, which corresponds to blue light.

Wait, but 450 nm is blue. So the absorbed photon is blue, and the emitted is green. So the absorbed color is blue, right? So the dye absorbs blue light and emits green. Therefore, the color absorbed would be blue, which is option C.

But wait, let me check another wavelength. If the absorbed wavelength is 400 nm (violet), then E is 1240 / 400 = 3.1 eV. Which is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the emitted would be 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the absorbed would be violet, and the emitted green.

Hmm, so depending on where the absorption is, the color absorbed can be either violet or blue. How do I decide which it is?

Wait, the question states that the dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons, which usually implies that the absorption maximum is in the visible range. Extensive conjugation leads to longer wavelengths (lower energy) absorption. So for something like beta-carotene, which is highly conjugated, the absorption is in the visible range, around 450 nm (blue). So maybe the absorbed is in the blue region.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think: molecules with conjugated double bonds absorb in the visible range. The energy gap for conjugated dienes is smaller, so longer wavelengths (lower energy) are absorbed. So for a highly conjugated system, the absorption is towards the red end, but that's for longer conjugation. Wait, no, longer conjugation leads to smaller energy gaps, so lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. So if the molecule has a large conjugated system, it absorbs at a longer wavelength (lower energy).

Wait, wait. The energy of the transition is inversely proportional to the wavelength. So larger conjugated systems have lower energy gaps, so the absorption is at longer wavelengths (lower energy). So if the molecule has a large conjugation, it absorbs in the red or maybe even near-infrared. But in this case, the emission is in green, so the absorption must be blue or violet.

Wait, but if the conjugation is extensive, the absorption might be in the visible, but perhaps not as far as red. So perhaps it's in the blue or green.

Hmm, but the question is about the color absorbed, which would correspond to the higher energy photon. Since the emission is 2.3393 eV (530 nm, green), the absorption is at a higher energy, so shorter wavelength.

If the absorption were in violet (400 nm), that's 3.1 eV, which is higher than 2.3393. So then the emitted would be green.

Alternatively, if the absorption were in blue (450 nm, 2.75 eV), then the emitted is green (2.3393 eV).

So both violet and blue are possible.

But the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

Which one is correct?

Wait, another approach: the color emitted is the complementary color of the absorbed. The emitted color is green, so the absorbed color would be magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. But the options don't have magenta. The closest options are violet and blue.

But the question is about the absorbed color. If the emitted is green, the absorbed would be magenta, but since that's not an option, perhaps the absorbed color is violet or blue. But which one?

Alternatively, the color we see is what's reflected or transmitted. So if the dye emits green, it's because it absorbed another color and then emitted green. So the color absorbed would be the one that's not present in the emitted light.

Wait, but absorption and emission are different. The molecule can't emit a color it doesn't absorb.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the energy.

The energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. So the energy absorbed must be higher than that, because in fluorescence, the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than E=2.3393 eV.

So what color is higher energy than green? Violet is higher (shorter wavelength) than blue and green. So the absorbed color is violet or blue.

But how do I choose between B and C?

Wait, the question says "the organic compound emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV." So the dye emits that energy when it relaxes. That emission is at 530 nm (green). So the absorbed energy must be higher, say, 2.75 eV (blue) or 3.1 eV (violet).

Looking at the options, both B and C are possible. But which one is more likely?

Wait, another angle: the energy difference between absorption and emission is often in the range of a few tenths of an eV, but I'm not sure. Let me compute the energy difference.

If E_absorbed is, say, 2.75 eV (blue), then E_emission is 2.3393 eV. The energy difference is 0.41 eV. That's in the infrared, which is possible.

Alternatively, if E_absorbed is 3.1 eV (violet), then the difference is 0.76 eV, which is in the visible range (green).

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the energy difference would be the energy of the emitted photon. No, wait. E_absorbed is higher than E_emitted. The energy difference is E_absorbed - E_emitted = energy lost as heat or other processes. So the difference is 2.75 - 2.3393 ≈ 0.41 eV. What's that in terms of wavelength? 1240 / 0.41 ≈ 3024 nm, which is infrared. So the molecule would lose that energy as heat or other emissions.

But that's okay, I think.

So whether the absorbed is blue or violet depends on the conjugation length. Extensively conjugated systems usually have lower energy gaps, so the absorption is at longer wavelengths (lower energy). Wait, no. Extensive conjugation reduces the energy gap, so the absorption is at longer (lower energy) wavelengths. So if the molecule has a very long conjugation, the absorption would be in the red or near-infrared, but in this case, the emitted is green, so the absorption must be blue or violet.

Wait, another thought: if the conjugation is extensive, the absorption maximum would be in the visible range but towards the red. But since the emitted is green, the absorption must be in the blue or violet.

Wait, but if the molecule emits green, then the excited state must have an energy corresponding to green. The ground state is lower. The transition upon absorption is from ground to excited state (green's energy). Wait, no. No, the absorption is the energy needed to excite the molecule, so the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the energy of the emitted photon.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Perhaps I should look at the options. The options are A to D, including Violet (B) and Blue (C). So based on the calculation, the emitted energy is 530 nm (green). The absorbed energy must be higher, so either blue (450 nm) or violet (400 nm).

Which is more likely? Well, the question says the molecule has "extensively conjugated pi-electrons". Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. So if the conjugation is extensive, the absorption would be in the red region. But that's conflicting with our earlier conclusion because the emission is green, which is shorter than red.

Wait, no. Wait, the emission is green (530 nm), which is in the middle of the visible spectrum. So if the molecule's absorption is due to extensive conjugation, would that absorption be in the visible range?

Yes, but for extensive conjugation, the absorption is typically in the visible, perhaps even near the red end. So for example, beta-carotene has a strong absorption around 450 nm (blue), which is due to its conjugated structure. So maybe the absorbed color is blue, so the answer is C.

Alternatively, another perspective: the energy emitted (2.3393 eV) would correspond to green. The absorbed energy is higher. The colors above green in energy are blue and violet. So the absorbed color would be either blue or violet. Which one?

The options are B and C. Which one is correct?

Hmm, without more info, perhaps I should think about the options. If the emitted is green, the absorbed is in the blue or violet region.

But wait, the question is about the color of light absorbed. So the correct answer would be the color that has higher energy than green. So the options are B) Violet (higher energy than blue) and C) Blue.

If the emitted is green, the absorbed is blue or violet. Which one is more likely?

Wait, another approach: the energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed energy would be higher. Let's compute the possible colors.

- Violet: approx 400 nm, E = 3.1 eV.
- Blue: 450 nm, E = 2.75 eV.
- Green: 530 nm, E = 2.3393 eV.

So the absorbed photon would have energy of either 2.75 eV or 3.1 eV.

The options are B and C.

In the context of dyes, which usually absorb in the visible range, it's more likely that a dye would absorb in the blue region, allowing it to emit in the green. So the absorbed color would be blue, making the answer C.

Wait, but why? Because dyes typically absorb in the visible range, and blue is in that range. So the answer would be C) Blue.

Alternatively, some dyes may absorb in the violet, but more commonly, they absorb in the blue or green regions.

Wait, another point: the complementary color of green is magenta. But the options don't have magenta. So perhaps the absorbed is blue, because the emitted is green. Wait, no, the complementary color is what's not present, so if the dye emits green, it's because it absorbed the other colors. But that's about the color we see, not the color it absorbs.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up concepts here. The color observed is the one that's not absorbed. But the question is specifically about the color absorbed. So if a compound emits green, what color is it absorbing? It's the color it's absorbing that allows it to emit green.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's just go with the energy calculations.

If the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed energy would be higher. The options for higher energy are violet (B) and blue (C). So of the given options, B and C are possible. Which one is correct?

Well, the question says it's a dye with extensively conjugated pi-electrons. Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. So the absorption would be in the red region. Hmm, but then if the absorption is in red, the emitted would be in a lower energy, which is infrared, which we don't see. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I got this backwards. Extensive conjugation leads to smaller energy gaps, meaning the absorption is at longer wavelengths (lower energy). So if the absorption is in the red, the emission would be in the infrared, which isn't visible. But the emission here is green (visible), which suggests that the energy difference is in the visible range.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. The energy emitted is E, which is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. The energy absorbed is the same as E? No, because in fluorescence, the absorbed energy is higher.

Wait, no. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it's promoted to an excited state. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon. The energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed. So the absorbed energy is higher.

So the energy of the absorbed photon E_abs = E_emit + energy lost (usually as heat or other emissions).

If E_emit is 2.3393 eV, then E_abs must be higher than that. So the absorption is in the blue (2.75 eV) or violet (3.1 eV).

Which one is more likely.

Well, the options are B and C. Let me think about common dyes. Many dyes absorb in the blue region and emit in the green or red. For example, some fluorescent dyes absorb in the UV and emit in the visible, but others absorb in the visible.

If the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorption is in the blue or violet.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to choose. However, since the question gives the options, let's see which makes sense.

If the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed is blue (450 nm) or violet (400 nm). So either B or C is correct.

But wait, 530 nm is green, which is in the middle of the visible spectrum.

The complementary color of green is magenta, which is not one of the options. So perhaps the question is not about the complementary color but the actual absorbed color.

So the correct answer would be the color with higher energy than 2.3393 eV, which is either blue or violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet (higher energy than blue). So why would the dye absorb violet and emit green?

It's possible. So the answer would be B) Violet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: which color has energy higher than 2.3393 eV?

The options are A) Red (1.9 eV?), B) Violet (~3.1 eV), C) Blue (~2.75 eV), D) Yellow (~2.1 eV). Wait, let me check the approximate energies.

Energy in eV for colors:

- Violet: ~3.1 eV (400 nm)
- Blue: ~2.75 eV (450 nm)
- Green: ~2.33 eV (530 nm)
- Yellow: ~2.1 eV (540-570 nm)
- Red: ~1.9 eV (650-700 nm)

So the emitted energy is 2.33 eV (green). The absorbed must be higher than that. So the possible options are B) Violet (3.1 eV) and C) Blue (2.75 eV).

So the correct answer is either B or C.

The question states the compound emits light of 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed energy is higher. So the color absorbed is either violet or blue.

Which one is correct?

In the absence of more information, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet, as it's the higher energy option.

Wait, but I remember that when molecules have conjugated pi systems, the absorption tends to be in the visible range. So, for example, anthocyanins absorb in the blue and red regions. Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the energy of the emitted light is the energy of the photon that is released when the molecule returns to its ground state. The energy absorbed is the one that took it to the excited state, which is higher than the emitted.

So, the question is, what color is absorbed? The absorbed color is the one with higher energy than the emitted.

In the options, the colors with higher energy than green (2.3393 eV) are violet (3.1 eV) and blue (2.75 eV). So the absorbed color is either B or C.

But the question is a multiple-choice with only these options. So the answer is either B or C.

Wait, but the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the color of the emitted light is green. The color absorbed is either blue or violet.

But wait, the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So the correct answer is either B or C.

Without more data, I think the intended answer is B) Violet.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: in the visible spectrum, the colors from lowest to highest energy are: red (~1.9 eV), orange, yellow, green (2.33), blue (2.75), violet (3.1).

The emitted is green (2.3393), so the absorbed must be either blue or violet.

If the question is about the absorbed color, the correct answer is B or C.

But the question is about the color absorbed. So if the molecule emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, which could be violet or blue.

But I'm not certain. Maybe the correct answer is B) Violet.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is misworded, and the energy given is the energy of the absorbed photon. But I don't think so; the question says emitted.

Hmm, given all that, I think the answer is B) Violet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted light and the absorbed light. The energy of the emitted light is given as \( E_{\text{emit}} = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \), which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = 530 \, \text{nm} \) (green light). 

In fluorescence, the energy of the absorbed photon (\( E_{\text{absorb}} \)) is higher than the energy of the emitted photon (\( E_{\text{emit}} \)) because the molecule loses some energy (e.g., as heat) during the transition from the excited state to the ground state. Therefore, the absorbed photon must have a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than the emitted photon.

The energy of the absorbed photon can be calculated using the relationship \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength. For the emitted light (\( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = 530 \, \text{nm} \)), the energy is:

\[
E_{\text{emit}} = \frac{1240}{\lambda_{\text{emit}}} \approx \frac{1240}{530} \approx 2.3393 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The absorbed photon must have a higher energy, corresponding to a shorter wavelength. For example:
- Violet light (\( \lambda_{\text{violet}} \approx 400 \, \text{nm} \)) has \( E_{\text{violet}} \approx \frac{1240}{400} = 3.1 \, \text{eV} \).
- Blue light (\( \lambda_{\text{blue}} \approx 450 \, \text{nm} \)) has \( E_{\text{blue}} \approx \frac{1240}{450} = 2.75 \, \text{eV} \).

Both violet and blue photons have higher energy than the emitted green photon (\( 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \)), so the absorbed light could be either violet or blue. However, the question specifies that the compound has "extensively conjugated pi-electrons," which typically absorb in the visible range. Extensive conjugation often shifts the absorption to longer wavelengths (lower energy), but the emitted light is green (\( 530 \, \text{nm} \)), indicating that the absorption must still occur at a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than green.

Given the options, violet (\( 3.1 \, \text{eV} \)) and blue (\( 2.75 \, \text{eV} \)) are the only plausible choices. Since the question does not provide additional details about the specific absorption properties of the compound, the most reasonable conclusion is that the absorbed light is violet, as it has a higher energy than blue and aligns with the fluorescence process.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about dyes and the colors they emit or absorb. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says a textile dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons and emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. They're asking what color is absorbed. Wait, wait, wait. I remember that when a compound emits light, that's after it has absorbed some other light. Oh right, the complementary color. Because when something absorbs a certain wavelength, it emits or reflects the complementary color.

So first, I need to figure out the wavelength corresponding to 2.3393 eV. Oh wait, wait. No, the energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. But usually, the energy absorbed determines the color absorbed, and the emitted color is the complementary. Or maybe I got that wrong.

Let me recall the energy equation. The energy E is related to wavelength λ by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. Oh wait, but the energy given is the emitted one, so that might actually be the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV.

Wait, no, wait. The energy of the emitted light would be the energy that the molecule transitions down. So when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state, and then when it relaxes, it emits a photon of that energy. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted one? Or is it the same?

Wait, I'm getting confused. So the absorption and emission are connected. The energy absorbed is the energy gap between the ground and excited states. When the molecule emits, it releases that same energy. So the energy emitted is the same as the energy absorbed, right? Because the molecule goes from the excited state (higher energy) back to the ground state (lower energy), releasing a photon of energy E.

So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, then that's the energy of the absorbed photon. Wait, no. Wait, wait. No, the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E, which promotes it to a higher energy state. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon of energy E. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the emitted photon. But wait, isn't that not always the case? Like, sometimes molecules can emit lower energy photons if there are multiple transitions, but I think in this case, it's a conjugated system, so it's a single emission.

So, the question is about the color absorbed. The energy absorbed is 2.3393 eV, so I can find the wavelength. Let me compute that.

The energy E is 2.3393 eV. Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. But since E is in eV, maybe I should use the conversion factor that 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J.

So E in J is 2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 3.746e-19 J.

Then wavelength λ = hc/E.

Let me compute hc. h is 6.626e-34, c is 3e8, so hc is about 1.986e-25 J·m.

Divide that by E (3.746e-19 J):

λ = (1.986e-25) / (3.746e-19) = approximately 5.299e-7 meters, which is 529.9 nm.

So the wavelength is about 530 nm. Now, what color is that? I remember the visible spectrum ranges from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). The colors in order are violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, red.

Wait, 530 nm is in the green region. Because blue is around 450-495 nm, green is 495-570 nm. So 530 is green. So the emitted light is green.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So if the dye emits green, the absorbed light must be the complementary color. What's the complement of green? The color wheel: green is opposite magenta, which is a combination of red and violet. But wait, in terms of color absorption, the absorbed color is the one that's not emitted. So the compound absorbs the energy corresponding to green and emits the complementary color?

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. When a substance absorbs certain wavelengths (colors) and reflects or emits others. The color we see is the one that's not absorbed, which is the complementary color of the absorbed one.

Alternatively, if a dye emits green light, that suggests it absorbed a photon of green and then emitted green? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if it absorbs green, it would typically emit at a longer or shorter wavelength, but that's in fluorescence. Wait, no. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited, and then when it de-excites, it emits a photon. The energy of the emitted photon is the same as the absorbed one only if it's a direct transition. But in conjugated systems, I think the emission is usually at a longer wavelength than the absorption (red shift). So the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed.

Wait, that's right! Fluorescence often involves a red shift, meaning the emitted light has lower energy (longer wavelength) than the absorbed. So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed energy would be higher.

Wait, so the question is about the energy of the emitted light. So the absorbed energy would be higher than 2.3393 eV.

So let me recalculate. Let me find the wavelength for 2.3393 eV again.

Wait, 2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 3.746e-19 J.

λ = hc/E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.746e-19) = (1.9878e-25) / (3.746e-19) ≈ 5.3e-7 meters, which is 530 nm, green light.

But since the emission is at 530 nm, the absorption must be at a shorter wavelength, higher energy. Because when you absorb a higher energy photon (shorter wavelength), the molecule gets excited, and upon relaxing, emits a lower energy photon (longer wavelength).

So what's the color absorbed? If the emission is green (530 nm), the absorption is at a shorter wavelength. Let's think about possible colors.

Wait, but how much shorter? The energy difference between absorption and emission will determine the transition energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy for the absorption. However, the question says the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, but the dye's extensively conjugated pi-electrons probably mean that the absorption is in the visible range. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the energy of the absorbed photon. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it's the energy of that photon that determines the transition. The emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed, as per fluorescence.

But the question is, what color is absorbed? So the wavelength of the absorbed photon would be shorter than 530 nm, so higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, but the question gives only the emitted energy. So perhaps the emitted light's energy is 2.3393 eV, but the absorbed is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is that the dye emits light at a certain energy, so the color we see is that energy. But the absorbed color would be the one not seen.

Wait, no. Let me think about the color of light absorbed. For example, if a dye emits red, it would have absorbed a higher energy (blue or green), because red is a longer wavelength. So the absorbed color is the one that's not emitted. So if the emitted color is green, the absorbed color is the one that's not green. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when a substance absorbs certain wavelengths, it reflects others. The color we see is what's not absorbed.

Wait, but in this case, the question is about the color absorbed, not the color emitted.

So if the dye emits green, that would mean it absorbed a higher-energy photon (blue, perhaps), and when it de-excites, it emits green. But that doesn't fit because the emission energy should be lower than the absorption.

Wait, but perhaps the question is simply that the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, so that corresponds to green, but the question is about the absorbed color. So the absorbed color is the same as the emitted? No, that can't be right because then it would absorb and emit the same color, which wouldn't make sense for a dye.

Ah, wait, perhaps the question is using the term "emits" in the context of fluorescence or phosphorescence. So the molecule absorbs a higher-energy photon, then emits a lower-energy photon.

So the absorbed energy is higher than the emitted. So the emitted wavelength is longer (lower energy) than the absorbed.

So for the emitted energy of 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm (green), the absorbed wavelength must be shorter than that, meaning higher energy, which would be in the blue or violet region.

So the color absorbed would be in the blue or violet range. Looking at the options:

Options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So possible answers are B or C.

Now, I need to figure out if the absorbed color is violet or blue.

Wait, what's the approximate energy for blue and violet?

Violet is around 400-440 nm, which is higher energy than blue (450-495 nm). So the energy for violet would be higher than blue.

Wait, but our emitted wavelength is 530 nm (green), so the absorbed must be shorter than that. Let's compute the energy for, say, 450 nm (blue), which is about 2.75 eV (since E = 1240 / λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / 450 ≈ 2.75 eV). Wait, 1240 is the product hc in eV·nm. So for 450 nm, E is 1240 / 450 ≈ 2.756 eV.

The emitted energy is 2.3393 eV (530 nm). So the absorbed energy is about 2.75 eV, which corresponds to blue light.

Wait, but 450 nm is blue. So the absorbed photon is blue, and the emitted is green. So the absorbed color is blue, right? So the dye absorbs blue light and emits green. Therefore, the color absorbed would be blue, which is option C.

But wait, let me check another wavelength. If the absorbed wavelength is 400 nm (violet), then E is 1240 / 400 = 3.1 eV. Which is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the emitted would be 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the absorbed would be violet, and the emitted green.

Hmm, so depending on where the absorption is, the color absorbed can be either violet or blue. How do I decide which it is?

Wait, the question states that the dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons, which usually implies that the absorption maximum is in the visible range. Extensive conjugation leads to longer wavelengths (lower energy) absorption. So for something like beta-carotene, which is highly conjugated, the absorption is in the visible range, around 450 nm (blue). So maybe the absorbed is in the blue region.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think: molecules with conjugated double bonds absorb in the visible range. The energy gap for conjugated dienes is smaller, so longer wavelengths (lower energy) are absorbed. So for a highly conjugated system, the absorption is towards the red end, but that's for longer conjugation. Wait, no, longer conjugation leads to smaller energy gaps, so lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. So if the molecule has a large conjugated system, it absorbs at a longer wavelength (lower energy).

Wait, wait. The energy of the transition is inversely proportional to the wavelength. So larger conjugated systems have lower energy gaps, so the absorption is at longer wavelengths (lower energy). So if the molecule has a large conjugation, it absorbs in the red or maybe even near-infrared. But in this case, the emission is in green, so the absorption must be blue or violet.

Wait, but if the conjugation is extensive, the absorption might be in the visible, but perhaps not as far as red. So perhaps it's in the blue or green.

Hmm, but the question is about the color absorbed, which would correspond to the higher energy photon. Since the emission is 2.3393 eV (530 nm, green), the absorption is at a higher energy, so shorter wavelength.

If the absorption were in violet (400 nm), that's 3.1 eV, which is higher than 2.3393. So then the emitted would be green.

Alternatively, if the absorption were in blue (450 nm, 2.75 eV), then the emitted is green (2.3393 eV).

So both violet and blue are possible.

But the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

Which one is correct?

Wait, another approach: the color emitted is the complementary color of the absorbed. The emitted color is green, so the absorbed color would be magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. But the options don't have magenta. The closest options are violet and blue.

But the question is about the absorbed color. If the emitted is green, the absorbed would be magenta, but since that's not an option, perhaps the absorbed color is violet or blue. But which one?

Alternatively, the color we see is what's reflected or transmitted. So if the dye emits green, it's because it absorbed another color and then emitted green. So the color absorbed would be the one that's not present in the emitted light.

Wait, but absorption and emission are different. The molecule can't emit a color it doesn't absorb.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the energy.

The energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. So the energy absorbed must be higher than that, because in fluorescence, the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than E=2.3393 eV.

So what color is higher energy than green? Violet is higher (shorter wavelength) than blue and green. So the absorbed color is violet or blue.

But how do I choose between B and C?

Wait, the question says "the organic compound emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV." So the dye emits that energy when it relaxes. That emission is at 530 nm (green). So the absorbed energy must be higher, say, 2.75 eV (blue) or 3.1 eV (violet).

Looking at the options, both B and C are possible. But which one is more likely?

Wait, another angle: the energy difference between absorption and emission is often in the range of a few tenths of an eV, but I'm not sure. Let me compute the energy difference.

If E_absorbed is, say, 2.75 eV (blue), then E_emission is 2.3393 eV. The energy difference is 0.41 eV. That's in the infrared, which is possible.

Alternatively, if E_absorbed is 3.1 eV (violet), then the difference is 0.76 eV, which is in the visible range (green).

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the energy difference would be the energy of the emitted photon. No, wait. E_absorbed is higher than E_emitted. The energy difference is E_absorbed - E_emitted = energy lost as heat or other processes. So the difference is 2.75 - 2.3393 ≈ 0.41 eV. What's that in terms of wavelength? 1240 / 0.41 ≈ 3024 nm, which is infrared. So the molecule would lose that energy as heat or other emissions.

But that's okay, I think.

So whether the absorbed is blue or violet depends on the conjugation length. Extensively conjugated systems usually have lower energy gaps, so the absorption is at longer wavelengths (lower energy). Wait, no. Extensive conjugation reduces the energy gap, so the absorption is at longer (lower energy) wavelengths. So if the molecule has a very long conjugation, the absorption would be in the red or near-infrared, but in this case, the emitted is green, so the absorption must be blue or violet.

Wait, another thought: if the conjugation is extensive, the absorption maximum would be in the visible range but towards the red. But since the emitted is green, the absorption must be in the blue or violet.

Wait, but if the molecule emits green, then the excited state must have an energy corresponding to green. The ground state is lower. The transition upon absorption is from ground to excited state (green's energy). Wait, no. No, the absorption is the energy needed to excite the molecule, so the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the energy of the emitted photon.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Perhaps I should look at the options. The options are A to D, including Violet (B) and Blue (C). So based on the calculation, the emitted energy is 530 nm (green). The absorbed energy must be higher, so either blue (450 nm) or violet (400 nm).

Which is more likely? Well, the question says the molecule has "extensively conjugated pi-electrons". Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. So if the conjugation is extensive, the absorption would be in the red region. But that's conflicting with our earlier conclusion because the emission is green, which is shorter than red.

Wait, no. Wait, the emission is green (530 nm), which is in the middle of the visible spectrum. So if the molecule's absorption is due to extensive conjugation, would that absorption be in the visible range?

Yes, but for extensive conjugation, the absorption is typically in the visible, perhaps even near the red end. So for example, beta-carotene has a strong absorption around 450 nm (blue), which is due to its conjugated structure. So maybe the absorbed color is blue, so the answer is C.

Alternatively, another perspective: the energy emitted (2.3393 eV) would correspond to green. The absorbed energy is higher. The colors above green in energy are blue and violet. So the absorbed color would be either blue or violet. Which one?

The options are B and C. Which one is correct?

Hmm, without more info, perhaps I should think about the options. If the emitted is green, the absorbed is in the blue or violet region.

But wait, the question is about the color of light absorbed. So the correct answer would be the color that has higher energy than green. So the options are B) Violet (higher energy than blue) and C) Blue.

If the emitted is green, the absorbed is blue or violet. Which one is more likely?

Wait, another approach: the energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed energy would be higher. Let's compute the possible colors.

- Violet: approx 400 nm, E = 3.1 eV.
- Blue: 450 nm, E = 2.75 eV.
- Green: 530 nm, E = 2.3393 eV.

So the absorbed photon would have energy of either 2.75 eV or 3.1 eV.

The options are B and C.

In the context of dyes, which usually absorb in the visible range, it's more likely that a dye would absorb in the blue region, allowing it to emit in the green. So the absorbed color would be blue, making the answer C.

Wait, but why? Because dyes typically absorb in the visible range, and blue is in that range. So the answer would be C) Blue.

Alternatively, some dyes may absorb in the violet, but more commonly, they absorb in the blue or green regions.

Wait, another point: the complementary color of green is magenta. But the options don't have magenta. So perhaps the absorbed is blue, because the emitted is green. Wait, no, the complementary color is what's not present, so if the dye emits green, it's because it absorbed the other colors. But that's about the color we see, not the color it absorbs.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up concepts here. The color observed is the one that's not absorbed. But the question is specifically about the color absorbed. So if a compound emits green, what color is it absorbing? It's the color it's absorbing that allows it to emit green.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's just go with the energy calculations.

If the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed energy would be higher. The options for higher energy are violet (B) and blue (C). So of the given options, B and C are possible. Which one is correct?

Well, the question says it's a dye with extensively conjugated pi-electrons. Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. So the absorption would be in the red region. Hmm, but then if the absorption is in red, the emitted would be in a lower energy, which is infrared, which we don't see. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I got this backwards. Extensive conjugation leads to smaller energy gaps, meaning the absorption is at longer wavelengths (lower energy). So if the absorption is in the red, the emission would be in the infrared, which isn't visible. But the emission here is green (visible), which suggests that the energy difference is in the visible range.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. The energy emitted is E, which is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. The energy absorbed is the same as E? No, because in fluorescence, the absorbed energy is higher.

Wait, no. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it's promoted to an excited state. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon. The energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed. So the absorbed energy is higher.

So the energy of the absorbed photon E_abs = E_emit + energy lost (usually as heat or other emissions).

If E_emit is 2.3393 eV, then E_abs must be higher than that. So the absorption is in the blue (2.75 eV) or violet (3.1 eV).

Which one is more likely.

Well, the options are B and C. Let me think about common dyes. Many dyes absorb in the blue region and emit in the green or red. For example, some fluorescent dyes absorb in the UV and emit in the visible, but others absorb in the visible.

If the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorption is in the blue or violet.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to choose. However, since the question gives the options, let's see which makes sense.

If the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed is blue (450 nm) or violet (400 nm). So either B or C is correct.

But wait, 530 nm is green, which is in the middle of the visible spectrum.

The complementary color of green is magenta, which is not one of the options. So perhaps the question is not about the complementary color but the actual absorbed color.

So the correct answer would be the color with higher energy than 2.3393 eV, which is either blue or violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet (higher energy than blue). So why would the dye absorb violet and emit green?

It's possible. So the answer would be B) Violet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: which color has energy higher than 2.3393 eV?

The options are A) Red (1.9 eV?), B) Violet (~3.1 eV), C) Blue (~2.75 eV), D) Yellow (~2.1 eV). Wait, let me check the approximate energies.

Energy in eV for colors:

- Violet: ~3.1 eV (400 nm)
- Blue: ~2.75 eV (450 nm)
- Green: ~2.33 eV (530 nm)
- Yellow: ~2.1 eV (540-570 nm)
- Red: ~1.9 eV (650-700 nm)

So the emitted energy is 2.33 eV (green). The absorbed must be higher than that. So the possible options are B) Violet (3.1 eV) and C) Blue (2.75 eV).

So the correct answer is either B or C.

The question states the compound emits light of 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed energy is higher. So the color absorbed is either violet or blue.

Which one is correct?

In the absence of more information, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet, as it's the higher energy option.

Wait, but I remember that when molecules have conjugated pi systems, the absorption tends to be in the visible range. So, for example, anthocyanins absorb in the blue and red regions. Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the energy of the emitted light is the energy of the photon that is released when the molecule returns to its ground state. The energy absorbed is the one that took it to the excited state, which is higher than the emitted.

So, the question is, what color is absorbed? The absorbed color is the one with higher energy than the emitted.

In the options, the colors with higher energy than green (2.3393 eV) are violet (3.1 eV) and blue (2.75 eV). So the absorbed color is either B or C.

But the question is a multiple-choice with only these options. So the answer is either B or C.

Wait, but the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the color of the emitted light is green. The color absorbed is either blue or violet.

But wait, the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So the correct answer is either B or C.

Without more data, I think the intended answer is B) Violet.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: in the visible spectrum, the colors from lowest to highest energy are: red (~1.9 eV), orange, yellow, green (2.33), blue (2.75), violet (3.1).

The emitted is green (2.3393), so the absorbed must be either blue or violet.

If the question is about the absorbed color, the correct answer is B or C.

But the question is about the color absorbed. So if the molecule emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, which could be violet or blue.

But I'm not certain. Maybe the correct answer is B) Violet.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is misworded, and the energy given is the energy of the absorbed photon. But I don't think so; the question says emitted.

Hmm, given all that, I think the answer is B) Violet.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted light and the absorbed light. The energy of the emitted light is given as \( E_{\text{emit}} = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \), which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = 530 \, \text{nm} \) (green light). 

In fluorescence, the energy of the absorbed photon (\( E_{\text{absorb}} \)) is higher than the energy of the emitted photon (\( E_{\text{emit}} \)) because the molecule loses some energy (e.g., as heat) during the transition from the excited state to the ground state. Therefore, the absorbed photon must have a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than the emitted photon.

The energy of the absorbed photon can be calculated using the relationship \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength. For the emitted light (\( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = 530 \, \text{nm} \)), the energy is:

\[
E_{\text{emit}} = \frac{1240}{\lambda_{\text{emit}}} \approx \frac{1240}{530} \approx 2.3393 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The absorbed photon must have a higher energy, corresponding to a shorter wavelength. For example:
- Violet light (\( \lambda_{\text{violet}} \approx 400 \, \text{nm} \)) has \( E_{\text{violet}} \approx \frac{1240}{400} = 3.1 \, \text{eV} \).
- Blue light (\( \lambda_{\text{blue}} \approx 450 \, \text{nm} \)) has \( E_{\text{blue}} \approx \frac{1240}{450} = 2.75 \, \text{eV} \).

Both violet and blue photons have higher energy than the emitted green photon (\( 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \)), so the absorbed light could be either violet or blue. However, the question specifies that the compound has "extensively conjugated pi-electrons," which typically absorb in the visible range. Extensive conjugation often shifts the absorption to longer wavelengths (lower energy), but the emitted light is green (\( 530 \, \text{nm} \)), indicating that the absorption must still occur at a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than green.

Given the options, violet (\( 3.1 \, \text{eV} \)) and blue (\( 2.75 \, \text{eV} \)) are the only plausible choices. Since the question does not provide additional details about the specific absorption properties of the compound, the most reasonable conclusion is that the absorbed light is violet, as it has a higher energy than blue and aligns with the fluorescence process.

Answer: B
