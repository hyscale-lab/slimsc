Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like a polygon with N sides. All the apothems are the same length, a. Monochromatic light, which means it's a single wavelength λ, is shining along the z-axis, and it's creating intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking about the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my diffraction concepts, but I'll try to think through this. So, an aperture causing diffraction patterns. I remember that for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a certain angle, but here it's an N-sided polygon, and N is infinitely large. Oh wait, when N is very large, the polygon becomes almost like a circle, but maybe not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the apothems being the same makes it a regular polygon, and when N is large, it's like a circle with a certain radius.

Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius (distance from center to a vertex) R. The formula I think is a = R * cos(π/N). But since N is very large, π/N is very small, so cos(π/N) is approximately 1. So a ≈ R. That means the apothem a is almost equal to the radius R when N is large. So the radius of the polygon (the distance from the center to a vertex) is approximately a, right?

Wait, no, wait. The apothem is the distance from the center to a side, which for a regular polygon is a = R * cos(π/N). So if N is very large, π/N approaches zero, so cos(π/N) approaches 1. So a ≈ R. So R is approximately a. But wait, when N approaches infinity, the regular polygon becomes a circle of radius R = a, since a = R * cos(π/N) ≈ R*(1 - (π²)/(2N²))... Hmm, but as N becomes very large, π/N becomes negligible, so a approaches R. So R is roughly equal to a.

But wait, isn't the apothem a the same as R for N approaching infinity? Because for a circle, the apothem would be the same as the radius, since every point on the circle is a vertex. So the polygon's apothem is a, and when N is infinite, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. So the problem reduces to a circular aperture? But wait, the options don't include the 1.22 λ/a value, which is the first minimum for a single slit. Wait, no, option C is 1.22 λ/a.

Wait, what's the formula for the minima in a circular aperture? Oh wait, no, the single-slit is a different case. The circular aperture (like a pinhole) has the first minimum at θ = 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter. But wait, in this case, if the polygon becomes a circle, then the first minimum would be at that 1.22 λ/(2a) angle? Because the radius is a, so diameter is 2a. Let me think: the formula for the first minimum in a circular aperture is when sinθ = 1.22 λ / D. So D is 2a, so sinθ would be 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a. But wait, the options include 0.610 λ/a as option A. But wait, I thought the circular first minimum is at 1.22 λ/(2a) which is 0.61 λ/a. So that would be option A.

But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Oh wait, no! Wait, no, the question is the angular distance between the first two minima. Hmm. Wait, for a single slit, the minima occur at sinθ = m λ / a, where a is the slit width. So for the first minimum, m=1, sinθ = λ/a. Second minimum would be m=2, sinθ =2λ/a. So the angular separation would be the difference in angles between m=1 and m=2.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the polygon is an N-sided polygon, and when N approaches infinity, the apothems are all length a. So what is the condition for the minima in such a case?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the diffraction pattern for a polygonal aperture. When the number of sides N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle. But wait, perhaps the question is referring to a circular aperture, but the options include 1.22 λ/a as option C, which is the first minimum.

Wait, but the question says 'the first two minima' when N is infinitely large. So in that case, perhaps we're looking at a single-slit scenario. Wait, no, a single slit is a different setup. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is analogous to a single slit, but for a circular aperture, the minima are different. Alternatively, maybe it's similar to a rectangular aperture, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: when the aperture is a regular N-gon with apothem a, how does it behave in the far field? The far-field diffraction pattern can be found using the Fourier transform of the aperture function. For a polygon with a very large number of sides, the Fourier transform would approach that of a circle. But wait, the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is the Airy disk, which has a central peak surrounded by concentric rings, with minima at certain radii.

But the question is about the angular separation between the first two minima. In the Airy disk, the first minimum is at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/(2a), which is about 0.61 λ/a. The next minima are at higher angles, but their spacing isn't uniform. Wait, but in the far field, perhaps the minima are spaced more or less regularly, but I'm not certain.

Wait, wait, the question says to take the small angle approximation, tanθ ≈ θ. So the minima occur at certain angles where the path difference leads to destructive interference.

Wait, perhaps I should model the polygon as an aperture that's a circle, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to a square or circular aperture, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Wait, another way: For a circular aperture, the diffraction minima occur at angles where the Bessel function J1 is zero. The first zero of J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317, so sinθ = 3.8317 λ/(π a), but wait, no, I think the formula is sinθ = (1.22) λ/(a), where a is the radius. Because the diameter D=2a, so sinθ=1.22 λ/(D) =1.22 λ/(2a) =0.61 λ/a. So the first minimum is at θ=0.61 λ/a. But that's the first minimum. What about the second?

Wait, the minima in the Airy pattern occur at higher orders. The first minimum is at ~1.22 λ/a (if a is the radius), but wait, I'm getting confused between radius and diameter.

Wait, let's clarify. For a circular aperture, the condition for minima is when J1(k a sinθ) =0, where k=2π/λ. The first zero of J1 is at around 3.8317, so:

k a sinθ = 3.8317 → sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a). Let me compute this factor: 3.8317/(2π) ≈ 3.8317 /6.283 ≈ 0.61. So sinθ ≈ 0.61 λ/a → θ ≈ 0.61 λ/a (since angle is small, so sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ).

So the first minimum is at θ ≈ 0.61 λ/a. What about the second minimum? The next zero of J1 is at around 7.0156. So sinθ =7.0156 λ/(2π a) → sinθ ≈ (7.0156)/(6.283) λ/a → approx 1.116 λ/a. But that's about 1.116 λ/a, which is beyond 90 degrees, which isn't possible because sinθ can't be more than 1. So that suggests that the second minimum might not exist in the first diffraction pattern, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the zeros of the derivatives. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, no, the zeros of J1 are at 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, etc. So for the first minimum, it's 3.8317, the second is 7.0156, but when we plug in, for the second minimum, sinθ = 7.0156 λ/(2π a). Let's compute 7.0156/(2π) ≈ 7.0156/6.283 ≈ 1.116. So sinθ would be 1.116 λ/a. But λ and a are positive quantities, so for sinθ to be ≤1, 1.116 λ/a must be ≤1. So if a is large enough, but in the problem, a is fixed. Wait, but when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle of radius a? Or is the diameter 2a?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in whether a is the radius or the apothem. Since the apothem is a, and for a regular polygon, the radius (distance from center to vertex) is R = a / cos(π/N). When N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R approaches a. So the radius of the polygon is approximately a when N is large.

So the diameter is 2a. So the first minimum for a circular aperture is at sinθ = 1.22 λ/(D) = 1.22 λ/(2a) → 0.61 λ/a, which is the first minimum.

But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So, first minimum at θ1 ≈ 0.61 λ/a, second at θ2.

Wait, but for a circular aperture, each ring corresponds to higher orders. The first minimum is the first ring, then the second, etc. But the angular positions are determined by the zeros of the Bessel functions.

Wait, but the angular separation between the first two minima would be the difference between θ2 and θ1. Let's compute θ1 and θ2.

θ1 is for the first zero of J1: 3.8317 → sinθ1 = 3.8317 λ/(2π a). So θ1 ≈ 3.8317 λ/(2π a) ≈ (3.8317)/(6.283) λ/a ≈ 0.61 λ/a.

The next zero of J1 is at 7.0156. So sinθ2 = 7.0156 λ/(2π a) → 7.0156/(2π) ≈ 1.116. But since sinθ can't be more than 1, this would imply that the next minimum is beyond 90 degrees, which likely isn't possible for the first set of minima in the far field. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong Bessel function. Wait, the intensity in the far field for a circular aperture is given by the square of the Bessel function J1(ka sinθ) divided by J0(ka sinθ), or something like that. Alternatively, the zeros of J1(k a sinθ) give the minima.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the question isn't about a circular aperture but about a polygon with a very large N, which approximates a different shape.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when N is very large, the polygon can be approximated as a square or a rectangle. Wait, no, a polygon with a very large N would approximate a circle, not a square.

Wait, another approach: the problem is about an aperture that's a regular N-gon, with all apothems equal to a. When N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle of radius a (since apothem a= R cos(π/N) → R≈a when N is large). So the problem reduces to a circular aperture with radius a.

But for a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern (Fraunhofer) is the Airy disk. The positions of the minima (the dark rings) are given by the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first minimum is at θ = 1.22 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.61 λ/a. But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So if the first minimum is at θ1, and the second at θ2, then the separation is θ2 - θ1.

But earlier, when using the J1 zeros, the second zero is at x=7.0156. So, the angle θ2 would be 7.0156 λ/(2π a). Let's compute that. 7.0156/(2π) ≈ 7.0156/6.283 ≈ 1.116. So sinθ2 = 1.116 λ/a. But wait, that's greater than 1. So that's not possible. So that suggests that the second minimum would be at θ where sinθ =1, meaning θ=90 degrees. But that can't be right because for a circular aperture, the minima occur at angles less than 90 degrees.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me compute 7.0156 divided by (2π) more accurately. 7.0156 /6.2832 ≈ approximately 1.116, which is greater than 1. So that would imply that the second minimum occurs beyond 90 degrees, which isn't possible. Therefore, perhaps the first minimum is the only one in the far field before 90 degrees.

Wait, that can't be. There must be more minima. Oh wait, perhaps I'm confusing the zeros of J1. Let me check the zeros of J1 again. The first zero is at x=3.8317, second at x=7.0156, third at x=10.1735, etc. So for a circular aperture with radius a, the minima occur at x = ka sinθ = 3.8317, 7.0156, etc.

So the first minimum is at θ1 = arcsin(3.8317 λ/(2π a)) ≈ 0.61 λ/a.

The second minimum would be at x=7.0156, so θ2 = arcsin(7.0156 λ/(2π a)).

But wait, 7.0156/(2π) is approximately 1.116. So (7.0156 λ)/(2π a) = (7.0156/6.2832) * λ/a ≈ 1.116 * λ/a.

So sinθ2 = 1.116 λ/a. But since sinθ cannot exceed 1, this would only be possible if 1.116 λ/a ≤1 → λ/a ≤0.897. Otherwise, it's impossible, meaning θ2 would be beyond 90 degrees.

Wait, but in the context of the problem, perhaps a is sufficiently large that 1.116 λ/a is less than 1. Or perhaps the problem is considering only the first minimum and the next possible minima within the same pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the minima in the intensity pattern of a single slit, which is a different scenario. For a single slit of width a, the minima occur at θ = m λ / a, where m is an integer (±1, ±2, etc.). So the first minimum is at θ1 = λ/a, the second at θ2=2λ/a, and so on. The angular separation between the first two minima would be θ2 - θ1 = (2λ/a) - (λ/a) )= λ/a.

But wait, none of the options have λ/a as an option. Let me check the options again. Option B is 0.500 λ/a, option D is 0.506 λ/a, option C is 1.220 λ/a.

Wait, but if the angular separation for single-slit would be λ/a, but that's not an option. Hmm. So perhaps the problem isn't a single-slit scenario.

Wait, perhaps the polygonal aperture is being treated as a circular one, and the minima are being considered as the first and second zeros of the Bessel function. But the second zero is beyond 90 degrees, which is not possible, so maybe the problem is considering only the first minimum and the next possible one within the visible range.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not a circular but a square aperture. Wait, but N is approaching infinity, so it's a circle.

Another thought: perhaps the question is about the diffraction pattern for a polygon which, when N→infinite, becomes a circle, but the problem is considering the minima due to different orders of interference.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the polygon as a circular aperture and find the angular separation between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern. But in that case, as discussed earlier, the first two minima are at θ1≈0.61 λ/a and θ2= ... but the second minimum is beyond 90 degrees, which is not possible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the zeros of the Bessel function. Wait, for the Airy pattern, the minima occur where J1(ka sinθ) is zero, so the first minimum is at θ1 where ka sinθ1 = 3.8317, and the second at ka sinθ2=7.0156.

But if ka is small (since a is large compared to λ), then θ would be small. Let's compute ka sinθ1 = 3.8317 → ka sinθ1 = (2π/λ) a sinθ1 = 3.8317 → sinθ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a) → θ1 ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a) (since for small angles, sinθ ≈θ).

Similarly, for the second minimum, sinθ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(2π a) → θ2 ≈ (7.0156 λ)/(2π a).

So the angular separation is θ2 - θ1 = [7.0156 -3.8317] λ/(2π a) = (3.1839) λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.506 λ/a.

Wait, because 3.1839 / (2π) ≈ 3.1839/6.283 ≈ 0.506. So the separation is about 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.

Wait, but this assumes that both minima are present within the visible range. So the first minimum is at ~0.61 λ/a, second at ~1.116 λ/a. But 1.116 λ/a might be beyond 90 degrees if a is small. But if a is large enough, it's acceptable.

Wait, but the problem says the angles are small, so tanθ ≈ θ. So maybe the second minimum is beyond the small angle approximation, but the problem states that the approximation can be taken. So perhaps only the first two minima within the small angle region are considered, but in reality, the second minimum is beyond θ=90, which is not in the far field. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about a circular aperture but about a polygon that approximates a different shape, such as a square, but that would require a different approach.

Wait, but earlier calculations gave me an angular separation of about 0.506 λ/a, which is option D. Let me see if this makes sense. So, the first minimum at θ1= 3.8317 λ/(2π a) ≈0.61 λ/a, the second at θ2=7.0156 λ/(2π a)≈1.116 λ/a. The difference θ2 - θ1 ≈ (7.0156 -3.8317) * λ/(2π a) = (3.1839) * λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.506 λ/a.

So the angular separation between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.

The problem involves a monochromatic light of wavelength $\lambda$ falling vertically on an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon with all apothems equal to $a$. When $N$ approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle of radius approximately $a$. The task is to determine the angular distance between the first two intensity minima in the far-field diffraction pattern, assuming small angles where $\tan\theta \approx \theta$.

For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is described by the Airy disk, and the minima occur where the Bessel function $J_1(k a \sin\theta)$ has zeros. The zeros of $J_1(x)$ are at $x = 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, \dots$. The condition for the minima is:

\[
k a \sin\theta = \text{zero of } J_1,
\]

where $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$. For small angles, $\sin\theta \approx \theta$, so the angular positions of the minima are approximately:

\[
\theta_m = \frac{\text{zero of } J_1}{k a}.
\]

The first minimum corresponds to the first zero of $J_1$, $x = 3.8317$, giving:

\[
\theta_1 \approx \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

The second minimum corresponds to the second zero of $J_1$, $x = 7.0156$, giving:

\[
\theta_2 \approx \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

The angular separation between the first two minima is:

\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{(7.0156 - 3.8317) \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\Delta\theta \approx \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

Using $\frac{3.1839}{2\pi} \approx 0.506$, the angular separation is approximately:

\[
\Delta\theta \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima is $0.506 \lambda / a$, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like a polygon with N sides. All the apothems are the same length, a. Monochromatic light, which means it's a single wavelength λ, is shining along the z-axis, and it's creating intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking about the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my diffraction concepts, but I'll try to think through this. So, an aperture causing diffraction patterns. I remember that for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a certain angle, but here it's an N-sided polygon, and N is infinitely large. Oh wait, when N is very large, the polygon becomes almost like a circle, but maybe not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the apothems being the same makes it a regular polygon, and when N is large, it's like a circle with a certain radius.

Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius (distance from center to a vertex) R. The formula I think is a = R * cos(π/N). But since N is very large, π/N is very small, so cos(π/N) is approximately 1. So a ≈ R. That means the apothem a is almost equal to the radius R when N is large. So the radius of the polygon (the distance from the center to a vertex) is approximately a, right?

Wait, no, wait. The apothem is the distance from the center to a side, which for a regular polygon is a = R * cos(π/N). So if N is very large, π/N approaches zero, so cos(π/N) approaches 1. So a ≈ R. So R is approximately a. But wait, when N approaches infinity, the regular polygon becomes a circle of radius R = a, since a = R * cos(π/N) ≈ R*(1 - (π²)/(2N²))... Hmm, but as N becomes very large, π/N becomes negligible, so a approaches R. So R is roughly equal to a.

But wait, isn't the apothem a the same as R for N approaching infinity? Because for a circle, the apothem would be the same as the radius, since every point on the circle is a vertex. So the polygon's apothem is a, and when N is infinite, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. So the problem reduces to a circular aperture? But wait, the options don't include the 1.22 λ/a value, which is the first minimum for a single slit. Wait, no, option C is 1.22 λ/a.

Wait, what's the formula for the minima in a circular aperture? Oh wait, no, the single-slit is a different case. The circular aperture (like a pinhole) has the first minimum at θ = 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter. But wait, in this case, if the polygon becomes a circle, then the first minimum would be at that 1.22 λ/(2a) angle? Because the radius is a, so diameter is 2a. Let me think: the formula for the first minimum in a circular aperture is when sinθ = 1.22 λ / D. So D is 2a, so sinθ would be 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a. But wait, the options include 0.610 λ/a as option A. But wait, I thought the circular first minimum is at 1.22 λ/(2a) which is 0.61 λ/a. So that would be option A.

But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Oh wait, no! Wait, no, the question is the angular distance between the first two minima. Hmm. Wait, for a single slit, the minima occur at sinθ = m λ / a, where a is the slit width. So for the first minimum, m=1, sinθ = λ/a. Second minimum would be m=2, sinθ =2λ/a. So the angular separation would be the difference in angles between m=1 and m=2.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the polygon is an N-sided polygon, and when N approaches infinity, the apothems are all length a. So what is the condition for the minima in such a case?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the diffraction pattern for a polygonal aperture. When the number of sides N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle. But wait, perhaps the question is referring to a circular aperture, but the options include 1.22 λ/a as option C, which is the first minimum.

Wait, but the question says 'the first two minima' when N is infinitely large. So in that case, perhaps we're looking at a single-slit scenario. Wait, no, a single slit is a different setup. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is analogous to a single slit, but for a circular aperture, the minima are different. Alternatively, maybe it's similar to a rectangular aperture, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: when the aperture is a regular N-gon with apothem a, how does it behave in the far field? The far-field diffraction pattern can be found using the Fourier transform of the aperture function. For a polygon with a very large number of sides, the Fourier transform would approach that of a circle. But wait, the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is the Airy disk, which has a central peak surrounded by concentric rings, with minima at certain radii.

But the question is about the angular separation between the first two minima. In the Airy disk, the first minimum is at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/(2a), which is about 0.61 λ/a. The next minima are at higher angles, but their spacing isn't uniform. Wait, but in the far field, perhaps the minima are spaced more or less regularly, but I'm not certain.

Wait, wait, the question says to take the small angle approximation, tanθ ≈ θ. So the minima occur at certain angles where the path difference leads to destructive interference.

Wait, perhaps I should model the polygon as an aperture that's a circle, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to a square or circular aperture, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Wait, another way: For a circular aperture, the diffraction minima occur at angles where the Bessel function J1 is zero. The first zero of J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317, so sinθ = 3.8317 λ/(π a), but wait, no, I think the formula is sinθ = (1.22) λ/(a), where a is the radius. Because the diameter D=2a, so sinθ=1.22 λ/(D) =1.22 λ/(2a) =0.61 λ/a. So the first minimum is at θ=0.61 λ/a. But that's the first minimum. What about the second?

Wait, the minima in the Airy pattern occur at higher orders. The first minimum is at ~1.22 λ/a (if a is the radius), but wait, I'm getting confused between radius and diameter.

Wait, let's clarify. For a circular aperture, the condition for minima is when J1(k a sinθ) =0, where k=2π/λ. The first zero of J1 is at around 3.8317, so:

k a sinθ = 3.8317 → sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a). Let me compute this factor: 3.8317/(2π) ≈ 3.8317 /6.283 ≈ 0.61. So sinθ ≈ 0.61 λ/a → θ ≈ 0.61 λ/a (since angle is small, so sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ).

So the first minimum is at θ ≈ 0.61 λ/a. What about the second minimum? The next zero of J1 is at around 7.0156. So sinθ =7.0156 λ/(2π a) → sinθ ≈ (7.0156)/(6.283) λ/a → approx 1.116 λ/a. But that's about 1.116 λ/a, which is beyond 90 degrees, which isn't possible because sinθ can't be more than 1. So that suggests that the second minimum might not exist in the first diffraction pattern, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the zeros of the derivatives. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, no, the zeros of J1 are at 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, etc. So for the first minimum, it's 3.8317, the second is 7.0156, but when we plug in, for the second minimum, sinθ = 7.0156 λ/(2π a). Let's compute 7.0156/(2π) ≈ 7.0156/6.283 ≈ 1.116. So sinθ would be 1.116 λ/a. But λ and a are positive quantities, so for sinθ to be ≤1, 1.116 λ/a must be ≤1. So if a is large enough, but in the problem, a is fixed. Wait, but when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle of radius a? Or is the diameter 2a?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in whether a is the radius or the apothem. Since the apothem is a, and for a regular polygon, the radius (distance from center to vertex) is R = a / cos(π/N). When N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R approaches a. So the radius of the polygon is approximately a when N is large.

So the diameter is 2a. So the first minimum for a circular aperture is at sinθ = 1.22 λ/(D) = 1.22 λ/(2a) → 0.61 λ/a, which is the first minimum.

But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So, first minimum at θ1 ≈ 0.61 λ/a, second at θ2.

Wait, but for a circular aperture, each ring corresponds to higher orders. The first minimum is the first ring, then the second, etc. But the angular positions are determined by the zeros of the Bessel functions.

Wait, but the angular separation between the first two minima would be the difference between θ2 and θ1. Let's compute θ1 and θ2.

θ1 is for the first zero of J1: 3.8317 → sinθ1 = 3.8317 λ/(2π a). So θ1 ≈ 3.8317 λ/(2π a) ≈ (3.8317)/(6.283) λ/a ≈ 0.61 λ/a.

The next zero of J1 is at 7.0156. So sinθ2 = 7.0156 λ/(2π a) → 7.0156/(2π) ≈ 1.116. But since sinθ can't be more than 1, this would imply that the next minimum is beyond 90 degrees, which likely isn't possible for the first set of minima in the far field. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong Bessel function. Wait, the intensity in the far field for a circular aperture is given by the square of the Bessel function J1(ka sinθ) divided by J0(ka sinθ), or something like that. Alternatively, the zeros of J1(k a sinθ) give the minima.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the question isn't about a circular aperture but about a polygon with a very large N, which approximates a different shape.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when N is very large, the polygon can be approximated as a square or a rectangle. Wait, no, a polygon with a very large N would approximate a circle, not a square.

Wait, another approach: the problem is about an aperture that's a regular N-gon, with all apothems equal to a. When N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle of radius a (since apothem a= R cos(π/N) → R≈a when N is large). So the problem reduces to a circular aperture with radius a.

But for a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern (Fraunhofer) is the Airy disk. The positions of the minima (the dark rings) are given by the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first minimum is at θ = 1.22 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.61 λ/a. But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So if the first minimum is at θ1, and the second at θ2, then the separation is θ2 - θ1.

But earlier, when using the J1 zeros, the second zero is at x=7.0156. So, the angle θ2 would be 7.0156 λ/(2π a). Let's compute that. 7.0156/(2π) ≈ 7.0156/6.283 ≈ 1.116. So sinθ2 = 1.116 λ/a. But wait, that's greater than 1. So that's not possible. So that suggests that the second minimum would be at θ where sinθ =1, meaning θ=90 degrees. But that can't be right because for a circular aperture, the minima occur at angles less than 90 degrees.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me compute 7.0156 divided by (2π) more accurately. 7.0156 /6.2832 ≈ approximately 1.116, which is greater than 1. So that would imply that the second minimum occurs beyond 90 degrees, which isn't possible. Therefore, perhaps the first minimum is the only one in the far field before 90 degrees.

Wait, that can't be. There must be more minima. Oh wait, perhaps I'm confusing the zeros of J1. Let me check the zeros of J1 again. The first zero is at x=3.8317, second at x=7.0156, third at x=10.1735, etc. So for a circular aperture with radius a, the minima occur at x = ka sinθ = 3.8317, 7.0156, etc.

So the first minimum is at θ1 = arcsin(3.8317 λ/(2π a)) ≈ 0.61 λ/a.

The second minimum would be at x=7.0156, so θ2 = arcsin(7.0156 λ/(2π a)).

But wait, 7.0156/(2π) is approximately 1.116. So (7.0156 λ)/(2π a) = (7.0156/6.2832) * λ/a ≈ 1.116 * λ/a.

So sinθ2 = 1.116 λ/a. But since sinθ cannot exceed 1, this would only be possible if 1.116 λ/a ≤1 → λ/a ≤0.897. Otherwise, it's impossible, meaning θ2 would be beyond 90 degrees.

Wait, but in the context of the problem, perhaps a is sufficiently large that 1.116 λ/a is less than 1. Or perhaps the problem is considering only the first minimum and the next possible minima within the same pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the minima in the intensity pattern of a single slit, which is a different scenario. For a single slit of width a, the minima occur at θ = m λ / a, where m is an integer (±1, ±2, etc.). So the first minimum is at θ1 = λ/a, the second at θ2=2λ/a, and so on. The angular separation between the first two minima would be θ2 - θ1 = (2λ/a) - (λ/a) )= λ/a.

But wait, none of the options have λ/a as an option. Let me check the options again. Option B is 0.500 λ/a, option D is 0.506 λ/a, option C is 1.220 λ/a.

Wait, but if the angular separation for single-slit would be λ/a, but that's not an option. Hmm. So perhaps the problem isn't a single-slit scenario.

Wait, perhaps the polygonal aperture is being treated as a circular one, and the minima are being considered as the first and second zeros of the Bessel function. But the second zero is beyond 90 degrees, which is not possible, so maybe the problem is considering only the first minimum and the next possible one within the visible range.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not a circular but a square aperture. Wait, but N is approaching infinity, so it's a circle.

Another thought: perhaps the question is about the diffraction pattern for a polygon which, when N→infinite, becomes a circle, but the problem is considering the minima due to different orders of interference.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the polygon as a circular aperture and find the angular separation between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern. But in that case, as discussed earlier, the first two minima are at θ1≈0.61 λ/a and θ2= ... but the second minimum is beyond 90 degrees, which is not possible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the zeros of the Bessel function. Wait, for the Airy pattern, the minima occur where J1(ka sinθ) is zero, so the first minimum is at θ1 where ka sinθ1 = 3.8317, and the second at ka sinθ2=7.0156.

But if ka is small (since a is large compared to λ), then θ would be small. Let's compute ka sinθ1 = 3.8317 → ka sinθ1 = (2π/λ) a sinθ1 = 3.8317 → sinθ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a) → θ1 ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a) (since for small angles, sinθ ≈θ).

Similarly, for the second minimum, sinθ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(2π a) → θ2 ≈ (7.0156 λ)/(2π a).

So the angular separation is θ2 - θ1 = [7.0156 -3.8317] λ/(2π a) = (3.1839) λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.506 λ/a.

Wait, because 3.1839 / (2π) ≈ 3.1839/6.283 ≈ 0.506. So the separation is about 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.

Wait, but this assumes that both minima are present within the visible range. So the first minimum is at ~0.61 λ/a, second at ~1.116 λ/a. But 1.116 λ/a might be beyond 90 degrees if a is small. But if a is large enough, it's acceptable.

Wait, but the problem says the angles are small, so tanθ ≈ θ. So maybe the second minimum is beyond the small angle approximation, but the problem states that the approximation can be taken. So perhaps only the first two minima within the small angle region are considered, but in reality, the second minimum is beyond θ=90, which is not in the far field. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about a circular aperture but about a polygon that approximates a different shape, such as a square, but that would require a different approach.

Wait, but earlier calculations gave me an angular separation of about 0.506 λ/a, which is option D. Let me see if this makes sense. So, the first minimum at θ1= 3.8317 λ/(2π a) ≈0.61 λ/a, the second at θ2=7.0156 λ/(2π a)≈1.116 λ/a. The difference θ2 - θ1 ≈ (7.0156 -3.8317) * λ/(2π a) = (3.1839) * λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.506 λ/a.

So the angular separation between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.


The problem involves a monochromatic light of wavelength $\lambda$ falling vertically on an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon with all apothems equal to $a$. When $N$ approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle of radius approximately $a$. The task is to determine the angular distance between the first two intensity minima in the far-field diffraction pattern, assuming small angles where $\tan\theta \approx \theta$.

For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is described by the Airy disk, and the minima occur where the Bessel function $J_1(k a \sin\theta)$ has zeros. The zeros of $J_1(x)$ are at $x = 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, \dots$. The condition for the minima is:

\[
k a \sin\theta = \text{zero of } J_1,
\]

where $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$. For small angles, $\sin\theta \approx \theta$, so the angular positions of the minima are approximately:

\[
\theta_m = \frac{\text{zero of } J_1}{k a}.
\]

The first minimum corresponds to the first zero of $J_1$, $x = 3.8317$, giving:

\[
\theta_1 \approx \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

The second minimum corresponds to the second zero of $J_1$, $x = 7.0156$, giving:

\[
\theta_2 \approx \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

The angular separation between the first two minima is:

\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{(7.0156 - 3.8317) \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\Delta\theta \approx \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

Using $\frac{3.1839}{2\pi} \approx 0.506$, the angular separation is approximately:

\[
\Delta\theta \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima is $0.506 \lambda / a$, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
