Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves the planet passing in front of its star, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period (three times shorter than Planet_2). Their host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but same radii. Interesting.

So, the goal is to find out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability formula, I think, is P = R_star / (a * (1 + sqrt(M_planet/(M_star)) )) ), but wait, no. Let me think. Oh right, the transit probability depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet relative to the distance, but more precisely, the geometric probability. 

The geometric probability for a planet to transit is given by the formula P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, maybe R_planet can be neglected. So P ≈ R_star / a. But wait, that's the basic idea, but there are other factors too. Oh wait, no, the probability is actually higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on to our line of sight. The probability depends on the alignment. The formula I remember is P = (R_star / a) / (1 - e²)^½ ), but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so it's just R_star/(a). So more accurately, P = (R*) / a, where R* is the star's radius and a is the orbital semi-major axis. But wait, another thought: this is a simplified version. The actual formula also depends on the planet's orbital inclination. But since the planets are already detected via the RV method, which gives a lower limit on the mass, their true mass is at least the minimum mass. But in this question, both have the same mass, so maybe that's not a factor here.

Wait, but another approach: the probability of transit is proportional to (R_star / a) times the solid angle, but I think the main factor is (R_star / a). But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another way: the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is approximately (R_star / a), assuming a uniform distribution of orbital inclinations. So higher a would mean lower probability.

But wait, a is the semi-major axis. How do we find a? The period is given via Kepler's third law. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M_star)) * a³. So a³ = [G(M_star) (P/(2π))² ].

Alternatively, a^3 = [ G(M_star + M_planet) P² ] / (4π² ). But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So a is proportional to (M_star * P² )^(1/3).

Wait, let's write Kepler's third law as a^3 = (G (M_star) P^2 )/(4 π² ). So a = [ (G M_star P^2 )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3).

So a is proportional to (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3).

But in the question, Planet_1's period is 3 times shorter than Planet_2's. So P_1 = (1/3) P_2.

But also, M_1 (the host star of Planet_1) is twice the mass of M_2 (host of Planet_2). So M_1 = 2 M_2.

So let's compute a_1 and a_2.

a_1 = [ G * M_1 * (P_1)^2 / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3) = [ G * (2 M_2) * (P_2/3)^2 / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3)

= [ (G M_2 P_2² / (4 π² )) * (2) * (1/9) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (a_2^3 ) * (2/9) ) ]^(1/3 )

So a_1^3 = a_2^3 * (2/9) → a_1 = a_2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

Wait, 2/9 is 2/(3^2). So cube root of 2 is about 1.26, cube root of 9 is about 2.08. 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.606. So a_1 is approximately 0.606 times a_2.

Wait, but let me calculate (2/9)^(1/3). Let me compute 2/9 = 0.2222. Cube root of 0.2222 is roughly 0.606, as before.

So a_1 = a_2 * 0.606.

Now, the transit probability is P = R_star / a. Both stars have the same radius, R*. So P_1 = R* / a_1, P_2 = R* / a_2.

So let's compute P_1 / P_2 = (R*/a_1) / (R* / a_2) ) = a_2 / a_1.

Since a_1 = 0.606 a_2 → a_2 / a_1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P_1 is about 1.65 times higher than P_2. So Planet_1 has higher probability.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, a_1 = ( (M_1 * P_1² ) / M_2 * P_2² ) )^(1/3) ) * a_2.

Wait, perhaps a better way to compute the ratio a_1/a_2.

a ∝ (M * P² )^(1/3)

So a_1 / a_2 = [ (M_1 / M_2) * (P_1² / P_2²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Given M_1 = 2 M_2, P_1 = P_2 / 3.

So (M_1/M_2) = 2.

(P_1² / P_2² ) = ( (1/3) P_2 )² / P_2² = (1/9) P_2² / P_2² = 1/9.

So (a_1/a_2) = (2 * 1/9 )^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.2222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a_1 = 0.606 a_2.

So, the transit probability is proportional to R*/a. Since R* is same for both, P_1 = R*/a_1, P_2 = R*/a_2.

So P_1 / P_2 = (R*/a_1) / (R*/a_2) ) = a_2/a_1 = 1/(0.606) ≈ 1.65.

So P_1 is about 1.65 times P_2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability. Therefore, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1. 

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred with ~1.65 times higher probability.

So the correct answer is C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star}} \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \).

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( a \propto \left( M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \right)^{1/3} \), where \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)).
- Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's (\( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \)).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}P_2\right)^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Approximating \( \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \), we find \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \). Thus, Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's.

The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

Alternatively, a^3 = [ G(M_star + M_planet) P² ] / (4π² ). But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So a is proportional to (M_star * P² )^(1/3).

Wait, let's write Kepler's third law as a^3 = (G (M_star) P^2 )/(4 π² ). So a = [ (G M_star P^2 )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3).

So a is proportional to (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3).

But also, M_1 (the host star of Planet_1) is twice the mass of M_2 (host of Planet_2). So M_1 = 2 M_2.

So let's compute a_1 and a_2.

a_1 = [ G * M_1 * (P_1)^2 / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3) = [ G * (2 M_2) * (P_2/3)^2 / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3)

= [ (G M_2 P_2² / (4 π² )) * (2) * (1/9) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (a_2^3 ) * (2/9) ) ]^(1/3 )

So a_1^3 = a_2^3 * (2/9) → a_1 = a_2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

Wait, 2/9 is 2/(3^2). So cube root of 2 is about 1.26, cube root of 9 is about 2.08. 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.606. So a_1 is approximately 0.606 times a_2.

Wait, but let me calculate (2/9)^(1/3). Let me compute 2/9 = 0.2222. Cube root of 0.2222 is roughly 0.606, as before.

So a_1 = a_2 * 0.606.

Now, the transit probability is P = R_star / a. Both stars have the same radius, R*. So P_1 = R* / a_1, P_2 = R* / a_2.

So let's compute P_1 / P_2 = (R*/a_1) / (R* / a_2) ) = a_2 / a_1.

Since a_1 = 0.606 a_2 → a_2 / a_1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P_1 is about 1.65 times higher than P_2. So Planet_1 has higher probability.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, a_1 = ( (M_1 * P_1² ) / M_2 * P_2² ) )^(1/3) ) * a_2.

Wait, perhaps a better way to compute the ratio a_1/a_2.

a ∝ (M * P² )^(1/3)

So a_1 / a_2 = [ (M_1 / M_2) * (P_1² / P_2²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Given M_1 = 2 M_2, P_1 = P_2 / 3.

So (M_1/M_2) = 2.

(P_1² / P_2² ) = ( (1/3) P_2 )² / P_2² = (1/9) P_2² / P_2² = 1/9.

So (a_1/a_2) = (2 * 1/9 )^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.2222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a_1 = 0.606 a_2.

So, the transit probability is proportional to R*/a. Since R* is same for both, P_1 = R*/a_1, P_2 = R*/a_2.

So P_1 / P_2 = (R*/a_1) / (R*/a_2) ) = a_2/a_1 = 1/(0.606) ≈ 1.65.

So P_1 is about 1.65 times P_2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability. Therefore, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1. 

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred with ~1.65 times higher probability.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star}} \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \).

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( a \propto \left( M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \right)^{1/3} \), where \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)).
- Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's (\( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \)).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}P_2\right)^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Approximating \( \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \), we find \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \). Thus, Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's.

The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.
