Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. 

The problem is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that in such a system, the potential is symmetric and the solutions can be found using the properties of the harmonic oscillator in each dimension.

Wait, right, for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, since it's isotropic, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh, right, in 3D, the energy depends on the principal quantum number n, where n = nx + ny + nz. Hmm, no, wait, more accurately, each direction (x, y, z) has its own quantum number (nx, ny, nz), and the total energy is given by E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n = nx + ny + nz. Or wait, is it (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) multiplied by ħω? Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Yes, that makes sense.

The question is about the third excited state. Hmm, excited states are counted starting from the ground state. The ground state is the lowest energy level. The first excited state is the next higher energy level, and so on. So the third excited state would be the fourth energy level above the ground state.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The ground state is n=0 (n = nx + ny + nz =0), which gives E= (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be the next energy level, which is when n=1. So E = (1 + 3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω. Second excited is n=2, E=(7/2) ħω. Third excited is n=3, E= (3 +3/2) = 9/2 ħω. Oh wait, so the third excited state's energy is (9/2) ħω. So looking at the options, that's option A and C. 

Now, the second part of the question: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue? That is, how many distinct eigenfunctions share the same energy level (the degeneracy).

In 3D harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy for a given n is given by the number of ways the sum of three non-negative integers (nx, ny, nz) equals n. So the number of states is (n + 2 choose 2), or (n+1)(n+2)/2? Wait, no, wait, the formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to nx + ny + nz = n is (n + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) ) = (n+2 choose 2) = (n+2)(n+1)/2. 

So for n=3 (third excited state), the degeneracy is (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5*4/2 =10. So the number of eigenfunctions is 10. 

Looking back at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω , 10. Option C says 9/2 ħω and 3, which is incorrect. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the states. Because, in 3D harmonic oscillator, the states are also sometimes considered in terms of their angular momentum quantum numbers, but for the isotropic case, the energy depends only on n = nx + ny + nz. So the degeneracy is as I thought.

So the energy is 9/2 ħω, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. So the correct choice is A.

The problem involves a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the potential is given by \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). In such a system, the energy levels are determined by the quantum numbers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) in the three spatial dimensions, with the total energy given by:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left( n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2} \right),
\]

where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the principal quantum number. The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for a given \( n \) is determined by the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = n \), which is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{n + 2}{2} = \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2}.
\]

The question asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state. The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second excited state to \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( n = 3 \). For \( n = 3 \), the energy is:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left( 3 + \frac{3}{2} \right) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy for \( n = 3 \) is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(3 + 1)(3 + 2)}{2} = \frac{4 \cdot 5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and the degeneracy is 10. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \).**
