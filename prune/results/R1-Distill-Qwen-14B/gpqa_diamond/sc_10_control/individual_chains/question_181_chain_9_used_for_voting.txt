Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux question. Hmm, neutrinos from the Sun... I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and the pp-chain is one of the main ones. Oh wait, the question is about the pp-III branch stopping. I think the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton cycle, which is the dominant process in the Sun's core for generating energy.

So, when the pp-III branch stops, what happens? I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. The pp-III branch involves reactions that produce helium-4 nuclei. If this stops, then the Sun's core might not be producing as much energy in that part. But wait, the question says only the pp-III branch stops, others remain the same. So other reactions, like maybe the CNO cycle or other branches, continue unaffected.

Neutrinos are produced in various processes. The main ones are the electron neutrinos from the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle. Oh, and there are also other types like muon and tau neutrinos, but the question says flavor changes don't matter here, so we can ignore that.

So, the flux of neutrinos depends on the rate of the reactions producing them. If the pp-III branch stops, which neutrinos are affected? The pp-III branch produces neutrinos, right? So if that stops, the rate of neutrinos from that process would drop.

Wait, but the pp-III is a part of the overall pp-chain. Let me think: the main pp-chain starts with two protons fusing into deuterium, then another proton to form helium-3, and then two helium-3 fusing into helium-4. Oh wait, maybe that's the pp-I branch. And the pp-II and pp-III are sub-processes, perhaps involving different paths or reactions. Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch involves the emission of a positron or something, which would produce a neutrino. Oh wait! The proton-proton chain in its main form (like the pp-I branch) produces a positron and a neutrino. So, each proton-proton fusion step emits a neutrino.

Wait, so each of these reactions contributes to the neutrino flux. If the pp-III branch stops, then the number of neutrinos from that particular part would decrease. But how significant is the pp-III branch compared to the others?

I think the pp-III branch is one of the main contributors. Oh wait, no, actually, in the standard pp-chain, the dominant process is the pp-I branch. The pp-II and pp-III are minor. Wait, perhaps the pp-III is a minor branch compared to the main pp-I. So if pp-III stops, the overall neutrino production from the pp-chain decreases a bit, but maybe not by a huge amount?

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of fluxes between two specific energy bands. So if pp-III is stopped, which of these bands are affected more?

Neutrinos from the pp-chain have lower energies compared to those from the CNO cycle. Because the CNO cycle occurs in higher temperatures, maybe, so the neutrinos produced there are higher energy. Or wait, actually, the neutrinos from the proton-proton chain are lower energy. Because in the pp-chain, the neutrino is produced when a positron is emitted, which comes from the decay of a neutron in the intermediate nucleus. The energy of the neutrino is related to the Q-value of the reaction.

So, the pp-chain neutrinos are typically lower energy, around a few hundred keV. The CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos. So the 700-800 keV band (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2) might be in the range where the CNO neutrinos start to dominate.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the number of lower-energy neutrinos (like from the pp-chain) would decrease. But the CNO neutrinos, which are higher energy, are produced more in other parts of the Sun. Wait, but the CNO cycle is the main source for higher energy neutrinos, right?

Wait, the pp-chain and the CNO cycle contribute to the solar neutrino flux. The CNO neutrinos are a smaller fraction of the total compared to the pp-chain, but their individual neutrinos have higher energies. The total solar neutrino flux is dominated by the pp-chain, which has a lot of low-energy neutrinos. The CNO neutrinos make up a smaller number but have higher energies.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the number of low-energy neutrinos (below, say, 500 keV) would decrease. But the bands in question are 700-800 and 800-900. Are those in the CNO range?

Hmm, I think the CNO neutrinos have energies in the hundreds of keV to a few MeV. So, 700-800 and 800-900 keV would be in the CNO region. So if the pp-III stops, but the CNO continues, then the flux in those higher bands would remain about the same?

Wait, no. Because the pp-III branch might contribute to some of the higher-energy neutrinos. Or maybe not. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-chain produces neutrinos that are lower in energy, and the CNO produces higher. So if the pp-III stops, the only neutrinos affected are the lower-energy ones, while the higher-energy ones from CNO are unaffected. So the ratio of band 1 to band 2 would change.

Wait, the problem is asking for the ratio of the flux in band 1 to band 2. Band 1 is 700-800, band 2 is 800-900. Both are in the same range, I think. So maybe the assumption is that one comes from the pp-chain and the other from the CNO.

Wait, no, because the CNO neutrinos are a different flavor. Oh, the question says that solar neutrino flavor changes don't play a role here, so we can ignore oscillations. So, all neutrinos are treated as the same type.

Wait, but the pp-chain and CNO produce neutrinos with different energy spectra. The pp-chain emits more lower-energy neutrinos, while CNO's neutrinos are higher. So, the 700-800 band is probably a mix, but maybe CNO starts to dominate above a certain energy.

Alternatively, considering that the pp-chain and CNO have different energy distributions, stopping the pp-III would impact the lower band (like 200-400 keV, perhaps) more, while the higher bands (like 700-800 and 800-900) are dominated by CNO.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of band 1 to band 2. If both are in the same general energy range, and both are mainly from CNO, then their ratio would be similar. But if band 1 has more contributions from pp, and band 2 from CNO, then stopping pp would cause the ratio to drop.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think about the energy distributions.

The pp-chain neutrinos have a peak around 300-400 keV, I think. So if the pp-III stops, the flux below, say, 500 keV would drop. The higher bands, like 700-800 and 800-900, are mainly from CNO, which isn't affected. So the flux in band 1 and band 2 would be:

- Band 1 (700-800): mainly CNO. So flux doesn't change much.
- Band 2 (800-900): also mainly CNO. So flux doesn't change much.

Wait, but if the pp-III produced some neutrinos in the 700-800 band, then their flux would decrease, while the higher band (800-900) is mainly from CNO. So the ratio Band1/Band2 would be (lower)/ (similar) => lower.

Wait, but I thought the CNO neutrinos are higher energy, so 800-900 is more CNO than 700-800. So if the CNO flux is the same, then the ratio Band1 (700-800) over Band2 (800-900) would be similar to before, unless the 700-800 has a mix.

Alternatively, perhaps the 700-800 band is influenced by both, but the 800-900 is more CNO.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the solar neutrino spectrum. The main pp neutrinos are around 200-400 keV. The CNO neutrinos have higher energies, maybe 400-1000 keV or so.

But if the pp-III stopped, the lower energies would have less neutrinos. So the 700-800 band is part of the CNO, but perhaps the CNO's contribution is relatively flat in that range. So, if the pp-III neutrinos don't contribute much to the 700-800 band, then stopping them would have little effect on band 1. So the flux in both bands would be similar, leading to a ratio close to 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes neutrinos in the 700-800 range, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the neutrinos from different sources. The pp-chain produces lower-energy neutrinos, and the CNO produces higher. So, the 700-800 band is in the CNO range, while the 800-900 is also CNO. So, if pp-III stops, the CNO neutrinos are unaffected, so the ratio would be 1.

But wait, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. So the neutrinos from that process have stopped, but the CNO continues. So the CNO neutrinos are still being produced as before. Therefore, the flux in both bands would be the same as before, because both bands are dominated by CNO. So the ratio remains at 1.

Wait, but if the pp-III contributed to the 700-800 band, then stopping it would reduce band1's flux more than band2, which is higher. But I'm not certain about that. I think that the CNO neutrinos start to dominate at higher energies, so 700-800 and 800-900 would both be more in the CNO range. So, the ratio of their fluxes would be approximately 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in band2 (800-900) is higher than band1 (700-800) because the CNO neutrinos have a higher spectrum, perhaps with more in the 800-900 range. If the CNO neutrino flux is flat in that range, then both bands would have similar fluxes. But if the CNO neutrino flux has a peak in 800-900, then their fluxes would be higher in band2 than band1, leading to a ratio of less than 1.

Wait, but if the pp-III stopped, and it contributed neutrinos only to the lower bands, then the higher bands would have the same flux as before. So the ratio of band1 to band2 would be the same as before.

But what was the ratio before? Let me think, the pp-chain neutrinos are around 200-400. So, in the 700-800 and 800-900 bands, they're negligible. Therefore, the flux in both of these bands comes mainly from CNO. If the CNO process isn't affected, then the flux in both bands remains the same. So the ratio would stay at 1.

Wait, but I think the CNO neutrinos have a different distribution. Do they have a higher flux in higher energy bands? Or a lower? I think their flux decreases with increasing energy because higher energy neutrinos are less likely. So perhaps in 700-800, the flux is higher than in 800-900. So the ratio of band1 to band2 would be greater than 1.

Wait, but that's about the shape of the CNO spectrum. If the CNO neutrinos' flux decreases with higher energy, then band1 (700-800) would have higher flux than band2 (800-900). So the ratio band1/band2 would be greater than 1.

But the question is about the ratio after stopping the pp-III. If the CNO hasn't changed, then the ratio is determined by the CNO's distribution.

So, let's say CNO's distribution decreases with energy. So band1 has higher flux than band2. So ratio is greater than 1.

Wait, but I'm not sure if CNO's flux decreases with energy. I thought that pp neutrinos peak at lower energies, and CNO have a broader, higher energy distribution but with a peak in the higher keV range.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrino flux has a peak at around 1 MeV, so 800-900 keV is near the peak, and 700-800 is a bit lower. So band2 would have a higher flux than band1. So the ratio would be 0.5, or something like that. Wait, but the options are A)10, B)0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

So if CNO's flux is higher in band2, then the ratio would be less than 1. So options D is 0.1, B is 0.01.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the CNO neutrinos have a fairly flat spectrum in the 700-900 keV range, so the ratio is about 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes to a small part of the 700-800 band, but not a significant portion. So if pp-III stops, the 700-800 band's flux would drop a little, while 800-900 remains the same, leading to a lower ratio.

But without knowing exactly how much the pp-III contributes to those bands, it's hard to say.

Wait, another angle: the solar neutrino flux is dominated by the pp-chain, which produces a lot of low-energy neutrinos. The CNO neutrinos are fewer but higher energy. So in any band above, say, 400 keV, the neutrinos are mainly from CNO.

So, in the 700-800 band, the neutrinos are primarily from CNO, and the same for 800-900. So, stopping the pp-III wouldn't affect these bands much. So their fluxes would remain the same, leading to a ratio of 1.

So the correct answer would be option C) 1.

The question involves analyzing the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) under the hypothetical scenario where the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch is a minor contributor to the Sun's energy production and neutrino emission, primarily producing lower-energy neutrinos. The CNO cycle, on the other hand, contributes higher-energy neutrinos, which dominate in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV ranges.

If the pp-III branch stops, the flux of lower-energy neutrinos (below ~500 keV) would decrease. However, the neutrinos in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands are primarily from the CNO cycle, which is unaffected by the cessation of the pp-III branch. Since both bands are dominated by CNO neutrinos, their fluxes would remain approximately the same. Therefore, the ratio of the flux in the 700-800 keV band to the 800-900 keV band would remain close to 1.

Given the options provided, the most reasonable conclusion is that the ratio of the fluxes in the two bands is approximately 1.
