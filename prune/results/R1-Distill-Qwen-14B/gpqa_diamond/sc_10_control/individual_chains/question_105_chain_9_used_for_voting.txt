Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere of the star has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the brightness changes, and this looks like the transit of an exoplanet. The question is, what would be the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation?

So the main goal is to find the ratio of the exoplanet's radius (Rpl) to the star's radius (Rstar), such that the light curve variation is the same as what's caused by these spots.

Hmm. I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula I think is: the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) is roughly (Rpl / Rstar)^2. Because both areas (star and planet) are circles, so area scales with the square of the radius.

But wait, in this case, the spots are causing a dip in brightness when they rotate into and out of view. So the brightness dip due to the spots isn't just about the area but also the temperature difference. Because the spots are cooler, when they are on the side facing us, the star's overall brightness decreases. So we need to calculate the total brightness change caused by the spots and see what planet size would cause the same dip.

Let me break it down. The star's total brightness without spots is based on its effective temperature. The spots are cooler, so they emit less light. The brightness variation (ΔF) is the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

First, let's think about the area of the spots. The radius of the star is equal to the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, a hemisphere is half the star, right? So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (4πR² / 2 )? Wait, wait. No, wait. The star is a sphere, so surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

So the area of the spots is 0.4πR².

Now, the brightness contribution from each spot is based on their temperature. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. The flux (energy per unit area per second) from a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σT^4.

So the flux from the spots (F_spots) is σ*(5000)^4, and the flux from the rest of the star (F_rest) is σ*(6000)^4.

The average flux when the spots are visible is the sum of the flux from the spots and the rest of the star. Wait, no. Because when the spots are on the side facing us, their lower flux contributes to a lower total flux.

Wait, the star's total flux when spots are facing us is (area without spots * F_rest + area of spots * F_spots) / total area.

Wait, the star's total flux without any spots would be F_rest * 4πR². When the spots are present (covering 0.4πR²), the flux becomes ( (4πR² - 0.4πR²) * F_rest + 0.4πR² * F_spots ) / (4πR²).

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the fractional change in flux when the spots are present. Let me think: the fractional change ΔF is (F_with_spots - F_without_spots) / F_without_spots.

F_without_spots is F_rest, because the spots are not contributing when they're not visible. Wait no, when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F_rest * 4πR² / (4πR²) )= F_rest. When the spots are on the near side, the flux is ( (4πR² - A_spots) * F_rest + A_spots * F_spots ) / (4πR²).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the change in flux when the spots are on the near side.

So the flux without spots is F_rest. The flux with spots is F = [ (4πR² - A_spots) * F_rest + A_spots * F_spots ] / (4πR² )

But that might be complicating things. Alternatively, the fractional change in flux when the spots are visible is (F_spots - F_rest) multiplied by the area fraction of the spots, right? Because when the spots are visible, that part of the star is emitting less.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try another approach. The maximum dip in brightness occurs when the spots are fully facing us. The dip would be the difference in flux between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

So the normal flux (F0) is F_rest = σ*(6000)^4.

When the spots are fully visible, the flux (F1) is [ (4πR² - A_spots) * F_rest + A_spots * F_spots ] / (4πR²)

But wait, I think A_spots is 0.4πR² as calculated earlier. So:

F1 = [ (4πR² - 0.4πR²) * σ(6000)^4 + 0.4πR² * σ(5000)^4 ) ] / (4πR² )

Simplify numerator:

(3.6πR² * σ(6000)^4 + 0.4πR² * σ(5000)^4) 

Divide by 4πR² σ:

F1 = [3.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(5000)^4 ] / 4 * σ 

So F1 = [ (3.6*(6e3)^4 + 0.4*(5e3)^4 ) /4 ] * σ

Calculate each term:

6e3^4 = (6)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15
5e3^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14

So 3.6 * 1.296e15 = 3.6 * 1.296e15 = let's compute 3.6 *1.296 = 4.6656 → 4.6656e15

0.4 *6.25e14 = 2.5e14

Adding them: 4.6656e15 + 0.25e15 = 4.9156e15

Divide by 4: 4.9156e15 /4 = 1.2289e15

So F1 = 1.2289e15 * σ

F0 is 6000^4 * σ = 1.296e15 * σ.

Wait, no, wait. F0 is when the star is fully emitting at F_rest, so F0 = 4πR² * F_rest / 4πR² = F_rest. So F0 is σ*(6000)^4 = 1.296e15 * σ.

So the flux when spots are visible: F1 is [3.6*6000^4 +0.4*5000^4 ] /4 * σ

As computed above, that's 1.2289e15 * σ.

So the fractional change is (F1 - F0) / F0.

Wait, no, wait. Because F1 is when the spots are visible. So the dip is F0 - F1.

Wait, F0 is the original flux. F1 is when spots are visible. So the change is F1 < F0.

So the dip is (F0 - F1) / F0.

So (1.296e15 σ - 1.2289e15 σ) / 1.296e15 σ = (0.0671e15 σ) / 1.296e15 σ = 0.0671 / 1.296 ≈ 0.0518 or about 5.18%.

Wait, that's about a 5.18% dip in brightness when the spots are fully visible.

But wait, the question says the star has a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. So perhaps I miscalculated the area.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere, so the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere. The area of one hemisphere is 2πR². So spots area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR², which is what I used earlier. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the maximum dip, considering that when the star rotates, the spots come into view. But the star is only spotted on one hemisphere, so the maximum dip is this 5.18% change.

Now, the question is, what exoplanet radius would cause the same dip in brightness when it transits. So the planet would block some of the star's light. The dip would be (Rpl^2) / (Rstar^2) because the area blocked is (π Rpl²) and the star's area is π Rstar^2, so the fractional change is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but wait. The area blocked is π Rpl², but as the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star. So the dip is (π Rpl²) / (π Rstar²) )= (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. We want this to be equal to the dip caused by the spots, which is approximately 5.18% or 0.0518.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277.

Wait, but that would be around 0.23. However, looking at the options, A is ~0.39, B is ~0.07, C is ~0.11, D is ~0.32.

Hmm, none of the options is 0.23. So maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the dip. Let me recheck.

Wait, in the calculation, I assumed that when the spots are visible, the flux is F1, which is lower. So ΔF = (F0 - F1)/F0.

But perhaps I should compute the actual dip in terms of the area and the temperature difference correctly.

Alternative approach: The flux from the star without spots is F0 = σ T^4 = σ (6000)^4.

The flux when the spots are fully visible is F1 = ( (4π R² - A_spots) * F0 + A_spots * F_spot ) / (4π R² )

Where A_spots is 0.4π R² and F_spot = σ (5000)^4.

So F1 = [ (4π R² - 0.4π R² ) * F0 + 0.4π R² * F_spot ] / 4π R²

Factor out π R² in numerator and denominator.

F1 = [ (3.6 π R²) F0 + 0.4 π R² F_spot ] / (4 π R² )

Cancel π R²:

F1= [ 3.6 F0 + 0.4 F_spot ] /4 

Now plug in F_spot = (5000/6000)^4 * F0.

So F_spot = (5/6)^4 F0 = (625/1296) F0 ≈ 0.48225 F0.

So F1 = [3.6 F0 + 0.4 * 0.48225 F0 ] /4

Compute numerator:

3.6 F0 + 0.4 * 0.48225 F0 = 3.6 F0 + 0.1929 F0 = 3.7929 F0.

Divide by 4: 3.7929 /4 ≈ 0.9482 F0.

So F1 ≈ 0.9482 F0.

So the fractional dip is (F0 - F1)/F0 = (1 - 0.9482) = 0.0518, so 5.18% dip. Which matches what I had earlier.

So the dip is about 5.18%.

So to get the same dip, the planet's transit would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277, which is about 0.23. But looking at the options, the closest is option D, 0.32, but that's higher. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the area calculation. Because the star has a radius equal to the Sun, and the planet is orbiting the star, so Rpl is much smaller than Rstar. Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is different.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% in one hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, which is 20% of 2πR², so 0.4πR² as before.

Another thought: what if the star's rotation causes the spots to come into view, but because it's only one hemisphere, the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible. So the dip is 5.18%, as calculated. So the planet's dip should be same 5.18%, which would require Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.23.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the brightness variation as the star rotates. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then leave. So perhaps the brightness variation is a sinusoidal curve, but that's more complicated. But the amplitude of the variation is the same as the dip I calculated, 5.18%.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is considering the area of the spots as a fraction of the entire star, not just a hemisphere. So perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the total surface area.

Wait, no. The question states that the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4π R².

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the effective area the spots take up as a fraction of the star's total area. The star's total area is 4π R². The spots cover 0.4π R², so the fraction is 0.4π/(4π) = 0.1 or 10%. So the spots cover 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20% per hemisphere, so 10% of the total surface. But that's a different way to present it.

So the fractional area of the spots is 0.1.

Hmm, then the dip would be (F_spot - F_rest) * A_spots_fraction.

Wait, no. The average flux when the spots are present is:

F1 = F_rest*(1 - A_spots) + F_spots * A_spots.

So F1 = F_rest (1 - 0.1) + F_rest*(T_spot/T_rest)^4 * 0.1.

So F1 = F_rest [0.9 + 0.1*(5/6)^4 ].

Compute (5/6)^4: 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So F1 = F_rest [0.9 + 0.1 * 0.48225 ] = F_rest [0.9 + 0.048225] = F_rest * 0.948225.

So (F1 - F_rest)/F_rest = -0.051775, so a 5.1775% dip.

Same as before.

So the dip is about 5.18%, which requires a planet radius of sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277 Rstar.

But the options don't have 0.23. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the star's effective temperature isn't the same as the spots. The star's Teff is 6000 K, but the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. But when the spots are on the far side, the star's brightness is at maximum. When the spots rotate into view, the brightness decreases. So the amplitude of the brightness variation (the peak-to-peak change) is 2 times the dip, because when the spots are on the far side, brightness is maximum, and when on the near side, it's minimum.

Wait, no. Because the star's rotation causes the spots to come into view and then go away. So the brightness variation is a sinusoidal-like curve. The maximum dip would be when the spots are fully visible, which is a 5.18% dip, and maximum brightness is when the spots are fully hidden, which is the same as the unspotted star. So the amplitude is 5.18% of the maximum brightness.

Wait, but for exoplanet transit, the dip is when the planet blocks part of the star. The amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So we need to equate 5.18% to (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Which would give Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277. So about 0.23.

But the options don't have that. Looking at the options again:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, none match 0.23. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the brightness change when the spots are on the far side is higher. Because when the star is unspotted, its brightness is F0. When the spots are on the far side, the brightness is higher because you're seeing the full star at 6000 K. Wait, no. Wait, the spots are cooler, so when the spots are on the far side, the side facing us is the rest of the star, which is at 6000 K. When the spots rotate into view, the brightness decreases.

Wait, no. Because the star's total flux is higher when the spots are not visible. So when the spots are on the far side, the star's flux is F0, and when the spots are visible, it's F1. So the maximum brightness is F0, and the minimum is F1. The amplitude of the light curve is (F0 - F1)/F0 * 100% = 5.18%.

So the variation is a peak-to-peak of about 5.18% * 2 = 10.36%? No, because the variation is between F0 and F1. The amplitude is the difference from the mean. The mean brightness would be the average of F0 and F1, but perhaps in this case, the star is only spotted on one hemisphere, so the brightness varies between F0 and F1 as the star rotates. The amplitude is (F0 - F1)/2, because the variation is symmetric around the mean.

Wait no, let's think again. When the star is at F0 (no spots visible), then as the spots rotate into view, brightness decreases to F1, and as it continues to rotate, it goes back to F0. So the brightness variation is a sine-like wave with peak at F0 and trough at F1. The amplitude is (F0 - F1)/2, because the average is (F0 + F1)/2, and the variation is from that average. So the amplitude of the light curve (the peak variation from the average) is (F0 - F1)/2. Which is 0.0518 / 2 = 0.0259 or about 2.59%.

Wait, this is a different approach. So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is about 2.59% of the mean brightness.

But wait, the problem says that the brightness variation (the amplitude) is the same as if an exoplanet were transiting. So in that case, the exoplanet would cause a dip of 2.59% when it transits.

Wait, this can't be right, because earlier calculation said the dip is 5.18% when the spots are fully visible. So I'm getting conflicting results.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation's amplitude is 5.18% because the maximum dip is 5.18% of the original brightness. So the exoplanet's dip should be 5.18%, which requires a planet size of 0.23 Rstar.

But again, none of the options match. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Another approach: Let's compute the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area that would cause the same dip as the spots.

The dip due to the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = (ΔF_planet) = (ΔF_spots).

So I need to compute ΔF_spots correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the effective area of the spots in terms of the star's luminosity.

The star's total luminosity is L = 4π R^2 σ T^4.

The spots have an area of A = 0.4 π R^2.

Their luminosity is L_spots = A σ T_spot^4.

The rest of the star's luminosity is L_rest = L - L_spots.

So when the spots are facing us, the total observed luminosity is L_rest + L_spots.

So the fractional change is (L_rest + L_spots - L) / L.

Which is ( L - L_spots + L_spots - L ) / L → no, that can't be.

Wait, the star's total luminosity without any spots is L0 = 4π R^2 σ (6000)^4.

When the spots are visible, the luminosity is L1 = (4π R^2 - A) σ (6000)^4 + A σ (5000)^4.

So L1 = L0 * [ (4π R^2 - A) (6000^4) + A (5000^4) ) / (4π R^2 * 6000^4) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio (L1/L0) - 1.

L1/L0 = [ (4π R² - A) (6000^4) + A (5000^4) ] / (4π R² 6000^4 )

As before, A = 0.4 π R².

So substituting:

= [ (4π R² - 0.4 π R²) * 6000^4 + 0.4 π R² * 5000^4 ] / (4π R² 6000^4 )

Factor out π R²:

= [ (3.6 π R²) * 6000^4 + 0.4 π R² * 5000^4 ] / (4 π R² 6000^4 )

Cancel π R² numerator and denominator:

= [3.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4] / (4 *6000^4 )

Factor out 6000^4 from numerator:

= [ 3.6 + 0.4 (5000/6000)^4 ] /4

= [3.6 + 0.4*(5/6)^4 ] /4

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So:

= [3.6 + 0.4 * 0.48225 ] /4

= [3.6 + 0.1929 ] /4

= 3.7929 /4 ≈ 0.9482.

So L1 = 0.9482 L0.

So the fractional change is (L1 - L0)/L0 = -0.0518, or -5.18% as before.

So the dip is 5.18% of the star's brightness.

So the planet's dip should be 5.18%, leading to (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2277.

But looking at the options, none is close to 0.23. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation due to the spots is only 10% of the star's surface. Because the filling factor is 20% of a hemisphere, which is 10% of the total surface area.

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. So the spots cover 10% of the star's surface. So the fractional area is 0.1.

But then, the dip is (F_spot - F_rest) * 0.1.

Wait, the dip is (F_rest - F_spot) * 0.1.

So dip = 0.1 * (F_rest - F_spot)/F_rest.

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 * (1 - (0.48225)) = 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775 → 5.1775%.

Same as before.

Hmm. So back to the original problem: the exoplanet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2277.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, but the exoplanet's radius is being compared to the host star's radius, not the Sun's. So Rpl is relative to Rstar, which is R_sun. So perhaps that doesn't change anything.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio in terms of the planet's area compared to the spots. Because the spots are causing a dip when they're on the near side, but the planet blocks a part of the star, leading to the same dip.

Wait, the dip caused by the planet is (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2 ) * 100%, which should equal 5.18%.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 =0.0518 → Rpl = Rstar * sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277 Rstar.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps considering the rotational modulation and the fact that only one hemisphere is spotted. So the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible, but the overall effect on brightness variation is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation is modulated as the spots rotate, causing a sinusoidal-like variation with an amplitude of (ΔF/2), because the brightness goes from F0 to F1 and back.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F0 - F1)/2 ≈ 5.18% /2 = 2.59%.

So the exoplanet's transit would cause a dip of 2.59%, leading to (Rpl/Rstar)^2 =0.0259 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.161.

But that's about 0.16, which is still not matching any option.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me think of the options again.

Wait, option C is ~0.11, which is (0.11)^2 = 0.0121, about 1.21% dip.

Option D is ~0.32 → 0.1024 dip, about 10.24%.

Option A is ~0.39 → 0.1521 dip, about 15.21%.

But the dip is 5.18%, which is between options C and D. But none match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the dip. Let me try another approach. Maybe the star's brightness variation is due to the spots being cooler, but the observed flux is modulated as the star rotates, leading to a variation in the observed flux.

Wait, the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible, but the average brightness when the spots are on the near side is F1, and on the far side, it's F0.

So the amplitude of the light curve (the peak-to-peak variation) would be F0 - F1 = 0.0518 F0. So the amplitude is that delta.

But for the exoplanet transit, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, which is a one-time dip, not a sinusoidal variation. So perhaps the correct approach is to make the dip the same as the spot-induced dip.

So the dip is 0.0518, so Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the area of the spots as 20% of the entire star, not just a hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8 π R².

But that would be a filling factor of 20% of the whole star, which is 20% of 4π R². Let's see what that would do.

Compute F1 again.

F1 = [ (4π R² - 0.8 π R²) * F_rest + 0.8 π R² * F_spot ] / 4 π R²

Simplify: (3.2 π R² * F_rest + 0.8 π R² F_spot ) /4 π R².

Factor out π R²:

= [3.2 F_rest + 0.8 F_spot ] /4

F_spot = (5/6)^4 F_rest ≈ 0.48225 F_rest.

So F1 = [3.2 F_rest + 0.8 * 0.48225 F_rest ] /4 

= [3.2 F_rest + 0.3858 F_rest ] /4 

= 3.5858 F_rest /4 ≈ 0.89645 F_rest.

So dip is (1 - 0.89645) = 0.10355 → about 10.36% dip.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1036 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.322.

Which is approximately 0.32, option D.

Wait, that matches option D. So perhaps the initial assumption that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface (not just a hemisphere) leads to this.

But the question says the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So that would mean 10% of the total surface area. So perhaps the correct calculation is the 5.18% dip, but perhaps the problem intended the filling factor to be 20% of the entire star.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again.

The question says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So 20% of the hemisphere is covered. So the area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R², as I did earlier.

But if the problem had the filling factor as 20% of the entire star, then the area would be 0.2 *4π R²= 0.8 π R², leading to a dip of about 10.36%, giving Rpl/Rstar ~0.32, which is option D.

But according to the question, the filling factor is 20% of a hemisphere, so the area is 10% of the total surface (0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1).

So why is the calculation leading to an option that's not present? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the average brightness when the star is rotating, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So the brightness variation depends on the rotational period and the spot distribution.

But perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me think: the brightness change is due to the spots covering a certain area. So to get the same dip, the planet's area should match the spot's area as a fraction of the star's area.

So spot area fraction is 0.1, so planet area fraction is 0.1, leading to Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316, which is approximately 0.32, option D.

Wait, that would make sense. Because the dip from the planet is (Rpl^2)/(Rstar^2) = 0.1 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316.

So that's option D.

But why is that the case?

Because the brightness dip caused by the spots is 5.18% when they are fully visible, which corresponds to an area of 0.1 (10%) of the star's surface. So the planet's area would need to be 10% of the star's surface, leading to a dip of 10% (since (0.316)^2 = 0.1).

Wait, but earlier calculation gave a dip of 5.18%, which is 5.18% of the star's brightness, but the area fraction is 10%. Because the spots are cooler, their effect isn't just their area but also their temperature.

Ah! So perhaps I should be comparing the luminosity blocked by the planet to the luminosity blocked by the spots. Because the planet blocks a part of the star, the dip is proportional to the area blocked. But the spots, being cooler, have a different effect.

Wait, no. The dip due to the planet is simply the area blocked times the star's flux. So if the planet blocks 10% of the star's area, the dip is 10% of the flux. But the dip due to the spots is 5.18%, which is less than 10%, because the spots are cooler.

So the planet's area needs to block the same amount of flux as the spots do. So the dip caused by the planet is (Rpl^2/Rstar^2) = (L_spot/ L_star ) * (T_spot / T_star )^4 ?

Wait, no. Because the planet blocks the star's light, regardless of the temperature. So the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

But the dip due to the spots is not just (A_spots / A_star) * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 ), which is the same as (A_spots / A_star) * (F_spot / F_star).

So the dip is (A_spots / A_star) * (F_spot - F_star) / F_star.

Which is (A_spots / A_star) * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4).

So dip = (0.1) * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775 → 5.1775%.

So the dip due to the spots is 5.1775% of the star's flux.

To get the same dip, the planet's area must block 5.1775% of the star's flux. But the planet's dip is (Rpl^2/Rstar^2) = dip_fraction.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2277.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the problem considers the brightness variation as the difference between the star with spots and without, not just the dip when the spots are visible. Because when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, leading to a variation in brightness. So the amplitude of this variation is the same as the planet's dip.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the overall brightness change due to the spots as a 5% dip, and the planet would cause the same 5% dip, leading to Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.223, which is still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius as the square root of the dip fraction. So if the dip is 5.18%, then sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277, which is about 0.23 Rstar. But the options don't have this.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 0.32, which is close to sqrt(0.1) = 0.316. So perhaps the problem intended the filling factor to be 10% of the star's surface, leading to dip of 10% and Rpl/Rstar of 0.316.

But according to the problem statement, the filling factor is 20% of a hemisphere, which is 10% of the star's surface. So the dip is 5.18%, but the planet's dip would be 5.18%, leading to a radius ratio of 0.2277.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's Teff is 6000 K, but the spots are 1000 K cooler than the surrounding, which is 5000 K. So the flux from the spots is F_spot = σ (5000)^4, and the rest is F_rest = σ (6000)^4.

The dip per spot area is (F_rest - F_spot)/F_rest = 1 - (5/6)^4 = 1 - 625/1296 ≈ 0.51775.

So for each spot, the dip per unit area is 0.51775 times the area.

The total dip is 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775 → 5.1775% dip.

To get the same dip, the planet must block 5.1775% of the star's flux, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2277.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as a function of the area times the temperature difference. So the effective area of the spots is 0.4π R², and the effective dip per area is (T_spot^4 - T_star^4)/T_star^4.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the planet to have the same amplitude in brightness variation as the spots. The spots cause a 5.18% dip, so the planet should cause 5.18% dip, leading to Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2277.

But this isn't an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are causing a dip of 20% (the filling factor) of the star's area, not considering the temperature difference. So dip is 20% of the star's surface area, leading to a dip of 20%, and Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.2) ≈ 0.447, which is approximately 0.45, but that's not an option either.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the area of the spots to the area of the planet. The area of the spots is 0.4π Rstar². The planet's area is π Rpl². So set π Rpl² = 0.4 π Rstar² → Rpl² = 0.4 Rstar² → Rpl = sqrt(0.4) Rstar ≈ 0.632 Rstar. But that can't be right because the options are much smaller.

No, that's not correct. Because the dip is not just based on area but also the temperature.

I'm stuck. Let me try to look for an alternative approach.

Alternative approach: Find the ratio of the areas (planet vs spots) that would cause the same dip in brightness.

The dip from the spots is:

dip_spot = (A_spots / A_star) * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4 )

= (0.1) * (1 - (5/6)^4 )

≈ 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775.

Set this equal to dip_planet = (A_planet / A_star) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2277.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the difference in flux as the dip, but not considering the entire area. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spots as a factor in the star's brightness, so when the spots are on the near side, the star's flux is F1, and when on the far side, F0. The brightness variation would be F0 and F1, so the amplitude is (F0 - F1)/2.

So the amplitude is (0.051775 * F0) / 2 ≈ 0.025888 F0.

So the planet's dip should be 0.025888 F0, leading to (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.025888 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.1609.

Which is ~0.16, still not matching any option.

Hmm.

Another thought: Maybe the problem is considering the brightness variation as the maximum difference between when the spots are just starting to come into view and when they're fully visible, so the variation is a sine wave with amplitude of 5.18%.

But for the exoplanet, the dip is a single event, not a sinusoidal variation. So the peak-to-peak variation for the planet would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2 *2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the planet would have to cause the same maximum dip as the spots, which is 5.18%, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2277.

But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the spots as a fraction of the star's surface, and the planet's radius as a fraction that would block the same area, but without considering the temperature difference. So if the spots cover 20% of the star's surface, then the planet's area would need to be 20%, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.2 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.447, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the hemisphere with spots as a 20% coverage, so the area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R², which is 10% of the star's surface. So the dip is 10% of the star's flux when the spots are visible, leading to (Rpl/Rstar)^2 =0.1 → Rpl ≈0.316 Rstar, which is option D.

But wait, earlier calculation with 10% area gave a dip of 5.18%, but if the dip is 10%, then Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316.

Hmm, perhaps the problem intended the filling factor to be 20% of the entire star, not a hemisphere. Because that would make the dip 10.36%, leading to Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.32, option D.

But according to the question, it's 20% of a hemisphere, which is 10% of the star's surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the area of the spots as 20% of the star's surface, leading to a dip of 10.36%, and Rpl/Rstar of 0.32, option D.

In that case, the correct answer would be option D.

But according to the question, the filling factor is 20% of a hemisphere, so the area is 10% of the star's surface, leading to a dip of 5.18%, which doesn't match any option.

Given the options, the only one close to 0.32 is option D. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's dark spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\star} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20% (i.e., 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots).
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The brightness dip caused by the spots depends on their area and their lower temperature.
   - The filling factor of 20% applies to one hemisphere, so the area of the spots is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\star}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\star}^2 \). This represents 10% of the star's total surface area.

3. **Flux Contribution**:
   - The flux from a blackbody is proportional to \( T^4 \). Thus, the flux from the star is \( F_{\text{star}} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \), and the flux from the spots is \( F_{\text{spots}} = \sigma T_{\text{spots}}^4 \).
   - The fractional brightness change when the spots are visible is:
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{F_{\text{spots}} - F_{\text{star}}}{F_{\text{star}}} = \frac{\sigma (5000^4 - 6000^4)}{\sigma 6000^4} = 1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775
     \]
   - Since the spots cover 10% of the star's surface, the total brightness dip is:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{total}} = 0.1 \times 0.51775 \approx 0.051775 \, \text{(or } 5.18\% \text{)}.
     \]

4. **Exoplanet Brightness Variation**:
   - The brightness dip caused by an exoplanet is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\star}}\right)^2
     \]
   - To match the brightness variation caused by the spots, we set \( \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \Delta F_{\text{total}} \):
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\star}}\right)^2 = 0.051775
     \]
   - Solving for \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\star} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\star}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2277
     \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated ratio \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\star} \approx 0.2277 \) does not match any of the provided options exactly.
   - However, if the problem intended the filling factor to represent 20% of the star's total surface area (instead of a hemisphere), the area of the spots would be \( 0.2 \times 4\pi R_{\star}^2 = 0.8\pi R_{\star}^2 \), leading to a larger dip:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{total}} = 0.2 \times 0.51775 \approx 0.10355 \, \text{(or } 10.36\% \text{)}.
     \]
   - In this case:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\star}}\right)^2 = 0.10355
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\star}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.322
     \]
   - This matches option **D**.

### Conclusion:
Given the ambiguity in interpreting the filling factor and the provided options, the most reasonable answer is **D**, assuming the filling factor applies to the star's total surface area.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere of the star has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the brightness changes, and this looks like the transit of an exoplanet. The question is, what would be the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation?

So the main goal is to find the ratio of the exoplanet's radius (Rpl) to the star's radius (Rstar), such that the light curve variation is the same as what's caused by these spots.

Hmm. I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula I think is: the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) is roughly (Rpl / Rstar)^2. Because both areas (star and planet) are circles, so area scales with the square of the radius.

But wait, in this case, the spots are causing a dip in brightness when they rotate into and out of view. So the brightness dip due to the spots isn't just about the area but also the temperature difference. Because the spots are cooler, when they are on the side facing us, the star's overall brightness decreases. So we need to calculate the total brightness change caused by the spots and see what planet size would cause the same dip.

Let me break it down. The star's total brightness without spots is based on its effective temperature. The spots are cooler, so they emit less light. The brightness variation (ΔF) is the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

First, let's think about the area of the spots. The radius of the star is equal to the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, a hemisphere is half the star, right? So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (4πR² / 2 )? Wait, wait. No, wait. The star is a sphere, so surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

So the area of the spots is 0.4πR².

Now, the brightness contribution from each spot is based on their temperature. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. The flux (energy per unit area per second) from a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σT^4.

So the flux from the spots (F_spots) is σ*(5000)^4, and the flux from the rest of the star (F_rest) is σ*(6000)^4.

The average flux when the spots are visible is the sum of the flux from the spots and the rest of the star. Wait, no. Because when the spots are on the side facing us, their lower flux contributes to a lower total flux.

Wait, the star's total flux when spots are facing us is (area without spots * F_rest + area of spots * F_spots) / total area.

Wait, the star's total flux without any spots would be F_rest * 4πR². When the spots are present (covering 0.4πR²), the flux becomes ( (4πR² - 0.4πR²) * F_rest + 0.4πR² * F_spots ) / (4πR²).

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the fractional change in flux when the spots are present. Let me think: the fractional change ΔF is (F_with_spots - F_without_spots) / F_without_spots.

F_without_spots is F_rest, because the spots are not contributing when they're not visible. Wait no, when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F_rest * 4πR² / (4πR²) )= F_rest. When the spots are on the near side, the flux is ( (4πR² - A_spots) * F_rest + A_spots * F_spots ) / (4πR²).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the change in flux when the spots are on the near side.

So the flux without spots is F_rest. The flux with spots is F = [ (4πR² - A_spots) * F_rest + A_spots * F_spots ] / (4πR² )

But that might be complicating things. Alternatively, the fractional change in flux when the spots are visible is (F_spots - F_rest) multiplied by the area fraction of the spots, right? Because when the spots are visible, that part of the star is emitting less.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try another approach. The maximum dip in brightness occurs when the spots are fully facing us. The dip would be the difference in flux between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

So the normal flux (F0) is F_rest = σ*(6000)^4.

When the spots are fully visible, the flux (F1) is [ (4πR² - A_spots) * F_rest + A_spots * F_spots ] / (4πR²)

But wait, I think A_spots is 0.4πR² as calculated earlier. So:

F1 = [ (4πR² - 0.4πR²) * σ(6000)^4 + 0.4πR² * σ(5000)^4 ) ] / (4πR² )

Simplify numerator:

(3.6πR² * σ(6000)^4 + 0.4πR² * σ(5000)^4) 

Divide by 4πR² σ:

F1 = [3.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(5000)^4 ] / 4 * σ 

So F1 = [ (3.6*(6e3)^4 + 0.4*(5e3)^4 ) /4 ] * σ

Calculate each term:

6e3^4 = (6)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15
5e3^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14

So 3.6 * 1.296e15 = 3.6 * 1.296e15 = let's compute 3.6 *1.296 = 4.6656 → 4.6656e15

0.4 *6.25e14 = 2.5e14

Adding them: 4.6656e15 + 0.25e15 = 4.9156e15

Divide by 4: 4.9156e15 /4 = 1.2289e15

So F1 = 1.2289e15 * σ

F0 is 6000^4 * σ = 1.296e15 * σ.

Wait, no, wait. F0 is when the star is fully emitting at F_rest, so F0 = 4πR² * F_rest / 4πR² = F_rest. So F0 is σ*(6000)^4 = 1.296e15 * σ.

So the flux when spots are visible: F1 is [3.6*6000^4 +0.4*5000^4 ] /4 * σ

As computed above, that's 1.2289e15 * σ.

So the fractional change is (F1 - F0) / F0.

Wait, no, wait. Because F1 is when the spots are visible. So the dip is F0 - F1.

Wait, F0 is the original flux. F1 is when spots are visible. So the change is F1 < F0.

So the dip is (F0 - F1) / F0.

So (1.296e15 σ - 1.2289e15 σ) / 1.296e15 σ = (0.0671e15 σ) / 1.296e15 σ = 0.0671 / 1.296 ≈ 0.0518 or about 5.18%.

Wait, that's about a 5.18% dip in brightness when the spots are fully visible.

But wait, the question says the star has a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. So perhaps I miscalculated the area.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere, so the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere. The area of one hemisphere is 2πR². So spots area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR², which is what I used earlier. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the maximum dip, considering that when the star rotates, the spots come into view. But the star is only spotted on one hemisphere, so the maximum dip is this 5.18% change.

Now, the question is, what exoplanet radius would cause the same dip in brightness when it transits. So the planet would block some of the star's light. The dip would be (Rpl^2) / (Rstar^2) because the area blocked is (π Rpl²) and the star's area is π Rstar^2, so the fractional change is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but wait. The area blocked is π Rpl², but as the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star. So the dip is (π Rpl²) / (π Rstar²) )= (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. We want this to be equal to the dip caused by the spots, which is approximately 5.18% or 0.0518.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277.

Wait, but that would be around 0.23. However, looking at the options, A is ~0.39, B is ~0.07, C is ~0.11, D is ~0.32.

Hmm, none of the options is 0.23. So maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the dip. Let me recheck.

Wait, in the calculation, I assumed that when the spots are visible, the flux is F1, which is lower. So ΔF = (F0 - F1)/F0.

But perhaps I should compute the actual dip in terms of the area and the temperature difference correctly.

Alternative approach: The flux from the star without spots is F0 = σ T^4 = σ (6000)^4.

The flux when the spots are fully visible is F1 = ( (4π R² - A_spots) * F0 + A_spots * F_spot ) / (4π R² )

Where A_spots is 0.4π R² and F_spot = σ (5000)^4.

So F1 = [ (4π R² - 0.4π R² ) * F0 + 0.4π R² * F_spot ] / 4π R²

Factor out π R² in numerator and denominator.

F1 = [ (3.6 π R²) F0 + 0.4 π R² F_spot ] / (4 π R² )

Cancel π R²:

F1= [ 3.6 F0 + 0.4 F_spot ] /4 

Now plug in F_spot = (5000/6000)^4 * F0.

So F_spot = (5/6)^4 F0 = (625/1296) F0 ≈ 0.48225 F0.

So F1 = [3.6 F0 + 0.4 * 0.48225 F0 ] /4

Compute numerator:

3.6 F0 + 0.4 * 0.48225 F0 = 3.6 F0 + 0.1929 F0 = 3.7929 F0.

Divide by 4: 3.7929 /4 ≈ 0.9482 F0.

So F1 ≈ 0.9482 F0.

So the fractional dip is (F0 - F1)/F0 = (1 - 0.9482) = 0.0518, so 5.18% dip. Which matches what I had earlier.

So the dip is about 5.18%.

So to get the same dip, the planet's transit would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277, which is about 0.23. But looking at the options, the closest is option D, 0.32, but that's higher. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the area calculation. Because the star has a radius equal to the Sun, and the planet is orbiting the star, so Rpl is much smaller than Rstar. Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is different.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% in one hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, which is 20% of 2πR², so 0.4πR² as before.

Another thought: what if the star's rotation causes the spots to come into view, but because it's only one hemisphere, the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible. So the dip is 5.18%, as calculated. So the planet's dip should be same 5.18%, which would require Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.23.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the brightness variation as the star rotates. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then leave. So perhaps the brightness variation is a sinusoidal curve, but that's more complicated. But the amplitude of the variation is the same as the dip I calculated, 5.18%.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is considering the area of the spots as a fraction of the entire star, not just a hemisphere. So perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the total surface area.

Wait, no. The question states that the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4π R².

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the effective area the spots take up as a fraction of the star's total area. The star's total area is 4π R². The spots cover 0.4π R², so the fraction is 0.4π/(4π) = 0.1 or 10%. So the spots cover 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20% per hemisphere, so 10% of the total surface. But that's a different way to present it.

So the fractional area of the spots is 0.1.

Hmm, then the dip would be (F_spot - F_rest) * A_spots_fraction.

Wait, no. The average flux when the spots are present is:

F1 = F_rest*(1 - A_spots) + F_spots * A_spots.

So F1 = F_rest (1 - 0.1) + F_rest*(T_spot/T_rest)^4 * 0.1.

So F1 = F_rest [0.9 + 0.1*(5/6)^4 ].

Compute (5/6)^4: 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So F1 = F_rest [0.9 + 0.1 * 0.48225 ] = F_rest [0.9 + 0.048225] = F_rest * 0.948225.

So (F1 - F_rest)/F_rest = -0.051775, so a 5.1775% dip.

Same as before.

So the dip is about 5.18%, which requires a planet radius of sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277 Rstar.

But the options don't have 0.23. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the star's effective temperature isn't the same as the spots. The star's Teff is 6000 K, but the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. But when the spots are on the far side, the star's brightness is at maximum. When the spots rotate into view, the brightness decreases. So the amplitude of the brightness variation (the peak-to-peak change) is 2 times the dip, because when the spots are on the far side, brightness is maximum, and when on the near side, it's minimum.

Wait, no. Because the star's rotation causes the spots to come into view and then go away. So the brightness variation is a sinusoidal-like curve. The maximum dip would be when the spots are fully visible, which is a 5.18% dip, and maximum brightness is when the spots are fully hidden, which is the same as the unspotted star. So the amplitude is 5.18% of the maximum brightness.

Wait, but for exoplanet transit, the dip is when the planet blocks part of the star. The amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So we need to equate 5.18% to (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Which would give Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277. So about 0.23.

But the options don't have that. Looking at the options again:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, none match 0.23. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the brightness change when the spots are on the far side is higher. Because when the star is unspotted, its brightness is F0. When the spots are on the far side, the brightness is higher because you're seeing the full star at 6000 K. Wait, no. Wait, the spots are cooler, so when the spots are on the far side, the side facing us is the rest of the star, which is at 6000 K. When the spots rotate into view, the brightness decreases.

Wait, no. Because the star's total flux is higher when the spots are not visible. So when the spots are on the far side, the star's flux is F0, and when the spots are visible, it's F1. So the maximum brightness is F0, and the minimum is F1. The amplitude of the light curve is (F0 - F1)/F0 * 100% = 5.18%.

So the variation is a peak-to-peak of about 5.18% * 2 = 10.36%? No, because the variation is between F0 and F1. The amplitude is the difference from the mean. The mean brightness would be the average of F0 and F1, but perhaps in this case, the star is only spotted on one hemisphere, so the brightness varies between F0 and F1 as the star rotates. The amplitude is (F0 - F1)/2, because the variation is symmetric around the mean.

Wait no, let's think again. When the star is at F0 (no spots visible), then as the spots rotate into view, brightness decreases to F1, and as it continues to rotate, it goes back to F0. So the brightness variation is a sine-like wave with peak at F0 and trough at F1. The amplitude is (F0 - F1)/2, because the average is (F0 + F1)/2, and the variation is from that average. So the amplitude of the light curve (the peak variation from the average) is (F0 - F1)/2. Which is 0.0518 / 2 = 0.0259 or about 2.59%.

Wait, this is a different approach. So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is about 2.59% of the mean brightness.

But wait, the problem says that the brightness variation (the amplitude) is the same as if an exoplanet were transiting. So in that case, the exoplanet would cause a dip of 2.59% when it transits.

Wait, this can't be right, because earlier calculation said the dip is 5.18% when the spots are fully visible. So I'm getting conflicting results.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation's amplitude is 5.18% because the maximum dip is 5.18% of the original brightness. So the exoplanet's dip should be 5.18%, which requires a planet size of 0.23 Rstar.

But again, none of the options match. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Another approach: Let's compute the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area that would cause the same dip as the spots.

The dip due to the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = (ΔF_planet) = (ΔF_spots).

So I need to compute ΔF_spots correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the effective area of the spots in terms of the star's luminosity.

The star's total luminosity is L = 4π R^2 σ T^4.

The spots have an area of A = 0.4 π R^2.

Their luminosity is L_spots = A σ T_spot^4.

The rest of the star's luminosity is L_rest = L - L_spots.

So when the spots are facing us, the total observed luminosity is L_rest + L_spots.

So the fractional change is (L_rest + L_spots - L) / L.

Which is ( L - L_spots + L_spots - L ) / L → no, that can't be.

Wait, the star's total luminosity without any spots is L0 = 4π R^2 σ (6000)^4.

When the spots are visible, the luminosity is L1 = (4π R^2 - A) σ (6000)^4 + A σ (5000)^4.

So L1 = L0 * [ (4π R^2 - A) (6000^4) + A (5000^4) ) / (4π R^2 * 6000^4) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio (L1/L0) - 1.

L1/L0 = [ (4π R² - A) (6000^4) + A (5000^4) ] / (4π R² 6000^4 )

As before, A = 0.4 π R².

So substituting:

= [ (4π R² - 0.4 π R²) * 6000^4 + 0.4 π R² * 5000^4 ] / (4π R² 6000^4 )

Factor out π R²:

= [ (3.6 π R²) * 6000^4 + 0.4 π R² * 5000^4 ] / (4 π R² 6000^4 )

Cancel π R² numerator and denominator:

= [3.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4] / (4 *6000^4 )

Factor out 6000^4 from numerator:

= [ 3.6 + 0.4 (5000/6000)^4 ] /4

= [3.6 + 0.4*(5/6)^4 ] /4

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So:

= [3.6 + 0.4 * 0.48225 ] /4

= [3.6 + 0.1929 ] /4

= 3.7929 /4 ≈ 0.9482.

So L1 = 0.9482 L0.

So the fractional change is (L1 - L0)/L0 = -0.0518, or -5.18% as before.

So the dip is 5.18% of the star's brightness.

So the planet's dip should be 5.18%, leading to (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2277.

But looking at the options, none is close to 0.23. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation due to the spots is only 10% of the star's surface. Because the filling factor is 20% of a hemisphere, which is 10% of the total surface area.

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. So the spots cover 10% of the star's surface. So the fractional area is 0.1.

But then, the dip is (F_spot - F_rest) * 0.1.

Wait, the dip is (F_rest - F_spot) * 0.1.

So dip = 0.1 * (F_rest - F_spot)/F_rest.

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 * (1 - (0.48225)) = 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775 → 5.1775%.

Same as before.

Hmm. So back to the original problem: the exoplanet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2277.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, but the exoplanet's radius is being compared to the host star's radius, not the Sun's. So Rpl is relative to Rstar, which is R_sun. So perhaps that doesn't change anything.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio in terms of the planet's area compared to the spots. Because the spots are causing a dip when they're on the near side, but the planet blocks a part of the star, leading to the same dip.

Wait, the dip caused by the planet is (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2 ) * 100%, which should equal 5.18%.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 =0.0518 → Rpl = Rstar * sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277 Rstar.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps considering the rotational modulation and the fact that only one hemisphere is spotted. So the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible, but the overall effect on brightness variation is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation is modulated as the spots rotate, causing a sinusoidal-like variation with an amplitude of (ΔF/2), because the brightness goes from F0 to F1 and back.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F0 - F1)/2 ≈ 5.18% /2 = 2.59%.

So the exoplanet's transit would cause a dip of 2.59%, leading to (Rpl/Rstar)^2 =0.0259 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.161.

But that's about 0.16, which is still not matching any option.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me think of the options again.

Wait, option C is ~0.11, which is (0.11)^2 = 0.0121, about 1.21% dip.

Option D is ~0.32 → 0.1024 dip, about 10.24%.

Option A is ~0.39 → 0.1521 dip, about 15.21%.

But the dip is 5.18%, which is between options C and D. But none match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the dip. Let me try another approach. Maybe the star's brightness variation is due to the spots being cooler, but the observed flux is modulated as the star rotates, leading to a variation in the observed flux.

Wait, the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible, but the average brightness when the spots are on the near side is F1, and on the far side, it's F0.

So the amplitude of the light curve (the peak-to-peak variation) would be F0 - F1 = 0.0518 F0. So the amplitude is that delta.

But for the exoplanet transit, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, which is a one-time dip, not a sinusoidal variation. So perhaps the correct approach is to make the dip the same as the spot-induced dip.

So the dip is 0.0518, so Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the area of the spots as 20% of the entire star, not just a hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8 π R².

But that would be a filling factor of 20% of the whole star, which is 20% of 4π R². Let's see what that would do.

Compute F1 again.

F1 = [ (4π R² - 0.8 π R²) * F_rest + 0.8 π R² * F_spot ] / 4 π R²

Simplify: (3.2 π R² * F_rest + 0.8 π R² F_spot ) /4 π R².

Factor out π R²:

= [3.2 F_rest + 0.8 F_spot ] /4

F_spot = (5/6)^4 F_rest ≈ 0.48225 F_rest.

So F1 = [3.2 F_rest + 0.8 * 0.48225 F_rest ] /4 

= [3.2 F_rest + 0.3858 F_rest ] /4 

= 3.5858 F_rest /4 ≈ 0.89645 F_rest.

So dip is (1 - 0.89645) = 0.10355 → about 10.36% dip.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1036 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.322.

Which is approximately 0.32, option D.

Wait, that matches option D. So perhaps the initial assumption that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface (not just a hemisphere) leads to this.

But the question says the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So that would mean 10% of the total surface area. So perhaps the correct calculation is the 5.18% dip, but perhaps the problem intended the filling factor to be 20% of the entire star.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again.

The question says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So 20% of the hemisphere is covered. So the area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R², as I did earlier.

But if the problem had the filling factor as 20% of the entire star, then the area would be 0.2 *4π R²= 0.8 π R², leading to a dip of about 10.36%, giving Rpl/Rstar ~0.32, which is option D.

But according to the question, the filling factor is 20% of a hemisphere, so the area is 10% of the total surface (0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1).

So why is the calculation leading to an option that's not present? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the average brightness when the star is rotating, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So the brightness variation depends on the rotational period and the spot distribution.

But perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me think: the brightness change is due to the spots covering a certain area. So to get the same dip, the planet's area should match the spot's area as a fraction of the star's area.

So spot area fraction is 0.1, so planet area fraction is 0.1, leading to Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316, which is approximately 0.32, option D.

Wait, that would make sense. Because the dip from the planet is (Rpl^2)/(Rstar^2) = 0.1 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316.

So that's option D.

But why is that the case?

Because the brightness dip caused by the spots is 5.18% when they are fully visible, which corresponds to an area of 0.1 (10%) of the star's surface. So the planet's area would need to be 10% of the star's surface, leading to a dip of 10% (since (0.316)^2 = 0.1).

Wait, but earlier calculation gave a dip of 5.18%, which is 5.18% of the star's brightness, but the area fraction is 10%. Because the spots are cooler, their effect isn't just their area but also their temperature.

Ah! So perhaps I should be comparing the luminosity blocked by the planet to the luminosity blocked by the spots. Because the planet blocks a part of the star, the dip is proportional to the area blocked. But the spots, being cooler, have a different effect.

Wait, no. The dip due to the planet is simply the area blocked times the star's flux. So if the planet blocks 10% of the star's area, the dip is 10% of the flux. But the dip due to the spots is 5.18%, which is less than 10%, because the spots are cooler.

So the planet's area needs to block the same amount of flux as the spots do. So the dip caused by the planet is (Rpl^2/Rstar^2) = (L_spot/ L_star ) * (T_spot / T_star )^4 ?

Wait, no. Because the planet blocks the star's light, regardless of the temperature. So the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

But the dip due to the spots is not just (A_spots / A_star) * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 ), which is the same as (A_spots / A_star) * (F_spot / F_star).

So the dip is (A_spots / A_star) * (F_spot - F_star) / F_star.

Which is (A_spots / A_star) * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4).

So dip = (0.1) * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775 → 5.1775%.

So the dip due to the spots is 5.1775% of the star's flux.

To get the same dip, the planet's area must block 5.1775% of the star's flux. But the planet's dip is (Rpl^2/Rstar^2) = dip_fraction.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2277.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the problem considers the brightness variation as the difference between the star with spots and without, not just the dip when the spots are visible. Because when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, leading to a variation in brightness. So the amplitude of this variation is the same as the planet's dip.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the overall brightness change due to the spots as a 5% dip, and the planet would cause the same 5% dip, leading to Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.223, which is still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius as the square root of the dip fraction. So if the dip is 5.18%, then sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277, which is about 0.23 Rstar. But the options don't have this.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 0.32, which is close to sqrt(0.1) = 0.316. So perhaps the problem intended the filling factor to be 10% of the star's surface, leading to dip of 10% and Rpl/Rstar of 0.316.

But according to the problem statement, the filling factor is 20% of a hemisphere, which is 10% of the star's surface. So the dip is 5.18%, but the planet's dip would be 5.18%, leading to a radius ratio of 0.2277.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's Teff is 6000 K, but the spots are 1000 K cooler than the surrounding, which is 5000 K. So the flux from the spots is F_spot = σ (5000)^4, and the rest is F_rest = σ (6000)^4.

The dip per spot area is (F_rest - F_spot)/F_rest = 1 - (5/6)^4 = 1 - 625/1296 ≈ 0.51775.

So for each spot, the dip per unit area is 0.51775 times the area.

The total dip is 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775 → 5.1775% dip.

To get the same dip, the planet must block 5.1775% of the star's flux, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2277.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as a function of the area times the temperature difference. So the effective area of the spots is 0.4π R², and the effective dip per area is (T_spot^4 - T_star^4)/T_star^4.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the planet to have the same amplitude in brightness variation as the spots. The spots cause a 5.18% dip, so the planet should cause 5.18% dip, leading to Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2277.

But this isn't an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are causing a dip of 20% (the filling factor) of the star's area, not considering the temperature difference. So dip is 20% of the star's surface area, leading to a dip of 20%, and Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.2) ≈ 0.447, which is approximately 0.45, but that's not an option either.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the area of the spots to the area of the planet. The area of the spots is 0.4π Rstar². The planet's area is π Rpl². So set π Rpl² = 0.4 π Rstar² → Rpl² = 0.4 Rstar² → Rpl = sqrt(0.4) Rstar ≈ 0.632 Rstar. But that can't be right because the options are much smaller.

No, that's not correct. Because the dip is not just based on area but also the temperature.

I'm stuck. Let me try to look for an alternative approach.

Alternative approach: Find the ratio of the areas (planet vs spots) that would cause the same dip in brightness.

The dip from the spots is:

dip_spot = (A_spots / A_star) * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4 )

= (0.1) * (1 - (5/6)^4 )

≈ 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775.

Set this equal to dip_planet = (A_planet / A_star) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2277.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the difference in flux as the dip, but not considering the entire area. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spots as a factor in the star's brightness, so when the spots are on the near side, the star's flux is F1, and when on the far side, F0. The brightness variation would be F0 and F1, so the amplitude is (F0 - F1)/2.

So the amplitude is (0.051775 * F0) / 2 ≈ 0.025888 F0.

So the planet's dip should be 0.025888 F0, leading to (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.025888 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.1609.

Which is ~0.16, still not matching any option.

Hmm.

Another thought: Maybe the problem is considering the brightness variation as the maximum difference between when the spots are just starting to come into view and when they're fully visible, so the variation is a sine wave with amplitude of 5.18%.

But for the exoplanet, the dip is a single event, not a sinusoidal variation. So the peak-to-peak variation for the planet would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2 *2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the planet would have to cause the same maximum dip as the spots, which is 5.18%, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2277.

But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the spots as a fraction of the star's surface, and the planet's radius as a fraction that would block the same area, but without considering the temperature difference. So if the spots cover 20% of the star's surface, then the planet's area would need to be 20%, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.2 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.447, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the hemisphere with spots as a 20% coverage, so the area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R², which is 10% of the star's surface. So the dip is 10% of the star's flux when the spots are visible, leading to (Rpl/Rstar)^2 =0.1 → Rpl ≈0.316 Rstar, which is option D.

But wait, earlier calculation with 10% area gave a dip of 5.18%, but if the dip is 10%, then Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316.

Hmm, perhaps the problem intended the filling factor to be 20% of the entire star, not a hemisphere. Because that would make the dip 10.36%, leading to Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.32, option D.

But according to the question, it's 20% of a hemisphere, which is 10% of the star's surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the area of the spots as 20% of the star's surface, leading to a dip of 10.36%, and Rpl/Rstar of 0.32, option D.

In that case, the correct answer would be option D.

But according to the question, the filling factor is 20% of a hemisphere, so the area is 10% of the star's surface, leading to a dip of 5.18%, which doesn't match any option.

Given the options, the only one close to 0.32 is option D. So perhaps the intended answer is D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's dark spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\star} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20% (i.e., 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots).
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The brightness dip caused by the spots depends on their area and their lower temperature.
   - The filling factor of 20% applies to one hemisphere, so the area of the spots is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\star}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\star}^2 \). This represents 10% of the star's total surface area.

3. **Flux Contribution**:
   - The flux from a blackbody is proportional to \( T^4 \). Thus, the flux from the star is \( F_{\text{star}} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \), and the flux from the spots is \( F_{\text{spots}} = \sigma T_{\text{spots}}^4 \).
   - The fractional brightness change when the spots are visible is:
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{F_{\text{spots}} - F_{\text{star}}}{F_{\text{star}}} = \frac{\sigma (5000^4 - 6000^4)}{\sigma 6000^4} = 1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775
     \]
   - Since the spots cover 10% of the star's surface, the total brightness dip is:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{total}} = 0.1 \times 0.51775 \approx 0.051775 \, \text{(or } 5.18\% \text{)}.
     \]

4. **Exoplanet Brightness Variation**:
   - The brightness dip caused by an exoplanet is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\star}}\right)^2
     \]
   - To match the brightness variation caused by the spots, we set \( \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \Delta F_{\text{total}} \):
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\star}}\right)^2 = 0.051775
     \]
   - Solving for \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\star} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\star}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2277
     \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated ratio \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\star} \approx 0.2277 \) does not match any of the provided options exactly.
   - However, if the problem intended the filling factor to represent 20% of the star's total surface area (instead of a hemisphere), the area of the spots would be \( 0.2 \times 4\pi R_{\star}^2 = 0.8\pi R_{\star}^2 \), leading to a larger dip:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{total}} = 0.2 \times 0.51775 \approx 0.10355 \, \text{(or } 10.36\% \text{)}.
     \]
   - In this case:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\star}}\right)^2 = 0.10355
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\star}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.322
     \]
   - This matches option **D**.

### Conclusion:
Given the ambiguity in interpreting the filling factor and the provided options, the most reasonable answer is **D**, assuming the filling factor applies to the star's total surface area.
