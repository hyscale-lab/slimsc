Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question says the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. Wait, I remember that when electrons get excited, they jump to a higher energy level, and when they drop back, they emit light. Oh right, that's fluorescence or something like that.

Wait, but the question is about the color it absorbs, not emits. Oh, right! I think organic compounds absorb certain wavelengths and emit others. Or wait, maybe it's about the energy difference. Oh, right, the energy gap between the excited state and ground state corresponds to the wavelength of light emitted or absorbed.

So when the dye is excited, it absorbs a photon of higher energy and then emits a photon of lower energy. Or is it the opposite? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a photon (with higher energy) and then emits a photon (with lower energy). So the absorbed light's energy is higher than the emitted light's. Because the energy difference is what excites the molecule.

Wait, the energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed light must have higher energy than that. Because the molecule can't emit more energy than it absorbed; it can only emit the difference.

So to find the absorbed color, I need to find the corresponding wavelength for 2.3393 eV, and then figure out what color that is. Wait, but wait. Wait, no, no. Because the emitted light is at 2.3393 eV, that's the energy of the photon it emits. So the energy gap between the excited state and ground state is that value.

Wait, but the absorbed photon's energy should be equal to that energy gap. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E, it gets excited to a higher energy state. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon of energy E. So the absorbed and emitted photons have the same energy? Wait, no, maybe not. Because sometimes it emits lower energy. Oh, wait, no, because the energy levels are fixed. So if the molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from ground to excited state (E), and when it emits, it goes back, so the emitted photon has energy E. So the absorbed and emitted photons have the same energy? Hmm, that can’t be right because different colors would be involved.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think of the energy levels. Suppose the molecule has an energy gap of E. When it absorbs a photon of energy E, it gets excited. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon of energy E. So the same energy? But then absorbed and emitted would be same color. That doesn't make sense because the question is saying the emitted light is in a certain color, and we have to find the absorbed color. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of the electromagnetic spectrum. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength.

So, the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. Let's compute the wavelength. Wait, but I don't remember the exact value of hc in eV·nm. I think 1 eV is approximately 1240 nm. So E (in eV) = 1240 nm / λ (in nm). So λ = 1240 / E.

E is 2.3393 eV, so λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let's calculate that. 1240 divided by 2.3393. Let me approximate. 2.3393 is about 2.34. 1240 / 2.34 ≈ 529.9 nm. So about 530 nm. What color is that? Hmm, the visible spectrum is roughly 400-700 nm. So 530 is in the green area. Wait, but the options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me compute it more accurately.

E = 2.3393 eV. hc is 1240 eV·nm. So λ = 1240 / 2.3393.

Let me calculate that: 1240 ÷ 2.3393.

Divide 1240 by 2.3393. Let's see. 2.3393 * 500 is 1169.65. 2.3393 * 529 is let's see, 2.3393 * 500=1169.65, 2.3393 * 29= about 68.04. So 1169.65 +68.04= 1237.69. Hmm, which is close to 1240. So 529 nm.

So 529 nm is green. But wait, the options don't have green. The options are red, violet, blue, yellow. So maybe I did something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing absorption and emission. Let's think again.

When a molecule absorbs a photon, it becomes excited. That photon's energy must be equal to the energy gap (E) between the ground and excited states. Then, when it emits a photon, it could emit a photon of lower energy (if there are other energy levels), but in some cases, like fluorescence, it emits a photon of the same energy. Wait, but that can't be. Because if the energy gap is E, the absorbed photon is E, and the emitted photon is E, then the color is same. But the question says the emitted is 2.3393 eV, so the color absorbed should be same? But the options don't have green. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the energy emitted is not the same as the energy absorbed. Because sometimes, the molecule can lose some energy through other means, like heat or other transitions, so the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed one.

So maybe the emitted photon's energy is lower than the absorbed. So, the energy of the absorbed photon is E_abs = E_emit + something. Oh, but wait, the energy difference between the two states is E. So when the molecule emits, the photon's energy would be E. Wait, but if the absorbed photon is E, then why would emission be lower? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon, which causes it to jump to a higher energy level, and then emits a lower energy photon as it relaxes to a lower energy state than the original. But then, that would mean the energy difference is the same as the initial state. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the initial energy is lower, and upon excitation, it goes higher. Then, when it emits, it goes back to the lower state, so the photon emitted has energy equal to the difference. So for example, if the molecule absorbs a photon of E, that's the energy gap. Then, when it emits, it could be the same E. But that would mean the same color, which doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule absorbs a higher-energy photon (lower wavelength) and emits a lower-energy photon (higher wavelength). So the absorbed photon has higher energy than emitted.

Because in the question, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than that.

But the question is, what color is absorbed? Since higher energy photons mean shorter wavelength, which corresponds to higher frequency. So colors go from red (long wavelength, low energy) to violet (short wavelength, high energy).

So, if the emitted photon is ~530 nm (green), then the absorbed photon would have higher energy, which would be shorter wavelength, like blue or violet.

Wait, but the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

Wait, but wait, earlier calculation of 2.3393 eV gives ~530 nm, which is green, but that's not an option here. Oh, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the wavelength calculation.

E = 2.3393 eV.

λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 529.9 nm, which is in the green part of the spectrum (around 530 nm). So the emitted light is green.

But the options don't have green. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the question is about the complementary color. Because when a dye emits light, it's because it absorbed a certain color and emitted another. So if the emitted light is green, the absorbed must be the complementary color, which is magenta. But that's not an option either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the energy emitted is the energy difference between the two states, so the absorbing photon has higher energy.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed?"

So the molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited, then emits a photon of 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than 2.3393 eV.

Because when the molecule absorbs, it's taking in energy to reach a higher state. Then, when it emits, it releases some energy. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher.

So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted one.

Therefore, the absorbed photon's energy is E_abs = E_emit + (some energy loss?), but wait, that's not right. The energy difference between the excited and ground state is E. So the photon's energy is E. So when the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E, it goes from ground to excited state. So the emitted photon would have energy E as well.

Wait, but that brings us back to the same problem. So perhaps the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy, and emits a lower-energy photon, but that would mean the energy gap is smaller than the absorbed photon. So when the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon, it gets excited to a higher level, but then emits a photon of lower energy because it drops down to an intermediate state, not all the way.

Wait, maybe that's possible. So, the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon's energy is higher than that. So the absorbed photon has higher energy, which corresponds to shorter wavelength, so towards violet or blue.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed photon must be a higher energy, which is towards blue or violet.

So, looking at the options: B is violet, C is blue.

So what's the wavelength of 2.3393 eV? As before, about 530 nm, which is green. So the absorbed photon would have a shorter wavelength than green. Let's compute the energy of a higher energy photon, say in the violet range.

Violet is around 400-450 nm. Let's compute E for 400 nm: E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV. 450 nm: E= 1240/450≈2.756 eV. So if the emitted is 2.3393 eV (~530 nm), then the absorbed is higher than that, say in the blue or violet.

Wait, 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm. Let me see the options: the possible absorbed color would be in higher energy, so shorter wavelength than 530 nm. So the color absorbed would be in the blue or violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet, C is blue.

Wait, 2.3393 eV is 530 nm (green). The absorbed photon has higher energy than that, so shorter wavelength. So which of the options has a shorter wavelength than green? Violet is shorter than blue, which is shorter than green.

Wait, no. The order of colors from longer to shorter wavelength is red (~700), orange (~620), yellow (~580), green (~530), blue (~470), violet (~400). So, if the emitted is green (530), the absorbed must be blue or violet, which are shorter wavelengths.

But the question is, what color is absorbed? So it would be either blue or violet.

Looking at the calculation, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. Let me compute what color 2.3393 eV is and what colors are higher energy (shorter wavelength) than that.

Wait, 2.3393 eV is 530 nm (green). So the absorption must be at a wavelength shorter than 530 nm. Which would correspond to blue or violet.

So looking at the options, B is violet, C is blue. Which one is correct?

Wait, the compound emits green light. So the absorbed light must be higher energy than the emitted. So, the absorbed photon is blue or violet.

But wait, the visible spectrum is: red (700 nm), orange (610), yellow (580), green (530), blue (470), violet (400).

So the absorbed photon wavelength is shorter than 530, so say 450 nm (blue) or 400 nm (violet).

So, let's compute E for 450 nm: E = 1240/450 ≈ 2.756 eV.

And for 400 nm: E=3.1 eV.

So, if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (530 nm), the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so in blue or violet.

But how to choose between B) Violet and C) Blue?

Wait, the compound emits green. If the dye absorbs blue, it would emit green. Alternatively, if it absorbs violet, emits green.

But the question is, what color is absorbed? So the absorbed light is blue or violet.

But in the options, only blue and violet are present. So the answer would be either B or C.

Hmm, perhaps I can look for a relationship between the photon energies.

Wait, the energy difference between the ground state and excited state is equal to the energy of the emitted photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy difference.

Wait, but that would imply that the absorbed photon's energy is E = 2.3393 eV. Then the wavelength is 530 nm, which is green. But the options don't have that. So maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy absorbed is higher, so the photon is higher in energy, which would correspond to a shorter wavelength.

Wait, but then how to determine the color.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the complementary color. For example, if the dye emits green, it must absorb the complementary color, which is magenta. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, which is about 530 nm (green). So, the dye must have absorbed a photon with higher energy than this. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it's promoted to a higher energy state. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon with energy equal to the energy difference between the states.

Wait, so the energy of the absorbed photon is E_abs = E1 - E0, where E1 is the excited state and E0 is the ground state. The emitted photon's energy is E_emit = E1 - E0. So E_abs = E_emit. So, the absorbed and emitted photons have the same energy. Which would imply same color.

But that would mean the question's options are incorrect, since green is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and instead, the emitted light is the complementary color.

Wait, maybe the dye is absorbing a certain color and emitting another. So, if the compound emits green, it must be absorbing a complementary color. The complementary color of green is magenta, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is reversed. The energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy of the emitted photon. So the color absorbed is green, but that's not an option.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think: what's the relationship between absorption and emission in fluorescence?

In fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a photon (with energy E) and gets excited to a higher state. Then, from that higher state, it emits a photon (with energy E') and drops to a lower state. So E > E'.

Thus, the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted photon.

So in this case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed photon must be higher than that.

So the wavelength of the absorbed photon is shorter than 530 nm.

So, looking for the color in the options, the absorbed photon could be violet or blue.

The options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So which color has a wavelength shorter than 530 nm? Violet (400-440) and blue (450-495). Both are shorter than 530.

So the possible answers are B or C.

Hmm, but how do I choose between them.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is just a bit higher than the emitted. So the wavelength is just a bit shorter than 530 nm.

If I compute the absorbed photon's energy, which is higher than 2.3393 eV, but not by much. Let's say it's in the blue range.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitting photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm (green). So the absorbed photon is higher, say 2.75 eV (blue, 450 nm), or 3.0 eV (violet, 413 nm).

But without more data, I can't exactly compute it. But the question gives the options of blue and violet.

But, wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So the correct answer would be the color with a wavelength shorter than 530 nm, either blue or violet.

So among the options, B is violet and C is blue.

But without knowing the exact energy of the absorbed photon, can I determine which is correct? Maybe I need to think about typical dye colors.

Wait, many dyes absorb in the UV or visible range and emit in another. For example, some dyes absorb in the UV and emit blue or green.

Wait, but if the emitted photon is green (530 nm), the absorbed photon is higher than that. So, maybe blue or violet.

But which one is more likely?

I think the answer is B) Violet, because 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm. So the absorbed photon must be higher energy, which would be violet.

Wait, let me think about the energy values. For example, 400 nm is 3.1 eV, 450 nm is about 2.75 eV. The emitted is 2.3393 eV.

So, if the absorbed photon is violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV), that's more than 2.3393. Alternatively, blue is ~450 nm, which is 2.75 eV, which is also higher than 2.3393.

So, without knowing the exact energy, I can't precisely say, but since the options don't specify, perhaps the intended answer is B) Violet.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the exact wavelength of 2.3393 eV.

Wait, 1240 divided by 2.3393.

Let me compute that more accurately. 1240 ÷ 2.3393.

2.3393 * 529 = Let me calculate 2.3393 * 500 = 1169.65. 2.3393 * 29 = 68.04. 1169.65 + 68.04 = 1237.69. So 2.3393 * 529 = 1237.69. The target is 1240, so 529 + (1240 - 1237.69)/(2.3393) = 529 + 2.31/2.3393 ≈ 529 + ~1. So about 530 nm.

So the emitted photon is green. The absorbed photon must be higher energy, so shorter wavelength than green.

So, the color absorbed is either blue or violet.

But which of the options is correct? The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

The question is about the color absorbed. So the correct answer must be B) Violet.

Wait, but why?

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of how the energy levels work. The energy difference between the ground and excited state is E_emit = 2.3393 eV. So the photon absorbed must have energy E_abs = E_emit + something. No, that doesn't fit. Because the energy gap is fixed.

Wait, no. The energy of the photon absorbed is exactly the energy needed to promote the electron from the ground state to the excited state. So the absorbed photon's energy is E_abs = E_excited - E_ground = E_emit. Which would imply the same energy, same color.

But that brings us back to the same issue because the options don't include green.

Hmm. Maybe the question is intended to be about the complementary color.

Wait, the complementary color of green is magenta, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm misunderstanding it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the color absorbed, which is the one with higher energy than the emitted. Because when the dye emits green, it absorbed a higher energy photon, which would be in the blue or violet range. So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

But without knowing the exact energy, I can't determine exactly between the two.

Wait, but 2.3393 eV is a specific value. Maybe I can compute the exact wavelength and see where it falls.

So, 1240 divided by 2.3393 is approximately 529.9 nm, which is indeed in the green range.

So, the absorbed photon must have a shorter wavelength, which would be blue or violet.

If the options are B and C, then the correct answer is either. But I need to choose between them.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference is such that the absorbed photon's wavelength is in the blue range.

Wait, 2.3393 eV is 530 nm. Let's say the absorbed photon is at 450 nm (blue), which is about 2.756 eV.

So, the energy difference between the photon absorbed (2.756 eV) and the emitted (2.3393 eV) is 0.4167 eV. That could be the energy difference due to other factors like heat loss or other transitions.

Alternatively, the energy of the absorbed photon is 2.3393 eV, so the emitted photon would also be 2.3393 eV, but that's not matching the options.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but looking at the options, B is violet, which is a higher energy than blue. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed could be blue or violet. But which one is the answer?

Wait, another way: the question is about the color absorbed, which is the color that the compound does not emit. So if it emits green, it absorbs the complementary color. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is reversed. The emitted color's energy is given, and we need to find the absorbed color, which is higher energy. So the correct answer is either blue or violet.

Well, perhaps the intended answer is B) Violet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: The energy of 2.3393 eV corresponds to green. The absorbed photon must have higher energy, so the color absorbed is either blue or violet.

In the visible spectrum, blue is about 470 nm (E=2.638 eV), violet is about 400 nm (3.1 eV). 2.3393 is green, so the absorbed photon must be blue (470, 2.638 eV) or violet (400, 3.1 eV).

Among the options, B and C are possible. But without more info, I can't decide. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet. Because 2.3393 eV is slightly higher than 2.3 eV (which is 540 nm, green).

Wait, 2.3393 eV is 530 nm, which is green. So the absorbed photon must be higher, so either blue or violet.

But I think the answer intended is Violet, so the correct option is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the color of light absorbed by a textile dye that emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. To solve this, we analyze the relationship between energy, wavelength, and color.

1. **Energy and Wavelength Relationship**:  
   The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation:  
   \[
   E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]  
   where \(E\) is energy (in eV), \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda\) is wavelength (in nm). Using the approximation \(hc \approx 1240 \, \text{eV·nm}\), the wavelength corresponding to \(E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV}\) is:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1240}{2.3393} \approx 529.9 \, \text{nm}.
   \]  
   This wavelength falls in the green region of the visible spectrum.

2. **Absorption and Emission Relationship**:  
   In fluorescence, a molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength) and emits a photon of lower energy (longer wavelength). Since the emitted photon has an energy of \(2.3393 \, \text{eV}\) (529.9 nm, green), the absorbed photon must have a higher energy and a shorter wavelength.

3. **Color of Absorbed Light**:  
   The absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than 529.9 nm, corresponding to either blue (470–495 nm) or violet (400–450 nm). Among the given options, violet corresponds to a higher energy than blue. Therefore, the absorbed light is most likely violet.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Based on the calculations and the relationship between energy, wavelength, and color, the absorbed light corresponds to violet light.

Answer: B

Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question says the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. Wait, I remember that when electrons get excited, they jump to a higher energy level, and when they drop back, they emit light. Oh right, that's fluorescence or something like that.

Wait, but the question is about the color it absorbs, not emits. Oh, right! I think organic compounds absorb certain wavelengths and emit others. Or wait, maybe it's about the energy difference. Oh, right, the energy gap between the excited state and ground state corresponds to the wavelength of light emitted or absorbed.

So when the dye is excited, it absorbs a photon of higher energy and then emits a photon of lower energy. Or is it the opposite? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a photon (with higher energy) and then emits a photon (with lower energy). So the absorbed light's energy is higher than the emitted light's. Because the energy difference is what excites the molecule.

Wait, the energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed light must have higher energy than that. Because the molecule can't emit more energy than it absorbed; it can only emit the difference.

So to find the absorbed color, I need to find the corresponding wavelength for 2.3393 eV, and then figure out what color that is. Wait, but wait. Wait, no, no. Because the emitted light is at 2.3393 eV, that's the energy of the photon it emits. So the energy gap between the excited state and ground state is that value.

Wait, but the absorbed photon's energy should be equal to that energy gap. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E, it gets excited to a higher energy state. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon of energy E. So the absorbed and emitted photons have the same energy? Wait, no, maybe not. Because sometimes it emits lower energy. Oh, wait, no, because the energy levels are fixed. So if the molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from ground to excited state (E), and when it emits, it goes back, so the emitted photon has energy E. So the absorbed and emitted photons have the same energy? Hmm, that can’t be right because different colors would be involved.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think of the energy levels. Suppose the molecule has an energy gap of E. When it absorbs a photon of energy E, it gets excited. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon of energy E. So the same energy? But then absorbed and emitted would be same color. That doesn't make sense because the question is saying the emitted light is in a certain color, and we have to find the absorbed color. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of the electromagnetic spectrum. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength.

So, the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. Let's compute the wavelength. Wait, but I don't remember the exact value of hc in eV·nm. I think 1 eV is approximately 1240 nm. So E (in eV) = 1240 nm / λ (in nm). So λ = 1240 / E.

E is 2.3393 eV, so λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let's calculate that. 1240 divided by 2.3393. Let me approximate. 2.3393 is about 2.34. 1240 / 2.34 ≈ 529.9 nm. So about 530 nm. What color is that? Hmm, the visible spectrum is roughly 400-700 nm. So 530 is in the green area. Wait, but the options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me compute it more accurately.

E = 2.3393 eV. hc is 1240 eV·nm. So λ = 1240 / 2.3393.

Let me calculate that: 1240 ÷ 2.3393.

Divide 1240 by 2.3393. Let's see. 2.3393 * 500 is 1169.65. 2.3393 * 529 is let's see, 2.3393 * 500=1169.65, 2.3393 * 29= about 68.04. So 1169.65 +68.04= 1237.69. Hmm, which is close to 1240. So 529 nm.

So 529 nm is green. But wait, the options don't have green. The options are red, violet, blue, yellow. So maybe I did something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing absorption and emission. Let's think again.

When a molecule absorbs a photon, it becomes excited. That photon's energy must be equal to the energy gap (E) between the ground and excited states. Then, when it emits a photon, it could emit a photon of lower energy (if there are other energy levels), but in some cases, like fluorescence, it emits a photon of the same energy. Wait, but that can't be. Because if the energy gap is E, the absorbed photon is E, and the emitted photon is E, then the color is same. But the question says the emitted is 2.3393 eV, so the color absorbed should be same? But the options don't have green. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the energy emitted is not the same as the energy absorbed. Because sometimes, the molecule can lose some energy through other means, like heat or other transitions, so the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed one.

So maybe the emitted photon's energy is lower than the absorbed. So, the energy of the absorbed photon is E_abs = E_emit + something. Oh, but wait, the energy difference between the two states is E. So when the molecule emits, the photon's energy would be E. Wait, but if the absorbed photon is E, then why would emission be lower? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon, which causes it to jump to a higher energy level, and then emits a lower energy photon as it relaxes to a lower energy state than the original. But then, that would mean the energy difference is the same as the initial state. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the initial energy is lower, and upon excitation, it goes higher. Then, when it emits, it goes back to the lower state, so the photon emitted has energy equal to the difference. So for example, if the molecule absorbs a photon of E, that's the energy gap. Then, when it emits, it could be the same E. But that would mean the same color, which doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule absorbs a higher-energy photon (lower wavelength) and emits a lower-energy photon (higher wavelength). So the absorbed photon has higher energy than emitted.

Because in the question, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than that.

But the question is, what color is absorbed? Since higher energy photons mean shorter wavelength, which corresponds to higher frequency. So colors go from red (long wavelength, low energy) to violet (short wavelength, high energy).

So, if the emitted photon is ~530 nm (green), then the absorbed photon would have higher energy, which would be shorter wavelength, like blue or violet.

Wait, but the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

Wait, but wait, earlier calculation of 2.3393 eV gives ~530 nm, which is green, but that's not an option here. Oh, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the wavelength calculation.

E = 2.3393 eV.

λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 529.9 nm, which is in the green part of the spectrum (around 530 nm). So the emitted light is green.

But the options don't have green. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the question is about the complementary color. Because when a dye emits light, it's because it absorbed a certain color and emitted another. So if the emitted light is green, the absorbed must be the complementary color, which is magenta. But that's not an option either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the energy emitted is the energy difference between the two states, so the absorbing photon has higher energy.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed?"

So the molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited, then emits a photon of 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than 2.3393 eV.

Because when the molecule absorbs, it's taking in energy to reach a higher state. Then, when it emits, it releases some energy. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher.

So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted one.

Therefore, the absorbed photon's energy is E_abs = E_emit + (some energy loss?), but wait, that's not right. The energy difference between the excited and ground state is E. So the photon's energy is E. So when the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E, it goes from ground to excited state. So the emitted photon would have energy E as well.

Wait, but that brings us back to the same problem. So perhaps the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy, and emits a lower-energy photon, but that would mean the energy gap is smaller than the absorbed photon. So when the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon, it gets excited to a higher level, but then emits a photon of lower energy because it drops down to an intermediate state, not all the way.

Wait, maybe that's possible. So, the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon's energy is higher than that. So the absorbed photon has higher energy, which corresponds to shorter wavelength, so towards violet or blue.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed photon must be a higher energy, which is towards blue or violet.

So, looking at the options: B is violet, C is blue.

So what's the wavelength of 2.3393 eV? As before, about 530 nm, which is green. So the absorbed photon would have a shorter wavelength than green. Let's compute the energy of a higher energy photon, say in the violet range.

Violet is around 400-450 nm. Let's compute E for 400 nm: E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV. 450 nm: E= 1240/450≈2.756 eV. So if the emitted is 2.3393 eV (~530 nm), then the absorbed is higher than that, say in the blue or violet.

Wait, 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm. Let me see the options: the possible absorbed color would be in higher energy, so shorter wavelength than 530 nm. So the color absorbed would be in the blue or violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet, C is blue.

Wait, 2.3393 eV is 530 nm (green). The absorbed photon has higher energy than that, so shorter wavelength. So which of the options has a shorter wavelength than green? Violet is shorter than blue, which is shorter than green.

Wait, no. The order of colors from longer to shorter wavelength is red (~700), orange (~620), yellow (~580), green (~530), blue (~470), violet (~400). So, if the emitted is green (530), the absorbed must be blue or violet, which are shorter wavelengths.

But the question is, what color is absorbed? So it would be either blue or violet.

Looking at the calculation, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. Let me compute what color 2.3393 eV is and what colors are higher energy (shorter wavelength) than that.

Wait, 2.3393 eV is 530 nm (green). So the absorption must be at a wavelength shorter than 530 nm. Which would correspond to blue or violet.

So looking at the options, B is violet, C is blue. Which one is correct?

Wait, the compound emits green light. So the absorbed light must be higher energy than the emitted. So, the absorbed photon is blue or violet.

But wait, the visible spectrum is: red (700 nm), orange (610), yellow (580), green (530), blue (470), violet (400).

So the absorbed photon wavelength is shorter than 530, so say 450 nm (blue) or 400 nm (violet).

So, let's compute E for 450 nm: E = 1240/450 ≈ 2.756 eV.

And for 400 nm: E=3.1 eV.

So, if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (530 nm), the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so in blue or violet.

But how to choose between B) Violet and C) Blue?

Wait, the compound emits green. If the dye absorbs blue, it would emit green. Alternatively, if it absorbs violet, emits green.

But the question is, what color is absorbed? So the absorbed light is blue or violet.

But in the options, only blue and violet are present. So the answer would be either B or C.

Hmm, perhaps I can look for a relationship between the photon energies.

Wait, the energy difference between the ground state and excited state is equal to the energy of the emitted photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy difference.

Wait, but that would imply that the absorbed photon's energy is E = 2.3393 eV. Then the wavelength is 530 nm, which is green. But the options don't have that. So maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy absorbed is higher, so the photon is higher in energy, which would correspond to a shorter wavelength.

Wait, but then how to determine the color.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the complementary color. For example, if the dye emits green, it must absorb the complementary color, which is magenta. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, which is about 530 nm (green). So, the dye must have absorbed a photon with higher energy than this. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it's promoted to a higher energy state. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon with energy equal to the energy difference between the states.

Wait, so the energy of the absorbed photon is E_abs = E1 - E0, where E1 is the excited state and E0 is the ground state. The emitted photon's energy is E_emit = E1 - E0. So E_abs = E_emit. So, the absorbed and emitted photons have the same energy. Which would imply same color.

But that would mean the question's options are incorrect, since green is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and instead, the emitted light is the complementary color.

Wait, maybe the dye is absorbing a certain color and emitting another. So, if the compound emits green, it must be absorbing a complementary color. The complementary color of green is magenta, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is reversed. The energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy of the emitted photon. So the color absorbed is green, but that's not an option.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think: what's the relationship between absorption and emission in fluorescence?

In fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a photon (with energy E) and gets excited to a higher state. Then, from that higher state, it emits a photon (with energy E') and drops to a lower state. So E > E'.

Thus, the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted photon.

So in this case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed photon must be higher than that.

So the wavelength of the absorbed photon is shorter than 530 nm.

So, looking for the color in the options, the absorbed photon could be violet or blue.

The options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So which color has a wavelength shorter than 530 nm? Violet (400-440) and blue (450-495). Both are shorter than 530.

So the possible answers are B or C.

Hmm, but how do I choose between them.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is just a bit higher than the emitted. So the wavelength is just a bit shorter than 530 nm.

If I compute the absorbed photon's energy, which is higher than 2.3393 eV, but not by much. Let's say it's in the blue range.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitting photon's energy is 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm (green). So the absorbed photon is higher, say 2.75 eV (blue, 450 nm), or 3.0 eV (violet, 413 nm).

But without more data, I can't exactly compute it. But the question gives the options of blue and violet.

But, wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So the correct answer would be the color with a wavelength shorter than 530 nm, either blue or violet.

So among the options, B is violet and C is blue.

But without knowing the exact energy of the absorbed photon, can I determine which is correct? Maybe I need to think about typical dye colors.

Wait, many dyes absorb in the UV or visible range and emit in another. For example, some dyes absorb in the UV and emit blue or green.

Wait, but if the emitted photon is green (530 nm), the absorbed photon is higher than that. So, maybe blue or violet.

But which one is more likely?

I think the answer is B) Violet, because 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm. So the absorbed photon must be higher energy, which would be violet.

Wait, let me think about the energy values. For example, 400 nm is 3.1 eV, 450 nm is about 2.75 eV. The emitted is 2.3393 eV.

So, if the absorbed photon is violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV), that's more than 2.3393. Alternatively, blue is ~450 nm, which is 2.75 eV, which is also higher than 2.3393.

So, without knowing the exact energy, I can't precisely say, but since the options don't specify, perhaps the intended answer is B) Violet.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the exact wavelength of 2.3393 eV.

Wait, 1240 divided by 2.3393.

Let me compute that more accurately. 1240 ÷ 2.3393.

2.3393 * 529 = Let me calculate 2.3393 * 500 = 1169.65. 2.3393 * 29 = 68.04. 1169.65 + 68.04 = 1237.69. So 2.3393 * 529 = 1237.69. The target is 1240, so 529 + (1240 - 1237.69)/(2.3393) = 529 + 2.31/2.3393 ≈ 529 + ~1. So about 530 nm.

So the emitted photon is green. The absorbed photon must be higher energy, so shorter wavelength than green.

So, the color absorbed is either blue or violet.

But which of the options is correct? The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

The question is about the color absorbed. So the correct answer must be B) Violet.

Wait, but why?

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of how the energy levels work. The energy difference between the ground and excited state is E_emit = 2.3393 eV. So the photon absorbed must have energy E_abs = E_emit + something. No, that doesn't fit. Because the energy gap is fixed.

Wait, no. The energy of the photon absorbed is exactly the energy needed to promote the electron from the ground state to the excited state. So the absorbed photon's energy is E_abs = E_excited - E_ground = E_emit. Which would imply the same energy, same color.

But that brings us back to the same issue because the options don't include green.

Hmm. Maybe the question is intended to be about the complementary color.

Wait, the complementary color of green is magenta, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm misunderstanding it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the color absorbed, which is the one with higher energy than the emitted. Because when the dye emits green, it absorbed a higher energy photon, which would be in the blue or violet range. So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

But without knowing the exact energy, I can't determine exactly between the two.

Wait, but 2.3393 eV is a specific value. Maybe I can compute the exact wavelength and see where it falls.

So, 1240 divided by 2.3393 is approximately 529.9 nm, which is indeed in the green range.

So, the absorbed photon must have a shorter wavelength, which would be blue or violet.

If the options are B and C, then the correct answer is either. But I need to choose between them.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference is such that the absorbed photon's wavelength is in the blue range.

Wait, 2.3393 eV is 530 nm. Let's say the absorbed photon is at 450 nm (blue), which is about 2.756 eV.

So, the energy difference between the photon absorbed (2.756 eV) and the emitted (2.3393 eV) is 0.4167 eV. That could be the energy difference due to other factors like heat loss or other transitions.

Alternatively, the energy of the absorbed photon is 2.3393 eV, so the emitted photon would also be 2.3393 eV, but that's not matching the options.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but looking at the options, B is violet, which is a higher energy than blue. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed could be blue or violet. But which one is the answer?

Wait, another way: the question is about the color absorbed, which is the color that the compound does not emit. So if it emits green, it absorbs the complementary color. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is reversed. The emitted color's energy is given, and we need to find the absorbed color, which is higher energy. So the correct answer is either blue or violet.

Well, perhaps the intended answer is B) Violet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: The energy of 2.3393 eV corresponds to green. The absorbed photon must have higher energy, so the color absorbed is either blue or violet.

In the visible spectrum, blue is about 470 nm (E=2.638 eV), violet is about 400 nm (3.1 eV). 2.3393 is green, so the absorbed photon must be blue (470, 2.638 eV) or violet (400, 3.1 eV).

Among the options, B and C are possible. But without more info, I can't decide. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet. Because 2.3393 eV is slightly higher than 2.3 eV (which is 540 nm, green).

Wait, 2.3393 eV is 530 nm, which is green. So the absorbed photon must be higher, so either blue or violet.

But I think the answer intended is Violet, so the correct option is B.


The question involves determining the color of light absorbed by a textile dye that emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. To solve this, we analyze the relationship between energy, wavelength, and color.

1. **Energy and Wavelength Relationship**:  
   The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation:  
   \[
   E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]  
   where \(E\) is energy (in eV), \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda\) is wavelength (in nm). Using the approximation \(hc \approx 1240 \, \text{eV·nm}\), the wavelength corresponding to \(E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV}\) is:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1240}{2.3393} \approx 529.9 \, \text{nm}.
   \]  
   This wavelength falls in the green region of the visible spectrum.

2. **Absorption and Emission Relationship**:  
   In fluorescence, a molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength) and emits a photon of lower energy (longer wavelength). Since the emitted photon has an energy of \(2.3393 \, \text{eV}\) (529.9 nm, green), the absorbed photon must have a higher energy and a shorter wavelength.

3. **Color of Absorbed Light**:  
   The absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than 529.9 nm, corresponding to either blue (470–495 nm) or violet (400–450 nm). Among the given options, violet corresponds to a higher energy than blue. Therefore, the absorbed light is most likely violet.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Based on the calculations and the relationship between energy, wavelength, and color, the absorbed light corresponds to violet light.

Answer: B
