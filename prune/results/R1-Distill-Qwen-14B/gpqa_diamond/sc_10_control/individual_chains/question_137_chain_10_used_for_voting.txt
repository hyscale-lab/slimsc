Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that synchrocyclotrons are types of cyclotrons used to accelerate charged particles, but the specifics are a bit fuzzy. Let me think.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is about 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

I think in a cyclotron, the magnetic field keeps the particles moving in a circle, and the electric field accelerates them. The frequency of the applied voltage must match the particle's cyclotron frequency as it's being accelerated. But wait, what's the cyclotron frequency again? Oh right, it's the frequency at which a charged particle orbits in a magnetic field, given by f = (qB)/(2πm). But in a synchrocyclotron, because the particles are accelerated, the frequency might change, but wait—no, actually, in a regular cyclotron, the frequency is constant because the speed doesn't change much. But for synchrocyclotrons, as particles gain energy, the radius increases, and the mass is the same, so the frequency changes. Or wait, the magnetic field might change? Or maybe not. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the problem mentions that the proton undergoes two accelerations. Oh, maybe it's accelerated twice in each revolution. Because each time it goes through the gap between the D-shaped boxes, it gets a kick of voltage. So perhaps each half-cycle of the voltage provides an acceleration. So each revolution, the proton gets two kicks. Hmm, but wait, in a cyclotron, the voltage's frequency is such that the time for one revolution matches the period of the voltage, so the particles are accelerated each time they pass the gap, which is once per revolution. Or wait, maybe in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency is varied, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about energy. The kinetic energy given is 950 MeV. The rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², so 950 is just above that. So it's a high-energy proton, but the exact energy might not be directly relevant yet.

The voltage applied is U0 cos(...). The maximum voltage is 190 kV, so each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains kinetic energy. But wait, how much energy per revolution? Because each time the voltage is applied, the proton is accelerated. But in a synchrocyclotron, since the magnetic field is varied, the particles are kept in a stable orbit because their cyclotron frequency matches the frequency of the applied voltage.

Wait, the problem is about the number of revolutions. So perhaps the number of revolutions is related to how many times the proton is accelerated to reach the desired energy.

Each acceleration step: when the proton passes through the gap, it gains energy. The energy gained each time depends on the voltage. So the maximum energy gained per passage is e*U0, where e is the proton charge. Because the voltage is U0 cos(...), the peak is U0.

Wait, but the proton is going through the gap twice per revolution? Or once per revolution? Because in a cyclotron, each revolution causes the particle to pass through the gap once, but for each half-period of the voltage. So if the voltage is AC, the particle may gain energy twice per cycle—once when the voltage is positive and once when it's negative, but only if the phase allows it. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the formula for the energy gained per revolution in a cyclotron is approximately e*U0, but only if the voltage is synchronous. Since the problem states that the voltage is applied as U(t)=U0 cos[2π ν(α) t + Φ0], where α is the angle, perhaps ν(α) is the varying frequency due to the change in radius as the proton gains energy. So in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency is adjusted so that the proton is always in phase with the voltage. So each time the proton goes around, it's accelerated once. So each revolution gives it one acceleration of e*U0.

Wait, but wait, the energy per revolution would be e*U0, but for a proton, e is 1.6e-19 C. So ΔE = e * U0. Let me calculate that.

U0 is 190 kV, which is 190,000 volts. So e*U0 = (1.6e-19 C)(190,000 V) = 3.04e-14 J. But wait, we're dealing with MeV. Let me convert that to MeV.

1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 1 J is 6.242e18 eV. So 3.04e-14 J is 3.04e-14 * 6.242e18 eV ≈ 190,000 eV, which is 190 keV. So each revolution, the proton gains 190 keV.

Wait, but that's only 0.190 MeV. The target is 950 MeV. So the number of revolutions would be 950 / 0.19 = approximately 5,000 something. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have 5000. The options are A)1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

Wait, so 950 divided by 0.19 is 5000, but the options don't have 5000. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Or maybe each revolution gives more energy.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Each time the proton passes through the gap, it's accelerated. The voltage is applied as U(t) = U0 cos(...), and the maximum voltage is U0. So each time the proton crosses the gap, it gains energy e*U0, but this happens twice each revolution. Because as the proton moves through the gap, the voltage changes from positive to negative and back, so the proton could gain energy twice per revolution. So each revolution gives 2 * e * U0.

Wait, is that correct? Let me visualize the cyclotron. The D-shaped boxes have a gap in the magnet. The proton moves through the gap, and the voltage is applied across the gap. The electric field in the gap is oscillating. So each time the proton passes through the gap, it might get a kick. How often does that happen? Once per revolution because in a regular cyclotron, the frequency is matched so that the proton passes through the gap once per revolution, getting a kick each time. But wait, in a typical cyclotron, the frequency is fixed, and the particles go through the gap once per period. So for each revolution, one acceleration.

But if the cyclotron's frequency is adjusted so that the proton is always in phase, perhaps it's possible to have two accelerations per revolution. Or maybe it's the opposite. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the total energy gained. The desired energy is 950 MeV. Each time the proton goes around once, it gains 190 keV (which is 0.190 MeV). So the number of revolutions needed would be approximately (950) / (0.190) ≈ 5000 revolutions.

But looking at the options, option B is 5300. That's close. But wait, the initial statement says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Oh, the question says the proton undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach T1 = 950 MeV. So two accelerations per revolution? Then each revolution adds 2 * (190 keV) = 380 keV (0.380 MeV).

So then the number of revolutions would be 950 / 0.380 ≈ 2500. Which is option D. Hmm, but wait, the initial statement says it undergoes two accelerations, but perhaps each acceleration is per revolution. So each revolution, two accelerations, each adding 190 keV. So 0.380 MeV per revolution.

Wait, 950 divided by 0.38 is 2500. So that would make D) 2500 the answer. But why does the initial statement say two accelerations? Because the voltage is applied as an AC, so each half-cycle might be an acceleration. Or perhaps each full cycle provides two accelerations.

Wait, but how does the phase factor in? The voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[2π ν(α) t + Φ0], with Φ0 = π/4. So the phase shift is 45 degrees. Does that affect the number of times the proton is accelerated? Hmm, perhaps the phase determines whether the acceleration occurs each time the proton arrives. So if the voltage is out of phase, the proton might not get the maximum acceleration each time. But in this problem, the phase is given, but perhaps it's not necessary for calculating the number of revolutions, since the setup is such that the proton is always accelerated.

Alternatively, maybe the phase doesn't affect the number of revolutions but affects the timing of when the acceleration occurs. So perhaps each time the proton goes around, it's accelerated once, regardless of the phase. Or maybe twice.

I think I'm getting stuck on whether each revolution gives one or two accelerations. The problem states "the proton undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator", so perhaps per revolution, two accelerations. So each revolution gives two energy boosts of 190 keV each. So 380 keV per revolution.

So 950 MeV / 0.38 MeV per revolution = 950 / 0.38 ≈ 2500. So that's option D.

But wait, another way: the energy per revolution is 2 * e * U0. e * U0 = 190 keV, so 2*190 = 380 keV per revolution. So 950,000,000 eV / 380,000 eV ≈ 2500.

So the answer would be D) 2500.

To determine how many revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gain per revolution and the total energy required.

The proton is accelerated by the voltage \( U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0] \), where \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \). Each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains energy equal to \( e \cdot U_0 \), where \( e \) is the proton's charge. Converting \( U_0 \) to energy:

\[
e \cdot U_0 = (1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}) \cdot (190 \times 10^3 \, \text{V}) = 3.04 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to MeV:

\[
1 \, \text{J} = 6.242 \times 10^{18} \, \text{eV}, \quad \text{so} \quad 3.04 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{J} \approx 190 \, \text{keV} = 0.190 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The problem states that the proton undergoes two accelerations per revolution. Therefore, the energy gained per revolution is:

\[
\Delta E = 2 \cdot (0.190 \, \text{MeV}) = 0.380 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The total energy required is \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \). The number of revolutions \( N \) is then:

\[
N = \frac{T_1}{\Delta E} = \frac{950}{0.380} \approx 2500.
\]

Thus, the proton makes approximately 2500 revolutions to reach the desired energy. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**A) 1864, B) 5300, C) 3536, D) 2500.**

The correct answer is:

\]

Converting to MeV:

\[
1 \, \text{J} = 6.242 \times 10^{18} \, \text{eV}, \quad \text{so} \quad 3.04 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{J} \approx 190 \, \text{keV} = 0.190 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The problem states that the proton undergoes two accelerations per revolution. Therefore, the energy gained per revolution is:

\[
\Delta E = 2 \cdot (0.190 \, \text{MeV}) = 0.380 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The total energy required is \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \). The number of revolutions \( N \) is then:

\[
N = \frac{T_1}{\Delta E} = \frac{950}{0.380} \approx 2500.
\]

Thus, the proton makes approximately 2500 revolutions to reach the desired energy. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**A) 1864, B) 5300, C) 3536, D) 2500.**

The correct answer is:
