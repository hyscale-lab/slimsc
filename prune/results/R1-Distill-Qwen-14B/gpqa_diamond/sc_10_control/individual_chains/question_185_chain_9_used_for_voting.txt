Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator H. The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma vector and n vector. Sigma is the Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli spin matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, right? Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. And when you take the dot product of sigma and n, I think that's sigma · n = n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z. So H is epsilon multiplied by this sum.

Eigenvalues of H, okay. So I need to find the possible energy levels, which are the eigenvalues of this operator.

I think the Pauli matrices have some properties that might help. Each Pauli matrix squared gives the identity matrix. Like, sigma_x squared is I, same for sigma_y and sigma_z. So when you square sigma · n, you get (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z)^2.

Expanding that, it's (n_x^2 I) + (n_y^2 I) + (n_z^2 I) + cross terms. Wait, but since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So the square of sigma · n would be I. Because all the cross terms involve sigma_i sigma_j, which are each other's anti-commuting terms, but when you square, maybe they cancel or add up correctly.

Wait, let me think again. So (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. For Pauli matrices, sigma_i sigma_j = i epsilon_ijk sigma_k if i != j, and I when i=j. So in sigma · n squared, we have terms like n_x^2 sigma_x^2, which is n_x^2 I, same for y and z. Then the cross terms are 2n_x n_y sigma_x sigma_y + ... etc.

But sigma_x sigma_y is i sigma_z, right? So each cross term would be 2n_x n_y (i sigma_z) + similar terms for other pairs. Wait, but when we sum all these, would they add up to zero? Or maybe not. Oh, but wait, if we square the vector, (sigma · n)^2, if n is a unit vector, then (sigma · n)^2 = I. Because the sum of squares and all the cross terms would just add up to the identity matrix.

Wait, let's compute (sigma · n)^2. So (sigma · n) is n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z. When we square this, we get sigma_x^2 n_x^2 + sigma_y^2 n_y^2 + sigma_z^2 n_z^2 plus all the cross terms. Since each sigma_i^2 is I, so each term is n_x^2 I, etc. So the sum of those terms is (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I = 1*I = I.

Now the cross terms: 2(n_x n_y sigma_x sigma_y + n_x n_z sigma_x sigma_z + n_y n_z sigma_y sigma_z). But sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z, and sigma_x sigma_z = -i sigma_y, and sigma_y sigma_z = i sigma_x. Wait, let me double-check. The commutation relations are [sigma_i, sigma_j] = 2i epsilon_ijk sigma_k, but I'm mixing products here. So sigma_i sigma_j = I delta_ij + i epsilon_ijk sigma_k. Oh, right, that's the identity for the product of two Pauli matrices.

So for i != j, sigma_i sigma_j = i epsilon_ijk sigma_k. So for each cross term:

sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z,
sigma_x sigma_z = i sigma_y? Wait, no, wait. Let me be precise. The epsilon is the Levi-Civita symbol, which is antisymmetric. So sigma_i sigma_j = i epsilon_ijk sigma_k.

So for sigma_x sigma_y, i= x, j= y, so epsilon_xyz = 1. So sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z.

Sigma_x sigma_z: i= x, j= z. Epsilon_xz? Wait, epsilon_ijk is 1 if ijk are x,y,z in cyclic order, and -1 otherwise, and zero if any indices are same. So for sigma_x sigma_z, i= x, j= z. So epsilon_xz... Let's think about the order. The correct order is i,j,k. So sigma_x sigma_z = i epsilon_x z k sigma_k. So epsilon_xyz is 1, epsilon_xzy is -1. So epsilon_x z y would be -1. Hmm, maybe it's easier to consider specific products.

Wait, sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z,
sigma_y sigma_z = i sigma_x,
sigma_z sigma_x = i sigma_y.

So for the cross term 2n_x n_y sigma_x sigma_y, it becomes 2n_x n_y (i sigma_z). Similarly, 2n_x n_z sigma_x sigma_z would be 2n_x n_z (i sigma_y?), because sigma_x sigma_z = i sigma_y? Let me compute that. sigma_x sigma_z = i sigma_y? Wait, no, because sigma_x sigma_z is i sigma_y? Wait, no, let's compute it using the identity.

sigma_x sigma_z = i epsilon_x z k sigma_k, where k is the third index. So epsilon_x z y is -1 (since xzy is cyclic, yzx is +1, so xzy would be -1). So sigma_x sigma_z = i * (-1) sigma_y = -i sigma_y.

Wait, that's a bit tricky. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can take a different approach. Let me compute (sigma · n)^2. Since n is a unit vector, then (sigma · n)^2 = I. Because the sum of squares plus cross terms, but all the cross terms add up to zero. Wait, no, that can't be right because I just saw that sigma_x sigma_y is i sigma_z, etc. So the cross terms would involve terms like i sigma_z, i sigma_x, etc. So when you multiply by 2 and n_x n_y, etc., perhaps the sum of all cross terms contributes zero?

Wait, no. Let me think of (sigma · n)^2. Suppose n is along the z-direction, n = (0,0,1). Then sigma · n = sigma_z. Then (sigma_z)^2 = I, which is correct. So for that case, (sigma · n)^2 = I.

If n is arbitrary, then perhaps (sigma ·n )^2 is I as well. Because regardless of the direction of n, the square of the spin component operator should still give the identity. Because that's a property of spin-1/2 systems. For any direction, the square of the spin component is proportional to the identity matrix.

Wait, but H is epsilon times sigma ·n, so H squared would be epsilon^2 (sigma ·n)^2. And since (sigma ·n)^2 is I, then H^2 = epsilon^2 I. So the eigenvalues of H^2 should be epsilon^2 times the eigenvalues of I, which are 1. So H squared is epsilon^2 I, so H^2 has eigenvalues epsilon^2 and epsilon^2. Wait, no, because for a 2x2 matrix, the identity matrix has eigenvalues 1, so H^2 has eigenvalues (epsilon^2)(1) = epsilon^2 each.

But the eigenvalues of H itself would be sqrt(epsilon^2) times the possible roots, but considering that H is a 2x2 matrix with trace zero. Because sigma ·n has trace zero, because each sigma_i has trace zero. So H would have eigenvalues +epsilon and -epsilon. Because when you square them, you get epsilon^2 each, and they must add up to zero for the trace.

Wait, let's think about it. The trace of H is epsilon times the trace of sigma ·n. Since each sigma_i has trace zero, the sum of sigma ·n is a matrix with trace zero. So H has trace zero, which means the sum of its eigenvalues is zero. And H squared is epsilon^2 I, so each eigenvalue squared is epsilon^2. Therefore, the eigenvalues must be +epsilon and -epsilon.

So looking at the options, option B is +ε, -ε. That must be the correct answer.

Alternatively, another approach: the eigenvalues of sigma ·n are +1 and -1, because for any direction n, the spin matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when you multiply by epsilon, the eigenvalues become ±epsilon. So that also leads to the same conclusion.

The Hamiltonian operator is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with the dimension of energy. To find the eigenvalues of \( H \), we analyze its properties.

The Pauli spin matrices \( \vec{\sigma} \) satisfy the relation \( (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix, because \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector. This implies that \( H^2 = \varepsilon^2 I \). The eigenvalues of \( H^2 \) are therefore \( \varepsilon^2 \), and the eigenvalues of \( H \) must satisfy \( \lambda^2 = \varepsilon^2 \). Thus, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Additionally, the trace of \( H \) is zero because the trace of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is zero (each Pauli matrix has a trace of zero). This means the sum of the eigenvalues of \( H \) must also be zero, consistent with the eigenvalues \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A)** \( +1, -1 \): Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \).  
**B)** \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \): Correct, as shown by the analysis.  
**C)** \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \): Incorrect, as there is no factor of \( \hbar/2 \) in the eigenvalues.  
**D)** \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \): Incorrect, as this does not involve \( \varepsilon \).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Because all the cross terms involve sigma_i sigma_j, which are each other's anti-commuting terms, but when you square, maybe they cancel or add up correctly.

Since each sigma_i^2 is I, so each term is n_x^2 I, etc. So the sum of those terms is (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I = 1*I = I.

Now the cross terms: 2(n_x n_y sigma_x sigma_y + n_x n_z sigma_x sigma_z + n_y n_z sigma_y sigma_z). But sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z, and sigma_x sigma_z = -i sigma_y, and sigma_y sigma_z = i sigma_x. Wait, let me double-check. The commutation relations are [sigma_i, sigma_j] = 2i epsilon_ijk sigma_k, but I'm mixing products here. So sigma_i sigma_j = I delta_ij + i epsilon_ijk sigma_k.

So for sigma_x sigma_y, i= x, j= y, so epsilon_xyz = 1. So sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z.

Sigma_x sigma_z: i= x, j= z. Epsilon_xz? Wait, epsilon_ijk is 1 if ijk are x,y,z in cyclic order, and -1 otherwise, and zero if any indices are same. So for sigma_x sigma_z, i= x, j= z. So epsilon_xz... Let's think about the order. The correct order is i,j,k. So sigma_x sigma_z = i epsilon_x z k sigma_k. So epsilon_xyz is 1, epsilon_xzy is -1. So epsilon_x z y would be -1. Hmm, maybe it's easier to consider specific products.

Wait, sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z,
sigma_y sigma_z = i sigma_x,
sigma_z sigma_x = i sigma_y.

So for the cross term 2n_x n_y sigma_x sigma_y, it becomes 2n_x n_y (i sigma_z). Similarly, 2n_x n_z sigma_x sigma_z would be 2n_x n_z (i sigma_y?), because sigma_x sigma_z = i sigma_y? Let me compute that. sigma_x sigma_z = i sigma_y? Wait, no, because sigma_x sigma_z is i sigma_y? Wait, no, let's compute it using the identity.

sigma_x sigma_z = i epsilon_x z k sigma_k, where k is the third index. So epsilon_x z y is -1 (since xzy is cyclic, yzx is +1, so xzy would be -1). So sigma_x sigma_z = i * (-1) sigma_y = -i sigma_y.

Wait, that's a bit tricky. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can take a different approach. Let me compute (sigma · n)^2. Since n is a unit vector, then (sigma · n)^2 = I.

Wait, no. Let me think of (sigma · n)^2. Suppose n is along the z-direction, n = (0,0,1). Then sigma · n = sigma_z. Then (sigma_z)^2 = I, which is correct. So for that case, (sigma · n)^2 = I.

If n is arbitrary, then perhaps (sigma ·n )^2 is I as well. Because regardless of the direction of n, the square of the spin component operator should still give the identity. Because that's a property of spin-1/2 systems. For any direction, the square of the spin component is proportional to the identity matrix.

Wait, but H is epsilon times sigma ·n, so H squared would be epsilon^2 (sigma ·n)^2. And since (sigma ·n)^2 is I, then H^2 = epsilon^2 I. So the eigenvalues of H^2 should be epsilon^2 times the eigenvalues of I, which are 1. So H squared is epsilon^2 I, so H^2 has eigenvalues epsilon^2 and epsilon^2. Wait, no, because for a 2x2 matrix, the identity matrix has eigenvalues 1, so H^2 has eigenvalues (epsilon^2)(1) = epsilon^2 each.

But the eigenvalues of H itself would be sqrt(epsilon^2) times the possible roots, but considering that H is a 2x2 matrix with trace zero.
