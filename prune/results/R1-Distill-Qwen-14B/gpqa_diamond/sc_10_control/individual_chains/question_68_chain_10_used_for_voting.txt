Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma multiplied by Sz. So mu = γ S_z. I remember that S_z is the spin operator in the z-direction, and for a spin-1/2 particle, it can have eigenvalues of ±ħ/2. But wait, maybe I don't need to get into that detail right now.

The setup is that the magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. So the initial state is probably the spin-up state along z, which makes sense because if the magnetic moment is aligned with the field, it's in the lowest energy state.

Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off. Wait, so no magnetic field anymore. But then another field is turned on along the +Y direction, and both fields have the same magnitude, B. So the initial situation (before the fields change) is B in +Z, and then after, it's B in +Y.

So the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the particle's moment. The problem states that when the magnetic field is turned off and then on again in a different direction, the average of the z-component starts oscillating. We need to find the oscillation frequency.

Hmm, okay. So when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -μ·B. Wait, no, wait—it's actually H = -μ·B. Or is it H = -γ S · B? Let me think. Since μ = γ S_z initially, but when the field is in a different direction, the magnetic moment would be proportional to the spin in that direction. Wait, no, the magnetic moment is generally μ = γ S, but the direction is along the field. Or wait, no, the magnetic moment is μ = γ S for a spin in any direction? Or is it that the magnetic moment is μ = γ (S_x, S_y, S_z), so it's a vector, and the interaction is μ·B.

So the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B · S. Because the energy is -μ·B, and μ is γ S. So H = - γ B · S.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The magnetic dipole moment is μ = γ S. So the interaction energy is U = -μ·B. So U = -γ (S · B). So the Hamiltonian H is -γ (S · B). Because when the field is along +Z, H would be -γ B S_z. But when the field is along +Y, H becomes -γ B S_y.

Wait, wait. Let's think about this. The initial situation is with B along +Z, so H_initial = -γ B S_z. The particle is in an eigenstate of S_z, so its state is either |+z> or |-z>, I think. But the problem says it's aligned with the magnetic field, so the initial state is |+z>, meaning S_z is ħ/2.

Then the magnetic field is turned off. So the H becomes zero for an instant? Or is the field immediately turned on in the Y-direction with the same B? Wait, the problem says "suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B." So H goes from being proportional to S_z to being proportional to S_y, but with the same B.

So the initial state is the eigenstate of S_z, but when the field is changed to point along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. Therefore, the state will evolve over time, and we can expect oscillations in observable quantities.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, <mu_z>, which is <gamma S_z> since mu = gamma S. So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.

Wait, no. Wait, mu is the magnetic moment, which is given as mu = gamma S_z. But wait, no, that's only when the magnetic moment is aligned along the field direction. Wait, no, if the field is along the z-direction, then mu is along z, so mu = gamma S_z. But if the field is along Y, then the magnetic moment is along Y, so mu would be gamma S_y? Hmmm, perhaps I need to clarify that.

Wait, wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. The magnetic moment is a vector, and it's proportional to the spin vector. So the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin vector. So mu is a vector that points in the same direction as the spin. So when the magnetic field is in the z-direction, the spin aligns with it, and so mu is along z. When the field is turned to y, the spin will precess around y, and so mu will also precess around y. But the question is about the average of the z-component of mu, <mu_z>.

So the Hamiltonian after the field change is H = -gamma B S_y. Because the field is along Y, and the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin in the direction of the field. Wait, no, the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B. So if mu is gamma S and B is along +Y, then H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but wait, the initial mu is gamma S_z, but when the field is turned to Y, the mu would be gamma S_y? Or wait, no. Wait, mu is a property of the particle, so it's always mu = gamma S. So mu is a vector, and its direction is the same as the spin direction. Oh, no, no, mu is just a vector proportional to the spin, regardless of the field direction. So when the field is along Z, the spin aligns along Z, so mu is along Z. When the field is along Y, the spin starts to precess around Y, so mu will also precess around Y.

So the Hamiltonian after the field is turned to Y is H = -mu · B. Because the energy is the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field. So H = - (gamma S) · B.

In this case, B is along Y, so B = B * ŷ. So H = -gamma B (S · ŷ) = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but wait: Sometimes, the formula is H = -γ B S_z when B is along Z, which is consistent with what I thought earlier. So in the new case, H = -gamma B S_y.

So the system starts in the state |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z, but not of S_y. So the state will evolve under the influence of H.

We can model the time evolution of the state. The time evolution is given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The state at time t after the Hamiltonian change is:

|ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z>

Wait, but for a spin-1/2 particle, ħ is a factor. Let me think about the units. Let me assume that ħ is 1 for simplicity, or perhaps handle the units properly. Alternatively, perhaps express H in terms of ħ.

Wait, actually, the spin operators S have units of ħ/2. So S_x, S_y, S_z are all (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So the Hamiltonian H is -gamma B S_y. Substituting S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, so H = -gamma B (ħ/2) σ_y.

Wait, perhaps. Let me think about units. Let me give the Hamiltonian in terms of energy. So H = -gamma B S_y.

So the eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So the energy eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (± ħ/2). So E_+ = gamma B ( ħ/2 ), and E_- = -gamma B ( ħ/2 ). Wait, wait, because S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, and H = -gamma B S_y.

So H |+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y>
H |-y> = gamma B (ħ/2) |-y>

Wait, because S_y |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y> = - (gamma B ħ/2) |+y>.

Similarly, S_y |-y> = -(ħ/2) |-y>, so H |-y> = gamma B (ħ/2) |-y>.

Ok, so the energies are E_+y = - (gamma B ħ)/2, and E_-y = + (gamma B ħ)/2.

Wait, but perhaps I should have the Hamiltonian as H = -gamma B S_y. Because the energy is -mu · B, and mu is gamma S.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again:

The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the interaction energy is U = -mu · B = -gamma (S · B).

So H = -gamma B · S.

In our case, B is along Y, so H = -gamma B S_y.

So, correct. So, the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z, but not of H. So we can express |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of H, which are |+y> and |-y>.

The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

So, we can write |+z> as a linear combination of |+y> and |-y>.

What's the expansion? Let me recall that the eigenstates of S_y are:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>) / sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>) / sqrt(2)

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the eigenstates of S_y are superpositions of the S_z eigenstates. Let me think again.

The eigenstates of S_y are:

|+y> = (|↑z> + |↓z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|↑z> - |↓z>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, but I'm not sure about the signs. Alternatively, perhaps:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) * i?

Wait, let me check. The standard way to write them is:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) * i ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think about the spin-1/2 case. The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the eigenstates of σ_y are:

The eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1. The eigenvectors for +1 are (1, i)/sqrt(2), because σ_y |+y> = |+y>.

Wait, let me compute σ_y times (1, i)/sqrt(2):

σ_y * [1; i] = [0*1 -i* i ; i *1 + 0*i ] / sqrt(2).

Wait, [ (0 * 1) - i*(i) ) ] = (0 + 1) = 1 on top.

[ i * 1 + 0 ] = i on bottom.

So the vector is [1; i], which is same as the original. So the eigenstate for +1 is (1, i)^T / sqrt(2). So in the S_y basis, the |+y> state is (1, i)/sqrt(2).

In terms of the S_z basis (|+z> is (1,0), |-z> is (0,1)), the |+y> state is (1/sqrt(2)) |+z> + (i/sqrt(2)) |-z>.

So, |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, the |-y> state is (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2).

So, the initial state |+z> can be written in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Let me write |+z> as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.

We can write:

|+z> = a |+y> + b |-y>.

We can plug in the expressions for |+y> and |-y>.

|+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2)

So,

a (|+z> + i |-z>) / sqrt(2) + b (|+z> - i |-z>) / sqrt(2) = |+z>.

Let me group terms:

(a + b) |+z> / sqrt(2) + (a i - b i) (-| -z>) / sqrt(2) = |+z>.

Wait, because |-z> is the same as -|down>, so perhaps I should write:

= [ (a + b) |+z> + (a i - b i) (- | -z> ) ] / sqrt(2 )

But this equals |+z>.

So, the coefficients must satisfy:

(a + b)/sqrt(2) = 1 (coefficient of |+z>),
and (a i - b i)/sqrt(2) = 0 (coefficient of |-z>).

So, from the second equation: (a i - b i ) = 0 → a = b.

Substituting into the first equation:

(a + a ) / sqrt(2) = 1 → 2a / sqrt(2) = 1 → a = sqrt(2)/2.

So a = sqrt(2)/2, and since a = b, then b = sqrt(2)/2.

So,

|+z> = (sqrt(2)/2) |+y> + (sqrt(2)/2) |-y>.

Wait, but wait, let me check: let me compute (sqrt(2)/2)( |+y> + |-y> ).

|+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2)

Adding them:

|+y> + |-y> = [ (|+z> + i |-z> ) + (|+z> - i |-z> ) ] / sqrt(2)
= (2 |+z> ) / sqrt(2)
= sqrt(2) |+z>.

So (sqrt(2)/2) (|+y> + |-y> ) = (sqrt(2)/2) * sqrt(2) |+z> ) = (2/2) |+z> = |+z>.

Yes, that works. So, the initial state |+z> can be written as ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the coefficients are both a = b = sqrt(2)/2.

So,

|+z> = (sqrt(2)/2) |+y> + (sqrt(2)/2) |-y>.

Which can be written as |+z> = ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but when I add |+y> and |-y>, I get (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2) + (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) = (2 |+z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2) |+z>.

So ( |+y> + |-y> ) = sqrt(2) |+z>,

so |+z> = ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Yes, that's correct.

So, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Now, the time evolution under H = -gamma B S_y.

So, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ )

But let me express H in terms of the Pauli matrices and see what that gives.

H = -gamma B S_y.

Since S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y,

H = -gamma B (ħ/2) σ_y

= - (gamma B ħ/2 ) σ_y.

So, H = - (gamma B ħ / 2 ) σ_y.

The time evolution operator U(t) is:

U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ )

= exp( -i [ - (gamma B ħ/2 ) σ_y ] t / ħ )

= exp( i (gamma B/2 ) t σ_y )

So U(t) = exp( i (gamma B t / 2 ) σ_y )

Now, the exponential of i theta σ_y can be expressed using Euler's formula for Pauli matrices.

We know that exp( i theta σ_y ) = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta)

So, let's compute U(t):

U(t) = cos( (gamma B t / 2) ) I + i sigma_y sin( (gamma B t / 2) )

Because theta is (gamma B t / 2).

So, U(t) = [ cos( (gamma B t / 2) ) ] I + i sigma_y sin( (gamma B t / 2) )

Now, let's apply this to the initial state |+z> = ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

So, |ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [ cos(θ) I + i sigma_y sin(θ) ] (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2),

where θ = gamma B t / 2.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>, then see how each component evolves under U(t).

Because U(t) acts on each eigenstate of H with a phase factor. Let me think: since |+y> and |-y> are eigenstates of H, their time evolution is simply a phase factor.

H |+y> = E_+ |+y>, where E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (since H = -gamma B S_y, and S_y |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y> → H |+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y> )

Similarly, H |-y> = gamma B (ħ/2) |-y>.

So, the time evolution of |+y> is exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) |+y>,

which is exp( i (gamma B (ħ/2) ) t / ħ ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y>.

Similarly, for |-y>,

exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) |-y>,

since E_- is gamma B (ħ/2), so:

exp( -i (gamma B ħ/2 ) t / ħ ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y>.

So, |ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2) * exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) 
+ ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2) * exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )

Wait, no. Because |+z> is ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2), so applying U(t), each component evolves as:

|ψ(t)> = [ exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2).

So,

|ψ(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y> ] / sqrt(2).

Now, we need to find the expectation value of S_z, because <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.

So, <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Let me compute this.

First, let's find <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

We can express S_z in terms of the |+z> and |-z> basis. S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, S_z |-z> = -(ħ/2) |-z>.

Alternatively, in terms of |+y> and |-y>, S_z can be written as a matrix. Let me find the matrix representation of S_z in the basis {|+y>, |-y>}.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> directly.

We can compute <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Let me write |ψ(t)> as:

|ψ(t)> = ( e^{i theta} |+y> + e^{-i theta} |-y> ) / sqrt(2), where theta = gamma B t / 2.

So theta is (gamma B t)/2.

Now,

S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) ( |+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2)
= (ħ/2) ( (1,0) + i (0,1) ) / sqrt(2)
Wait, perhaps another approach.

Because S_z is diagonal in the |+z>, |-z> basis, perhaps it's easier to express S_z in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Wait, perhaps find the matrix elements of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis.

Alternatively, perhaps compute <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Let me express |ψ(t)> in the S_z basis.

Wait, |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2)

So,

|ψ(t)> = [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + i |-z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - i |-z> ) ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) )

Simplify denominator: sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2.

Expanding numerator:

e^{i theta} |+z> + i e^{i theta} |-z> + e^{-i theta} |+z> - i e^{-i theta} |-z>

Combine terms:

[ e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} ] |+z> + [ i e^{i theta} - i e^{-i theta} ] |-z>

Factor out terms:

= [ 2 cos(theta) ] |+z> + [ i ( e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} ) ] |-z>

Now, e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin(theta), so:

= 2 cos(theta) |+z> + i (2i sin(theta)) |-z>

Simplify: i * 2i sin(theta) = 2i^2 sin(theta) = -2 sin(theta).

So,

|ψ(t)> = [ 2 cos(theta) |+z> - 2 sin(theta) |-z> ] / 2
= cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |-z>

So,

|ψ(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |-z>.

Now, compute <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Expressed in the |+z>, |-z> basis, S_z is diagonal with entries (ħ/2) and (-ħ/2).

So,

<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = [ cos(theta) , -sin(theta) ] [ [ ħ/2, 0 ], [0, -ħ/2] ] [ cos(theta) ; -sin(theta) ]

Compute matrix multiplication:

= [ cos(theta) * (ħ/2) * cos(theta) + ( - sin(theta) ) * ( - ħ/2 ) * (- sin(theta) ) ]

Wait, no, the correct way is:

= cos(theta) * (ħ/2) * cos(theta) + (-sin(theta)) * ( - ħ/2 ) * (-sin(theta)).

Wait, perhaps better to compute it step by step.

The vector <ψ(t)| is [ cos(theta), -sin(theta) ].

The S_z matrix is diag(ħ/2, -ħ/2).

So,

<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] * S_z * [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T.

S_z * [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T is:

= [ (ħ/2) cos(theta), ( - ħ/2 ) ( - sin(theta) ) ]^T
= [ (ħ/2) cos(theta), ( ħ/2 ) sin(theta) ]^T.

Then, the dot product with [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] is:

(ħ/2) cos(theta) * cos(theta) + (ħ/2) sin(theta) * (- sin(theta) )

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]

= (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

Because cos(2 theta ) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta).

So,

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

But theta is gamma B t /2,

so 2 theta = gamma B t.

So,

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Now, the magnetic moment's z-component is mu_z = gamma S_z.

So,

< mu_z > = gamma < S_z > = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So,

< mu_z > = ( gamma ħ / 2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the ħ factors. Let me go back.

Earlier, when I substituted S_y, I used S = (ħ/2) sigma. So, H = -gamma B S_y = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So, the energy eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (ħ/2) (± 1/2?) No, wait, earlier I thought that S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so E = -gamma B (± ħ/2 ). So, theta (in the time evolution) is E t / ħ.

So for |+y>:

E_+y = - gamma B (ħ/2 )

So,

phase factor: exp( -i E t / ħ ) = exp( i gamma B t ( (ħ/2) ) / ħ ) )

= exp( i gamma B t (1/2) )

Which is what I used earlier, so theta = (gamma B t ) / 2.

So, my calculation for <S_z> is correct, leading to:

<S_z> = ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

But wait, because the expression for <S_z> is (ħ/2) cos(2 theta ), and theta is gamma B t / 2, so 2 theta is gamma B t.

So,

< mu_z > = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

But looking at the options, the frequency is given in terms of gamma B, but what is the oscillation frequency of <mu_z>?

The oscillation in <mu_z> is cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the time dependence. The argument of the cosine is gamma B t. So the angular frequency is omega = gamma B.

So, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options:

Option B is gamma B.

Option C is sqrt(2) gamma B.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the factor. Let me recheck.

In the expression,

< mu_z > = (gamma ħ / 2 ) cos( gamma B t )

But what is the oscillation frequency? The term inside the cosine is gamma B t, so the frequency is gamma B / (2 pi) ) radians per second. So the angular frequency is gamma B.

But the options are about the frequency, so the answer would be gamma B.

So the correct option is B.

To solve the problem, we analyze the dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle in a changing magnetic field. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction, and the particle is in the eigenstate |+z> of \( S_z \). The magnetic moment is given as \( \mu = \gamma S \), where \( \gamma \) is the gyromagnetic ratio. When the magnetic field is suddenly turned off and then reactivated along the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes from \( H = -\gamma B S_z \) to \( H = -\gamma B S_y \). The particle's state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, leading to time-dependent oscillations in observables like the z-component of the magnetic moment, \( \langle \mu_z \rangle \).

### Key Steps:
1. **Initial State and Basis Expansion**:  
   The initial state \( |+z\rangle \) is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of \( S_y \), \( |+y\rangle \) and \( |-y\rangle \):
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |-y\rangle \right).
   \]

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The Hamiltonian after the field is applied along +Y is \( H = -\gamma B S_y \). The eigenstates \( |+y\rangle \) and \( |-y\rangle \) evolve with time-dependent phase factors:
   \[
   |+y\rangle \to e^{i\gamma B t / 2} |+y\rangle, \quad |-y\rangle \to e^{-i\gamma B t / 2} |-y\rangle.
   \]
   Thus, the time-evolved state is:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{i\gamma B t / 2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\gamma B t / 2} |-y\rangle \right).
   \]

3. **Transition to \( S_z \) Basis**:  
   Expanding \( |\psi(t)\rangle \) in the \( S_z \) basis (\(|+z\rangle, |-z\rangle\)) gives:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\gamma B t / 2) |+z\rangle - \sin(\gamma B t / 2) |-z\rangle.
   \]

4. **Expectation Value of \( S_z \)**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_z \) is:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]
   Since \( \mu_z = \gamma S_z \), the expectation value of \( \mu_z \) is:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

5. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation of \( \langle \mu_z \rangle \) arises from the cosine term, which oscillates with angular frequency \( \omega = \gamma B \). Therefore, the oscillation frequency is \( \gamma B \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (\( \gamma B / 2 \))**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is not reduced by a factor of 2.
- **Option B (\( \gamma B \))**: Correct. The angular frequency of the oscillation is \( \gamma B \).
- **Option C (\( \sqrt{2} \gamma B \))**: Incorrect. There is no factor of \( \sqrt{2} \) in the oscillation frequency.
- **Option D (\( \gamma B / \sqrt{2} \))**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is not reduced by \( \sqrt{2} \).

### Final Answer:
The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is \( \gamma B \).

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma multiplied by Sz. So mu = γ S_z. I remember that S_z is the spin operator in the z-direction, and for a spin-1/2 particle, it can have eigenvalues of ±ħ/2. But wait, maybe I don't need to get into that detail right now.

The setup is that the magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. So the initial state is probably the spin-up state along z, which makes sense because if the magnetic moment is aligned with the field, it's in the lowest energy state.

Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off. Wait, so no magnetic field anymore. But then another field is turned on along the +Y direction, and both fields have the same magnitude, B. So the initial situation (before the fields change) is B in +Z, and then after, it's B in +Y.

So the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the particle's moment. The problem states that when the magnetic field is turned off and then on again in a different direction, the average of the z-component starts oscillating. We need to find the oscillation frequency.

Hmm, okay. So when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -μ·B. Wait, no, wait—it's actually H = -μ·B. Or is it H = -γ S · B? Let me think. Since μ = γ S_z initially, but when the field is in a different direction, the magnetic moment would be proportional to the spin in that direction. Wait, no, the magnetic moment is generally μ = γ S, but the direction is along the field. Or wait, no, the magnetic moment is μ = γ S for a spin in any direction? Or is it that the magnetic moment is μ = γ (S_x, S_y, S_z), so it's a vector, and the interaction is μ·B.

So the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B · S. Because the energy is -μ·B, and μ is γ S. So H = - γ B · S.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The magnetic dipole moment is μ = γ S. So the interaction energy is U = -μ·B. So U = -γ (S · B). So the Hamiltonian H is -γ (S · B). Because when the field is along +Z, H would be -γ B S_z. But when the field is along +Y, H becomes -γ B S_y.

Wait, wait. Let's think about this. The initial situation is with B along +Z, so H_initial = -γ B S_z. The particle is in an eigenstate of S_z, so its state is either |+z> or |-z>, I think. But the problem says it's aligned with the magnetic field, so the initial state is |+z>, meaning S_z is ħ/2.

Then the magnetic field is turned off. So the H becomes zero for an instant? Or is the field immediately turned on in the Y-direction with the same B? Wait, the problem says "suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B." So H goes from being proportional to S_z to being proportional to S_y, but with the same B.

So the initial state is the eigenstate of S_z, but when the field is changed to point along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. Therefore, the state will evolve over time, and we can expect oscillations in observable quantities.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, <mu_z>, which is <gamma S_z> since mu = gamma S. So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.

Wait, no. Wait, mu is the magnetic moment, which is given as mu = gamma S_z. But wait, no, that's only when the magnetic moment is aligned along the field direction. Wait, no, if the field is along the z-direction, then mu is along z, so mu = gamma S_z. But if the field is along Y, then the magnetic moment is along Y, so mu would be gamma S_y? Hmmm, perhaps I need to clarify that.

Wait, wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. The magnetic moment is a vector, and it's proportional to the spin vector. So the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin vector. So mu is a vector that points in the same direction as the spin. So when the magnetic field is in the z-direction, the spin aligns with it, and so mu is along z. When the field is turned to y, the spin will precess around y, and so mu will also precess around y. But the question is about the average of the z-component of mu, <mu_z>.

So the Hamiltonian after the field change is H = -gamma B S_y. Because the field is along Y, and the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin in the direction of the field. Wait, no, the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B. So if mu is gamma S and B is along +Y, then H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but wait, the initial mu is gamma S_z, but when the field is turned to Y, the mu would be gamma S_y? Or wait, no. Wait, mu is a property of the particle, so it's always mu = gamma S. So mu is a vector, and its direction is the same as the spin direction. Oh, no, no, mu is just a vector proportional to the spin, regardless of the field direction. So when the field is along Z, the spin aligns along Z, so mu is along Z. When the field is along Y, the spin starts to precess around Y, so mu will also precess around Y.

So the Hamiltonian after the field is turned to Y is H = -mu · B. Because the energy is the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field. So H = - (gamma S) · B.

In this case, B is along Y, so B = B * ŷ. So H = -gamma B (S · ŷ) = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but wait: Sometimes, the formula is H = -γ B S_z when B is along Z, which is consistent with what I thought earlier. So in the new case, H = -gamma B S_y.

So the system starts in the state |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z, but not of S_y. So the state will evolve under the influence of H.

We can model the time evolution of the state. The time evolution is given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The state at time t after the Hamiltonian change is:

|ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z>

Wait, but for a spin-1/2 particle, ħ is a factor. Let me think about the units. Let me assume that ħ is 1 for simplicity, or perhaps handle the units properly. Alternatively, perhaps express H in terms of ħ.

Wait, actually, the spin operators S have units of ħ/2. So S_x, S_y, S_z are all (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So the Hamiltonian H is -gamma B S_y. Substituting S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, so H = -gamma B (ħ/2) σ_y.

Wait, perhaps. Let me think about units. Let me give the Hamiltonian in terms of energy. So H = -gamma B S_y.

So the eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So the energy eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (± ħ/2). So E_+ = gamma B ( ħ/2 ), and E_- = -gamma B ( ħ/2 ). Wait, wait, because S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, and H = -gamma B S_y.

So H |+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y>
H |-y> = gamma B (ħ/2) |-y>

Wait, because S_y |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y> = - (gamma B ħ/2) |+y>.

Similarly, S_y |-y> = -(ħ/2) |-y>, so H |-y> = gamma B (ħ/2) |-y>.

Ok, so the energies are E_+y = - (gamma B ħ)/2, and E_-y = + (gamma B ħ)/2.

Wait, but perhaps I should have the Hamiltonian as H = -gamma B S_y. Because the energy is -mu · B, and mu is gamma S.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again:

The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the interaction energy is U = -mu · B = -gamma (S · B).

So H = -gamma B · S.

In our case, B is along Y, so H = -gamma B S_y.

So, correct. So, the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z, but not of H. So we can express |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of H, which are |+y> and |-y>.

The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

So, we can write |+z> as a linear combination of |+y> and |-y>.

What's the expansion? Let me recall that the eigenstates of S_y are:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>) / sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>) / sqrt(2)

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the eigenstates of S_y are superpositions of the S_z eigenstates. Let me think again.

The eigenstates of S_y are:

|+y> = (|↑z> + |↓z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|↑z> - |↓z>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, but I'm not sure about the signs. Alternatively, perhaps:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) * i?

Wait, let me check. The standard way to write them is:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) * i ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think about the spin-1/2 case. The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the eigenstates of σ_y are:

The eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1. The eigenvectors for +1 are (1, i)/sqrt(2), because σ_y |+y> = |+y>.

Wait, let me compute σ_y times (1, i)/sqrt(2):

σ_y * [1; i] = [0*1 -i* i ; i *1 + 0*i ] / sqrt(2).

Wait, [ (0 * 1) - i*(i) ) ] = (0 + 1) = 1 on top.

[ i * 1 + 0 ] = i on bottom.

So the vector is [1; i], which is same as the original. So the eigenstate for +1 is (1, i)^T / sqrt(2). So in the S_y basis, the |+y> state is (1, i)/sqrt(2).

In terms of the S_z basis (|+z> is (1,0), |-z> is (0,1)), the |+y> state is (1/sqrt(2)) |+z> + (i/sqrt(2)) |-z>.

So, |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, the |-y> state is (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2).

So, the initial state |+z> can be written in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Let me write |+z> as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.

We can write:

|+z> = a |+y> + b |-y>.

We can plug in the expressions for |+y> and |-y>.

|+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2)

So,

a (|+z> + i |-z>) / sqrt(2) + b (|+z> - i |-z>) / sqrt(2) = |+z>.

Let me group terms:

(a + b) |+z> / sqrt(2) + (a i - b i) (-| -z>) / sqrt(2) = |+z>.

Wait, because |-z> is the same as -|down>, so perhaps I should write:

= [ (a + b) |+z> + (a i - b i) (- | -z> ) ] / sqrt(2 )

But this equals |+z>.

So, the coefficients must satisfy:

(a + b)/sqrt(2) = 1 (coefficient of |+z>),
and (a i - b i)/sqrt(2) = 0 (coefficient of |-z>).

So, from the second equation: (a i - b i ) = 0 → a = b.

Substituting into the first equation:

(a + a ) / sqrt(2) = 1 → 2a / sqrt(2) = 1 → a = sqrt(2)/2.

So a = sqrt(2)/2, and since a = b, then b = sqrt(2)/2.

So,

|+z> = (sqrt(2)/2) |+y> + (sqrt(2)/2) |-y>.

Wait, but wait, let me check: let me compute (sqrt(2)/2)( |+y> + |-y> ).

|+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2)

Adding them:

|+y> + |-y> = [ (|+z> + i |-z> ) + (|+z> - i |-z> ) ] / sqrt(2)
= (2 |+z> ) / sqrt(2)
= sqrt(2) |+z>.

So (sqrt(2)/2) (|+y> + |-y> ) = (sqrt(2)/2) * sqrt(2) |+z> ) = (2/2) |+z> = |+z>.

Yes, that works. So, the initial state |+z> can be written as ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the coefficients are both a = b = sqrt(2)/2.

So,

|+z> = (sqrt(2)/2) |+y> + (sqrt(2)/2) |-y>.

Which can be written as |+z> = ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but when I add |+y> and |-y>, I get (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2) + (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) = (2 |+z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2) |+z>.

So ( |+y> + |-y> ) = sqrt(2) |+z>,

so |+z> = ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Yes, that's correct.

So, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Now, the time evolution under H = -gamma B S_y.

So, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ )

But let me express H in terms of the Pauli matrices and see what that gives.

H = -gamma B S_y.

Since S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y,

H = -gamma B (ħ/2) σ_y

= - (gamma B ħ/2 ) σ_y.

So, H = - (gamma B ħ / 2 ) σ_y.

The time evolution operator U(t) is:

U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ )

= exp( -i [ - (gamma B ħ/2 ) σ_y ] t / ħ )

= exp( i (gamma B/2 ) t σ_y )

So U(t) = exp( i (gamma B t / 2 ) σ_y )

Now, the exponential of i theta σ_y can be expressed using Euler's formula for Pauli matrices.

We know that exp( i theta σ_y ) = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta)

So, let's compute U(t):

U(t) = cos( (gamma B t / 2) ) I + i sigma_y sin( (gamma B t / 2) )

Because theta is (gamma B t / 2).

So, U(t) = [ cos( (gamma B t / 2) ) ] I + i sigma_y sin( (gamma B t / 2) )

Now, let's apply this to the initial state |+z> = ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

So, |ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [ cos(θ) I + i sigma_y sin(θ) ] (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2),

where θ = gamma B t / 2.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>, then see how each component evolves under U(t).

Because U(t) acts on each eigenstate of H with a phase factor. Let me think: since |+y> and |-y> are eigenstates of H, their time evolution is simply a phase factor.

H |+y> = E_+ |+y>, where E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (since H = -gamma B S_y, and S_y |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y> → H |+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y> )

Similarly, H |-y> = gamma B (ħ/2) |-y>.

So, the time evolution of |+y> is exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) |+y>,

which is exp( i (gamma B (ħ/2) ) t / ħ ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y>.

Similarly, for |-y>,

exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) |-y>,

since E_- is gamma B (ħ/2), so:

exp( -i (gamma B ħ/2 ) t / ħ ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y>.

So, |ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2) * exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) 
+ ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2) * exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )

Wait, no. Because |+z> is ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2), so applying U(t), each component evolves as:

|ψ(t)> = [ exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2).

So,

|ψ(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y> ] / sqrt(2).

Now, we need to find the expectation value of S_z, because <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.

So, <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Let me compute this.

First, let's find <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

We can express S_z in terms of the |+z> and |-z> basis. S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, S_z |-z> = -(ħ/2) |-z>.

Alternatively, in terms of |+y> and |-y>, S_z can be written as a matrix. Let me find the matrix representation of S_z in the basis {|+y>, |-y>}.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> directly.

We can compute <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Let me write |ψ(t)> as:

|ψ(t)> = ( e^{i theta} |+y> + e^{-i theta} |-y> ) / sqrt(2), where theta = gamma B t / 2.

So theta is (gamma B t)/2.

Now,

S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) ( |+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2)
= (ħ/2) ( (1,0) + i (0,1) ) / sqrt(2)
Wait, perhaps another approach.

Because S_z is diagonal in the |+z>, |-z> basis, perhaps it's easier to express S_z in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Wait, perhaps find the matrix elements of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis.

Alternatively, perhaps compute <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Let me express |ψ(t)> in the S_z basis.

Wait, |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2)

So,

|ψ(t)> = [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + i |-z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - i |-z> ) ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) )

Simplify denominator: sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2.

Expanding numerator:

e^{i theta} |+z> + i e^{i theta} |-z> + e^{-i theta} |+z> - i e^{-i theta} |-z>

Combine terms:

[ e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} ] |+z> + [ i e^{i theta} - i e^{-i theta} ] |-z>

Factor out terms:

= [ 2 cos(theta) ] |+z> + [ i ( e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} ) ] |-z>

Now, e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin(theta), so:

= 2 cos(theta) |+z> + i (2i sin(theta)) |-z>

Simplify: i * 2i sin(theta) = 2i^2 sin(theta) = -2 sin(theta).

So,

|ψ(t)> = [ 2 cos(theta) |+z> - 2 sin(theta) |-z> ] / 2
= cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |-z>

So,

|ψ(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |-z>.

Now, compute <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Expressed in the |+z>, |-z> basis, S_z is diagonal with entries (ħ/2) and (-ħ/2).

So,

<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = [ cos(theta) , -sin(theta) ] [ [ ħ/2, 0 ], [0, -ħ/2] ] [ cos(theta) ; -sin(theta) ]

Compute matrix multiplication:

= [ cos(theta) * (ħ/2) * cos(theta) + ( - sin(theta) ) * ( - ħ/2 ) * (- sin(theta) ) ]

Wait, no, the correct way is:

= cos(theta) * (ħ/2) * cos(theta) + (-sin(theta)) * ( - ħ/2 ) * (-sin(theta)).

Wait, perhaps better to compute it step by step.

The vector <ψ(t)| is [ cos(theta), -sin(theta) ].

The S_z matrix is diag(ħ/2, -ħ/2).

So,

<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] * S_z * [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T.

S_z * [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T is:

= [ (ħ/2) cos(theta), ( - ħ/2 ) ( - sin(theta) ) ]^T
= [ (ħ/2) cos(theta), ( ħ/2 ) sin(theta) ]^T.

Then, the dot product with [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] is:

(ħ/2) cos(theta) * cos(theta) + (ħ/2) sin(theta) * (- sin(theta) )

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]

= (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

Because cos(2 theta ) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta).

So,

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

But theta is gamma B t /2,

so 2 theta = gamma B t.

So,

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Now, the magnetic moment's z-component is mu_z = gamma S_z.

So,

< mu_z > = gamma < S_z > = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So,

< mu_z > = ( gamma ħ / 2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the ħ factors. Let me go back.

Earlier, when I substituted S_y, I used S = (ħ/2) sigma. So, H = -gamma B S_y = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So, the energy eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (ħ/2) (± 1/2?) No, wait, earlier I thought that S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so E = -gamma B (± ħ/2 ). So, theta (in the time evolution) is E t / ħ.

So for |+y>:

E_+y = - gamma B (ħ/2 )

So,

phase factor: exp( -i E t / ħ ) = exp( i gamma B t ( (ħ/2) ) / ħ ) )

= exp( i gamma B t (1/2) )

Which is what I used earlier, so theta = (gamma B t ) / 2.

So, my calculation for <S_z> is correct, leading to:

<S_z> = ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

But wait, because the expression for <S_z> is (ħ/2) cos(2 theta ), and theta is gamma B t / 2, so 2 theta is gamma B t.

So,

< mu_z > = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

But looking at the options, the frequency is given in terms of gamma B, but what is the oscillation frequency of <mu_z>?

The oscillation in <mu_z> is cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the time dependence. The argument of the cosine is gamma B t. So the angular frequency is omega = gamma B.

So, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options:

Option B is gamma B.

Option C is sqrt(2) gamma B.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the factor. Let me recheck.

In the expression,

< mu_z > = (gamma ħ / 2 ) cos( gamma B t )

But what is the oscillation frequency? The term inside the cosine is gamma B t, so the frequency is gamma B / (2 pi) ) radians per second. So the angular frequency is gamma B.

But the options are about the frequency, so the answer would be gamma B.

So the correct option is B.


To solve the problem, we analyze the dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle in a changing magnetic field. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction, and the particle is in the eigenstate |+z> of \( S_z \). The magnetic moment is given as \( \mu = \gamma S \), where \( \gamma \) is the gyromagnetic ratio. When the magnetic field is suddenly turned off and then reactivated along the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes from \( H = -\gamma B S_z \) to \( H = -\gamma B S_y \). The particle's state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, leading to time-dependent oscillations in observables like the z-component of the magnetic moment, \( \langle \mu_z \rangle \).

### Key Steps:
1. **Initial State and Basis Expansion**:  
   The initial state \( |+z\rangle \) is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of \( S_y \), \( |+y\rangle \) and \( |-y\rangle \):
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |-y\rangle \right).
   \]

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The Hamiltonian after the field is applied along +Y is \( H = -\gamma B S_y \). The eigenstates \( |+y\rangle \) and \( |-y\rangle \) evolve with time-dependent phase factors:
   \[
   |+y\rangle \to e^{i\gamma B t / 2} |+y\rangle, \quad |-y\rangle \to e^{-i\gamma B t / 2} |-y\rangle.
   \]
   Thus, the time-evolved state is:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{i\gamma B t / 2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\gamma B t / 2} |-y\rangle \right).
   \]

3. **Transition to \( S_z \) Basis**:  
   Expanding \( |\psi(t)\rangle \) in the \( S_z \) basis (\(|+z\rangle, |-z\rangle\)) gives:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\gamma B t / 2) |+z\rangle - \sin(\gamma B t / 2) |-z\rangle.
   \]

4. **Expectation Value of \( S_z \)**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_z \) is:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]
   Since \( \mu_z = \gamma S_z \), the expectation value of \( \mu_z \) is:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

5. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation of \( \langle \mu_z \rangle \) arises from the cosine term, which oscillates with angular frequency \( \omega = \gamma B \). Therefore, the oscillation frequency is \( \gamma B \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (\( \gamma B / 2 \))**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is not reduced by a factor of 2.
- **Option B (\( \gamma B \))**: Correct. The angular frequency of the oscillation is \( \gamma B \).
- **Option C (\( \sqrt{2} \gamma B \))**: Incorrect. There is no factor of \( \sqrt{2} \) in the oscillation frequency.
- **Option D (\( \gamma B / \sqrt{2} \))**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is not reduced by \( \sqrt{2} \).

### Final Answer:
The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is \( \gamma B \).

**Answer: B**
