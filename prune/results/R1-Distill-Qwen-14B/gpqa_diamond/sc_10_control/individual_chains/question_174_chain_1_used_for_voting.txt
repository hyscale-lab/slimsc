Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.

Wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum should be zero before and after the fission. So the two fragments will move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta, right? That means their velocities are probably in opposite directions, but their magnitudes depend on their masses.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. We need to find the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Options are A to D, all in MeV. So the difference is probably a small fraction of GeV, hence the answer is likely in the MeV range.

Let me break it down. First, let's get the masses of the two fragments.

Let me denote the less massive fragment as mass m, so the more massive one is 2m. Their sum is m + 2m = 3m. But the sum is 99% of M, so 3m = 0.99 M => m = 0.99 M / 3 = 0.33 M. So the more massive fragment is 2m = 0.66 M.

Wait, but M is the initial mass. Oh wait, the initial nucleus has rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. So M must be the rest mass, so M c² = 300 GeV. But for calculations, we might not need to use c² explicitly because we're dealing with mass and energy in compatible units.

Wait, the sum of rest masses is 0.99 M, so the mass-energy of the two fragments is 0.99 * M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the initial energy is 300 GeV, and after fission, the rest mass energy is 297 GeV. The remaining energy must be the kinetic energy of the two fragments. So the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

But wait, the initial nucleus was at rest, so the total energy before fission is just its rest energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the energy includes the rest mass energies of the two fragments and their kinetic energies. So the total energy after is (m1 c² + K1) + (m2 c² + K2) ) = (m1 + m2) c^2 + (K1 + K2).

But since the total energy is conserved, 300 GeV = (297 GeV) + (K1 + K2). So K1 + K2 = 3 GeV. So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 GeV.

Now, because the nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let's denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for the two fragments. Wait, but since momentum is m v, and since the two fragments have different masses, their velocities will be different.

Let me model this. Let the more massive fragment (2m) have velocity v, and the less massive one (m) have velocity u. Then, 2m v = m u in the opposite direction. So 2m v = m u → 2v = -u. So u = -2v. So if the more massive one is moving in positive direction with velocity v, the other is moving in the negative direction with velocity 2v.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the momentum of the first is 2m v, and the second is m u. They must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So 2m v = - m u → 2v = -u → u = -2v. So the second fragment is moving in the opposite direction with twice the speed of the first. Hmm, that seems right.

But wait, let's think about the kinetic energies. The kinetic energy for each fragment is (1/2) m v², but wait, that's the non-relativistic formula. Since the masses are a significant fraction of the initial mass, but the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is small compared to 300 GeV. So perhaps the non-relativistic approximation is valid here, but the problem asks for the difference between the correct and the classical T1.

So I need to compute T1 using both relativistic and non-relativistic methods and find the difference.

But first, let's find the velocities. Well, because of the momentum condition and the energy condition.

Another approach is to model the velocities using conservation of energy and momentum. So the system is:

- Momentum: 2m (v) - m (u) = 0 → 2v = u (but direction is considered, so perhaps 2m v = m u, but with opposite signs, so u = 2v but in the opposite direction). Hmm, perhaps I should model it as vectors, so the more massive fragment's velocity is v, the other's is u. So 2m v = - m u → 2 v = -u → u = -2v.

So, the kinetic energy of fragment 1 (2m) is (1/2)(2m) v², and fragment 2 (m) is (1/2) m u². Since u = -2v, u² = 4 v².

So KE1 = (1/2)(2m)(v²) = m v².

KE2 = (1/2) m (4 v²) = 2 m v².

So KE1 + KE2 = 3 m v² = 3 GeV.

So 3 m v² = 3 GeV → m v² = 1 GeV.

But wait, m is the rest mass of the smaller fragment, which is (0.33 M) / c², but perhaps in units where c=1, mass and energy are directly related. Hmm, perhaps I should express everything in terms of M.

Wait, M is the initial rest mass. The initial energy is M c² = 300 GeV. So M = 300 GeV / c². Then m is 0.33 M. Wait, earlier I calculated m as 0.33 M, but that was based on the sum of the two masses being 0.99 M. Let me check that again.

Wait, the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 99% of M, so m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Given that m1 is twice m2, so m1 = 2 m2. So 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M.

So m2 = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M.

So, in the non-relativistic case, KE1 (for m1) is (1/2) m1 v², and KE2 is (1/2) m2 u².

From the momentum conservation, since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after must be zero. So m1 v1 = m2 v2, but since they move in opposite directions, m1 v1 = - m2 v2. So v2 = -(m1 / m2) v1.

Wait, earlier I thought m1 is 0.66 M, m2 is 0.33 M. So m1/m2 = 2. So v2 = -2 v1.

Wait, but when I previously considered m and 2m, perhaps I mixed up m1 and m2. Let me correct. The more massive fragment is m1 = 0.66 M, the less is m2 = 0.33 M.

So in terms of momentum, m1 v1 = - m2 v2. So:

0.66 M * v1 = - 0.33 M * v2 → 0.66 v1 = -0.33 v2 → v2 = -2 v1.

So v2 is twice as much in the opposite direction of v1.

Now, the kinetic energies in non-relativistic:

KE1 = (1/2)(0.66 M) v1².

KE2 = (1/2)(0.33 M) v2² = (1/2)(0.33 M)( (2 v1) )^2 = (1/2)(0.33 M)(4 v1²) )= (1/2)(1.32 M v1²) )= 0.66 M v1².

So KE1 + KE2 = (0.33 M v1²) + (0.66 M v1²) )= 0.99 M v1².

Wait, but earlier we said the total KE is 3 GeV. So 0.99 M v1² = 3 GeV.

We know M c² = 300 GeV. So M = 300 GeV / c².

But in units where c=1, M = 300 GeV.

So substituting M = 300 GeV, we have:

0.99 * 300 GeV * v1² = 3 GeV → 0.99 * 300 v1² = 3 → v1² = 3 / (0.99 *300) → v1² = 3/(297) ≈ 0.0101 → v1 ≈ sqrt(0.0101) ≈ 0.1005.

So v1 is about 0.1 times the speed of light in non-relativistic terms.

So the non-relativistic KE for the more massive fragment (m1) is KE1 = 0.5 * 0.66 M v1².

Wait, wait, in the non-relativistic case, KE1 = (1/2) m1 v1^2 = 0.5 * 0.66 M (v1^2).

We have M = 300 GeV, so let's compute. v1² ≈ 0.01.

So KE1 = 0.5 * 0.66 * 300 GeV * 0.01.

Calculating that: 0.5 * 0.66 = 0.33. 0.33 *300 = 99, 99 *0.01=0.99 GeV. So 0.99 GeV is 990 MeV. Wait, but that can't be right because the total KE is 3 GeV, so that would make KE1 990 MeV and KE2 2010 MeV, which adds to 3 GeV. Wait, 990 + 2010 = 3000 MeV = 3 GeV. Hmm, that's correct.

But wait, that's the non-relativistic approach. Now, the actual relativistic calculation would probably have a higher KE because in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2) m v^2. So the correct approach would involve using relativistic expressions for energy and momentum.

So the correct way is to model using relativistic momentum and energy.

In the relativistic case, the total energy of each fragment is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but since we are dealing with kinetic energy, perhaps it's better to model using total energy.

So for the more massive fragment, mass m1 = 0.66 M.

Its total energy is gamma * m1 c², where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

Similarly, fragment 2 has mass m2 = 0.33 M, and velocity v2 = -2 v1 (from non-relativistic assumption, but perhaps that's not correct in relativistic terms. Wait, no, because in relativistic cases, velocities don't just add like that. So perhaps the relation between v1 and v2 is more complicated.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think again.

In the relativistic case, conservation of momentum and energy must be applied.

Let me denote the more massive fragment as having velocity v, and the less as u.

Then, momentum conservation:

gamma1 * m1 v = gamma2 * m2 u.

But since they move in opposite directions, perhaps it's better to model as:

gamma1 * m1 v = - gamma2 * m2 u.

Energy conservation:

gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c² = M c².

Because the initial nucleus is at rest, its energy is M c².

So we have these two equations:

1) gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

2) gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M.

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, no, because energy is E = gamma m c², so the sum of energies after fission is M c², so equation 2 would be:

gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c² = M c^2 → gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M.

Wait, no, because M is in units where c=1, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps I should use natural units where c=1 for simplicity. So, energies are in GeV, masses are in GeV/c², but with c=1, it's just GeV. So M = 300 GeV. m1 = 0.66 M = 198 GeV, m2 = 0.33 M = 99 GeV.

So, the equations become:

gamma1 * m1 * v = gamma2 * m2 * u.

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M = 300 GeV.

Additionally, the velocities are such that the two fragments move in opposite directions. So, u could be negative, but perhaps it's easier to model their directions with positive and negative signs.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the signs. Alternatively, perhaps I should assume that fragment 1 (m1) is moving with velocity v, fragment 2 (m2) with velocity u. The momentum vectors are in opposite directions, so m1 v = - m2 u.

Wait, but in reality, the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so m1 v = - m2 u → u = -(m1 v)/(m2).

So, u = -(m1/m2) v. Since m1 = 2 m2, then u = -2 v.

Wait, so in this approximation, u is twice v in the opposite direction, same as the non-relativistic case. But wait, that's only valid in the non-relativistic scenario. Because in relativity, velocities don't add linearly. So perhaps this relation is not correct in the relativistic case, but for the purpose of solving this problem, maybe I can proceed with this assumption and see where it leads me.

So, let's proceed with u = -2 v.

Then, equation 1 becomes:

gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 (-2 v) → gamma1 m1 v = - 2 gamma2 m2 v.

We can cancel v (assuming v ≠ 0) to get:

gamma1 m1 = -2 gamma2 m2.

But since gamma is always positive, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me correct this.

Wait, the correct momentum equation should be:

gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

But if u is in the opposite direction, let's consider u = -2 v as per non-relativistic.

So equation 1 becomes:

gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 (-2 v) → gamma1 m1 = -2 gamma2 m2.

But the left side is positive, right side is negative. Hmm, that can't be. So perhaps I should take the magnitude, and adjust the signs accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the momenta as vectors, so:

gamma1 m1 v = - gamma2 m2 u.

If u is in the opposite direction, then u = +2 v. Wait, perhaps I should be more careful with the signs.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the momentum as vectors. So, if fragment 1 moves in the positive direction with velocity v, fragment 2 moves in the negative direction with velocity u. So their momenta are:

P1 = gamma1 m1 v (positive)

P2 = gamma2 m2 u (negative, because u is in the negative direction)

Conservation of momentum requires P1 + P2 = 0 → gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 (-u).

So, gamma1 m1 v = - gamma2 m2 u → u = -(gamma1 m1 v)/(gamma2 m2).

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the magnitude and direction separately. So, the magnitude equation is:

gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

But since u is in the opposite direction, perhaps u is positive in magnitude but direction is negative.

But maybe it's easier to proceed without considering direction, but just the magnitudes, and then find the relation between v and u.

So, the equations are:

gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u. → equation 1.

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M → equation 2.

And from earlier, the non-relativistic assumption gives u = 2 v, but in reality, in relativity, the relation between u and v is more complex. So perhaps we can proceed by substituting u = 2 v into equation 1, but I'm not sure if that's valid in the relativistic case. Hmm, perhaps that's an approximation we can try, but it's not accurate. Maybe I should instead express u in terms of v using the non-relativistic relation, but that's only valid when speeds are low, which may not be the case here.

But wait, earlier in the non-relativistic case, the velocity v was about 0.1c, which is 30,000 km/s. That's high, but not ultra-relativistic. So perhaps this non-relativistic approximation for u is not accurate, and it would lead to a wrong result in the relativistic calculation. Hmm, this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed by assuming that the kinetic energy is non-relativistic, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using the non-relativistic momentum relation, but that might not hold.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the velocities in terms of each other.

Wait, perhaps I can write u = (gamma1 m1 v) / (gamma2 m2). But that's from equation 1.

But without knowing the gamma factors, this might not be helpful.

This seems complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, I remember that in inelastic collisions, the maximum kinetic energy occurs when the two masses move in the same direction, but in fission, they move in opposite directions. Hmm, but perhaps that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the two fragments have velocities v and u, such that their momenta are equal and opposite, as before.

So, gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

And the energy equation is gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M.

Additionally, the kinetic energy K1 + K2 = 3 GeV, where K1 = (gamma1 - 1) m1 c^2, and K2 = (gamma2 - 1) m2 c^2.

Wait, since in relativity, the total energy is gamma m c², and the rest energy is m c², so K = (gamma - 1) m c².

But since we're using units where c=1, K = (gamma - 1) m.

So, the sum is (gamma1 -1) m1 + (gamma2 - 1) m2 = 3 GeV.

But m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

So, (gamma1 -1) * 0.66 M + (gamma2 -1) * 0.33 M = 3 GeV.

But M is 300 GeV, so:

( gamma1 -1 ) * 0.66 *300 + ( gamma2 - 1 ) * 0.33 *300 = 3.

Simplify:

0.66 *300 = 198 GeV,

0.33 *300 = 99 GeV.

So,

198 (gamma1 -1) + 99 (gamma2 -1) = 3 GeV.

Which simplifies to:

198 gamma1 - 198 + 99 gamma2 -99 = 3.

→ 198 gamma1 + 99 gamma2 = 3 + 198 +99 = 300.

So,

198 gamma1 + 99 gamma2 = 300 → can divide both sides by 99:

(198/99) gamma1 + gamma2 = 300/99 → 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303... approximately.

So equation A: 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

Now, let's go back to the momentum equation.

gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

We can write v and u in terms of each other. From the non-relativistic approximation, u = 2 v. But perhaps that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express u in terms of v using the relation given by the momentum equation.

But since I don't know the gamma factors, this seems complicated. Let me think.

Another approach is to express the velocities in terms of the beta factors, beta1 = v/c, beta2 = u/c.

In terms of beta, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²).

The momentum equation becomes:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

So,

(gamma1 / gamma2) (m1 beta1) = m2 beta2.

But m1 = 2 m2 → m1 = 2 m2.

So,

(gamma1/gamma2) * 2 m2 beta1 = m2 beta2 → 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

Hmm, but not sure if that helps.

Wait, from the non-relativistic case, we found that in non-relativistic, u=2v.

But in reality, perhaps the velocities are different. Let's say, in the non-relativistic case, u=2v, but in the relativistic case, the relation between u and v is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption that u = k v, where k is a constant, but I don't know the value of k.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too involved. Maybe I should make a substitution.

Let me think about the variables.

We have three equations:

1) 198 gamma1 + 99 gamma2 = 300 → simplified to 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

2) gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

3) u = (gamma1 m1 beta1)/(gamma2 m2) → from equation 2.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can express gamma2 in terms of gamma1.

From equation A: gamma2 = 3.0303 - 2 gamma1.

Now, substituting into equation 2:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = (3.0303 - 2 gamma1) m2 beta2.

But I'm not sure how to proceed further. Maybe I need another relation between beta1 and beta2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express beta2 in terms of beta1.

Wait, another approach: express everything in terms of beta1.

But I'm not sure. This is getting a bit too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that since the kinetic energy is low compared to the rest mass energy (3 GeV vs 300 GeV), the velocities are non-relativistic, so the non-relativistic approximation is valid. But the question asks for the difference between the correct and the non-relativistic T1, so perhaps the correct approach is to compute T1 relativistically and subtract the non-relativistic T1.

Wait, but earlier in the non-relativistic approach, T1 was 0.99 GeV, which is 990 MeV. But according to the relativistic approach, it's different.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem using the relativistic expressions.

Wait, let's make it concrete. Let me define some variables again.

m1 = 0.66 M.

m2 = 0.33 M.

M = 300 GeV.

The sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M, so the kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, KE1 = 0.99 GeV, as we calculated earlier.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energies would be higher because the relativistic kinetic energy is larger than the non-relativistic one. So the difference would be the relativistic T1 minus the non-relativistic T1.

Wait, but how much higher is T1 relativistically?

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the velocities and the kinetic energies relativistically.

Wait, perhaps I can model the problem using the fact that the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

In the non-relativistic case, gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), so the kinetic energy is approximately (1/2) m v².

But in the relativistic case, KE is (gamma - 1) m c².

So, perhaps I can find the velocity v of the more massive fragment, then compute both relativistic and non-relativistic KEs.

But to find v, I need to use the conservation laws.

Another approach: Since the problem is symmetric except for the masses, perhaps I can find the ratio of the velocities.

Wait, let me try to find the ratio of the velocities. From the momentum equation:

gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

We know m1 = 2 m2.

So,

gamma1 * 2 m2 v = gamma2 m2 u → 2 gamma1 v = gamma2 u → u = (2 gamma1 v)/gamma2.

But without knowing the gamma values, this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the velocities are small compared to c, but given that the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is 3e9 eV, and the rest mass energy is 3e11 eV, so 3 GeV is 0.003 times the rest mass energy. So perhaps the velocities are not ultra-relativistic, but not non-relativistic either. So the non-relativistic approximation might not be very accurate, but the difference between relativistic and non-relativistic KE may be small.

Wait, but the question is about the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the non-relativistic T1. Let me think about how to calculate that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem as a two-body problem with conservation of energy and momentum.

Another approach: Let me denote beta1 = v1/c and beta2 = v2/c.

From the momentum conservation:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

The energy conservation:

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M.

Also, the kinetic energy is (gamma1 m1 - m1) + (gamma2 m2 - m2) )= 3 GeV.

So,

(gamma1 -1) m1 + (gamma2 - 1) m2 = 3 GeV.

Given m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M, and M=300 GeV.

Substituting:

(gamma1 -1) * 0.66 *300 + (gamma2 -1) * 0.33 *300 = 3.

As before, this simplifies to 198 (gamma1 -1) + 99 (gamma2 -1) = 3.

Which becomes 198 gamma1 + 99 gamma2 = 300 + 198 +99 → no, wait: 198 gamma1 -198 +99 gamma2 -99 = 3 → 198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 = 3 + 198 +99 = 300.

So,

198 gamma1 + 99 gamma2 = 300 → divide by 99: 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

So equation A: 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

Now, the momentum equation:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

But m1 = 2 m2 → m1 = 2 m2 → m1 = 2 m2.

So,

gamma1 * 2 m2 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2 → 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But beta2 = v2/c = (2 v1) / c, based on non-relativistic assumption. But perhaps in reality, it's different.

Wait, perhaps I should assume that beta2 = k beta1, where k is a constant.

But without knowing k, this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can express beta2 in terms of beta1 and the gamma factors.

Wait, another approach: express beta in terms of gamma.

We know that beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

So,

beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2),

beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2).

Substituting into the momentum equation:

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

So,

2 gamma1 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2) = gamma2 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2).

But this equation is complicated to solve.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption, such as gamma1 ≈ gamma2, but I'm not sure if that's valid.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that gamma1 is approximately equal to gamma2. Let's see:

If gamma1 ≈ gamma2, then equation A becomes:

2 gamma1 + gamma1 ≈ 3.0303 → 3 gamma1 ≈ 3.0303 → gamma1 ≈ 1.0101.

But gamma must be greater than 1, so that's possible.

If gamma1 = gamma2 ≈ 1.0101, then beta1 = sqrt(1 - (1/(1.0101)^2)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.9803) ≈ sqrt(0.0197) ≈ 0.1403.

Wait, but then beta2 would be the same as beta1, which would imply that u = v, which is not possible given the mass ratio. So perhaps this assumption is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed numerically.

Wait, from equation A:

gamma2 = 3.0303 - 2 gamma1.

Substituting into the momentum equation:

2 gamma1 beta1 = (3.0303 - 2 gamma1) beta2.

But I also have:

beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2),

beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 1/( (3.0303 - 2 gamma1)^2 )).

This seems difficult to solve algebraically, so perhaps I can make an initial guess and iterate.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, we found that gamma1 is approximately 1 + (v^2)/(2 c^2).

Wait, let's compute gamma1 in the non-relativistic case.

In the non-relativistic case, v is approximately 0.1c, so gamma ≈ 1 + (0.1c)^2/(2 c^2) )= 1 + 0.005 = 1.005.

So gamma1 ≈ 1.005.

Then, gamma2 would be 3.0303 - 2 * 1.005 ≈ 3.0303 - 2.01 = 1.0203.

So gamma2 ≈ 1.0203.

Then, beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/(1.005)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.9900) = sqrt(0.01) = 0.1.

Similarly, beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/(1.0203)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.9608 )= sqrt(0.0392)= 0.198.

Wait, but earlier in the non-relativistic case, u=2v → beta2 = 2 beta1 → beta2 = 0.2.

So this is close to that, but not exact.

Now, let's plug these values into the momentum equation.

2 gamma1 beta1 = 2 * 1.005 * 0.1 = 0.201.

gamma2 beta2 = 1.0203 * 0.198 ≈ 0.202.

So that's approximately equal, which is good.

So, with these gamma values, the momentum equation is approximately satisfied.

Now, let's compute the kinetic energies.

Relativistic KE1 = (gamma1 - 1) m1.

m1 = 0.66 *300 GeV = 198 GeV.

So KE1 = (1.005 -1 ) * 198 = 0.005 * 198 = 0.99 GeV.

Similarly, KE2 = (1.0203 -1 ) * 99 GeV = 0.0203 *99 = approx 2.0097 GeV.

So total KE = 0.99 + 2.0097 ≈ 2.9997 GeV ≈3 GeV, which matches.

So, the relativistic KE1 is 0.99 GeV, same as the non-relativistic case. Wait, that can't be right because the non-relativistic case also gave KE1 as 0.99 GeV.

Wait, but that suggests that the relativistic and non-relativistic KE1 are the same, which can't be correct because the problem states that there's a difference.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, we calculated KE1 as 0.99 GeV. In the relativistic case, with gamma1 ≈1.005, KE1 is (1.005-1)*198 GeV = 0.005 *198 = 0.99 GeV. So same value.

But wait, that's confusing. How can the relativistic and non-relativistic results be the same?

Wait, perhaps because the velocity is small enough that the relativistic correction is negligible. But the problem states that the correct T1 is to be compared with the classical approximation, implying that there is a difference. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the relativistic case, the velocities are different, leading to different kinetic energies.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that u = 2v is only valid in the non-relativistic case. In reality, the velocities are different, so the momentum equation might give different results.

Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me think about the problem in terms of invariant mass.

Wait, the invariant mass squared is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

In this case, after fission, the total momentum is zero, so the invariant mass is simply E_total / c².

But E_total after fission is M c², so the invariant mass is M. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the kinetic energy in the center of mass frame.

Wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the center of mass frame is the same as the initial frame. So after fission, the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is to calculate the velocity of the more massive fragment using the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

The energy of fragment 1 is E1 = gamma m1 c².

Momentum p1 = gamma m1 v = gamma m1 beta c.

Similarly for fragment 2: E2 = gamma2 m2 c², p2 = gamma2 m2 beta2 c.

Conservation of energy: E1 + E2 = M c².

Conservation of momentum: p1 = -p2 → gamma1 m1 beta1 c = gamma2 m2 beta2 c → gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

We can write beta in terms of gamma: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

So,

gamma1 m1 sqrt(1 -1/gamma1^2 ) = gamma2 m2 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2 ).

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the kinetic energy is small, so gamma is close to 1, and use a Taylor expansion.

Let me let gamma1 = 1 + a, gamma2 = 1 + b, where a and b are small.

Then, the energy equation:

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M.

We have,

(1+a) m1 + (1+b) m2 = M → m1 + m2 + a m1 + b m2 = M.

But m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

So,

0.99 M + a m1 + b m2 = M → a m1 + b m2 = 0.01 M.

Substituting m1 = 0.66 M, m2 =0.33 M:

a (0.66 M) + b (0.33 M) = 0.01 M.

Divide both sides by M:

0.66 a + 0.33 b = 0.01 → 0.66 a + 0.33 b = 0.01.

Equation B: 0.66 a + 0.33 b = 0.01.

Now, the momentum equation:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

Expressing beta in terms of gamma:

beta1 = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma1)^2 )) ≈ sqrt(1 - (1/(1+a)^2 )) ≈ sqrt(1 - (1 - 2a + 3a^2 )) ≈ sqrt(2a - 3a^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2a) (1 - (3a)/(4)).

Similarly, beta2 ≈ sqrt(2b).

So,

gamma1 m1 beta1 ≈ (1 + a) * m1 * sqrt(2a) = gamma2 m2 beta2 ≈ (1 + b) * m2 * sqrt(2b).

But since a and b are small, 1 + a ≈ 1, 1 + b ≈ 1.

So,

m1 sqrt(2a) ≈ m2 sqrt(2b).

Squaring both sides:

m1^2 (2a) ≈ m2^2 (2b) → m1^2 a ≈ m2^2 b → (0.66 M)^2 a ≈ (0.33 M)^2 b → (0.4356) a ≈ (0.1089) b → a ≈ (0.1089/0.4356) b → a ≈ 0.25 b.

So, a ≈ 0.25 b.

Now, substituting into equation B:

0.66 a + 0.33 b = 0.01.

Substituting a = 0.25 b,

0.66 *0.25 b + 0.33 b = 0.01 → 0.165 b + 0.33 b = 0.01 → 0.495 b = 0.01 → b ≈ 0.01 / 0.495 → approximately 0.0202.

Then, a ≈ 0.25 *0.0202 ≈ 0.00505.

So,

gamma1 ≈ 1 + a = 1.00505,

gamma2 ≈ 1 + b = 1.0202.

Now, calculate the kinetic energies.

Relativistic KE1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c² → (0.00505) * 0.66 *300 GeV → 0.00505 * 198 ≈ 1 GeV.

Similarly, KE2 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c² → (0.0202) * 0.33 *300 → 0.0202 *99 ≈ 2.00 GeV.

Wait, but earlier in the non-relativistic approach, KE1 was 0.99 GeV. Here, with this approximation, KE1 is about 1 GeV. So the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the non-relativistic T1 would be 1 GeV - 0.99 GeV = 0.01 GeV = 10 MeV.

But wait, the options don't have 10 MeV as a choice. The options are A) 2, B)5, C)10, D)20. So option C is 10 MeV.

Wait, but earlier in the non-relativistic case, KE1 was 0.99 GeV (990 MeV), and in this relativistic approximation, it's 1 GeV (1000 MeV). So the difference is 10 MeV.

So the answer would be option C) 10 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps my approximations are leading to this. But I started with the assumption that a and b are small, which they are (0.005 and 0.02), so perhaps this is valid.

So, the correct T1 is 1 GeV, the non-relativistic T1 is 0.99 GeV, so the difference is 0.01 GeV, which is 10 MeV. So the correct answer is C)10 MeV.

To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process and compare the relativistic and non-relativistic kinetic energies of the more massive fragment.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Conditions**:  
   - The atomic nucleus has a rest mass energy of \( M c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \).  
   - After fission, the nucleus splits into two fragments:  
     - Fragment 1 (more massive): \( m_1 = 0.66M \).  
     - Fragment 2 (less massive): \( m_2 = 0.33M \).  
   - The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is \( 0.99M \), leaving \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \) of energy as the total kinetic energy of the fragments.

2. **Conservation Laws**:  
   - **Momentum Conservation**: Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission is zero. Thus, the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:  
     \[
     \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2.
     \]
   - **Energy Conservation**: The total energy after fission is the sum of the rest masses and kinetic energies of the two fragments:  
     \[
     \gamma_1 m_1 + \gamma_2 m_2 = M.
     \]
   - The total kinetic energy is distributed as:  
     \[
     K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV},
     \]
     where \( K_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1)m_1 \) and \( K_2 = (\gamma_2 - 1)m_2 \).

### Non-Relativistic Case:
In the non-relativistic approximation, kinetic energy is given by \( K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). Using momentum conservation, the velocity ratio is \( v_2 = 2v_1 \). Substituting into the energy conservation equation, the total kinetic energy is:  
\[
K_1 + K_2 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2(2v_1)^2 = \frac{3}{2}m_1v_1^2.
\]
Solving for \( v_1^2 \), we find \( v_1^2 \approx 0.01 \). The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:  
\[
K_1 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 = 0.99 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Relativistic Case:
In the relativistic case, the total energy of each fragment includes a Lorentz factor \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). The total energy of the system is:  
\[
\gamma_1 m_1 + \gamma_2 m_2 = M.
\]
Using the momentum conservation equation \( \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2 \) and the velocity ratio \( v_2 = 2v_1 \), the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:  
\[
K_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1)m_1.
\]
After solving the relativistic equations, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is found to be approximately \( K_1 = 1.00 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( K_1 \):
The difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic kinetic energies of the more massive fragment is:  
\[
\Delta K_1 = K_1^{\text{relativistic}} - K_1^{\text{non-relativistic}} = 1.00 \, \text{GeV} - 0.99 \, \text{GeV} = 0.01 \, \text{GeV} = 10 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The difference between the correct relativistic \( T_1 \) and the classical non-relativistic \( T_1 \) is **10 MeV**.

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.

Wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum should be zero before and after the fission. So the two fragments will move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta, right? That means their velocities are probably in opposite directions, but their magnitudes depend on their masses.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. We need to find the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Options are A to D, all in MeV. So the difference is probably a small fraction of GeV, hence the answer is likely in the MeV range.

Let me break it down. First, let's get the masses of the two fragments.

Let me denote the less massive fragment as mass m, so the more massive one is 2m. Their sum is m + 2m = 3m. But the sum is 99% of M, so 3m = 0.99 M => m = 0.99 M / 3 = 0.33 M. So the more massive fragment is 2m = 0.66 M.

Wait, but M is the initial mass. Oh wait, the initial nucleus has rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. So M must be the rest mass, so M c² = 300 GeV. But for calculations, we might not need to use c² explicitly because we're dealing with mass and energy in compatible units.

Wait, the sum of rest masses is 0.99 M, so the mass-energy of the two fragments is 0.99 * M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the initial energy is 300 GeV, and after fission, the rest mass energy is 297 GeV. The remaining energy must be the kinetic energy of the two fragments. So the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

But wait, the initial nucleus was at rest, so the total energy before fission is just its rest energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the energy includes the rest mass energies of the two fragments and their kinetic energies. So the total energy after is (m1 c² + K1) + (m2 c² + K2) ) = (m1 + m2) c^2 + (K1 + K2).

But since the total energy is conserved, 300 GeV = (297 GeV) + (K1 + K2). So K1 + K2 = 3 GeV. So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 GeV.

Now, because the nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let's denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for the two fragments. Wait, but since momentum is m v, and since the two fragments have different masses, their velocities will be different.

Let me model this. Let the more massive fragment (2m) have velocity v, and the less massive one (m) have velocity u. Then, 2m v = m u in the opposite direction. So 2m v = m u → 2v = -u. So u = -2v. So if the more massive one is moving in positive direction with velocity v, the other is moving in the negative direction with velocity 2v.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the momentum of the first is 2m v, and the second is m u. They must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So 2m v = - m u → 2v = -u → u = -2v. So the second fragment is moving in the opposite direction with twice the speed of the first. Hmm, that seems right.

But wait, let's think about the kinetic energies. The kinetic energy for each fragment is (1/2) m v², but wait, that's the non-relativistic formula. Since the masses are a significant fraction of the initial mass, but the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is small compared to 300 GeV. So perhaps the non-relativistic approximation is valid here, but the problem asks for the difference between the correct and the classical T1.

So I need to compute T1 using both relativistic and non-relativistic methods and find the difference.

But first, let's find the velocities. Well, because of the momentum condition and the energy condition.

Another approach is to model the velocities using conservation of energy and momentum. So the system is:

- Momentum: 2m (v) - m (u) = 0 → 2v = u (but direction is considered, so perhaps 2m v = m u, but with opposite signs, so u = 2v but in the opposite direction). Hmm, perhaps I should model it as vectors, so the more massive fragment's velocity is v, the other's is u. So 2m v = - m u → 2 v = -u → u = -2v.

So, the kinetic energy of fragment 1 (2m) is (1/2)(2m) v², and fragment 2 (m) is (1/2) m u². Since u = -2v, u² = 4 v².

So KE1 = (1/2)(2m)(v²) = m v².

KE2 = (1/2) m (4 v²) = 2 m v².

So KE1 + KE2 = 3 m v² = 3 GeV.

So 3 m v² = 3 GeV → m v² = 1 GeV.

But wait, m is the rest mass of the smaller fragment, which is (0.33 M) / c², but perhaps in units where c=1, mass and energy are directly related. Hmm, perhaps I should express everything in terms of M.

Wait, M is the initial rest mass. The initial energy is M c² = 300 GeV. So M = 300 GeV / c². Then m is 0.33 M. Wait, earlier I calculated m as 0.33 M, but that was based on the sum of the two masses being 0.99 M. Let me check that again.

Wait, the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 99% of M, so m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Given that m1 is twice m2, so m1 = 2 m2. So 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M.

So m2 = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M.

So, in the non-relativistic case, KE1 (for m1) is (1/2) m1 v², and KE2 is (1/2) m2 u².

From the momentum conservation, since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after must be zero. So m1 v1 = m2 v2, but since they move in opposite directions, m1 v1 = - m2 v2. So v2 = -(m1 / m2) v1.

Wait, earlier I thought m1 is 0.66 M, m2 is 0.33 M. So m1/m2 = 2. So v2 = -2 v1.

Wait, but when I previously considered m and 2m, perhaps I mixed up m1 and m2. Let me correct. The more massive fragment is m1 = 0.66 M, the less is m2 = 0.33 M.

So in terms of momentum, m1 v1 = - m2 v2. So:

0.66 M * v1 = - 0.33 M * v2 → 0.66 v1 = -0.33 v2 → v2 = -2 v1.

So v2 is twice as much in the opposite direction of v1.

Now, the kinetic energies in non-relativistic:

KE1 = (1/2)(0.66 M) v1².

KE2 = (1/2)(0.33 M) v2² = (1/2)(0.33 M)( (2 v1) )^2 = (1/2)(0.33 M)(4 v1²) )= (1/2)(1.32 M v1²) )= 0.66 M v1².

So KE1 + KE2 = (0.33 M v1²) + (0.66 M v1²) )= 0.99 M v1².

Wait, but earlier we said the total KE is 3 GeV. So 0.99 M v1² = 3 GeV.

We know M c² = 300 GeV. So M = 300 GeV / c².

But in units where c=1, M = 300 GeV.

So substituting M = 300 GeV, we have:

0.99 * 300 GeV * v1² = 3 GeV → 0.99 * 300 v1² = 3 → v1² = 3 / (0.99 *300) → v1² = 3/(297) ≈ 0.0101 → v1 ≈ sqrt(0.0101) ≈ 0.1005.

So v1 is about 0.1 times the speed of light in non-relativistic terms.

So the non-relativistic KE for the more massive fragment (m1) is KE1 = 0.5 * 0.66 M v1².

Wait, wait, in the non-relativistic case, KE1 = (1/2) m1 v1^2 = 0.5 * 0.66 M (v1^2).

We have M = 300 GeV, so let's compute. v1² ≈ 0.01.

So KE1 = 0.5 * 0.66 * 300 GeV * 0.01.

Calculating that: 0.5 * 0.66 = 0.33. 0.33 *300 = 99, 99 *0.01=0.99 GeV. So 0.99 GeV is 990 MeV. Wait, but that can't be right because the total KE is 3 GeV, so that would make KE1 990 MeV and KE2 2010 MeV, which adds to 3 GeV. Wait, 990 + 2010 = 3000 MeV = 3 GeV. Hmm, that's correct.

But wait, that's the non-relativistic approach. Now, the actual relativistic calculation would probably have a higher KE because in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2) m v^2. So the correct approach would involve using relativistic expressions for energy and momentum.

So the correct way is to model using relativistic momentum and energy.

In the relativistic case, the total energy of each fragment is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but since we are dealing with kinetic energy, perhaps it's better to model using total energy.

So for the more massive fragment, mass m1 = 0.66 M.

Its total energy is gamma * m1 c², where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

Similarly, fragment 2 has mass m2 = 0.33 M, and velocity v2 = -2 v1 (from non-relativistic assumption, but perhaps that's not correct in relativistic terms. Wait, no, because in relativistic cases, velocities don't just add like that. So perhaps the relation between v1 and v2 is more complicated.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think again.

In the relativistic case, conservation of momentum and energy must be applied.

Let me denote the more massive fragment as having velocity v, and the less as u.

Then, momentum conservation:

gamma1 * m1 v = gamma2 * m2 u.

But since they move in opposite directions, perhaps it's better to model as:

gamma1 * m1 v = - gamma2 * m2 u.

Energy conservation:

gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c² = M c².

Because the initial nucleus is at rest, its energy is M c².

So we have these two equations:

1) gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

2) gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M.

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, no, because energy is E = gamma m c², so the sum of energies after fission is M c², so equation 2 would be:

gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c² = M c^2 → gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M.

Wait, no, because M is in units where c=1, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps I should use natural units where c=1 for simplicity. So, energies are in GeV, masses are in GeV/c², but with c=1, it's just GeV. So M = 300 GeV. m1 = 0.66 M = 198 GeV, m2 = 0.33 M = 99 GeV.

So, the equations become:

gamma1 * m1 * v = gamma2 * m2 * u.

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M = 300 GeV.

Additionally, the velocities are such that the two fragments move in opposite directions. So, u could be negative, but perhaps it's easier to model their directions with positive and negative signs.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the signs. Alternatively, perhaps I should assume that fragment 1 (m1) is moving with velocity v, fragment 2 (m2) with velocity u. The momentum vectors are in opposite directions, so m1 v = - m2 u.

Wait, but in reality, the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so m1 v = - m2 u → u = -(m1 v)/(m2).

So, u = -(m1/m2) v. Since m1 = 2 m2, then u = -2 v.

Wait, so in this approximation, u is twice v in the opposite direction, same as the non-relativistic case. But wait, that's only valid in the non-relativistic scenario. Because in relativity, velocities don't add linearly. So perhaps this relation is not correct in the relativistic case, but for the purpose of solving this problem, maybe I can proceed with this assumption and see where it leads me.

So, let's proceed with u = -2 v.

Then, equation 1 becomes:

gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 (-2 v) → gamma1 m1 v = - 2 gamma2 m2 v.

We can cancel v (assuming v ≠ 0) to get:

gamma1 m1 = -2 gamma2 m2.

But since gamma is always positive, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me correct this.

Wait, the correct momentum equation should be:

gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

But if u is in the opposite direction, let's consider u = -2 v as per non-relativistic.

So equation 1 becomes:

gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 (-2 v) → gamma1 m1 = -2 gamma2 m2.

But the left side is positive, right side is negative. Hmm, that can't be. So perhaps I should take the magnitude, and adjust the signs accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the momenta as vectors, so:

gamma1 m1 v = - gamma2 m2 u.

If u is in the opposite direction, then u = +2 v. Wait, perhaps I should be more careful with the signs.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the momentum as vectors. So, if fragment 1 moves in the positive direction with velocity v, fragment 2 moves in the negative direction with velocity u. So their momenta are:

P1 = gamma1 m1 v (positive)

P2 = gamma2 m2 u (negative, because u is in the negative direction)

Conservation of momentum requires P1 + P2 = 0 → gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 (-u).

So, gamma1 m1 v = - gamma2 m2 u → u = -(gamma1 m1 v)/(gamma2 m2).

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the magnitude and direction separately. So, the magnitude equation is:

gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

But since u is in the opposite direction, perhaps u is positive in magnitude but direction is negative.

But maybe it's easier to proceed without considering direction, but just the magnitudes, and then find the relation between v and u.

So, the equations are:

gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u. → equation 1.

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M → equation 2.

And from earlier, the non-relativistic assumption gives u = 2 v, but in reality, in relativity, the relation between u and v is more complex. So perhaps we can proceed by substituting u = 2 v into equation 1, but I'm not sure if that's valid in the relativistic case. Hmm, perhaps that's an approximation we can try, but it's not accurate. Maybe I should instead express u in terms of v using the non-relativistic relation, but that's only valid when speeds are low, which may not be the case here.

But wait, earlier in the non-relativistic case, the velocity v was about 0.1c, which is 30,000 km/s. That's high, but not ultra-relativistic. So perhaps this non-relativistic approximation for u is not accurate, and it would lead to a wrong result in the relativistic calculation. Hmm, this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed by assuming that the kinetic energy is non-relativistic, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using the non-relativistic momentum relation, but that might not hold.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the velocities in terms of each other.

Wait, perhaps I can write u = (gamma1 m1 v) / (gamma2 m2). But that's from equation 1.

But without knowing the gamma factors, this might not be helpful.

This seems complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, I remember that in inelastic collisions, the maximum kinetic energy occurs when the two masses move in the same direction, but in fission, they move in opposite directions. Hmm, but perhaps that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the two fragments have velocities v and u, such that their momenta are equal and opposite, as before.

So, gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

And the energy equation is gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M.

Additionally, the kinetic energy K1 + K2 = 3 GeV, where K1 = (gamma1 - 1) m1 c^2, and K2 = (gamma2 - 1) m2 c^2.

Wait, since in relativity, the total energy is gamma m c², and the rest energy is m c², so K = (gamma - 1) m c².

But since we're using units where c=1, K = (gamma - 1) m.

So, the sum is (gamma1 -1) m1 + (gamma2 - 1) m2 = 3 GeV.

But m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

So, (gamma1 -1) * 0.66 M + (gamma2 -1) * 0.33 M = 3 GeV.

But M is 300 GeV, so:

( gamma1 -1 ) * 0.66 *300 + ( gamma2 - 1 ) * 0.33 *300 = 3.

Simplify:

0.66 *300 = 198 GeV,

0.33 *300 = 99 GeV.

So,

198 (gamma1 -1) + 99 (gamma2 -1) = 3 GeV.

Which simplifies to:

198 gamma1 - 198 + 99 gamma2 -99 = 3.

→ 198 gamma1 + 99 gamma2 = 3 + 198 +99 = 300.

So,

198 gamma1 + 99 gamma2 = 300 → can divide both sides by 99:

(198/99) gamma1 + gamma2 = 300/99 → 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303... approximately.

So equation A: 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

Now, let's go back to the momentum equation.

gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

We can write v and u in terms of each other. From the non-relativistic approximation, u = 2 v. But perhaps that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express u in terms of v using the relation given by the momentum equation.

But since I don't know the gamma factors, this seems complicated. Let me think.

Another approach is to express the velocities in terms of the beta factors, beta1 = v/c, beta2 = u/c.

In terms of beta, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²).

The momentum equation becomes:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

So,

(gamma1 / gamma2) (m1 beta1) = m2 beta2.

But m1 = 2 m2 → m1 = 2 m2.

So,

(gamma1/gamma2) * 2 m2 beta1 = m2 beta2 → 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

Hmm, but not sure if that helps.

Wait, from the non-relativistic case, we found that in non-relativistic, u=2v.

But in reality, perhaps the velocities are different. Let's say, in the non-relativistic case, u=2v, but in the relativistic case, the relation between u and v is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption that u = k v, where k is a constant, but I don't know the value of k.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too involved. Maybe I should make a substitution.

Let me think about the variables.

We have three equations:

1) 198 gamma1 + 99 gamma2 = 300 → simplified to 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

2) gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

3) u = (gamma1 m1 beta1)/(gamma2 m2) → from equation 2.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can express gamma2 in terms of gamma1.

From equation A: gamma2 = 3.0303 - 2 gamma1.

Now, substituting into equation 2:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = (3.0303 - 2 gamma1) m2 beta2.

But I'm not sure how to proceed further. Maybe I need another relation between beta1 and beta2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express beta2 in terms of beta1.

Wait, another approach: express everything in terms of beta1.

But I'm not sure. This is getting a bit too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that since the kinetic energy is low compared to the rest mass energy (3 GeV vs 300 GeV), the velocities are non-relativistic, so the non-relativistic approximation is valid. But the question asks for the difference between the correct and the non-relativistic T1, so perhaps the correct approach is to compute T1 relativistically and subtract the non-relativistic T1.

Wait, but earlier in the non-relativistic approach, T1 was 0.99 GeV, which is 990 MeV. But according to the relativistic approach, it's different.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem using the relativistic expressions.

Wait, let's make it concrete. Let me define some variables again.

m1 = 0.66 M.

m2 = 0.33 M.

M = 300 GeV.

The sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M, so the kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, KE1 = 0.99 GeV, as we calculated earlier.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energies would be higher because the relativistic kinetic energy is larger than the non-relativistic one. So the difference would be the relativistic T1 minus the non-relativistic T1.

Wait, but how much higher is T1 relativistically?

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the velocities and the kinetic energies relativistically.

Wait, perhaps I can model the problem using the fact that the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

In the non-relativistic case, gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), so the kinetic energy is approximately (1/2) m v².

But in the relativistic case, KE is (gamma - 1) m c².

So, perhaps I can find the velocity v of the more massive fragment, then compute both relativistic and non-relativistic KEs.

But to find v, I need to use the conservation laws.

Another approach: Since the problem is symmetric except for the masses, perhaps I can find the ratio of the velocities.

Wait, let me try to find the ratio of the velocities. From the momentum equation:

gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

We know m1 = 2 m2.

So,

gamma1 * 2 m2 v = gamma2 m2 u → 2 gamma1 v = gamma2 u → u = (2 gamma1 v)/gamma2.

But without knowing the gamma values, this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the velocities are small compared to c, but given that the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is 3e9 eV, and the rest mass energy is 3e11 eV, so 3 GeV is 0.003 times the rest mass energy. So perhaps the velocities are not ultra-relativistic, but not non-relativistic either. So the non-relativistic approximation might not be very accurate, but the difference between relativistic and non-relativistic KE may be small.

Wait, but the question is about the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the non-relativistic T1. Let me think about how to calculate that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem as a two-body problem with conservation of energy and momentum.

Another approach: Let me denote beta1 = v1/c and beta2 = v2/c.

From the momentum conservation:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

The energy conservation:

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M.

Also, the kinetic energy is (gamma1 m1 - m1) + (gamma2 m2 - m2) )= 3 GeV.

So,

(gamma1 -1) m1 + (gamma2 - 1) m2 = 3 GeV.

Given m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M, and M=300 GeV.

Substituting:

(gamma1 -1) * 0.66 *300 + (gamma2 -1) * 0.33 *300 = 3.

As before, this simplifies to 198 (gamma1 -1) + 99 (gamma2 -1) = 3.

Which becomes 198 gamma1 + 99 gamma2 = 300 + 198 +99 → no, wait: 198 gamma1 -198 +99 gamma2 -99 = 3 → 198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 = 3 + 198 +99 = 300.

So,

198 gamma1 + 99 gamma2 = 300 → divide by 99: 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

So equation A: 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

Now, the momentum equation:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

But m1 = 2 m2 → m1 = 2 m2 → m1 = 2 m2.

So,

gamma1 * 2 m2 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2 → 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But beta2 = v2/c = (2 v1) / c, based on non-relativistic assumption. But perhaps in reality, it's different.

Wait, perhaps I should assume that beta2 = k beta1, where k is a constant.

But without knowing k, this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can express beta2 in terms of beta1 and the gamma factors.

Wait, another approach: express beta in terms of gamma.

We know that beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

So,

beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2),

beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2).

Substituting into the momentum equation:

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

So,

2 gamma1 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2) = gamma2 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2).

But this equation is complicated to solve.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption, such as gamma1 ≈ gamma2, but I'm not sure if that's valid.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that gamma1 is approximately equal to gamma2. Let's see:

If gamma1 ≈ gamma2, then equation A becomes:

2 gamma1 + gamma1 ≈ 3.0303 → 3 gamma1 ≈ 3.0303 → gamma1 ≈ 1.0101.

But gamma must be greater than 1, so that's possible.

If gamma1 = gamma2 ≈ 1.0101, then beta1 = sqrt(1 - (1/(1.0101)^2)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.9803) ≈ sqrt(0.0197) ≈ 0.1403.

Wait, but then beta2 would be the same as beta1, which would imply that u = v, which is not possible given the mass ratio. So perhaps this assumption is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed numerically.

Wait, from equation A:

gamma2 = 3.0303 - 2 gamma1.

Substituting into the momentum equation:

2 gamma1 beta1 = (3.0303 - 2 gamma1) beta2.

But I also have:

beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2),

beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 1/( (3.0303 - 2 gamma1)^2 )).

This seems difficult to solve algebraically, so perhaps I can make an initial guess and iterate.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, we found that gamma1 is approximately 1 + (v^2)/(2 c^2).

Wait, let's compute gamma1 in the non-relativistic case.

In the non-relativistic case, v is approximately 0.1c, so gamma ≈ 1 + (0.1c)^2/(2 c^2) )= 1 + 0.005 = 1.005.

So gamma1 ≈ 1.005.

Then, gamma2 would be 3.0303 - 2 * 1.005 ≈ 3.0303 - 2.01 = 1.0203.

So gamma2 ≈ 1.0203.

Then, beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/(1.005)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.9900) = sqrt(0.01) = 0.1.

Similarly, beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/(1.0203)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.9608 )= sqrt(0.0392)= 0.198.

Wait, but earlier in the non-relativistic case, u=2v → beta2 = 2 beta1 → beta2 = 0.2.

So this is close to that, but not exact.

Now, let's plug these values into the momentum equation.

2 gamma1 beta1 = 2 * 1.005 * 0.1 = 0.201.

gamma2 beta2 = 1.0203 * 0.198 ≈ 0.202.

So that's approximately equal, which is good.

So, with these gamma values, the momentum equation is approximately satisfied.

Now, let's compute the kinetic energies.

Relativistic KE1 = (gamma1 - 1) m1.

m1 = 0.66 *300 GeV = 198 GeV.

So KE1 = (1.005 -1 ) * 198 = 0.005 * 198 = 0.99 GeV.

Similarly, KE2 = (1.0203 -1 ) * 99 GeV = 0.0203 *99 = approx 2.0097 GeV.

So total KE = 0.99 + 2.0097 ≈ 2.9997 GeV ≈3 GeV, which matches.

So, the relativistic KE1 is 0.99 GeV, same as the non-relativistic case. Wait, that can't be right because the non-relativistic case also gave KE1 as 0.99 GeV.

Wait, but that suggests that the relativistic and non-relativistic KE1 are the same, which can't be correct because the problem states that there's a difference.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, we calculated KE1 as 0.99 GeV. In the relativistic case, with gamma1 ≈1.005, KE1 is (1.005-1)*198 GeV = 0.005 *198 = 0.99 GeV. So same value.

But wait, that's confusing. How can the relativistic and non-relativistic results be the same?

Wait, perhaps because the velocity is small enough that the relativistic correction is negligible. But the problem states that the correct T1 is to be compared with the classical approximation, implying that there is a difference. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the relativistic case, the velocities are different, leading to different kinetic energies.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that u = 2v is only valid in the non-relativistic case. In reality, the velocities are different, so the momentum equation might give different results.

Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me think about the problem in terms of invariant mass.

Wait, the invariant mass squared is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

In this case, after fission, the total momentum is zero, so the invariant mass is simply E_total / c².

But E_total after fission is M c², so the invariant mass is M. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the kinetic energy in the center of mass frame.

Wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the center of mass frame is the same as the initial frame. So after fission, the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is to calculate the velocity of the more massive fragment using the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

The energy of fragment 1 is E1 = gamma m1 c².

Momentum p1 = gamma m1 v = gamma m1 beta c.

Similarly for fragment 2: E2 = gamma2 m2 c², p2 = gamma2 m2 beta2 c.

Conservation of energy: E1 + E2 = M c².

Conservation of momentum: p1 = -p2 → gamma1 m1 beta1 c = gamma2 m2 beta2 c → gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

We can write beta in terms of gamma: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

So,

gamma1 m1 sqrt(1 -1/gamma1^2 ) = gamma2 m2 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2 ).

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the kinetic energy is small, so gamma is close to 1, and use a Taylor expansion.

Let me let gamma1 = 1 + a, gamma2 = 1 + b, where a and b are small.

Then, the energy equation:

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M.

We have,

(1+a) m1 + (1+b) m2 = M → m1 + m2 + a m1 + b m2 = M.

But m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

So,

0.99 M + a m1 + b m2 = M → a m1 + b m2 = 0.01 M.

Substituting m1 = 0.66 M, m2 =0.33 M:

a (0.66 M) + b (0.33 M) = 0.01 M.

Divide both sides by M:

0.66 a + 0.33 b = 0.01 → 0.66 a + 0.33 b = 0.01.

Equation B: 0.66 a + 0.33 b = 0.01.

Now, the momentum equation:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

Expressing beta in terms of gamma:

beta1 = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma1)^2 )) ≈ sqrt(1 - (1/(1+a)^2 )) ≈ sqrt(1 - (1 - 2a + 3a^2 )) ≈ sqrt(2a - 3a^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2a) (1 - (3a)/(4)).

Similarly, beta2 ≈ sqrt(2b).

So,

gamma1 m1 beta1 ≈ (1 + a) * m1 * sqrt(2a) = gamma2 m2 beta2 ≈ (1 + b) * m2 * sqrt(2b).

But since a and b are small, 1 + a ≈ 1, 1 + b ≈ 1.

So,

m1 sqrt(2a) ≈ m2 sqrt(2b).

Squaring both sides:

m1^2 (2a) ≈ m2^2 (2b) → m1^2 a ≈ m2^2 b → (0.66 M)^2 a ≈ (0.33 M)^2 b → (0.4356) a ≈ (0.1089) b → a ≈ (0.1089/0.4356) b → a ≈ 0.25 b.

So, a ≈ 0.25 b.

Now, substituting into equation B:

0.66 a + 0.33 b = 0.01.

Substituting a = 0.25 b,

0.66 *0.25 b + 0.33 b = 0.01 → 0.165 b + 0.33 b = 0.01 → 0.495 b = 0.01 → b ≈ 0.01 / 0.495 → approximately 0.0202.

Then, a ≈ 0.25 *0.0202 ≈ 0.00505.

So,

gamma1 ≈ 1 + a = 1.00505,

gamma2 ≈ 1 + b = 1.0202.

Now, calculate the kinetic energies.

Relativistic KE1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c² → (0.00505) * 0.66 *300 GeV → 0.00505 * 198 ≈ 1 GeV.

Similarly, KE2 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c² → (0.0202) * 0.33 *300 → 0.0202 *99 ≈ 2.00 GeV.

Wait, but earlier in the non-relativistic approach, KE1 was 0.99 GeV. Here, with this approximation, KE1 is about 1 GeV. So the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the non-relativistic T1 would be 1 GeV - 0.99 GeV = 0.01 GeV = 10 MeV.

But wait, the options don't have 10 MeV as a choice. The options are A) 2, B)5, C)10, D)20. So option C is 10 MeV.

Wait, but earlier in the non-relativistic case, KE1 was 0.99 GeV (990 MeV), and in this relativistic approximation, it's 1 GeV (1000 MeV). So the difference is 10 MeV.

So the answer would be option C) 10 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps my approximations are leading to this. But I started with the assumption that a and b are small, which they are (0.005 and 0.02), so perhaps this is valid.

So, the correct T1 is 1 GeV, the non-relativistic T1 is 0.99 GeV, so the difference is 0.01 GeV, which is 10 MeV. So the correct answer is C)10 MeV.


To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process and compare the relativistic and non-relativistic kinetic energies of the more massive fragment.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Conditions**:  
   - The atomic nucleus has a rest mass energy of \( M c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \).  
   - After fission, the nucleus splits into two fragments:  
     - Fragment 1 (more massive): \( m_1 = 0.66M \).  
     - Fragment 2 (less massive): \( m_2 = 0.33M \).  
   - The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is \( 0.99M \), leaving \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \) of energy as the total kinetic energy of the fragments.

2. **Conservation Laws**:  
   - **Momentum Conservation**: Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission is zero. Thus, the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:  
     \[
     \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2.
     \]
   - **Energy Conservation**: The total energy after fission is the sum of the rest masses and kinetic energies of the two fragments:  
     \[
     \gamma_1 m_1 + \gamma_2 m_2 = M.
     \]
   - The total kinetic energy is distributed as:  
     \[
     K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV},
     \]
     where \( K_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1)m_1 \) and \( K_2 = (\gamma_2 - 1)m_2 \).

### Non-Relativistic Case:
In the non-relativistic approximation, kinetic energy is given by \( K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). Using momentum conservation, the velocity ratio is \( v_2 = 2v_1 \). Substituting into the energy conservation equation, the total kinetic energy is:  
\[
K_1 + K_2 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2(2v_1)^2 = \frac{3}{2}m_1v_1^2.
\]
Solving for \( v_1^2 \), we find \( v_1^2 \approx 0.01 \). The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:  
\[
K_1 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 = 0.99 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Relativistic Case:
In the relativistic case, the total energy of each fragment includes a Lorentz factor \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). The total energy of the system is:  
\[
\gamma_1 m_1 + \gamma_2 m_2 = M.
\]
Using the momentum conservation equation \( \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2 \) and the velocity ratio \( v_2 = 2v_1 \), the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:  
\[
K_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1)m_1.
\]
After solving the relativistic equations, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is found to be approximately \( K_1 = 1.00 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( K_1 \):
The difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic kinetic energies of the more massive fragment is:  
\[
\Delta K_1 = K_1^{\text{relativistic}} - K_1^{\text{non-relativistic}} = 1.00 \, \text{GeV} - 0.99 \, \text{GeV} = 0.01 \, \text{GeV} = 10 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The difference between the correct relativistic \( T_1 \) and the classical non-relativistic \( T_1 \) is **10 MeV**.

**Answer: C**
