Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in electromagnetism. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t, given a moving point charge q. The setup is that the charge is moving along a trajectory s(t), and the field is observed at some later time t, which is greater than the time tr when the field was generated. They also mention the vector d, which is the displacement from where the field was generated to the observation point r. Oh, and the velocity of the charge at time tr is v.

I remember that when dealing with potentials for moving charges, you can't just use the static case formula anymore because the charge is moving, so you have to account for the motion's effects. I think this involves the concept of retarded time, where the field at a point depends on the state of the charge at an earlier time. But wait, the problem already mentions tr as the time when the field was generated, so I might not have to compute it, but just use it in the expressions.

So the scalar potential V for a static charge is (q)/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge to the observation point. But when the charge is moving, do I need to adjust this formula? I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the scalar potential remains the same because it's only dependent on the charge's position, but the vector potential would change due to the motion.

Wait, no. Actually, the retarded potential approach comes into play when calculating fields due to moving charges. So in that case, the scalar potential is indeed (q)/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance at time tr. But wait, the problem states that t > tr, so r would be the current distance, but the fields are based on the charge's state at tr. Hmm, but the options don't seem to directly involve r' but instead involve d and v.

Alternatively, let's think about the expressions for V and A when a charge is moving. I remember that the scalar potential V is given by the Coulomb potential at the retarded time. The vector potential A, on the other hand, involves the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.

Wait, the standard expression for the vector potential due to a moving charge q is A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (some function of the position and velocity). Let me recall: The vector potential is (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × something) divided by the cube of the distance or something like that. Oh, wait, no, I think for a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential is given by (μ₀ q v) / (4π) * (d / (d · v - c²) ) ), but I might be mixing up the terms.

Wait, let me think of the general form. The scalar potential V is (q)/(4πε₀) * [ 1/(r - (v t')/c²) ] evaluated at the retarded time t', but perhaps in this problem, it's given as time tr, so maybe the expression is simplified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the displacement vector d as being the vector from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point r.

Wait, the vector d is defined as the vector from where the field was generated (at tr) to r. So, when the charge was at position s(tr), the vector from s(tr) to r is d. So d = r - s(tr).

In that case, the distance between the charge at tr and the observation point is |d|, which I can denote as d. So, V would be (q)/(4πε₀ d), but wait, wait—does that make sense? Because the scalar potential is usually 1/r, not 1/d. Wait, no, because the charge is at a point, and the potential at r depends on the distance between the charge and r. So if d is the vector from the charge position to r, then the magnitude is |d|, so V would be q/(4πε₀ |d| ), right? But in the options, some have terms with d c and v dot d.

Looking back at the options, option C has V as (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)). Hmm, that's interesting. Wait, what's the reasoning here?

Maybe when the charge is moving, the potentials are affected by the motion. So the scalar potential is as before, but the vector potential depends on the velocity.

Wait, another approach: The potentials are determined using the retarded time. The scalar potential V is q/(4πε₀) times the potential at the retarded time. Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀ q)/(4π) times some function involving the velocity.

Wait, perhaps the potentials are given by V = (q)/(4πε₀) [1/(d - (v d t_r /c²)) ] or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps the expressions involve the term (d c - v · d), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the general expression for the scalar potential is V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) * [ 1/( |d| − (v · d)/c² ) ] ... Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, it's 1/(d − (v/c²) * t'), where t' is the time when the field was generated. But given that we're using d = r - s(tr), which is the vector from the charge to r at time tr, perhaps the denominator becomes d c - (v · d). Wait, let me think. The denominator could be (d · (c dt - v dt)) but that's probably not the right approach.

Alternatively, considering that the charge emits a signal (the field) at time tr. The observation happens at time t. The signal travels at speed c, so the time it takes is (t - tr) = (distance between charge at tr and r)/c. But this is not directly relevant to the potentials' expressions, perhaps.

Wait, going back: the potentials are determined by the charge's position and velocity at time tr. So for V, it's the Coulomb potential at that time. So V would be (q)/(4πε₀ d), where d is the distance between the charge and r at time tr. For A, the vector potential is (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v) / (d - (v/c²) * something).

Wait, I remember that for the vector potential A, it's given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (d')/(d'^3), where d' is the displacement vector from the charge to the field point. But wait, if the charge is moving, then the vector potential also depends on the velocity. Another possibility is that A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * [d/(d c - v · d)].

Wait, let me think of the exact expression. The vector potential for a moving charge is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) (v × something), but I'm not getting it right. Alternatively, I've seen the expression that A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) multiplied by ( (d) )/(d c - (v · d) ). So perhaps A = (μ₀ q v )/(4π) * [d/(d c - v·d)] or maybe [v/(d c - v·d)].

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)) , A is (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (d c - v·d) )

Option D: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c + v·d)) , A is same numerator but denominator (d c + v·d)

Option B: V is Coulomb potential, A is (v/c²) V.

Option A: A is v²/c² V.

So, which one is correct?

I think that the scalar potential V is (q)/(4π ε₀ d ), since it's the Coulomb potential. But wait, looking at the options, none of them have just V = q/(4π ε₀ d). Options A and B have 1/r, but C and D have terms with (d c ± v·d) in the denominator.

Wait, so perhaps I'm mistaken. Maybe for a moving charge, the scalar potential isn't just Coulomb's law but has a correction due to motion. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, from what I remember, the scalar potential is the same as the static case, but the vector potential depends on velocity. So V would be (q)/(4π ε₀ |d|), and A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * [d/(|d|^3 - (v·d)/c²) ] or something like that. Maybe I'm mixing up the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expressions involve (d c - v·d) in the denominator.

Wait, let me think about how to derive this. The potentials are determined using the Liénard potentials. The scalar potential V is given by:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) [ 1 / ( r - (s(t) + v Δt) ) ]

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, using the retarded time approach, the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) [ 1 / | r' - (v (t - t_r)) | ]

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me recall the retarded potential formulas.

The scalar potential V is given by:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) ∫ [ (1/|r - r'(t')) ) ] δ(t' - t + (|r - r'|)/c ) dt'

Which evaluates to (q)/(4πε₀ |d| ), where d is the displacement vector at the retarded time. But wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps V is (q)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)) ), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the vector potential. The vector potential A for a point charge is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) [ (v(t_r) ) / ( |d|^2 - (v · d)/c )  ) ] 

Wait, no, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should check the standard formulas.

Wait, I remember that the potentials for a moving charge are given by:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) [ 1 / ( r - (v (t - t_r) ) ) ]

Wait, that's not quite right. Alternatively, the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) [ 1/( r - r'(t_r) + (v (t - t_r) ) ) ]

Wait, no. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the displacement vector d. The vector from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point is d. Then, the denominator for V would be |d|, and for A, it would involve terms with v and d.

Wait, looking at the options, option C has V as (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)) and A as (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (d c - v·d) )

Hmm. Wait, the units might help. Let's analyze the options.

The scalar potential V should have units of volts (V), which is joules per coulomb (J/C). Let's check the units.

Option C: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)).

The numerator has q*c. The denominator has units of (distance * c - velocity * distance ), so units are (m^2/s - m^2/s) which is m^2/s. Wait, no: d has units of m, c is m/s, v is m/s. So d c: m*(m/s) = m²/s. v·d: (m/s)*m = m²/s. So the denominator is (m²/s) - (m²/s) which is okay, but the units would be m²/s.

So the entire denominator is m²/s. The numerator is q*c: C*(m/s).

So V's units: (C*(m/s)) / (m²/s) ) → (C * m/s ) * s/(m²) ) → C/(m) → correct, since V is (J/C) = (N m)/C = (kg m²/s² * m ) / C → kg m²/(s² C) ) → but wait, Coulomb is ampere-seconds (A s). So, Volts are kg m²/(s³ A). Hmm, maybe this isn't the best approach.

Alternatively, the denominator in option C is (d c - v·d) = c |d| - v·d, which has units of m²/s. The numerator is q c, units C m/s. So V has units (C m/s) / (m²/s) ) = C/(m). Which is correct because 1/(4πε₀) has units F/m (farads per meter), and farad is C²/(J), but maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, Coulomb's law V = q/(4πε₀ r) gives V in volts when q is in coulombs and r in meters. So the other options must have the same structure.

Looking at option C: V is (q c) / [4πε₀ (d c - v·d) ]

Wait, but that would have units (C * m/s) / ( (m * m/s) ) ) → (C m/s) / (m²/s) ) → C/(m), which is correct. So units-wise, that's okay.

Similarly, the vector potential A has units of tesla meters (T·m). Looking at option C's A: (μ₀ q c v) / [4π (d c - v·d) ]

μ₀ has units of H/m (henrys per meter), which is kg·m/(s²·A²). So let's compute the units for A in option C:

μ₀ q c v → (H/m) * C * (m/s) * (m/s) → (kg·m/(s²·A²·m)) ) * C * (m/s)² → kg/(s²·A²) ) * (C * m²/s²) → Hmm, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, since μ₀ ε₀ c² = 1, perhaps we can relate the units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the standard expressions. The vector potential due to a moving charge is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (d) / (d² - (v·d)/c² ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I think the correct expressions are:

V = (q)/(4πε₀) [ 1/(d c - v·d) ) ] → but wait, that would be (q)/(4πε₀) * 1/(d c - v·d). Wait, that can't be right because the units wouldn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - v·d), which is (m * m/s - m * m/s ) → same as m²/s.

Wait, but V should be volts, which is J/C = (N·m)/C = (kg·m²/s² · m ) / C → kg·m²/(s² C). Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Another approach: I remember that for a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential is proportional to v, and the scalar potential is as in Coulomb's law. So looking at the options, options B and C have A proportional to v. So options A and D are probably incorrect.

Option B: A is (v / c²) V. So substituting V, A would be (v / c²) * [ q/(4π ε₀ r) ]

But units-wise, that would be (m/s) / (m²/s²) ) * (C/(4π ε₀ m) ) → (m/s) * (C s²/m²) ) → C s/(m). But vector potential A has units of T·m (tesla meters). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, Tesla is kg/(s²·A), so T·m is kg·m/(s²·A). Let me compute the units for option B's A:

A = (v / c²) * V → (m/s) / (m²/s²) ) * (V) → (s/m) * V. Since V is J/C → (kg m²/(s² C)) → So A's units would be (s/m) * (kg m²/(s² C)) ) = kg m/(s C). Hmm, but Tesla·meter is kg·m/(s²·A), and since A is Coulombs per second, so kg·m/(s² (C/s)) ) → kg·m·s/(s² C) ) → kg m/(s C), which matches. So the units for option B's A are correct.

But what about the scalar potential? It's given as (q)/(4πε₀ r), which is correct for a static charge. But when the charge is moving, does the scalar potential change? Because in the case where the charge is moving, the electric field isn't just due to the charge's current position but also its motion. However, I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is still given by the Coulomb potential at the retarded time, which would be q/(4πε₀ |d| ), but in the options, option B's V is just the Coulomb form. So perhaps option B is correct in terms of V.

But wait, I thought the vector potential A would depend on the velocity. So if option B's A is (v/c²) V, substituting V, that would give A = (v q)/(4 π ε₀ c² r ). But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, I think the correct expression for the vector potential when a charge is moving is A = (μ₀ q v)/(4 π) * (d) / (d² - (v·d)/c²), but I'm not certain. So looking back at the options, option C's A is (μ₀ q c v ) / [4π (d c - v·d) ]

Wait, let me see. The denominator in option C is (d c - v·d), which is c|d| - (v·d). But for a general d, v·d is just the projection. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the vector potential is often expressed as A = (μ₀ q v)/(4 π) * (d) / (d² - (v·d)/c² ), where d is the vector from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point r. So that would be d = r - s(tr), which is the vector d as given in the problem.

If that's the case, then the denominator is d² - (v·d)/c², which is |d|^2 - (v·d)/c². But in the options, the denominators are (d c - v·d), which is c |d| - v·d. Hmm, not exactly the same.

Wait, perhaps there's an alternative expression. Let me think about the denominator:

d² - (v·d)/c² = |d|^2 [ 1 - (v·d̂)/(c² |d|) ) ]

But I'm not sure how that relates to the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator in option C is (d c - v·d) = c d - v·d. Which would be a vector expression. Wait, no, because d is a vector, so (d c) would be a vector multiplied by a scalar, which is correct. Hmm, but the denominator in option C is a scalar, so it would be (d c) · something?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me clarify. The denominator in option C is written as (dc - d·v), but I think it's actually (d c - v·d ), but since d and v are vectors, to make this a scalar, it would be d c - (v · d), which is (c |d| - v·d ), a scalar. So the denominator is a scalar quantity: c |d| - (v · d). 

Hmm, so if my expression for A is (μ₀ q v)/(4 π) * [d ] / (d² - (v·d)/c² ), then I'm not sure how that compares to the options provided.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Lorentz transformation or how potentials transform. Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are derived using a different approach.

Another thought: The vector potential A is often proportional to (v × something), but in this case, perhaps it's simpler.

Wait, let me think of the SI units again. The vector potential A has units of T·m. The expression in option C's A is (μ₀ q c v ) / [4π (d c - v·d) ]

μ₀ has units of H/m = kg·m/(s²·A²). So let's compute the units for option C's A:

( kg·m/(s²·A²) ) * (C) * (m/s) * (m/s) ) / ( (m * m/s ) - (m/s * m) ) )

Wait, the denominator has units of m²/s. So numerator: (kg·m/(s² A²)) ) * C * (m/s) * (m/s) → (kg·m * C * m² ) / (s^4 A² )

Denominator: m²/s → s/m².

So overall units: [ kg·m^3 C ) / (s^4 A² ) ] * [ s/m² ] → (kg m^3 C s ) / (s^4 A² m²) ) → (kg m^2 C ) / ( s^3 A² )

But Tesla is kg/(s² A), so Tesla·meter is (kg/(s² A)) * m = kg m/(s² A). Hmm, but the computed units here are (kg m² C ) / (s^3 A² ), which doesn't match. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps my approach to the units is getting me stuck. Let me think differently.

The correct potentials should satisfy Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field via E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t. The vector potential contributes to the magnetic field via B = ∇ × A.

But perhaps solving this through Maxwell's equations isn't the quickest approach while trying to remember the formulas.

Wait, another memory: The vector potential due to a moving charge is A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (d) / (d² - (v·d)/c² )

In this expression, d is the vector from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point r. So d = r - s(tr).

So if I denote d as the displacement vector, then the denominator is |d|² - (v · d)/c².

But looking at the options, none of them directly match this. Let me see:

Option C's denominator is (d c - v·d) → which is c |d| - v·d.

Wait, but |d| is sqrt(d · d). So if I factor c from the denominator:

d c - v · d = c |d| ( 1 - (v · d̂)/(c) )

But I'm not sure how that connects.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator in the expression I remember can be rewritten. Let me compute d² - (v·d)/c² = |d|^2 (1 - (v · d̂)/(c |d|) ) )

But I don't see a direct connection to the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another approach: Let me think of the potentials in the context of wave equations. The potentials should satisfy the wave equation because electromagnetic waves propagate at speed c. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, another thought: when the charge is moving, the potentials should account for the motion, but for potentials, the scalar potential V is the same as static if no current is present, but the vector potential A is non-zero when there's motion. So the correct V would be the Coulomb potential, and A would involve the velocity.

Looking at the options, option B's V is correct as Coulomb's law, and A is (v/c²) V. So let's see:

V = q/(4πε₀ r)

A = (v/c²) * V = (v q)/(4πε₀ c² r )

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Because in Maxwell's equations, the vector potential also depends on the current. Wait, but for a point charge, the current is J = q v.

Wait, the Ampère-Maxwell law says that the curl of B is μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t ). But the vector potential A is related to B via B = ∇ × A. So perhaps the vector potential is more directly connected to the current.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (d) / (d² - (v·d)/c² ), but I can't see any option that matches this exactly.

Looking back at the options, option C's A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - v·d ) )

Hmm, perhaps if I factor out c from the denominator, I can express it as (d c - v·d ) = c (d - (v/c) · d ). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when the charge is moving, the potentials are:

V = (q)/(4π ε₀) [ 1/( |d| ) ]

A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) [ d / ( |d|^2 - (v·d)/c^2 ) ]

But none of the options directly match this. Let me look again.

Option C: V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - v·d) )

Wait, that would make V's denominator (d c - v · d ), which is (c |d| - v·d ). So, if the numerator is q c, then V would be (q c ) / [4 π ε₀ (c |d| - v·d ) )

But in the static case, when v is zero, this would become (q c )/(4 π ε₀ c |d| ) ) → q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ), which is correct. So if v is zero, V reduces to the Coulomb potential. So that seems correct for V in option C.

Similarly, for the vector potential A in option C: (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (d c - v·d ) )

When v is zero, A becomes zero, which is correct because if the charge isn't moving, there's no vector potential. So that also seems correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that V would be (q)/(4 pi eps0 |d| ), but in option C, V is (q c )/(4 pi eps0 (d c - v·d) ), which when v is zero, gives V = (q c)/(4 pi eps0 c |d| ) ) = q/(4 pi eps0 |d| ), which is correct. So this makes me think that option C is correct.

Similarly, the vector potential A in option C when v is zero is zero, which is correct because a stationary charge doesn't produce a vector potential. So that seems to fit.

So putting this together, option C would be correct because when v is zero, V and A take their correct static forms, and when the charge is moving, the expressions account for the velocity.

Wait, but wait, the vector potential in option C is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi (d c - v·d) ), but I thought the correct expression should involve d in the numerator and (d² - (v·d)/c² ) in the denominator. But perhaps this is a different form, perhaps due to some algebraic manipulation.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator can be factored as (d c - v·d ) = c (d - (v/c) · d ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps when you factor out c from the denominator, something cancels.

Wait, let me compute d c - v·d. Since d is the displacement vector from the charge to the observation point, its magnitude is |d| = r, the distance between the charge and the observation point. The term v·d is the projection of v onto d, which is v_r |d|, where v_r is the radial component of v.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Another angle: The denominator in option C's V is (d c - v·d ), which is c |d| - v·d. So if we write this as c (|d| - (v·d)/c ), then the denominator becomes c times (|d| - (v·d)/c ). So V can be rewritten as (q c )/(4 pi eps0 c (|d| - (v·d)/c )) ) → q/(4 pi eps0 (|d| - (v·d)/c )) )

Which would be q/(4 pi eps0 (|d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c )) ), since d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d. So this becomes q/(4 pi eps0 |d| ) * 1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c )

But this seems to be an approximation only valid when (v·d̂) is much smaller than c, but perhaps that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator in the V expression in option C can be written as (c |d| - v·d ), which for small velocities (v << c), would approach the static case.

So given all this, and considering that option C's expressions correctly reduce to the static case when v=0, I think option C is the correct one.

To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the given options based on the principles of electromagnetism. The charge moves with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \), and the displacement vector \( \vec{d} \) is defined as the vector from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \). The goal is to identify the correct expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) that satisfy the conditions of the problem.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), which is the Coulomb potential for a static charge.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\vec{v}^2}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \).  
   This expression for \( \vec{A} \) is incorrect because the vector potential depends linearly on \( \vec{v} \), not \( \vec{v}^2 \). Thus, this option is invalid.

2. **Option B**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), which is correct for the scalar potential of a static charge.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \).  
   While this form is dimensionally consistent, it does not correctly account for the dependence of \( \vec{A} \) on the displacement vector \( \vec{d} \) and the velocity \( \vec{v} \). Thus, this option is also invalid.

3. **Option C**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   Here, \( dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) appears in both the scalar and vector potential expressions. When \( \vec{v} = 0 \) (static charge), \( V \) reduces to the Coulomb potential \( \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 |d|} \), and \( \vec{A} \) becomes zero, which is consistent with the expected behavior. This option aligns with the correct form of the potentials for a moving charge.

4. **Option D**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (dc + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (dc + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   The denominator \( dc + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is unphysical because adding \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) to \( dc \) does not correspond to the correct retarded potential formulation. Thus, this option is invalid.

### Conclusion:
Option C is the correct choice because it satisfies the conditions of the problem, reduces to the static case when \( \vec{v} = 0 \), and correctly incorporates the effects of the charge's motion through the displacement vector \( \vec{d} \) and velocity \( \vec{v} \).

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in electromagnetism. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t, given a moving point charge q. The setup is that the charge is moving along a trajectory s(t), and the field is observed at some later time t, which is greater than the time tr when the field was generated. They also mention the vector d, which is the displacement from where the field was generated to the observation point r. Oh, and the velocity of the charge at time tr is v.

I remember that when dealing with potentials for moving charges, you can't just use the static case formula anymore because the charge is moving, so you have to account for the motion's effects. I think this involves the concept of retarded time, where the field at a point depends on the state of the charge at an earlier time. But wait, the problem already mentions tr as the time when the field was generated, so I might not have to compute it, but just use it in the expressions.

So the scalar potential V for a static charge is (q)/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge to the observation point. But when the charge is moving, do I need to adjust this formula? I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the scalar potential remains the same because it's only dependent on the charge's position, but the vector potential would change due to the motion.

Wait, no. Actually, the retarded potential approach comes into play when calculating fields due to moving charges. So in that case, the scalar potential is indeed (q)/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance at time tr. But wait, the problem states that t > tr, so r would be the current distance, but the fields are based on the charge's state at tr. Hmm, but the options don't seem to directly involve r' but instead involve d and v.

Alternatively, let's think about the expressions for V and A when a charge is moving. I remember that the scalar potential V is given by the Coulomb potential at the retarded time. The vector potential A, on the other hand, involves the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.

Wait, the standard expression for the vector potential due to a moving charge q is A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (some function of the position and velocity). Let me recall: The vector potential is (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × something) divided by the cube of the distance or something like that. Oh, wait, no, I think for a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential is given by (μ₀ q v) / (4π) * (d / (d · v - c²) ) ), but I might be mixing up the terms.

Wait, let me think of the general form. The scalar potential V is (q)/(4πε₀) * [ 1/(r - (v t')/c²) ] evaluated at the retarded time t', but perhaps in this problem, it's given as time tr, so maybe the expression is simplified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the displacement vector d as being the vector from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point r.

Wait, the vector d is defined as the vector from where the field was generated (at tr) to r. So, when the charge was at position s(tr), the vector from s(tr) to r is d. So d = r - s(tr).

In that case, the distance between the charge at tr and the observation point is |d|, which I can denote as d. So, V would be (q)/(4πε₀ d), but wait, wait—does that make sense? Because the scalar potential is usually 1/r, not 1/d. Wait, no, because the charge is at a point, and the potential at r depends on the distance between the charge and r. So if d is the vector from the charge position to r, then the magnitude is |d|, so V would be q/(4πε₀ |d| ), right? But in the options, some have terms with d c and v dot d.

Looking back at the options, option C has V as (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)). Hmm, that's interesting. Wait, what's the reasoning here?

Maybe when the charge is moving, the potentials are affected by the motion. So the scalar potential is as before, but the vector potential depends on the velocity.

Wait, another approach: The potentials are determined using the retarded time. The scalar potential V is q/(4πε₀) times the potential at the retarded time. Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀ q)/(4π) times some function involving the velocity.

Wait, perhaps the potentials are given by V = (q)/(4πε₀) [1/(d - (v d t_r /c²)) ] or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps the expressions involve the term (d c - v · d), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the general expression for the scalar potential is V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) * [ 1/( |d| − (v · d)/c² ) ] ... Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, it's 1/(d − (v/c²) * t'), where t' is the time when the field was generated. But given that we're using d = r - s(tr), which is the vector from the charge to r at time tr, perhaps the denominator becomes d c - (v · d). Wait, let me think. The denominator could be (d · (c dt - v dt)) but that's probably not the right approach.

Alternatively, considering that the charge emits a signal (the field) at time tr. The observation happens at time t. The signal travels at speed c, so the time it takes is (t - tr) = (distance between charge at tr and r)/c. But this is not directly relevant to the potentials' expressions, perhaps.

Wait, going back: the potentials are determined by the charge's position and velocity at time tr. So for V, it's the Coulomb potential at that time. So V would be (q)/(4πε₀ d), where d is the distance between the charge and r at time tr. For A, the vector potential is (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v) / (d - (v/c²) * something).

Wait, I remember that for the vector potential A, it's given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (d')/(d'^3), where d' is the displacement vector from the charge to the field point. But wait, if the charge is moving, then the vector potential also depends on the velocity. Another possibility is that A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * [d/(d c - v · d)].

Wait, let me think of the exact expression. The vector potential for a moving charge is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) (v × something), but I'm not getting it right. Alternatively, I've seen the expression that A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) multiplied by ( (d) )/(d c - (v · d) ). So perhaps A = (μ₀ q v )/(4π) * [d/(d c - v·d)] or maybe [v/(d c - v·d)].

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)) , A is (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (d c - v·d) )

Option D: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c + v·d)) , A is same numerator but denominator (d c + v·d)

Option B: V is Coulomb potential, A is (v/c²) V.

Option A: A is v²/c² V.

So, which one is correct?

I think that the scalar potential V is (q)/(4π ε₀ d ), since it's the Coulomb potential. But wait, looking at the options, none of them have just V = q/(4π ε₀ d). Options A and B have 1/r, but C and D have terms with (d c ± v·d) in the denominator.

Wait, so perhaps I'm mistaken. Maybe for a moving charge, the scalar potential isn't just Coulomb's law but has a correction due to motion. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, from what I remember, the scalar potential is the same as the static case, but the vector potential depends on velocity. So V would be (q)/(4π ε₀ |d|), and A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * [d/(|d|^3 - (v·d)/c²) ] or something like that. Maybe I'm mixing up the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expressions involve (d c - v·d) in the denominator.

Wait, let me think about how to derive this. The potentials are determined using the Liénard potentials. The scalar potential V is given by:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) [ 1 / ( r - (s(t) + v Δt) ) ]

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, using the retarded time approach, the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) [ 1 / | r' - (v (t - t_r)) | ]

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me recall the retarded potential formulas.

The scalar potential V is given by:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) ∫ [ (1/|r - r'(t')) ) ] δ(t' - t + (|r - r'|)/c ) dt'

Which evaluates to (q)/(4πε₀ |d| ), where d is the displacement vector at the retarded time. But wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps V is (q)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)) ), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the vector potential. The vector potential A for a point charge is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) [ (v(t_r) ) / ( |d|^2 - (v · d)/c )  ) ] 

Wait, no, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should check the standard formulas.

Wait, I remember that the potentials for a moving charge are given by:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) [ 1 / ( r - (v (t - t_r) ) ) ]

Wait, that's not quite right. Alternatively, the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) [ 1/( r - r'(t_r) + (v (t - t_r) ) ) ]

Wait, no. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the displacement vector d. The vector from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point is d. Then, the denominator for V would be |d|, and for A, it would involve terms with v and d.

Wait, looking at the options, option C has V as (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)) and A as (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (d c - v·d) )

Hmm. Wait, the units might help. Let's analyze the options.

The scalar potential V should have units of volts (V), which is joules per coulomb (J/C). Let's check the units.

Option C: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)).

The numerator has q*c. The denominator has units of (distance * c - velocity * distance ), so units are (m^2/s - m^2/s) which is m^2/s. Wait, no: d has units of m, c is m/s, v is m/s. So d c: m*(m/s) = m²/s. v·d: (m/s)*m = m²/s. So the denominator is (m²/s) - (m²/s) which is okay, but the units would be m²/s.

So the entire denominator is m²/s. The numerator is q*c: C*(m/s).

So V's units: (C*(m/s)) / (m²/s) ) → (C * m/s ) * s/(m²) ) → C/(m) → correct, since V is (J/C) = (N m)/C = (kg m²/s² * m ) / C → kg m²/(s² C) ) → but wait, Coulomb is ampere-seconds (A s). So, Volts are kg m²/(s³ A). Hmm, maybe this isn't the best approach.

Alternatively, the denominator in option C is (d c - v·d) = c |d| - v·d, which has units of m²/s. The numerator is q c, units C m/s. So V has units (C m/s) / (m²/s) ) = C/(m). Which is correct because 1/(4πε₀) has units F/m (farads per meter), and farad is C²/(J), but maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, Coulomb's law V = q/(4πε₀ r) gives V in volts when q is in coulombs and r in meters. So the other options must have the same structure.

Looking at option C: V is (q c) / [4πε₀ (d c - v·d) ]

Wait, but that would have units (C * m/s) / ( (m * m/s) ) ) → (C m/s) / (m²/s) ) → C/(m), which is correct. So units-wise, that's okay.

Similarly, the vector potential A has units of tesla meters (T·m). Looking at option C's A: (μ₀ q c v) / [4π (d c - v·d) ]

μ₀ has units of H/m (henrys per meter), which is kg·m/(s²·A²). So let's compute the units for A in option C:

μ₀ q c v → (H/m) * C * (m/s) * (m/s) → (kg·m/(s²·A²·m)) ) * C * (m/s)² → kg/(s²·A²) ) * (C * m²/s²) → Hmm, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, since μ₀ ε₀ c² = 1, perhaps we can relate the units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the standard expressions. The vector potential due to a moving charge is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (d) / (d² - (v·d)/c² ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I think the correct expressions are:

V = (q)/(4πε₀) [ 1/(d c - v·d) ) ] → but wait, that would be (q)/(4πε₀) * 1/(d c - v·d). Wait, that can't be right because the units wouldn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - v·d), which is (m * m/s - m * m/s ) → same as m²/s.

Wait, but V should be volts, which is J/C = (N·m)/C = (kg·m²/s² · m ) / C → kg·m²/(s² C). Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Another approach: I remember that for a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential is proportional to v, and the scalar potential is as in Coulomb's law. So looking at the options, options B and C have A proportional to v. So options A and D are probably incorrect.

Option B: A is (v / c²) V. So substituting V, A would be (v / c²) * [ q/(4π ε₀ r) ]

But units-wise, that would be (m/s) / (m²/s²) ) * (C/(4π ε₀ m) ) → (m/s) * (C s²/m²) ) → C s/(m). But vector potential A has units of T·m (tesla meters). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, Tesla is kg/(s²·A), so T·m is kg·m/(s²·A). Let me compute the units for option B's A:

A = (v / c²) * V → (m/s) / (m²/s²) ) * (V) → (s/m) * V. Since V is J/C → (kg m²/(s² C)) → So A's units would be (s/m) * (kg m²/(s² C)) ) = kg m/(s C). Hmm, but Tesla·meter is kg·m/(s²·A), and since A is Coulombs per second, so kg·m/(s² (C/s)) ) → kg·m·s/(s² C) ) → kg m/(s C), which matches. So the units for option B's A are correct.

But what about the scalar potential? It's given as (q)/(4πε₀ r), which is correct for a static charge. But when the charge is moving, does the scalar potential change? Because in the case where the charge is moving, the electric field isn't just due to the charge's current position but also its motion. However, I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is still given by the Coulomb potential at the retarded time, which would be q/(4πε₀ |d| ), but in the options, option B's V is just the Coulomb form. So perhaps option B is correct in terms of V.

But wait, I thought the vector potential A would depend on the velocity. So if option B's A is (v/c²) V, substituting V, that would give A = (v q)/(4 π ε₀ c² r ). But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, I think the correct expression for the vector potential when a charge is moving is A = (μ₀ q v)/(4 π) * (d) / (d² - (v·d)/c²), but I'm not certain. So looking back at the options, option C's A is (μ₀ q c v ) / [4π (d c - v·d) ]

Wait, let me see. The denominator in option C is (d c - v·d), which is c|d| - (v·d). But for a general d, v·d is just the projection. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the vector potential is often expressed as A = (μ₀ q v)/(4 π) * (d) / (d² - (v·d)/c² ), where d is the vector from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point r. So that would be d = r - s(tr), which is the vector d as given in the problem.

If that's the case, then the denominator is d² - (v·d)/c², which is |d|^2 - (v·d)/c². But in the options, the denominators are (d c - v·d), which is c |d| - v·d. Hmm, not exactly the same.

Wait, perhaps there's an alternative expression. Let me think about the denominator:

d² - (v·d)/c² = |d|^2 [ 1 - (v·d̂)/(c² |d|) ) ]

But I'm not sure how that relates to the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator in option C is (d c - v·d) = c d - v·d. Which would be a vector expression. Wait, no, because d is a vector, so (d c) would be a vector multiplied by a scalar, which is correct. Hmm, but the denominator in option C is a scalar, so it would be (d c) · something?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me clarify. The denominator in option C is written as (dc - d·v), but I think it's actually (d c - v·d ), but since d and v are vectors, to make this a scalar, it would be d c - (v · d), which is (c |d| - v·d ), a scalar. So the denominator is a scalar quantity: c |d| - (v · d). 

Hmm, so if my expression for A is (μ₀ q v)/(4 π) * [d ] / (d² - (v·d)/c² ), then I'm not sure how that compares to the options provided.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Lorentz transformation or how potentials transform. Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are derived using a different approach.

Another thought: The vector potential A is often proportional to (v × something), but in this case, perhaps it's simpler.

Wait, let me think of the SI units again. The vector potential A has units of T·m. The expression in option C's A is (μ₀ q c v ) / [4π (d c - v·d) ]

μ₀ has units of H/m = kg·m/(s²·A²). So let's compute the units for option C's A:

( kg·m/(s²·A²) ) * (C) * (m/s) * (m/s) ) / ( (m * m/s ) - (m/s * m) ) )

Wait, the denominator has units of m²/s. So numerator: (kg·m/(s² A²)) ) * C * (m/s) * (m/s) → (kg·m * C * m² ) / (s^4 A² )

Denominator: m²/s → s/m².

So overall units: [ kg·m^3 C ) / (s^4 A² ) ] * [ s/m² ] → (kg m^3 C s ) / (s^4 A² m²) ) → (kg m^2 C ) / ( s^3 A² )

But Tesla is kg/(s² A), so Tesla·meter is (kg/(s² A)) * m = kg m/(s² A). Hmm, but the computed units here are (kg m² C ) / (s^3 A² ), which doesn't match. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps my approach to the units is getting me stuck. Let me think differently.

The correct potentials should satisfy Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field via E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t. The vector potential contributes to the magnetic field via B = ∇ × A.

But perhaps solving this through Maxwell's equations isn't the quickest approach while trying to remember the formulas.

Wait, another memory: The vector potential due to a moving charge is A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (d) / (d² - (v·d)/c² )

In this expression, d is the vector from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point r. So d = r - s(tr).

So if I denote d as the displacement vector, then the denominator is |d|² - (v · d)/c².

But looking at the options, none of them directly match this. Let me see:

Option C's denominator is (d c - v·d) → which is c |d| - v·d.

Wait, but |d| is sqrt(d · d). So if I factor c from the denominator:

d c - v · d = c |d| ( 1 - (v · d̂)/(c) )

But I'm not sure how that connects.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator in the expression I remember can be rewritten. Let me compute d² - (v·d)/c² = |d|^2 (1 - (v · d̂)/(c |d|) ) )

But I don't see a direct connection to the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another approach: Let me think of the potentials in the context of wave equations. The potentials should satisfy the wave equation because electromagnetic waves propagate at speed c. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, another thought: when the charge is moving, the potentials should account for the motion, but for potentials, the scalar potential V is the same as static if no current is present, but the vector potential A is non-zero when there's motion. So the correct V would be the Coulomb potential, and A would involve the velocity.

Looking at the options, option B's V is correct as Coulomb's law, and A is (v/c²) V. So let's see:

V = q/(4πε₀ r)

A = (v/c²) * V = (v q)/(4πε₀ c² r )

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Because in Maxwell's equations, the vector potential also depends on the current. Wait, but for a point charge, the current is J = q v.

Wait, the Ampère-Maxwell law says that the curl of B is μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t ). But the vector potential A is related to B via B = ∇ × A. So perhaps the vector potential is more directly connected to the current.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (d) / (d² - (v·d)/c² ), but I can't see any option that matches this exactly.

Looking back at the options, option C's A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - v·d ) )

Hmm, perhaps if I factor out c from the denominator, I can express it as (d c - v·d ) = c (d - (v/c) · d ). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when the charge is moving, the potentials are:

V = (q)/(4π ε₀) [ 1/( |d| ) ]

A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) [ d / ( |d|^2 - (v·d)/c^2 ) ]

But none of the options directly match this. Let me look again.

Option C: V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - v·d) )

Wait, that would make V's denominator (d c - v · d ), which is (c |d| - v·d ). So, if the numerator is q c, then V would be (q c ) / [4 π ε₀ (c |d| - v·d ) )

But in the static case, when v is zero, this would become (q c )/(4 π ε₀ c |d| ) ) → q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ), which is correct. So if v is zero, V reduces to the Coulomb potential. So that seems correct for V in option C.

Similarly, for the vector potential A in option C: (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (d c - v·d ) )

When v is zero, A becomes zero, which is correct because if the charge isn't moving, there's no vector potential. So that also seems correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that V would be (q)/(4 pi eps0 |d| ), but in option C, V is (q c )/(4 pi eps0 (d c - v·d) ), which when v is zero, gives V = (q c)/(4 pi eps0 c |d| ) ) = q/(4 pi eps0 |d| ), which is correct. So this makes me think that option C is correct.

Similarly, the vector potential A in option C when v is zero is zero, which is correct because a stationary charge doesn't produce a vector potential. So that seems to fit.

So putting this together, option C would be correct because when v is zero, V and A take their correct static forms, and when the charge is moving, the expressions account for the velocity.

Wait, but wait, the vector potential in option C is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi (d c - v·d) ), but I thought the correct expression should involve d in the numerator and (d² - (v·d)/c² ) in the denominator. But perhaps this is a different form, perhaps due to some algebraic manipulation.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator can be factored as (d c - v·d ) = c (d - (v/c) · d ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps when you factor out c from the denominator, something cancels.

Wait, let me compute d c - v·d. Since d is the displacement vector from the charge to the observation point, its magnitude is |d| = r, the distance between the charge and the observation point. The term v·d is the projection of v onto d, which is v_r |d|, where v_r is the radial component of v.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Another angle: The denominator in option C's V is (d c - v·d ), which is c |d| - v·d. So if we write this as c (|d| - (v·d)/c ), then the denominator becomes c times (|d| - (v·d)/c ). So V can be rewritten as (q c )/(4 pi eps0 c (|d| - (v·d)/c )) ) → q/(4 pi eps0 (|d| - (v·d)/c )) )

Which would be q/(4 pi eps0 (|d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c )) ), since d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d. So this becomes q/(4 pi eps0 |d| ) * 1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c )

But this seems to be an approximation only valid when (v·d̂) is much smaller than c, but perhaps that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator in the V expression in option C can be written as (c |d| - v·d ), which for small velocities (v << c), would approach the static case.

So given all this, and considering that option C's expressions correctly reduce to the static case when v=0, I think option C is the correct one.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the given options based on the principles of electromagnetism. The charge moves with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \), and the displacement vector \( \vec{d} \) is defined as the vector from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \). The goal is to identify the correct expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) that satisfy the conditions of the problem.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), which is the Coulomb potential for a static charge.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\vec{v}^2}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \).  
   This expression for \( \vec{A} \) is incorrect because the vector potential depends linearly on \( \vec{v} \), not \( \vec{v}^2 \). Thus, this option is invalid.

2. **Option B**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), which is correct for the scalar potential of a static charge.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \).  
   While this form is dimensionally consistent, it does not correctly account for the dependence of \( \vec{A} \) on the displacement vector \( \vec{d} \) and the velocity \( \vec{v} \). Thus, this option is also invalid.

3. **Option C**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   Here, \( dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) appears in both the scalar and vector potential expressions. When \( \vec{v} = 0 \) (static charge), \( V \) reduces to the Coulomb potential \( \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 |d|} \), and \( \vec{A} \) becomes zero, which is consistent with the expected behavior. This option aligns with the correct form of the potentials for a moving charge.

4. **Option D**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (dc + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (dc + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   The denominator \( dc + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is unphysical because adding \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) to \( dc \) does not correspond to the correct retarded potential formulation. Thus, this option is invalid.

### Conclusion:
Option C is the correct choice because it satisfies the conditions of the problem, reduces to the static case when \( \vec{v} = 0 \), and correctly incorporates the effects of the charge's motion through the displacement vector \( \vec{d} \) and velocity \( \vec{v} \).

**Answer: C**
