Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li with 3 neutrons would make it lithium-6, because lithium typically has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make the mass number 6. So its atomic mass is about 6 atomic mass units (u).

The question is about relativistic energy. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just kinetic; it includes the rest mass energy as well. Since the nucleus is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (0.96c), relativistic effects are important here.

I think the total energy of the particle is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me write that down:

E = γ * m₀c²

Where m₀ is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.

So first, I need to calculate gamma for v = 0.96c. Let's compute that. 

Calculating gamma:
v = 0.96c
v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
Taking the square root: sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28
So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714

Wait, let me double-check that square root. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So that part is correct.

So gamma ≈ 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the lithium nucleus. The rest mass is 6 u. I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So m₀c² is 6 * 931.5 MeV.

Calculating that:

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV. That's 5.589 GeV.

Then, the total energy is gamma times this:

E = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV ≈ let's compute that.

3.5714 *5 = 17.857
3.5714 *0.589 = let's compute step by step.

0.5 *3.5714 = 1.7857
0.08 *3.5714 ≈ 0.2857
0.009 *3.5714 ≈ 0.0321
Adding those: 1.7857 + 0.2857 = 2.0714; +0.0321 = 2.0714+0.0321≈2.1035
So total is 17.857 + 2.1035 ≈ 19.96 GeV.

Wait, but that approximation might be a bit off. Maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, 5.589 *3.5714. Let's compute 5.589 *3.5714.

I can do this step by step.

First, 5 *3.5714 =17.857
Then 0.589 *3.5714: 

0.5 *3.5714 =1.7857
0.08 *3.5714 =0.2857
0.009 *3.5714≈0.0321
So add those: 1.7857 +0.2857=2.0714 +0.0321=2.1035

So total is 17.857 +2.1035=19.9605 GeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option C: 20.132 GeV, and option D: 21.419 GeV. Hmm, but 19.96 is closer to 20 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me recheck that.

v = 0.96c → v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c² → v²/c² = 0.9216.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1 / sqrt(0.0784) using more precise methods.

Wait, 0.0784 is the value, so sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. Because 0.28 *0.28 = 0.0784. So yes, gamma is exactly 3.57142857... So that's correct.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps the mass of the lithium nucleus is more accurately calculated. Because 6 u is just an approximation. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, maybe the exact value of the mass is needed. Let me think about it. The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus: Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons. Each proton is about 1.007276 u, and neutron is about 1.008665 u.

So for Li-6: 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = ?

3 *1.007276 = 3.021828
3 *1.008665 = 3.025995
Adding: 3.021828 +3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

So the exact rest mass is 6.047823 u. Then, m₀c² is 6.047823 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

So 6.047823 *931.5 = let me calculate that.

Compute 6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.047823 *931.5 ≈ let's compute:

0.047823 *900 =43.0407

0.047823 *31.5 = approx 1.5083

Total ≈43.0407 +1.5083 ≈44.549 MeV.

So total m₀c² is 5589 +44.549 = 5633.549 MeV, which is 5.633549 GeV.

So now, E = gamma * m₀c² = 3.57142857 *5.633549 GeV.

Let me compute that precisely.

3.57142857 *5.633549.

Let me compute 3 *5.633549 = 16.900647

0.57142857 *5.633549.

0.5 *5.633549 =2.8167745

0.07142857 *5.633549 ≈ let's compute 5.633549 *0.07142857.

Wait, 0.07142857 is approximately 1/14, so 5.633549 /14 ≈0.402396.

So 0.07142857 *5.633549 ≈ 0.402396.

So 0.57142857 *5.633549 ≈2.8167745 +0.402396 ≈3.2191705.

Adding that to the 3*5.633549 (16.900647):

16.900647 +3.2191705 ≈20.1198175 GeV.

So approximately 20.1198 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, I should check the calculation again for more precision.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.633549 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 3.57142857 *5.633549:

Let me break it down:

5.633549 = 5 + 0.633549

So:

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.633549:

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142

3.57142857 *0.033549 = ?

0.03 *3.57142857 ≈0.107142857

0.003549 *3.57142857 ≈

0.003 *3.57142857 ≈0.0107142857

0.000549 *3.57142857 ≈approx 0.001954.

So adding these:

0.107142857 +0.0107142857=0.1178571427 +0.001954≈0.119811.

So total 3.57142857 *0.033549 ≈0.119811.

So 3.57142857 *0.633549 ≈2.142857142 +0.119811≈2.262668.

Adding to the 17.85714285:

17.85714285 +2.262668 ≈20.11981085 GeV.

So about 20.1198 GeV, which is approximately 20.12 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to our calculated 20.1198. The slight difference could be due to more precise values of the atomic masses or the speed. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered relativistic kinetic energy instead of total energy. Wait, wait a second! I think I might have made a mistake here.

Wait, the question asks for the energy of the RHIC. Is that the kinetic energy or the total energy (rest + kinetic)?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Because in particle physics, the energy given is often the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. But in colliders, I think the specified energy is usually the kinetic energy per particle. Or wait, no—often, the total energy is given. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about this.

Wait, the RHIC accelerates heavy ions like gold nuclei to a certain energy. The energy given is usually the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy? I think in accelerator physics, the energy given is the kinetic energy. Because the rest mass is much smaller than the kinetic energy at such high speeds.

Wait, but in our calculation, we computed the total energy as gamma * m0c². If the question is asking for the total energy, then that's correct. But if it's asking for the kinetic energy, which is E_kinetic = (gamma -1) m0c², then the result would be different.

Wait, the question says, "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So the energy of the collider would be the kinetic energy imparted to each nucleus, I think. Because the collider's energy is usually given as the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. The total energy is gamma * m0c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma-1) m0c². So in the problem statement, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let's reevaluate.

The problem statement says: "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)". From what I remember, the RHIC is a collider that accelerates heavy ions (like gold nuclei) to high energies. The energy figures for colliders are typically given as the kinetic energy. For example, the LHC's energy is given as the kinetic energy (like 13 TeV per proton). So perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy.

If that's the case, then our initial calculation was incorrect. Because we calculated the total energy, but if the question is about kinetic energy, then we need to compute (gamma -1) * m0c².

So let's recompute with that in mind.

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma -1 is 2.57142857.

So m0c² is 5.633549 GeV.

Wait, wait no: the exact m0c² was 5.633549 GeV, but earlier when I recalculated with precise neutron and proton masses, I got 5.633549 GeV.

So E_kinetic = (gamma -1) * m0c².

So (3.57142857 -1) =2.57142857.

So 2.57142857 *5.633549 GeV.

Compute this:

2 *5.633549 = 11.267098 GeV.

0.57142857 *5.633549:

0.5 *5.633549 =2.8167745 GeV.

0.07142857 *5.633549 ≈0.402396 GeV.

So 2.8167745 +0.402396 ≈3.2191705 GeV.

So total E_kinetic ≈11.267098 +3.2191705 ≈14.4862685 GeV.

Wait, that's 14.486 GeV, but that's not one of the given options. Hmm, that's a problem because none of the options match that.

Wait, so maybe the question is actually asking for the total energy, not the kinetic. Because our first calculation gave about 20.12 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV).

But why the discrepancy? Because if the energy is given as the kinetic, it's 14.486 GeV, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question is referring to the total energy, not the kinetic. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I miscalculated the atomic mass. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Let me think again: the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Proton mass: 1.007276 u.

Neutron mass: 1.008665 u.

So total mass: 3 *1.007276 =3.021828 u.

3 *1.008665 =3.025995 u.

Total mass: 3.021828 +3.025995 =6.047823 u.

So that's correct.

Then, m0c² is 6.047823 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

6.047823 * 931.5 = Let me compute that more accurately.

Let me compute it step by step.

6.047823 *931.5:

First, 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.047823 *931.5:

0.04 *931.5 =37.26

0.007823 *931.5 = let's compute:

First, 0.007 *931.5 =6.5205.

0.000823 *931.5 ≈0.768.

So 6.5205 +0.768 ≈7.2885.

So 0.04 *931.5=37.26, plus 0.007823*931.5≈7.2885 → total 37.26+7.2885=44.5485 MeV.

So 6.047823 *931.5 =5589 +44.5485=5633.5485 MeV → 5.6335485 GeV.

So m0c² is approximately 5.63355 GeV.

So the total energy is gamma * m0c² → 3.57142857 *5.63355 GeV.

Wait, let's compute 3.57142857 *5.63355.

I can compute this using a calculator-like approach:

3.57142857 *5.63355 → Let's think of 3.57142857 as 25/7, since 3.57142857 is 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So 25/7 *5.63355 = (25 *5.63355)/7.

25 *5.63355 = 140.83875.

140.83875 /7 ≈20.1198214 GeV.

So approximately 20.1198 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects the use of (1/√(1 - (0.96)^2)) as gamma, without considering the exact mass. Let me try that.

Alternatively, maybe the mistake is in the initial assumption of what the question is asking for. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

RHIC's energy is typically given as the kinetic energy per ion. So perhaps I should be using E_kinetic = (gamma-1) m0 c².

In that case, I compute:

gamma =3.57142857 → gamma -1 =2.57142857.

E_kinetic =2.57142857 *5.63355 GeV ≈14.486 GeV.

But that's not one of the options. So perhaps the problem expects the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about calculating the kinetic energy, but the options don't include 14.486 GeV. Let me look at the options again:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate gamma.

Wait, I'm pretty sure gamma is correct. Let me double-check.

v=0.96c → v² = (0.96)^2 c² =0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² =1 -0.9216=0.0784 → sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 → gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

No mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is in u, and I should use a more precise conversion factor. The exact value of 1 u in MeV is 931.494064 MeV.

So m0c² =6.047823 u * 931.494064 MeV/u.

Let me compute that:

6.047823 *931.494064.

Compute 6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.047823 *931.494064 → let's compute:

0.04 *931.494064 =37.25976256

0.007823 *931.494064 → compute 0.007 *931.494064 =6.52045845,

0.000823 *931.494064 ≈0.767899.

So 6.52045845 +0.767899 ≈7.28835745.

So total for 0.047823 *931.494064 is approx 37.25976256 +7.28835745 ≈44.5481199.

So total m0c² is 5588.964384 +44.5481199 = 5633.512504 MeV →5.6335125 GeV.

So gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *5.6335125 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6335125.

Let me use a calculator approach:

3.57142857 *5.6335125 → let's compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6335125 → let's compute.

0.6 *3.57142857 ≈2.14285714.

0.0335125 *3.57142857 → let me compute 0.03 *3.57142857 =0.107142857, 0.0035125 *3.57142857 ≈0.012520137.

Adding: 0.107142857 +0.012520137 ≈0.119663.

So 0.6335125 *3.57142857 ≈2.14285714 +0.119663 ≈2.26252014.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.26252014 ≈20.119663 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.1197 GeV. The options have option C as 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise multiplication.

Alternatively, perhaps the precise calculation would yield 20.1198 GeV, which would round to 20.120 GeV. But none of the options is exactly that. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the answer should be option C.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise computation for gamma.

Wait, gamma =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784). Wait, 0.0784 is exactly (0.28)^2, so sqrt is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857... So that part is accurate.

Hmm, but why is there a discrepancy between the calculation and the option? Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So, my calculation is approximately 20.1198 GeV, which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV). The difference is about 0.012 GeV, which is 12 MeV. That's a small difference, possibly due to rounding in the problem statement or more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the rest mass in a more precise way.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is different. Let me check an exact mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, considering only the relativistic velocity without considering the rest mass accurately.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy is calculated using the relativistic kinetic energy formula, which is E = (gamma -1) m c², where m is the rest mass.

But earlier calculation with that gave about 14.486 GeV, which isn't an option. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the rest mass as 6 u, ignoring the protons and neutrons' precise masses.

So let's compute with m0 =6 u.

So m0c² =6 *931.5 =5589 MeV =5.589 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

Total energy: 3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.589 = ?

0.5 *3.57142857=1.785714285.

0.08 *3.57142857=0.285714286.

0.009 *3.57142857=0.032142857.

Adding: 1.785714285 +0.285714286 =2.071428571 +0.032142857=2.103571428.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.103571428=19.96071428 GeV.

Approximately 19.9607 GeV, which is 19.96 GeV. But none of the options are close to that except option C (20.132 GeV) and option A (18.475 GeV).

Wait, perhaps using precise gamma and rest mass, the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the problem statement again.

Wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c".

In reality, RHIC's energy is given as the total energy (total kinetic plus rest), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy as the kinetic energy, but that didn't match the options. So perhaps I should proceed with the initial assumption that the energy is the total energy, which gives about 20.12 GeV, matching option C.

But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So I think the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is 0.96c, we calculate the total energy of the nucleus using relativistic mechanics. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
For \( v = 0.96c \):
\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \)
The Li-6 nucleus consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using their exact masses:
\[
m_0 = 3(1.007276 \, \text{u}) + 3(1.008665 \, \text{u}) = 6.047823 \, \text{u}
\]
The conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) gives:
\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.047823 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} = 5633.5125 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6335125 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m_0 c^2 \approx 5.6335125 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6335125 \, \text{GeV}
\]
Breaking this into components:
\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.6335125 \approx 2.2625
\]
\[
E \approx 17.857 + 2.2625 = 20.1195 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.1195 \, \text{GeV} \), which is very close to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)). The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding differences in intermediate steps or the problem's precision requirements.

### Conclusion
The energy of the RHIC, corresponding to the total energy of the Li-6 nucleus moving at \( 0.96c \), is best matched by option C.

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li with 3 neutrons would make it lithium-6, because lithium typically has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make the mass number 6. So its atomic mass is about 6 atomic mass units (u).

The question is about relativistic energy. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just kinetic; it includes the rest mass energy as well. Since the nucleus is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (0.96c), relativistic effects are important here.

I think the total energy of the particle is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me write that down:

E = γ * m₀c²

Where m₀ is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.

So first, I need to calculate gamma for v = 0.96c. Let's compute that. 

Calculating gamma:
v = 0.96c
v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
Taking the square root: sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28
So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714

Wait, let me double-check that square root. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So that part is correct.

So gamma ≈ 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the lithium nucleus. The rest mass is 6 u. I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So m₀c² is 6 * 931.5 MeV.

Calculating that:

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV. That's 5.589 GeV.

Then, the total energy is gamma times this:

E = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV ≈ let's compute that.

3.5714 *5 = 17.857
3.5714 *0.589 = let's compute step by step.

0.5 *3.5714 = 1.7857
0.08 *3.5714 ≈ 0.2857
0.009 *3.5714 ≈ 0.0321
Adding those: 1.7857 + 0.2857 = 2.0714; +0.0321 = 2.0714+0.0321≈2.1035
So total is 17.857 + 2.1035 ≈ 19.96 GeV.

Wait, but that approximation might be a bit off. Maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, 5.589 *3.5714. Let's compute 5.589 *3.5714.

I can do this step by step.

First, 5 *3.5714 =17.857
Then 0.589 *3.5714: 

0.5 *3.5714 =1.7857
0.08 *3.5714 =0.2857
0.009 *3.5714≈0.0321
So add those: 1.7857 +0.2857=2.0714 +0.0321=2.1035

So total is 17.857 +2.1035=19.9605 GeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option C: 20.132 GeV, and option D: 21.419 GeV. Hmm, but 19.96 is closer to 20 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me recheck that.

v = 0.96c → v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c² → v²/c² = 0.9216.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1 / sqrt(0.0784) using more precise methods.

Wait, 0.0784 is the value, so sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. Because 0.28 *0.28 = 0.0784. So yes, gamma is exactly 3.57142857... So that's correct.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps the mass of the lithium nucleus is more accurately calculated. Because 6 u is just an approximation. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, maybe the exact value of the mass is needed. Let me think about it. The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus: Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons. Each proton is about 1.007276 u, and neutron is about 1.008665 u.

So for Li-6: 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = ?

3 *1.007276 = 3.021828
3 *1.008665 = 3.025995
Adding: 3.021828 +3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

So the exact rest mass is 6.047823 u. Then, m₀c² is 6.047823 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

So 6.047823 *931.5 = let me calculate that.

Compute 6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.047823 *931.5 ≈ let's compute:

0.047823 *900 =43.0407

0.047823 *31.5 = approx 1.5083

Total ≈43.0407 +1.5083 ≈44.549 MeV.

So total m₀c² is 5589 +44.549 = 5633.549 MeV, which is 5.633549 GeV.

So now, E = gamma * m₀c² = 3.57142857 *5.633549 GeV.

Let me compute that precisely.

3.57142857 *5.633549.

Let me compute 3 *5.633549 = 16.900647

0.57142857 *5.633549.

0.5 *5.633549 =2.8167745

0.07142857 *5.633549 ≈ let's compute 5.633549 *0.07142857.

Wait, 0.07142857 is approximately 1/14, so 5.633549 /14 ≈0.402396.

So 0.07142857 *5.633549 ≈ 0.402396.

So 0.57142857 *5.633549 ≈2.8167745 +0.402396 ≈3.2191705.

Adding that to the 3*5.633549 (16.900647):

16.900647 +3.2191705 ≈20.1198175 GeV.

So approximately 20.1198 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, I should check the calculation again for more precision.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.633549 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 3.57142857 *5.633549:

Let me break it down:

5.633549 = 5 + 0.633549

So:

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.633549:

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142

3.57142857 *0.033549 = ?

0.03 *3.57142857 ≈0.107142857

0.003549 *3.57142857 ≈

0.003 *3.57142857 ≈0.0107142857

0.000549 *3.57142857 ≈approx 0.001954.

So adding these:

0.107142857 +0.0107142857=0.1178571427 +0.001954≈0.119811.

So total 3.57142857 *0.033549 ≈0.119811.

So 3.57142857 *0.633549 ≈2.142857142 +0.119811≈2.262668.

Adding to the 17.85714285:

17.85714285 +2.262668 ≈20.11981085 GeV.

So about 20.1198 GeV, which is approximately 20.12 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to our calculated 20.1198. The slight difference could be due to more precise values of the atomic masses or the speed. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered relativistic kinetic energy instead of total energy. Wait, wait a second! I think I might have made a mistake here.

Wait, the question asks for the energy of the RHIC. Is that the kinetic energy or the total energy (rest + kinetic)?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Because in particle physics, the energy given is often the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. But in colliders, I think the specified energy is usually the kinetic energy per particle. Or wait, no—often, the total energy is given. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about this.

Wait, the RHIC accelerates heavy ions like gold nuclei to a certain energy. The energy given is usually the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy? I think in accelerator physics, the energy given is the kinetic energy. Because the rest mass is much smaller than the kinetic energy at such high speeds.

Wait, but in our calculation, we computed the total energy as gamma * m0c². If the question is asking for the total energy, then that's correct. But if it's asking for the kinetic energy, which is E_kinetic = (gamma -1) m0c², then the result would be different.

Wait, the question says, "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So the energy of the collider would be the kinetic energy imparted to each nucleus, I think. Because the collider's energy is usually given as the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. The total energy is gamma * m0c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma-1) m0c². So in the problem statement, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let's reevaluate.

The problem statement says: "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)". From what I remember, the RHIC is a collider that accelerates heavy ions (like gold nuclei) to high energies. The energy figures for colliders are typically given as the kinetic energy. For example, the LHC's energy is given as the kinetic energy (like 13 TeV per proton). So perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy.

If that's the case, then our initial calculation was incorrect. Because we calculated the total energy, but if the question is about kinetic energy, then we need to compute (gamma -1) * m0c².

So let's recompute with that in mind.

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma -1 is 2.57142857.

So m0c² is 5.633549 GeV.

Wait, wait no: the exact m0c² was 5.633549 GeV, but earlier when I recalculated with precise neutron and proton masses, I got 5.633549 GeV.

So E_kinetic = (gamma -1) * m0c².

So (3.57142857 -1) =2.57142857.

So 2.57142857 *5.633549 GeV.

Compute this:

2 *5.633549 = 11.267098 GeV.

0.57142857 *5.633549:

0.5 *5.633549 =2.8167745 GeV.

0.07142857 *5.633549 ≈0.402396 GeV.

So 2.8167745 +0.402396 ≈3.2191705 GeV.

So total E_kinetic ≈11.267098 +3.2191705 ≈14.4862685 GeV.

Wait, that's 14.486 GeV, but that's not one of the given options. Hmm, that's a problem because none of the options match that.

Wait, so maybe the question is actually asking for the total energy, not the kinetic. Because our first calculation gave about 20.12 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV).

But why the discrepancy? Because if the energy is given as the kinetic, it's 14.486 GeV, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question is referring to the total energy, not the kinetic. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I miscalculated the atomic mass. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Let me think again: the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Proton mass: 1.007276 u.

Neutron mass: 1.008665 u.

So total mass: 3 *1.007276 =3.021828 u.

3 *1.008665 =3.025995 u.

Total mass: 3.021828 +3.025995 =6.047823 u.

So that's correct.

Then, m0c² is 6.047823 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

6.047823 * 931.5 = Let me compute that more accurately.

Let me compute it step by step.

6.047823 *931.5:

First, 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.047823 *931.5:

0.04 *931.5 =37.26

0.007823 *931.5 = let's compute:

First, 0.007 *931.5 =6.5205.

0.000823 *931.5 ≈0.768.

So 6.5205 +0.768 ≈7.2885.

So 0.04 *931.5=37.26, plus 0.007823*931.5≈7.2885 → total 37.26+7.2885=44.5485 MeV.

So 6.047823 *931.5 =5589 +44.5485=5633.5485 MeV → 5.6335485 GeV.

So m0c² is approximately 5.63355 GeV.

So the total energy is gamma * m0c² → 3.57142857 *5.63355 GeV.

Wait, let's compute 3.57142857 *5.63355.

I can compute this using a calculator-like approach:

3.57142857 *5.63355 → Let's think of 3.57142857 as 25/7, since 3.57142857 is 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So 25/7 *5.63355 = (25 *5.63355)/7.

25 *5.63355 = 140.83875.

140.83875 /7 ≈20.1198214 GeV.

So approximately 20.1198 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects the use of (1/√(1 - (0.96)^2)) as gamma, without considering the exact mass. Let me try that.

Alternatively, maybe the mistake is in the initial assumption of what the question is asking for. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

RHIC's energy is typically given as the kinetic energy per ion. So perhaps I should be using E_kinetic = (gamma-1) m0 c².

In that case, I compute:

gamma =3.57142857 → gamma -1 =2.57142857.

E_kinetic =2.57142857 *5.63355 GeV ≈14.486 GeV.

But that's not one of the options. So perhaps the problem expects the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about calculating the kinetic energy, but the options don't include 14.486 GeV. Let me look at the options again:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate gamma.

Wait, I'm pretty sure gamma is correct. Let me double-check.

v=0.96c → v² = (0.96)^2 c² =0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² =1 -0.9216=0.0784 → sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 → gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

No mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is in u, and I should use a more precise conversion factor. The exact value of 1 u in MeV is 931.494064 MeV.

So m0c² =6.047823 u * 931.494064 MeV/u.

Let me compute that:

6.047823 *931.494064.

Compute 6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.047823 *931.494064 → let's compute:

0.04 *931.494064 =37.25976256

0.007823 *931.494064 → compute 0.007 *931.494064 =6.52045845,

0.000823 *931.494064 ≈0.767899.

So 6.52045845 +0.767899 ≈7.28835745.

So total for 0.047823 *931.494064 is approx 37.25976256 +7.28835745 ≈44.5481199.

So total m0c² is 5588.964384 +44.5481199 = 5633.512504 MeV →5.6335125 GeV.

So gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *5.6335125 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6335125.

Let me use a calculator approach:

3.57142857 *5.6335125 → let's compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6335125 → let's compute.

0.6 *3.57142857 ≈2.14285714.

0.0335125 *3.57142857 → let me compute 0.03 *3.57142857 =0.107142857, 0.0035125 *3.57142857 ≈0.012520137.

Adding: 0.107142857 +0.012520137 ≈0.119663.

So 0.6335125 *3.57142857 ≈2.14285714 +0.119663 ≈2.26252014.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.26252014 ≈20.119663 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.1197 GeV. The options have option C as 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise multiplication.

Alternatively, perhaps the precise calculation would yield 20.1198 GeV, which would round to 20.120 GeV. But none of the options is exactly that. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the answer should be option C.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise computation for gamma.

Wait, gamma =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784). Wait, 0.0784 is exactly (0.28)^2, so sqrt is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857... So that part is accurate.

Hmm, but why is there a discrepancy between the calculation and the option? Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So, my calculation is approximately 20.1198 GeV, which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV). The difference is about 0.012 GeV, which is 12 MeV. That's a small difference, possibly due to rounding in the problem statement or more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the rest mass in a more precise way.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is different. Let me check an exact mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, considering only the relativistic velocity without considering the rest mass accurately.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy is calculated using the relativistic kinetic energy formula, which is E = (gamma -1) m c², where m is the rest mass.

But earlier calculation with that gave about 14.486 GeV, which isn't an option. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the rest mass as 6 u, ignoring the protons and neutrons' precise masses.

So let's compute with m0 =6 u.

So m0c² =6 *931.5 =5589 MeV =5.589 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

Total energy: 3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.589 = ?

0.5 *3.57142857=1.785714285.

0.08 *3.57142857=0.285714286.

0.009 *3.57142857=0.032142857.

Adding: 1.785714285 +0.285714286 =2.071428571 +0.032142857=2.103571428.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.103571428=19.96071428 GeV.

Approximately 19.9607 GeV, which is 19.96 GeV. But none of the options are close to that except option C (20.132 GeV) and option A (18.475 GeV).

Wait, perhaps using precise gamma and rest mass, the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the problem statement again.

Wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c".

In reality, RHIC's energy is given as the total energy (total kinetic plus rest), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy as the kinetic energy, but that didn't match the options. So perhaps I should proceed with the initial assumption that the energy is the total energy, which gives about 20.12 GeV, matching option C.

But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So I think the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is 0.96c, we calculate the total energy of the nucleus using relativistic mechanics. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
For \( v = 0.96c \):
\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \)
The Li-6 nucleus consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using their exact masses:
\[
m_0 = 3(1.007276 \, \text{u}) + 3(1.008665 \, \text{u}) = 6.047823 \, \text{u}
\]
The conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) gives:
\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.047823 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} = 5633.5125 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6335125 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m_0 c^2 \approx 5.6335125 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6335125 \, \text{GeV}
\]
Breaking this into components:
\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.6335125 \approx 2.2625
\]
\[
E \approx 17.857 + 2.2625 = 20.1195 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.1195 \, \text{GeV} \), which is very close to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)). The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding differences in intermediate steps or the problem's precision requirements.

### Conclusion
The energy of the RHIC, corresponding to the total energy of the Li-6 nucleus moving at \( 0.96c \), is best matched by option C.

**Answer: C**
