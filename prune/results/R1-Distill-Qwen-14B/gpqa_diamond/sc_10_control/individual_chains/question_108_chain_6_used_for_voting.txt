Okay, so I have this physics problem here about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom's transition energy. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking me to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The setup is a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis, right? And the values of m are small, so m is probably like 0, ±1, etc. Also, B is 1 Tesla, which is a pretty strong magnetic field, but I'm not sure how that factors into the comparison.

Wait, I remember that paramagnetism deals with the magnetic properties of materials due to their electrons' magnetic moments. The coupling term here refers to the interaction energy between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. Oh right, the Zeeman effect is about that. The Zeeman term in the Hamiltonian is something like H' = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor (approximately 2 for electrons), and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So the energy due to this interaction would be H' = gμ_B m B. But wait, since the orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, like m=0, ±1, etc., the term would be proportional to m. But in the case of hydrogen, the ground state has m=0, so perhaps this would lead to a smaller energy shift. Or maybe for higher m states, but the question says small m.

Wait, the problem states that m is small. So m could be zero or ±1. So the coupling term would be small. But wait, the transition energy is given, which is ΔE, and it's associated with a specific wavelength λ=0.4861 μm, which I think is the Balmer series in hydrogen, maybe the H-alpha line.

I remember that the energy levels of hydrogen are given by the Rydberg formula. The transition energy ΔE is related to the wavelength by ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

Let me calculate ΔE. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. So λ = 486.1e-9 meters. hc is a constant, approximately 1240 eV·nm. So ΔE ≈ (1240 eV·nm) / (486.1 nm) ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait, that's about 2.55 eV. But wait, let me compute that. 1240 / 486.1 is approximately 2.55. So yes, about 2.55 eV for ΔE.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the Zeeman term. Let me think about the energy scale of this term. The paramagnetic term is H' = g μ_B m B. Let's compute this for m=1 (since m is small, maybe we can take m=1 as the maximum here for the comparison).

g is approximately 2. The Bohr magneton μ_B is about 9.274e-24 J/T. So putting it all together:

H' = 2 * (9.274e-24 J/T) * 1 * 1 T = 1.8548e-23 J.

Wait, but I need to convert that into eV to compare with ΔE. I know that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So:

H' = 1.8548e-23 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 1.158e-4 eV ≈ 0.0001158 eV.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is about 0.0001158 eV. The transition energy ΔE is about 2.55 eV. Comparing the two, the coupling term is much smaller than ΔE.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than ΔE, which means that ⟨H'⟩ is much less than ΔE. So the correct comparison is ⟨H'⟩ << ΔE.

Looking back at the options:

A) ⟨H⟩ = ΔE → No, because they're not equal.
B) ⟨H⟩ >> ΔE → No, the coupling term is smaller.
C) ⟨H⟩ << ΔE → Yes, this is correct.
D) ⟨H⟩ > ΔE → No, because it's smaller.

Wait, but wait a second. The paramagnetic coupling might be the perturbation, and sometimes in these cases, the perturbation is much smaller than the main energy levels. So in this case, the Zeeman effect would cause a small shift in the energy levels, but the transition energy itself is the energy difference between two states, which is much larger.

Wait, but the question says "compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE". So the coupling term is the energy shift due to the magnetic field, and ΔE is the transition energy between two states.

So the coupling term is much smaller than ΔE, so the correct option is C.

To compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Transition Energy (ΔE):**  
   The transition energy is associated with the wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm. Using the relation ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light, we calculate:  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx \frac{1240 \, \text{eV·nm}}{486.1 \, \text{nm}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (H'):**  
   The energy due to the interaction of the magnetic moment with the external magnetic field is given by:  
   \[
   H' = g \mu_B m B,
   \]  
   where \( g \approx 2 \) (Landé g-factor), \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) (Bohr magneton), \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number (small, e.g., \( m = 1 \)), and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). Substituting these values:  
   \[
   H' = 2 \cdot (9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}) \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \, \text{T} = 1.8548 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts:  
   \[
   H' \approx \frac{1.8548 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx 0.0001158 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Comparison:**  
   The paramagnetic coupling term \( H' \approx 0.0001158 \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than the transition energy \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \). Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   The correct comparison is \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).
