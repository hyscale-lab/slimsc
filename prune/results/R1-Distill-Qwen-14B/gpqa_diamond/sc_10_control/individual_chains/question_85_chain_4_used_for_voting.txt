Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Both planets are detected via transit and radial velocity methods. 

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. They're in circular orbits, which probably means the same orbital shape, but I need to think about their distances from the star? Wait, the question doesn't give their orbital periods or distances, so maybe I don't need that for calculating equilibrium temperature.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Oh wait, but albedo is the same for both planets, so that part cancels out. So the main factors are the star's temperature, its radius, and the planet's orbital distance.

But wait, the problem doesn't give the orbital distances directly. Hmm. How else can I find 'a' for each planet? Or maybe I don't need 'a' because the question gives the RV shifts. Let me think about the radial velocity method. Oh, right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's movement caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The semi-amplitude K of the RV curve depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance.

Wait, but in the question, the RV shifts are given in terms of the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. The shifts are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (v) where v is the velocity causing the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ = v/c, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K can be calculated using the formula:

K = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) / (M_Jupiter) ) * ( (P/(year)) )^{-1/3} * ( (M_star / M_sun)^{-2/3} ) ) 

Wait, but maybe that's not the way to go. Another approach is to relate the radial velocity shift to the mass and orbital distance. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2πG) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(c)) )

Wait, maybe there's a more straightforward way. Alternatively, the Doppler shift (Δλ) is proportional to the velocity. Since the forbidden line is at 6300 Å, the shift is 0.03 and 0.04 Å. So their velocities would be (Δλ / λ) * c.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula is:

Δλ / λ = v / c

But wait, what's the sign here? Oh, it doesn't matter for the magnitude. So the velocity of the star due to Planet1 is v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c, and for Planet2, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

Wait, but c is the speed of light. Let me compute those velocities.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s, but let me compute the shifts in terms of m/s.

So, for Planet1: Δλ1 = 0.03 Å, λ = 6300 Å. So:

v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c 

Similarly, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

But c in m/s is about 2.9979e5 km/s = 2.9979e8 m/s. Wait wait, no, km/s is 1e3 m/s. So 3e5 km/s is 3e8 m/s. Let me compute v1 and v2.

v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * 2.9979e8 m/s ≈ (4.7619e-6) * 2.9979e8 ≈ 1427 m/s. Wait, that seems way too high. Because radial velocity amplitudes are usually a few tens of m/s, not thousands. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, no, I think I messed up the units. Oh wait, 0.03 Å is 0.03e-10 meters. And λ is 6300 Å = 6300e-10 meters. So the ratio is (0.03e-10)/(6300e-10) ) = 0.03 /6300 = 1e-5 / 2100 ≈ 4.76e-6.

Then, v = (4.76e-6) * c. c is 3e8 m/s. So v ≈ 4.76e-6 *3e8 ≈ 1.428e3 m/s. That's 1428 m/s. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe it's correct.

Similarly, for Planet2, Δλ is 0.04 Å. So:

v2 = (0.04 /6300) *3e8 ≈ (6.349e-6) *3e8 ≈ 1.904e3 m/s. So about 1904 m/s.

Wait, but RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v sin i), but if the orbits are edge-on (transit implies i≈90 degrees), so sin i ≈1. So K is approximately v.

So K1 = 1428 m/s, K2=1904 m/s.

But how does this relate to the mass and orbital parameters? The RV semi-amplitude formula is:

K = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3) c) )

Wait, but I'm not sure I get the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (27.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) / (M_Jup) ) ] * [ (P / year )^(-1/3) ] * [ (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) ) ]

Wait, but that's an approximation. Let me think. Alternatively, the formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ (P * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

Hmm, perhaps that's too complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of the mass function and the period. But since the periods aren't given, I'm stuck.

Wait, but the question doesn't give the periods of the planets. Hmm. So maybe I don't need the actual period because the ratio will eliminate that variable.

Wait, the problem is about equilibrium temperatures, which depend on the distance from the star. So I need to find the ratio of the distances of Planet1 and Planet2 from the star.

If I can find the ratio a1/a2, then the ratio of equilibrium temperatures can be determined.

Equilibrium temperature formula: T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

But since albedo is same, it can be ignored for the ratio. So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 /a1 )

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 /a1 )

So I need a2/a1.

But how to find a1 and a2.

Wait, the RV method gives K, which is related to the mass of the planet and the distance a.

The formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is:

K = (v) = [ (27.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) / M_Jup ) ] * [ (P / year )^(-1/3) ] * [ (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) ) ]

Assuming sin i =1 (edge-on orbit, since transit is observed), and M_p << M_star, which is probably true since M_planet is Earth masses and star is much more massive.

So K ≈ (27.4) * (M_p / M_Jup) * [ (P year )^(-1/3) ] * [ (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) ) ]

But I don't have P. Hmm.

Wait, but for each planet, I can write this equation, and then take the ratio.

Let me denote K1 and K2 as the radial velocities for Planet1 and Planet2.

So,

K1 = 27.4 * (M1 / M_Jup) * (P1^(-1/3)) * (M_star^(-2/3) )

K2 = 27.4 * (M2 / M_Jup) * (P2^(-1/3)) * (M_star^(-2/3) )

Dividing K2 by K1:

K2/K1 = (M2/M1) * (P1/P2)^(1/3)

But I don't know P1 and P2. Hmm.

Wait, but from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star)) a^3.

So for each planet:

P = ( (4π² a^3) / ( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )

But since P is in years, M_star is in solar masses, and a is in AU, perhaps it's better to write it in terms of the relationship with Earth's orbit.

Alternatively, Kepler's third law in terms of period, semi-major axis, and star's mass is:

P² = (a^3) / (M_star) ) * (4π²/(G M_sun)) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider the formula for P in terms of a.

Wait, Kepler's third law: (P^2) (M_star) = a^3 (in AU, years, solar masses). Wait, the exact form depends on units, but perhaps it's easier to write the ratio.

For each planet,

P1² = (4π² a1^3) / ( G M_star )

Similarly, P2² = (4π² a2^3) / ( G M_star )

Taking the ratio P2² / P1² = (a2^3)/(a1^3 )

So P2 / P1 = ( a2 / a1 )^(3/2 )

So, P1 / P2 = (a1/a2)^(3/2 )

Going back to the ratio K2/K1:

K2/K1 = (M2/M1) * (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

Substituting P1/P2 = (a1/a2)^(3/2 )

So, (P1/P2)^(1/3 ) = (a1/a2)^( (3/2)*(1/3) ) = (a1/a2)^(1/2 )

So,

K2/K1 = (M2/M1) * sqrt( a1/a2 )

But K2/K1 is given by the Doppler shifts. Wait, K1 is 0.03 Å and K2 is 0.04 Å. So K2/K1 = 0.04/0.03 ≈ 1.333...

So,

1.333... = (M2/M1) * sqrt( a1/a2 )

M2 is 5 Earth masses, M1 is 7. So M2/M1 =5/7 ≈0.7143.

So,

1.333 = 0.7143 * sqrt(a1/a2 )

Divide both sides by 0.7143:

1.333 / 0.7143 ≈ 1.87 approx.

So,

sqrt(a1/a2 ) ≈1.87

So,

a1/a2 = (1.87)^2 ≈ 3.498. So a1 ≈3.5 a2.

Wait wait, that can't be right. Because if a1 is larger than a2, then Planet1 is farther away, so would have lower equilibrium temperature.

Wait, but let's proceed.

So a1 =3.5 a2.

So the ratio a2/a1 is 1/3.5 ≈0.2857.

Then, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.2857) ≈ 0.5345.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, let's compute 1.333 / 0.7143.

1.333 / 0.7143 = 1.333 / (5/7) ) = 1.333 * (7/5) = (4/3) * (7/5) ) = 28/15 ≈1.8667.

So sqrt(a1/a2 )=1.8667 → a1/a2 = (1.8667)^2 ≈3.48.

So a1 =3.48 a2.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/3.48) ≈ sqrt(0.2872) ≈0.536.

So the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 is about 0.536, meaning Planet1 is cooler than Planet2 by about 53%.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the Doppler shifts are given as 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å. So K1 is 0.03, K2 is 0.04, so K2/K1 is 4/3 ≈1.333.

Wait, but is the RV semi-amplitude K directly proportional to the velocity? Because the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, which is proportional to the amplitude of the Doppler shift.

So, yeah, the earlier approach should be correct.

Another way: using the RV formula, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(-1/3) )

But with the same star, same sin i (since both transit, so sin i =1), so K is proportional to M_p * P^(-1/3) ) / M_star^(2/3 )

But we can write for each planet:

K1 = (G * M1 * sin i) / ( (M_star + M1)^(1/3) (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) * (1/(P1^(1/3) c) ) )

But since M1 << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M1 ≈ M_star.

So,

K1 ≈ ( G M1 )/( M_star^(1/3) ) * (1/( P1^(1/3) c )) )

But G is a constant, so for the ratio K2/K1:

K2/K1 ≈ (M2 / M1) * (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

But from Kepler's law,

P² = (4π² a³)/( G M_star )

So P = ( (4π² a³)/( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )

So (P1/P2 ) = ( (a1³) / (a2³) )^(1/2 ) * ( M_star / M_star )^0.5 )

So (P1/P2 ) = (a1/a2)^(3/2 )

So,

K2/K1 = (M2/M1) * ( (a1/a2)^(3/2 ) )^(1/3 )

= (M2/M1) * (a1/a2)^(1/2 )

So,

K2/K1 = (M2/M1) * sqrt(a1/a2 )

Which is what I had earlier.

So substituting in the numbers:

(0.04 / 0.03 ) = (5/7) * sqrt( a1/a2 )

4/3 = (5/7) * sqrt(a1/a2 )

=> sqrt(a1/a2 ) = (4/3) * (7/5 ) = (28/15 ) ≈1.8667

So, a1 = ( (28/15 )^2 ) * a2 ≈3.48 a2.

Thus, a1 is about 3.5 times a2.

Then, equilibrium temperature ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) )

= sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which is sqrt( 1/3.48 ) ≈0.536.

So the ratio is about 0.53, which is option C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the albedo term cancels out, leaving:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends on the ratio of the orbital distances \(a_2/a_1\).

### Step 1: Relating Radial Velocity Shifts to Orbital Distances
The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the cube root of its orbital period. Using the RV shifts provided (\(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\) for Planet1 and \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\) for Planet2), we have:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{M_2}{M_1} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_1}{a_2}}
\]

Substituting \(M_1 = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\) and \(M_2 = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\), and \(\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{0.04}{0.03} \approx 1.333\):

\[
1.333 = \frac{5}{7} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_1}{a_2}}
\]

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_1}{a_2}} = \frac{1.333 \cdot 7}{5} \approx 1.8667
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx (1.8667)^2 \approx 3.498
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 3.498 \cdot a_2\).

### Step 2: Calculating the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substituting \(\frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx 3.498\):

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3.498}} \approx \sqrt{0.2857} \approx 0.536
\]

### Step 3: Final Answer
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately \(0.53\), which corresponds to **Option C**.

Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Both planets are detected via transit and radial velocity methods. 

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. They're in circular orbits, which probably means the same orbital shape, but I need to think about their distances from the star? Wait, the question doesn't give their orbital periods or distances, so maybe I don't need that for calculating equilibrium temperature.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Oh wait, but albedo is the same for both planets, so that part cancels out. So the main factors are the star's temperature, its radius, and the planet's orbital distance.

But wait, the problem doesn't give the orbital distances directly. Hmm. How else can I find 'a' for each planet? Or maybe I don't need 'a' because the question gives the RV shifts. Let me think about the radial velocity method. Oh, right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's movement caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The semi-amplitude K of the RV curve depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance.

Wait, but in the question, the RV shifts are given in terms of the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. The shifts are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (v) where v is the velocity causing the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ = v/c, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K can be calculated using the formula:

K = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) / (M_Jupiter) ) * ( (P/(year)) )^{-1/3} * ( (M_star / M_sun)^{-2/3} ) ) 

Wait, but maybe that's not the way to go. Another approach is to relate the radial velocity shift to the mass and orbital distance. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2πG) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(c)) )

Wait, maybe there's a more straightforward way. Alternatively, the Doppler shift (Δλ) is proportional to the velocity. Since the forbidden line is at 6300 Å, the shift is 0.03 and 0.04 Å. So their velocities would be (Δλ / λ) * c.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula is:

Δλ / λ = v / c

But wait, what's the sign here? Oh, it doesn't matter for the magnitude. So the velocity of the star due to Planet1 is v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c, and for Planet2, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

Wait, but c is the speed of light. Let me compute those velocities.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s, but let me compute the shifts in terms of m/s.

So, for Planet1: Δλ1 = 0.03 Å, λ = 6300 Å. So:

v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c 

Similarly, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

But c in m/s is about 2.9979e5 km/s = 2.9979e8 m/s. Wait wait, no, km/s is 1e3 m/s. So 3e5 km/s is 3e8 m/s. Let me compute v1 and v2.

v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * 2.9979e8 m/s ≈ (4.7619e-6) * 2.9979e8 ≈ 1427 m/s. Wait, that seems way too high. Because radial velocity amplitudes are usually a few tens of m/s, not thousands. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, no, I think I messed up the units. Oh wait, 0.03 Å is 0.03e-10 meters. And λ is 6300 Å = 6300e-10 meters. So the ratio is (0.03e-10)/(6300e-10) ) = 0.03 /6300 = 1e-5 / 2100 ≈ 4.76e-6.

Then, v = (4.76e-6) * c. c is 3e8 m/s. So v ≈ 4.76e-6 *3e8 ≈ 1.428e3 m/s. That's 1428 m/s. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe it's correct.

Similarly, for Planet2, Δλ is 0.04 Å. So:

v2 = (0.04 /6300) *3e8 ≈ (6.349e-6) *3e8 ≈ 1.904e3 m/s. So about 1904 m/s.

Wait, but RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v sin i), but if the orbits are edge-on (transit implies i≈90 degrees), so sin i ≈1. So K is approximately v.

So K1 = 1428 m/s, K2=1904 m/s.

But how does this relate to the mass and orbital parameters? The RV semi-amplitude formula is:

K = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3) c) )

Wait, but I'm not sure I get the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (27.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) / (M_Jup) ) ] * [ (P / year )^(-1/3) ] * [ (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) ) ]

Wait, but that's an approximation. Let me think. Alternatively, the formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ (P * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

Hmm, perhaps that's too complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of the mass function and the period. But since the periods aren't given, I'm stuck.

Wait, but the question doesn't give the periods of the planets. Hmm. So maybe I don't need the actual period because the ratio will eliminate that variable.

Wait, the problem is about equilibrium temperatures, which depend on the distance from the star. So I need to find the ratio of the distances of Planet1 and Planet2 from the star.

If I can find the ratio a1/a2, then the ratio of equilibrium temperatures can be determined.

Equilibrium temperature formula: T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

But since albedo is same, it can be ignored for the ratio. So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 /a1 )

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 /a1 )

So I need a2/a1.

But how to find a1 and a2.

Wait, the RV method gives K, which is related to the mass of the planet and the distance a.

The formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is:

K = (v) = [ (27.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) / M_Jup ) ] * [ (P / year )^(-1/3) ] * [ (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) ) ]

Assuming sin i =1 (edge-on orbit, since transit is observed), and M_p << M_star, which is probably true since M_planet is Earth masses and star is much more massive.

So K ≈ (27.4) * (M_p / M_Jup) * [ (P year )^(-1/3) ] * [ (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) ) ]

But I don't have P. Hmm.

Wait, but for each planet, I can write this equation, and then take the ratio.

Let me denote K1 and K2 as the radial velocities for Planet1 and Planet2.

So,

K1 = 27.4 * (M1 / M_Jup) * (P1^(-1/3)) * (M_star^(-2/3) )

K2 = 27.4 * (M2 / M_Jup) * (P2^(-1/3)) * (M_star^(-2/3) )

Dividing K2 by K1:

K2/K1 = (M2/M1) * (P1/P2)^(1/3)

But I don't know P1 and P2. Hmm.

Wait, but from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star)) a^3.

So for each planet:

P = ( (4π² a^3) / ( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )

But since P is in years, M_star is in solar masses, and a is in AU, perhaps it's better to write it in terms of the relationship with Earth's orbit.

Alternatively, Kepler's third law in terms of period, semi-major axis, and star's mass is:

P² = (a^3) / (M_star) ) * (4π²/(G M_sun)) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider the formula for P in terms of a.

Wait, Kepler's third law: (P^2) (M_star) = a^3 (in AU, years, solar masses). Wait, the exact form depends on units, but perhaps it's easier to write the ratio.

For each planet,

P1² = (4π² a1^3) / ( G M_star )

Similarly, P2² = (4π² a2^3) / ( G M_star )

Taking the ratio P2² / P1² = (a2^3)/(a1^3 )

So P2 / P1 = ( a2 / a1 )^(3/2 )

So, P1 / P2 = (a1/a2)^(3/2 )

Going back to the ratio K2/K1:

K2/K1 = (M2/M1) * (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

Substituting P1/P2 = (a1/a2)^(3/2 )

So, (P1/P2)^(1/3 ) = (a1/a2)^( (3/2)*(1/3) ) = (a1/a2)^(1/2 )

So,

K2/K1 = (M2/M1) * sqrt( a1/a2 )

But K2/K1 is given by the Doppler shifts. Wait, K1 is 0.03 Å and K2 is 0.04 Å. So K2/K1 = 0.04/0.03 ≈ 1.333...

So,

1.333... = (M2/M1) * sqrt( a1/a2 )

M2 is 5 Earth masses, M1 is 7. So M2/M1 =5/7 ≈0.7143.

So,

1.333 = 0.7143 * sqrt(a1/a2 )

Divide both sides by 0.7143:

1.333 / 0.7143 ≈ 1.87 approx.

So,

sqrt(a1/a2 ) ≈1.87

So,

a1/a2 = (1.87)^2 ≈ 3.498. So a1 ≈3.5 a2.

Wait wait, that can't be right. Because if a1 is larger than a2, then Planet1 is farther away, so would have lower equilibrium temperature.

Wait, but let's proceed.

So a1 =3.5 a2.

So the ratio a2/a1 is 1/3.5 ≈0.2857.

Then, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.2857) ≈ 0.5345.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, let's compute 1.333 / 0.7143.

1.333 / 0.7143 = 1.333 / (5/7) ) = 1.333 * (7/5) = (4/3) * (7/5) ) = 28/15 ≈1.8667.

So sqrt(a1/a2 )=1.8667 → a1/a2 = (1.8667)^2 ≈3.48.

So a1 =3.48 a2.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/3.48) ≈ sqrt(0.2872) ≈0.536.

So the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 is about 0.536, meaning Planet1 is cooler than Planet2 by about 53%.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the Doppler shifts are given as 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å. So K1 is 0.03, K2 is 0.04, so K2/K1 is 4/3 ≈1.333.

Wait, but is the RV semi-amplitude K directly proportional to the velocity? Because the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, which is proportional to the amplitude of the Doppler shift.

So, yeah, the earlier approach should be correct.

Another way: using the RV formula, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(-1/3) )

But with the same star, same sin i (since both transit, so sin i =1), so K is proportional to M_p * P^(-1/3) ) / M_star^(2/3 )

But we can write for each planet:

K1 = (G * M1 * sin i) / ( (M_star + M1)^(1/3) (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) * (1/(P1^(1/3) c) ) )

But since M1 << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M1 ≈ M_star.

So,

K1 ≈ ( G M1 )/( M_star^(1/3) ) * (1/( P1^(1/3) c )) )

But G is a constant, so for the ratio K2/K1:

K2/K1 ≈ (M2 / M1) * (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

But from Kepler's law,

P² = (4π² a³)/( G M_star )

So P = ( (4π² a³)/( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )

So (P1/P2 ) = ( (a1³) / (a2³) )^(1/2 ) * ( M_star / M_star )^0.5 )

So (P1/P2 ) = (a1/a2)^(3/2 )

So,

K2/K1 = (M2/M1) * ( (a1/a2)^(3/2 ) )^(1/3 )

= (M2/M1) * (a1/a2)^(1/2 )

So,

K2/K1 = (M2/M1) * sqrt(a1/a2 )

Which is what I had earlier.

So substituting in the numbers:

(0.04 / 0.03 ) = (5/7) * sqrt( a1/a2 )

4/3 = (5/7) * sqrt(a1/a2 )

=> sqrt(a1/a2 ) = (4/3) * (7/5 ) = (28/15 ) ≈1.8667

So, a1 = ( (28/15 )^2 ) * a2 ≈3.48 a2.

Thus, a1 is about 3.5 times a2.

Then, equilibrium temperature ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) )

= sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which is sqrt( 1/3.48 ) ≈0.536.

So the ratio is about 0.53, which is option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the albedo term cancels out, leaving:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends on the ratio of the orbital distances \(a_2/a_1\).

### Step 1: Relating Radial Velocity Shifts to Orbital Distances
The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the cube root of its orbital period. Using the RV shifts provided (\(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\) for Planet1 and \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\) for Planet2), we have:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{M_2}{M_1} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_1}{a_2}}
\]

Substituting \(M_1 = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\) and \(M_2 = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\), and \(\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{0.04}{0.03} \approx 1.333\):

\[
1.333 = \frac{5}{7} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_1}{a_2}}
\]

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_1}{a_2}} = \frac{1.333 \cdot 7}{5} \approx 1.8667
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx (1.8667)^2 \approx 3.498
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 3.498 \cdot a_2\).

### Step 2: Calculating the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substituting \(\frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx 3.498\):

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3.498}} \approx \sqrt{0.2857} \approx 0.536
\]

### Step 3: Final Answer
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately \(0.53\), which corresponds to **Option C**.
