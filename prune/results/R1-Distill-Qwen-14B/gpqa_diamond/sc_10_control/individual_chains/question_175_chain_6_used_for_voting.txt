Okay, so I have this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my electromagnetism classes. The question is about the power radiated by an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. It says the charge distribution oscillates, so it must be emitting radiation. The wavelength is lambda, and in the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis.

The question asks for two things: the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the possible form of the function f in terms of lambda.

So, I think this relates to the radiation pattern of a dipole antenna or something similar. Because the charge distribution is oscillating, it's probably acting like a dipole radiator. Dipole radiation has a characteristic radiation pattern where the intensity varies with the angle.

Wait, the radiation from a dipole is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis (so theta = 90 degrees) and it decreases as you go towards the poles (theta = 0 and 180). The radiation pattern for a dipole is symmetric around the axis, right? The intensity should depend on the angle theta as 1 + cos^2(theta), but wait, no, that's the radiation pattern for a dipole in terms of the intensity. Or is it? Let me recall.

Actually, the intensity pattern for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta)). Wait no, that's the radiation pattern for a dipole in terms of the electric field, I think. Wait, when the dipole is aligned along the z-axis, the radiation is strongest perpendicular to it, so theta = 90 degrees. The formula for the radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (2/3) (d^2 E/dt^2)^2 multiplied by sin^2(theta), but wait, maybe I'm mixing up terms.

Wait, no, the radiation pattern for an oscillating dipole is given by the formula for the intensity, which is proportional to (sin^2(theta)) times some function of the wavelength and distance. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the far-field radiation or the radiation zone approximation.

In the far field, the intensity (or the power per unit area) from a dipole is proportional to (1/(r^2)) and also depends on the angle theta. The exact formula for the intensity is something like I = ( (μ0 / (4π)) * (e^2 / (c^3)) ) * (sin^2(theta)) * (ω^2) ) / (r^2) ), where e is the dipole moment. But wait, I'm probably getting into the details here.

But the problem is about the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity. So, the function f would be that expression. But the question is about the form of f and the fraction at theta=30 degrees.

Wait, the total power radiated is the integral of the intensity over all solid angles. So, the maximum intensity occurs at theta=90 degrees, I believe. Because the sin^2(theta) term peaks there.

Wait, the function f(λ, θ) is the power per unit solid angle. So, for a dipole, the intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta). So f(θ) would be proportional to sin^2(theta). Then, the maximum power would be at theta=90 degrees, where sin(theta)=1, so f is maximum as 1.

But wait, the question says that the maximum power is A. So, when theta=90 degrees, f is maximum. So the fraction at theta=30 degrees would be f(30)/A.

So, let's compute f(theta=30 degrees) / f(theta=90 degrees). Since f is proportional to sin^2(theta), then f(30) = sin^2(30) * f_max. Sin(30) is 0.5, so sin^2 is 0.25. So f(30) = 0.25 * f_max, so the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4.

Wait, but wait. The total power is the integral of f over the sphere, right? Because the power is the integral of intensity (power per unit solid angle) multiplied by the solid angle element.

Wait, no, the maximum power per unit solid angle is at theta=90 degrees. But the total power is the integral over all solid angles. But the question is, what fraction of the maximum power (A) is radiated at a specific theta. Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood. Wait, the question says "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta=30 degrees". So it's asking, when the maximum is A, what's the fraction emitted at 30 degrees.

Wait, but if the power per unit solid angle is maximum at 90 degrees, then the power at 30 degrees would be a fraction of that maximum, not of the total power.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the function f(theta) is given, and the maximum value of f is A. So, for each theta, the power per unit solid angle is f(theta) = something. The maximum is at theta=90 degrees, f_max = A.

Therefore, at theta=30 degrees, f(theta) = A * [sin(theta=30)]^2. Because the maximum is A when sin(theta)=1. So, sin(30 degrees)=1/2, so [1/2]^2 = 1/4. So, f(30) = A * 1/4. So, the power at 30 degrees is 1/4 of the maximum.

So the fraction would be 1/4. So the first part is 1/4.

Now, what about the form of f? It's a function of lambda and theta. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. From Maxwell's theory, the radiated power per unit solid angle for an oscillating dipole is proportional to (sin^2(theta)) times (some terms involving the frequency or wavelength). Let me think about the dependence on lambda.

The function f is related to the radiation field. The radiation from a dipole is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r^2), but in the problem, we're in the radiation zone where r is large, so the form would include terms like 1/r^2, but the question is about the dependence on lambda.

Wait, the function f is given as a function of lambda and theta. So perhaps f is proportional to 1/lambda^4 or 1/lambda^3, etc.

Wait, the power radiated by a dipole is proportional to ω^4, because the power goes with E^2, and E is proportional to (ω^2 / c^3) * (e a sin(kr - ωt)), where a is the amplitude. So E ~ (ω^2 e a)/(c^3 r). Then, the power is P ~ (d^2 E/dt)^2 * r^2 sin^2(theta) / (something) ... Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the dipole formula.

The total power radiated by a dipole is given by P = (μ0 / (12π c^3)) * ω^4 |p|^2, where p is the dipole moment. So P depends on ω^4, which is 1/λ^4 because λ = c/(f) = c/(ω/(2π)) → λ = 2π c / ω. So ω = 2π c / λ. So ω^4 = (2π c / λ)^4. Therefore, P is proportional to 1/λ^4.

But wait, the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So f is the intensity, which is P/(4π) or something? Wait, no, the total power is the integral of intensity over 4π steradians. So, f is the intensity, which is (dP)/(dΩ), where dΩ is the solid angle.

But in the case of an oscillating dipole, the intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta) and also proportional to (ω^2)^2, which is ω^4. So f(theta) = k * ω^4 sin^2(theta) / r^2, but wait, the problem states that in the radiation zone, f is a function of lambda and theta. So perhaps the dependence on lambda comes from the ω^4 term, as I said earlier.

But in the function f, since lambda is given, and we have f being proportional to 1/lambda^4 times sin^2(theta). Or is it 1/lambda^something else?

Wait, looking back, the problem says that the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta. So f is a function that depends on lambda and theta. If the function f is in the form proportional to 1/lambda^4 times sin^2(theta), then the correct option should have 1/lambda^4 as the form.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1/4 and lambda^-4.

Option B is 1/4 and lambda^-3.

Option A is 1/2 and lambda^-4.

Hmm. So, from earlier, the fraction is 1/4, and the form is lambda^-4. So the first part (fraction) is 1/4, and the function is proportional to lambda^-4.

So in the options, option C is 1/4 and lambda^-4, which would match.

But wait, let me make sure about the dependence on lambda for the function f. Maybe I should think about the dipole radiation formula.

The intensity (power per unit area) from a dipole is given by:

I = ( (μ0) / (4π) ) * ( (ω^2 μ0) / (3 c^3 ) ) * (p0^2) * sin^2(theta) / r^2.

Wait, but p is the dipole moment, which is p = q a, where a is the amplitude of oscillation. But the exact dependence on ω (or lambda) is what matters here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that the intensity from a dipole is proportional to (ω^4) / r^2. Since ω is 2π c / λ, so ω^4 is proportional to 1/lambda^4. Therefore, the intensity (f) is proportional to 1/lambda^4 times sin^2(theta) / r^2. But wait, the problem says that in the radiation zone, f is a function of lambda and theta. So, perhaps the r dependence is neglected because we're considering the radiation field in the far zone. So, the function f would have the form f(theta, lambda) = k sin^2(theta) / lambda^4.

So the function f is proportional to 1/lambda^4 multiplied by sin^2(theta). That means the form is lambda^-4.

So putting it together, the fraction is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to lambda^-4. So the correct option should be option C: 1/4, lambda^-4.

Looking back at the options:

Option C) 1/4, λ^(-4). Yes, that matches.

The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, which radiates at a wavelength \(\lambda\). The radiated power per unit solid angle, \(f(\lambda, \theta)\), depends on \(\lambda\) and the angle \(\theta\) (measured from the z-axis). The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the possible form of \(f(\lambda, \theta)\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern of a Dipole**:  
   The charge distribution acts like a dipole radiator. The intensity pattern for a dipole is proportional to \(\sin^2(\theta)\), where the maximum intensity occurs at \(\theta = 90^\circ\). The intensity at any other angle \(\theta\) is a fraction of the maximum intensity.

2. **Fraction of Maximum Power at \(\theta = 30^\circ\)**:  
   The intensity at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is proportional to \(\sin^2(30^\circ)\). Since \(\sin(30^\circ) = 1/2\), we have \(\sin^2(30^\circ) = 1/4\). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\).

3. **Dependence of \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) on \(\lambda\)**:  
   The intensity \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) is proportional to \(\sin^2(\theta)\) and also depends on \(\lambda\). For a dipole radiator, the intensity is proportional to \(\omega^4\), where \(\omega = 2\pi c / \lambda\). Substituting \(\omega = 2\pi c / \lambda\), we find that \(\omega^4 \propto 1/\lambda^4\). Therefore, the function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) has the form \(f(\lambda, \theta) \propto \sin^2(\theta) / \lambda^4\).

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   - The fraction of the maximum power at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\).  
   - The function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) depends on \(\lambda^{-4}\).  

   These match the description in **Option C**.

### Conclusion:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\), and the function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) has the form \(\lambda^{-4}\).

So, let's compute f(theta=30 degrees) / f(theta=90 degrees). Since f is proportional to sin^2(theta), then f(30) = sin^2(30) * f_max. Sin(30) is 0.5, so sin^2 is 0.25. So f(30) = 0.25 * f_max, so the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4.

Wait, but wait. The total power is the integral of f over the sphere, right? Because the power is the integral of intensity (power per unit solid angle) multiplied by the solid angle element.

Wait, the question says "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta=30 degrees". So it's asking, when the maximum is A, what's the fraction emitted at 30 degrees.

Wait, but if the power per unit solid angle is maximum at 90 degrees, then the power at 30 degrees would be a fraction of that maximum, not of the total power.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the function f(theta) is given, and the maximum value of f is A. So, for each theta, the power per unit solid angle is f(theta) = something. The maximum is at theta=90 degrees, f_max = A.

Therefore, at theta=30 degrees, f(theta) = A * [sin(theta=30)]^2. Because the maximum is A when sin(theta)=1. So, sin(30 degrees)=1/2, so [1/2]^2 = 1/4. So, f(30) = A * 1/4. So, the power at 30 degrees is 1/4 of the maximum.

So the fraction would be 1/4. So the first part is 1/4.

Now, what about the form of f? It's a function of lambda and theta. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. From Maxwell's theory, the radiated power per unit solid angle for an oscillating dipole is proportional to (sin^2(theta)) times (some terms involving the frequency or wavelength).

Wait, the function f is given as a function of lambda and theta. So perhaps f is proportional to 1/lambda^4 or 1/lambda^3, etc.

Wait, the power radiated by a dipole is proportional to ω^4, because the power goes with E^2, and E is proportional to (ω^2 / c^3) * (e a sin(kr - ωt)), where a is the amplitude. So E ~ (ω^2 e a)/(c^3 r). Then, the power is P ~ (d^2 E/dt)^2 * r^2 sin^2(theta) / (something) ... Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the dipole formula.

The total power radiated by a dipole is given by P = (μ0 / (12π c^3)) * ω^4 |p|^2, where p is the dipole moment. So P depends on ω^4, which is 1/λ^4 because λ = c/(f) = c/(ω/(2π)) → λ = 2π c / ω. So ω = 2π c / λ. So ω^4 = (2π c / λ)^4. Therefore, P is proportional to 1/λ^4.

But wait, the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So f is the intensity, which is P/(4π) or something? Wait, no, the total power is the integral of intensity over 4π steradians. So, f is the intensity, which is (dP)/(dΩ), where dΩ is the solid angle.

But in the case of an oscillating dipole, the intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta) and also proportional to (ω^2)^2, which is ω^4. So f(theta) = k * ω^4 sin^2(theta) / r^2, but wait, the problem states that in the radiation zone, f is a function of lambda and theta. So perhaps the dependence on lambda comes from the ω^4 term, as I said earlier.

But in the function f, since lambda is given, and we have f being proportional to 1/lambda^4 times sin^2(theta). Or is it 1/lambda^something else?

Wait, looking back, the problem says that the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta. So f is a function that depends on lambda and theta. If the function f is in the form proportional to 1/lambda^4 times sin^2(theta), then the correct option should have 1/lambda^4 as the form.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 1/4 and lambda^-3.

Option A is 1/2 and lambda^-4.

Hmm. So, from earlier, the fraction is 1/4, and the form is lambda^-4. So the first part (fraction) is 1/4, and the function is proportional to lambda^-4.

So in the options, option C is 1/4 and lambda^-4, which would match.

But wait, let me make sure about the dependence on lambda for the function f. Maybe I should think about the dipole radiation formula.

The intensity (power per unit area) from a dipole is given by:

I = ( (μ0) / (4π) ) * ( (ω^2 μ0) / (3 c^3 ) ) * (p0^2) * sin^2(theta) / r^2.

Wait, but p is the dipole moment, which is p = q a, where a is the amplitude of oscillation. But the exact dependence on ω (or lambda) is what matters here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that the intensity from a dipole is proportional to (ω^4) / r^2. Since ω is 2π c / λ, so ω^4 is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

So putting it together, the fraction is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to lambda^-4. So the correct option should be option C: 1/4, lambda^-4.

Looking back at the options:
