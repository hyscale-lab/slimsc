Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, right. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, so the calcium is bound by EDTA.

So the problem is about the dissociation of this complex. The concentration of free calcium ions in solution. I think the key here is the formation constant and how it relates to the dissociation.

Formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction for the formation of the Ca-EDTA complex would be something like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2−

Wait, no, wait. Or is it EDTA^4−? Because EDTA has multiple charges. Right, EDTA is usually in the form of H2Y^2−, but under certain pH conditions, it can be deprotonated. But the problem says pH is ideal, so I think we can assume that all the EDTA is in the form that can form the complex, so it's probably Y^4−. So the reaction is:

Ca²+ + Y^4− ⇌ CaY^2−

And the formation constant Kf is given as 5x10^10. Wait, no, wait. The given K is K_Ca-EDTA, which is the same as Kf. So Kf = [CaY^2−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]) = 5e10.

The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of CaY^2− is 0.02 M. Let's assume that some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4−.

Let me set up an ICE table. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So:

Initial:
[CaY^2−] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0 (since it's all complex initially)
[Y^4−] = 0

Change:
[CaY^2−] decreases by x → 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is probably very small)
[Ca²+] increases by x → x
[Y^4−] increases by x → x

So equilibrium concentrations:
[CaY^2−] ≈ 0.02 M (since x is small)
[Ca²+] = x
[Y^4−] = x

Plugging into the Kf equation:

Kf = [CaY^2−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]) = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

We know Kf is 5e10. So:

5e10 = 0.02 / x²
=> x² = 0.02 / 5e10
=> x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 → 4e-14

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.02 is 2e-2.

So x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) ) → 2/(5e12) → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13?

Wait, 2e-2 is 2 * 1e-2. 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5e12) → 0.4 * 1e-12 → 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me compute it.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) = 2 * (1e-13)^0.5 = 2 * 1e-6.5. Because 1e-13 is 1e-6 * 1e-7. Wait, 1e-6 squared is 1e-12; 1e-7 squared is 1e-14. Hmm, maybe I should just calculate it as exponents.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 10^-13 is 10^(-13/2) which is 10^-6.5. So x= 2 * 10^-6.5.

Wait, 10^-6.5 is the same as 10^-6 * 10^-0.5. 10^-0.5 is about 0.3162. So 10^-6.5 ≈ 3.162e-7. So x ≈ 2 * 3.162e-7 = approx 6.324e-7 M.

Wait, so x is about 6.3e-7 M. That's the concentration of Ca²+ ions.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it: when Kf is very large, the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free ions is very low. So starting with 0.02 M complex, the free Ca²+ should be low, which matches our calculation. So that's consistent.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{f}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{f}} = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Initially, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and we assume that a small amount \( x \) dissociates into \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\) and \([\text{Y}^{4-}] = x\). At equilibrium, \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since \( x \) is expected to be very small). Substituting these values into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{f}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Given \( K_{\text{f}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we solve for \( x \):

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Breaking this down further:

\[
10^{-6.5} = 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.5} \approx 10^{-6} \times 0.3162 = 3.162 \times 10^{-7}
\]

\[
x = 2 \times 3.162 \times 10^{-7} \approx 6.324 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.

And the formation constant Kf is given as 5x10^10. Wait, no, wait. The given K is K_Ca-EDTA, which is the same as Kf. So Kf = [CaY^2−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]) = 5e10.

The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of CaY^2− is 0.02 M. Let's assume that some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4−.

Change:

[Y^4−] increases by x → x

So equilibrium concentrations:
[CaY^2−] ≈ 0.02 M (since x is small)
[Ca²+] = x
[Y^4−] = x

Plugging into the Kf equation:

Kf = [CaY^2−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]) = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

We know Kf is 5e10. So:

5e10 = 0.02 / x²
=> x² = 0.02 / 5e10
=> x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 → 4e-14

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.02 is 2e-2.

So x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) ) → 2/(5e12) → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13?

Wait, 2e-2 is 2 * 1e-2. 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5e12) → 0.4 * 1e-12 → 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me compute it.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) = 2 * (1e-13)^0.5 = 2 * 1e-6.5. Because 1e-13 is 1e-6 * 1e-7. Wait, 1e-6 squared is 1e-12; 1e-7 squared is 1e-14. Hmm, maybe I should just calculate it as exponents.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 10^-13 is 10^(-13/2) which is 10^-6.5. So x= 2 * 10^-6.5.

Wait, 10^-6.5 is the same as 10^-6 * 10^-0.5. 10^-0.5 is about 0.3162. So 10^-6.5 ≈ 3.162e-7. So x ≈ 2 * 3.162e-7 = approx 6.324e-7 M.

Wait, so x is about 6.3e-7 M. That's the concentration of Ca²+ ions.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it: when Kf is very large, the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free ions is very low. So starting with 0.02 M complex, the free Ca²+ should be low, which matches our calculation. So that's consistent.
