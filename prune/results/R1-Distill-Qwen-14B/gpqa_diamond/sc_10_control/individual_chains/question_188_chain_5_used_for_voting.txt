Alright, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystal structures, but let me think this through.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms in the structure, right? But in a crystal, that's the lattice constant, the edge length 'a'. So, in a rhombohedral system, all edges are equal, a = b = c, but the angles can be different. Oh wait, no, in a rhombohedral system, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all equal. So in this case, all three angles are 30 degrees.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember there's a formula for calculating interplanar distances using the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

The formula I recall is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - sqrt(2)(hk + hl + kl) * cos(theta) ) ) / (something?), wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but rhombohedral isn't cubic. So I must be using a different formula.

Wait, right! For a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2√3)/a² * (h k + h l + k l) * cos(theta)

But wait, theta here is the angle between the lattice vectors. In a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, so theta is 30 degrees in this case.

Alternatively, another approach: The general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, am I getting this right? Because sometimes the formula varies based on whether it's a primitive or non-primitive lattice, and the type of unit cell.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The general formula for interplanar distances in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is given by the formula:

1/d² = (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c²) + (2hk cos gamma)/(a b) + (2hl cos beta)/(a c) + (2kl cos alpha)/(b c)

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma = theta (30 degrees here). So substituting that in, the formula simplifies.

So, substituting a = b = c = a, and alpha = beta = gamma = theta = 30 degrees. So, the equation becomes:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (2hk cos(theta))/(a²) + (2hl cos(theta))/(a²) + (2kl cos(theta))/(a²)

Wait, because each term like hk is multiplied by cos of the angle between the respective axes. Since all angles are the same, 30 degrees, and a = b = c, all the terms are the same.

So simplifying, that's 1/d² = (h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos(theta) + 2hl cos(theta) + 2kl cos(theta)) ) / a²

Wait, but another approach: when all three angles are equal, the formula for d_{hkl} can be written as:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, is that correct? Because in the cubic case, cos(theta) is zero (since angles are 90 degrees), so the formula reduces to the familiar d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). So yes, that makes sense.

So given that, for a rhombohedral system with theta = 30 degrees, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about the (111) plane. So h, k, l are all 1.

So substituting h = k = l =1, we get:

d^2 = a² / [ (1 + 1 + 1) + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) * cos(30) ]

Calculating the denominator inside the sqrt:

1+1+1 =3.

The second part: 2*(1+1+1) * cos(30) = 2*3*(√3/2) )= 3√3.

So the denominator is 3 + 3√3.

So d^2 = a² / (3 + 3√3 ) = a² / [ 3(1 + √3) ) ].

Taking square root, d = a / sqrt(3(1 + √3)).

Hmm, let's compute that numerically.

Given a is 10 Angstroms.

So compute the denominator: 3*(1 + sqrt(3)).

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So 1 + 1.732 = 2.732.

3 * 2.732 ≈ 8.196.

So d = 10 / sqrt(8.196).

Wait, sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.

So d ≈ 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.491 Angstroms? Wait, but none of the options look like that. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, I must have messed up the formula somewhere.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula as per the general case is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (2 hk cos gamma)/(a²) + (2 hl cos beta)/(a²) + (2 kl cos alpha)/(a² )

But in the rhombohedral case, alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees. So each cos term is cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So,

1/d² = (3)/(10²) + [2*(1*1)*0.866 + 2*(1*1)*0.866 + 2*(1*1)*0.866 ] / (10² )

Wait, let's compute that.

First term: 3/(10)^2 = 3/100 = 0.03.

Second term: [ 2*1*1*0.866 *3 ] / 100.

Because there are three terms: hk, hl, kl each multiplied by cos(theta). Each term is 2*1*1*0.866, so 3 terms make 3*(2*0.866) = 3*1.732=5.196. So 5.196 / 100 = 0.05196.

So total 1/d² = 0.03 + 0.05196 = 0.08196.

So d² = 1 / 0.08196 ≈ 12.20.

So d ≈ sqrt(12.20) ≈ 3.49 Angstroms. Wait, but this doesn't match any of the options either. The options are all around 9 Angstroms, except option D is 10.05, which is higher than a.

Hmm. That's a problem. Maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I confused the formula. Another approach: perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the lattice constants are such that a = b = c, but the angles are different. Wait, but in this case, all angles are 30 degrees, so it's a special case.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. I came across another formula when the crystal is rhombohedral. Maybe the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, but that's what I used earlier, leading to d ≈3.49 A, which isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral structure, the spacing is calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the general formula again. Oh wait, another source I recall, the formula for interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a^2) / ( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) ]^(1/2 )

Wait, that's similar to what I had earlier. Let me compute this again.

Given a =10 A, theta =30 degrees.

So compute denominator:

h² +k² +l² = 1+1+1=3.

2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta): 2*(1+1+1)* (sqrt(3)/2) )= 3*sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So denominator: 3 +5.196=8.196.

So d = 10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈10/2.863≈3.49 A.

Hmm, but the options are all about 9-10 A. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the structure. Wait, alternatively, in a rhombohedral system, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think about the unit cell.

Wait, a rhombohedral system has a basis which might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral system is a function of the lattice parameter.

Wait, wait. For a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a, but in a rhombohedral, the nearest neighbor distance would be a * sqrt( (2 - 2 cos(theta)) ), where theta is the angle.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance. So, if the interatomic distance is 10 A, then perhaps a is not 10 A. Let me think.

In a rhombohedral crystal, the nearest neighbor distance is given by the distance between two adjacent atoms along the edges of the lattice. But wait, no, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor is along the edge, but rhombohedral has a more complex structure.

Wait, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is along the edges (so same as a), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a * sqrt(1 - cos(theta)).

Wait, let's think: the vectors in a rhombohedral system are a, a, a, with angles theta between each pair.

The distance between nearest neighbors could be along the edge, which is a. But if the structure is such that the nearest neighbors are along the edges, then a is the interatomic distance, which is 10 A.

But then why the calculation gives d=3.49 A, which is much smaller than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length, a=10 A, but the (111) interplanar distance is computed as d = a / sqrt(3) ≈5.77 A. But again, that's not matching the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I got the angles wrong. The angles given are 30 degrees, which is quite a small angle. Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles can be less than 90 degrees (acute) or more than 90 degrees (obtuse).

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * sqrt(3) )

Wait, that would be if the angles are 60 degrees, because cos(60)=0.5. Let me see, if theta is 60, cos(theta)=0.5.

Wait, in our case, theta is 30 degrees, so cos(theta)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

Wait, let me recalculate using the formula 1/d² = [ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ] / a².

Wait, that's the same as before. So for hkl = 111, that's 3 + 2*3*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈3 + 5.196=8.196.

So 1/d² = 8.196 / (10^2) = 0.08196.

So d ≈ sqrt(1/0.08196) ≈ sqrt(12.2) ≈3.49 A.

But the options are around 9 A. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm considering the lattice.

Wait, perhaps the lattice is not primitive. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral system, the conventional unit cell can sometimes be larger. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance refers to something else.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the rhombohedral system here is actually a face-centered cubic or similar structure, but I don't think so. Rhombohedral is a separate system.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the formula. Let me check a reference.

Wait, according to my notes, for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar spacing d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = [ (a²) / (h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta)) ]^(1/2 )

Alternatively, another formula I found is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which is what I used earlier.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length of the unit cell. So a=10 A. Then, according to the formula, d=3.49 A. But this isn't matching any of the options.

Wait, but the options are all around 9 Angstroms. Hmm. That suggests that I must have made a mistake in the approach. Let's think differently.

Wait, perhaps the question isn't about the conventional unit cell but about the interatomic distance in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the (111) plane is not the first reflection.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes, so that's the same regardless of reflection.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think of the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different for non-cubic systems, and I'm not using the correct approach.

Wait, another thought: in a rhombohedral system, the Miller indices for the planes relate to the reciprocal lattice vectors. But maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I should use is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) * sqrt( [ 1 - ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) (1 - cos^2(theta)) )/(something) ] )

Wait, that's getting too vague. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the relationship between the lattice parameters and the interplanar distance in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the volume of the unit cell and the volume of the basis. No, that might not help here.

Wait, maybe I should approach this using vectors. Let me model the rhombohedral unit cell as vectors a, b, c each of length a=10 A, with angles 30 degrees between each pair.

The planes in the crystal are defined by their Miller indices (hkl). The (111) plane equation is h x + k y + l z = d. But I think the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the sum of the squares of the reciprocal lattice vectors, but that might be too vague.

Alternatively, the distance between two adjacent (111) planes can be found using the formula:

d = (1/√(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta))) ) * a

Wait, that's the same formula I used earlier.

Wait, but with a=10, theta=30, h=k=l=1.

So denominator is 3 + 2(3) * (sqrt(3)/2) ) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 3 +5.196=8.196.

So d=10 / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 A.

But the options are all around 9 A. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the angles are 30 degrees each, but in some references, the angles are defined differently. For example, sometimes rhombohedral systems are considered with angles of 60 degrees or 90 degrees, but in this case, it's given as 30 degrees.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different when all angles are equal and less than 90 degrees. Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a' but something else. For example, in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance might not be 'a' because the structure is non-cubic.

Wait, let's compute the nearest neighbor distance in a rhombohedral system with a =10 A and theta=30 degrees.

In a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor is a. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is along a diagonal. For example, in a face-centered cubic system, the nearest neighbor is a√2/2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the distance between adjacent atoms in a rhombohedral lattice can be found using the vectors. Let me model it.

The vectors are a, a, a, with angles of 30 degrees between each pair.

The positions of atoms can be described by vectors of the form (h a, k a, l a), but considering the angles, perhaps the distance between (100) and (010) is sqrt( a² + a² + 2 a a cos(theta) ). Wait, no, wait, for two vectors, the distance between two points (hkl) and (h'k'l') in the lattice is given by the magnitude of the difference vector.

So, the distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) is | (a,0,0) - (0,a,0) | = sqrt( (a)^2 + (-a)^2 + 0 ) = sqrt(2 a²) = a√2 ≈14.14 A. But that's larger than the given interatomic distance of 10 A. So that can't be the nearest neighbor.

Hmm, perhaps the nearest neighbor is along a different direction, like (1,1,0). Wait, let's compute that.

Wait, perhaps the nearest neighbor is along the (111) direction. Let me compute the distance from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1).

The vector is (a, a, a), but the angle between any two vectors is 30 degrees. So the distance squared is:

= a² + a² + a² + 2a² cos(theta) (for each pair of vectors). Wait, that's not right. Wait, the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,1) is the magnitude of the vector (a, a, a), but considering the angles between the axes.

Wait, no, the position vectors in a rhombohedral system involve the vectors a, b, c, each with angles of 30 degrees.

The distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) would be the magnitude of (a - b). Since vectors a and b have an angle of 30 degrees between them.

So, the magnitude squared is |a|² + |b|² - 2 a·b.

a·b = |a||b| cos(theta) = a² cos(30) = a² (√3/2).

So the distance squared is a² + a² - 2 a² (√3/2) = 2 a² - a² √3.

With a=10, 2*100=200. 200 - 100 *1.732≈200 -173.2=26.8.

So distance is sqrt(26.8)≈5.176 A. That's the nearest neighbor distance. So the given interatomic distance is 10 A, which is larger than this. So perhaps 'a' is not the interatomic distance but another parameter.

Wait, but the question says the interatomic distance is 10 A. So in that case, the nearest neighbor distance is 5.176 A, and a is 10 A? That can't be, because the given interatomic distance is 10 A.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify:

In the problem statement, the interatomic distance is given as 10 A. So for the rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor distance is 10 A. From my earlier calculation, when a=10, the nearest neighbor distance would be approximately 5.176 A. But in the problem, it's given as 10 A. So perhaps in this case, a is different.

Let me denote the interatomic distance as d_inter = 10 A.

From the calculation above, the nearest neighbor distance is sqrt(2 a² - 2 a² cos(theta) ). Wait, wait, no. Let me recalculate the nearest neighbor distance.

Wait, the nearest neighbor distance is the distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0), which is | (a) - (b) |.

The magnitude is sqrt( a² + a² - 2 a a cos(30°) ) = sqrt( 2 a² (1 - cos(30°) ) ).

Set this equal to 10 A:

sqrt( 2 a² (1 - sqrt(3)/2) ) =10.

Squaring both sides: 2 a² (1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) = 100.

Solve for a²:

a² = 100 / [ 2 (1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) ]

Compute denominator: 2*(1 - 0.866) ≈2*(0.134)=0.268.

a²=100 / 0.268 ≈373.2.

a ≈ sqrt(373.2)≈19.32 A.

Wait, so the lattice parameter a is approximately 19.32 A. But the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 A, so that's the nearest neighbor distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0).

So, now that I have a ≈19.32 A, I can compute the interplanar distance d_{111}.

Using the formula:

d_{111} = a / sqrt( 3 + 3*sqrt(3) )

a ≈19.32 A.

Compute denominator: 3 +3*sqrt(3)≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So d =19.32 / sqrt(8.196)≈19.32 /2.863≈6.75 A.

Hmm, but that's still not matching any of the options. The options are around 9 A.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the correct formula for the nearest neighbor distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the (111) planes are not the nearest planes. But the question is about the (111) plane, so it's the first set that's considered.

Wait, but according to my calculations, the interplanar distance is around 6.75 A. But the options are all around 9 A.

Hmm, maybe I should try a different approach. Let's think about the conventional formula for d-spacing in hexagonal systems, but wait, this is a rhombohedral system.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the given angles are the angles of the unit cell in terms of the vectors a, b, c, but the actual lattice is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula where the angles are 60 degrees instead of 30. Because in some cases, rhombohedral systems are described with angles of 60 degrees.

But the problem statement says 30 degrees, so that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps I should try plugging in the answer options into the formula to see which gives the correct result.

Let me try option C:9.54 A.

So, d=9.54 A.

Using the formula d= a / sqrt(3 + 3√3 )

We have a = d * sqrt(3 +3√3 )

So a=9.54 * sqrt(8.196) ≈9.54 * 2.863≈27.27 A.

Wait, but earlier I found a to be around 19.32 A when the nearest neighbor is 10 A. So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take another approach, such as using the volume of the unit cell.

Wait, the volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a³ * sqrt(1 - cos²(theta) - cos^2(theta) ) or something. Maybe I should compute the volume.

Wait, the volume of the rhombohedral unit cell is given by V = a³ * sqrt(1 - 3 cos(theta) + 3 cos^2(theta) ) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the volume can be computed using the scalar triple product.

The vectors a, b, c are each of length a, and the angles between each pair is theta.

The volume is | (a × b) · c |.

Which equals a*b*c * sqrt(1 + 2 cos(theta) cos(phi) cos(psi) - cos^2(theta) - cos^2(phi) - cos^2(psi)) )

But in a rhombohedral system, a=b=c, and theta=phi=psi=30 degrees.

So,

V = a³ * sqrt( 1 + 2 (cos(theta))^3 - 3 (cos(theta))^2 )

Substituting theta=30, cos(theta)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

So,

V = a³ * sqrt(1 + 2*(0.866)^3 -3*(0.866)^2 )

Compute each term:

(0.866)^2≈0.750.

(0.866)^3≈0.866 *0.750≈0.6495.

So,

1 + 2*0.6495=1+1.299=2.299.

3*(0.750)=2.25.

So, 2.299 - 2.25=0.049.

So V= a^3 * sqrt(0.049) ≈a^3 * 0.221.

So, V = a^3 * 0.221.

But I'm not sure how this helps me find the interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is related to the reciprocal of the reciprocal lattice vectors. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the conventional formula for a hexagonal system, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the interplanar distance for (111) is same as the interatomic distance, 10 A. But option D is 10.05 A. But that can't be correct because the interplanar distance should be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the (111) plane is not a close-packed plane, so the interplanar distance is larger.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me go back.

The correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a²) / ( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) ]^(1/2 )

So, with a=10, theta=30 degrees, hkl=111:

Denominator =3 + 2*(3) * cos(30) = 3 + 6*(0.866)≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So, d=10 / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 A.

But the options are all around 9 A. So perhaps the given a is not 10, but the interatomic distance is 10, which relates to a differently.

Wait, perhaps the lattice parameter a is not the same as the interatomic distance. Because in a simple cubic system, a is the interatomic distance, but in rhombohedral, perhaps the interatomic distance is a different function of a.

Let me think: the interatomic distance 'd_inter' is the distance between adjacent atoms in the structure. In a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbors are not along the edges (a), but perhaps along a diagonal.

Earlier, I calculated that when a=10 A, the nearest neighbor distance is approximately 5.176 A. But in the problem, the interatomic distance is 10 A. So, perhaps in this case, the nearest neighbor distance is 10 A, which would require a different a.

Let me find the value of a such that the nearest neighbor distance is 10 A.

As before, the nearest neighbor distance is the distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0), which is sqrt( 2 a² (1 - cos(theta)) ).

Set that equal to 10 A:

sqrt( 2 a² (1 - cos(30) ) ) =10.

Square both sides: 2 a² (1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) =100.

a² = 100 / [ 2 (1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) ].

Compute denominator: 2*(1 - 0.866)=2*(0.134)=0.268.

a²=100/0.268≈373.2.

a≈sqrt(373.2)≈19.32 A.

So, the lattice parameter a is about 19.32 A.

Now, using this a to compute the interplanar distance for (111):

d = a / sqrt(3 +3√3 )

a=19.32.

Denominator: 3 +3*1.732≈8.196.

So, d=19.32 / 2.863≈6.75 A.

But the options are all around 9 A. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the (111) plane isn't along a diagonal, but a different set.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the interplanar distance using the conventional formula for a hexagonal system, but that's a different structure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula I'm using is for a primitive unit cell, but in reality, the unit cell is larger. Alternatively, perhaps the (111) plane has a different interplanar distance due to the basis.

But without more information, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the interplanar distance is given by the reciprocal of the sum of the squares of the reciprocal lattice vectors.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the problem in terms of the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length. So a=10 A, and then using the formula, d=3.49 A. But that's not matching any option. So perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula used is d = a / (h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta)).

Wait, but that can't be, because d would have the same units as a, but the denominator is dimensionless. Hmm, no, the formula must have a squared in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²) / (a²) + ( ... )

But I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:9.54 Angstrom.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the formula is

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / [ sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) ]

Wait, that seems complicated, but let's compute it.

For h=k=l=1,

numerator: sqrt(3),

denominator: sqrt(3 + 3√3 )=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So, d= a * 1.732/2.863 ≈a * 0.605.

If a=10, d=6.05 A. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of a face-centered cubic structure or something else, but the question says it's a rhombohedral crystal.

Wait, perhaps the formula is reciprocal in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are different.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / sqrt( (h +k + l)^2 (1 - cos(theta) ) ) )

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / sqrt( (h +k + l)^2 (1 - cos(theta) ) ) )

Wait, but for (111), h +k +l=3.

But with theta=30, 1 - cos(theta)=0.134.

So d= a * sqrt(3) / (3 * sqrt(0.134) )

=10 *1.732/(3 * 0.366 )

=17.32/(1.098) ≈15.77 A.

Still not matching.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of the options. Option C is 9.54 A.

What if I compute 10 / (sqrt(3) ) ≈5.77 A. No, too small. 10 / 2=5 A. No.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * [ (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ]^(-1/2)

Which is the same as before. So a=10, d≈3.49 A. Not matching.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the angles given are the angles between the planes, but that's not how Miller indices work.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe for a rhombohedral system, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) )

But with angles, perhaps cos(theta) is 1, which would imply theta=0 degrees, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for the correct formula.

After some research, I found that the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is indeed:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

So, with a=10, theta=30, hkl=111.

Denominator = 3 + 2*(3)*(√3/2) =3 + 3√3≈8.196.

So, d=10 / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 A.

But the options don't include this. Therefore, perhaps the problem is considering a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the diagonal of the unit cell. For a cube, the face diagonal is a√2, space diagonal a√3. But in a rhombohedral system, the diagonals are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the (111) direction. Let's compute the length of that vector.

The vector (1,1,1) would have a magnitude of sqrt( a² + a² + a² + 2a² cos(theta) + 2a² cos(theta) + 2a² cos(theta) )

Which is sqrt(3 a² + 6 a² cos(theta) )

Set this equal to 10 A:

sqrt(3 a² +6 a² cos(theta) )=10.

Square both sides:3 a² +6 a² (sqrt(3)/2 )=100.

Simplify:3a² +3sqrt(3) a² =100.

Factor a²: a² (3 +3√3 )=100.

So a²=100/(3+3√3 )=100/(3*(1+√3 ))=approx 100/(3*2.732)=100/(8.196)=12.20.

a= sqrt(12.20)= approx3.49 A.

Now, using this a to compute the interplanar distance d_{111}.

Using the formula d= a / sqrt(3 +3√3 )

a=3.49 A.

Denominator= sqrt(3 +3√3 )=2.863.

So d=3.49 /2.863≈1.219 A. That's even smaller, which doesn't match the options.

Hmm. This suggests that perhaps the interatomic distance is not along the (111) direction.

I think I've exhausted the approaches I can think of. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C:9.54 A.

But wait, let me compute 10 / sqrt( (1/3) )

Wait, 1/3 square root is about 0.577. 10/0.577≈17.32 A. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the formula without considering the angles, treating it as a cubic system. So d= a / sqrt(3)=10/sqrt(3)=5.77 A. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of a different formula, perhaps one that's incorrect but leads to one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² ), ignoring the angles. So for (111), d=10/sqrt(3)=5.77 A. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / (h +k + l), which would give 10 * sqrt(3)/3 ≈5.77 A.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to provide the interplanar distance without considering the angles, treating it as a cubic system. So, for a cubic system with a=10 A, d=10/sqrt(3)=5.77 A. But the options are higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are 90 degrees, making it a cubic system. Then, d=10/sqrt(3)=5.77 A. But that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the intended answer is option C:9.54 A, which would be 10/sqrt( 1.1547 ) ≈10/1.074≈9.31, which is close to 9.54.

Wait, but that doesn't align with any formula I know.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) ) / ( ... )

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the reciprocal of h, k, l, but I'm not sure.

In the end, I think the intended answer is option C:9.54 A, but I'm not confident. However, based on the calculations I've done, the correct interplanar distance should be about 3.49 A, which isn't an option, suggesting I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different formula. Let me try using the formula for a face-centered cubic system, but that's a different crystal system.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) ]^(1/2 )

Wait, that's the same as I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the angles are the angles between the planes, not between the lattice vectors. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, let's try that. For (111), hkl=1, theta=30.

Denominator =3 - 2*3*(0.866)=3 -5.196= -2.196.

But square root of negative number? No, that can't be.

So that's impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator correctly.

Wait, denominator is 3 + 3√3 =8.196. So d=10 / sqrt(8.196)=3.49.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the diagonal of the face, which in a square face would be a√2. But in rhombohedral, the face diagonal would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the diagonal of the unit cell, which is a√3 in a cubic system. But in rhombohedral, it's more complex.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between two opposite corners of the unit cell, which in a rhombohedral system would be a√(3 + 6 cos(theta) )

So, set that equal to 10.

a√(3 +6 cos(theta) )=10.

With theta=30, cos(theta)=sqrt(3)/2=0.866.

So,

3 +6*0.866=3 +5.196=8.196.

So,

a=10 / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 A.

Then, compute the interplanar distance using a=3.49.

d=3.49 / sqrt(8.196)=3.49/2.863≈1.219 A. No, that's not matching.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the intended answer is option C:9.54 A, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A or B.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula used is d = a / ( h² +k² + l² )^(1/2 ), ignoring the angles.

So for (111), d=10/sqrt(3)=5.77 A. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / (h +k + l), which for (111) would be 10/3≈3.33 A. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / (h +k +l ), which for (111) is 10 * sqrt(3)/3 ≈5.77 A.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / (h² +k² +l²) )^(1/2 ), but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the distance between the planes, but considering all three axes. No, that's what we've been doing.

After all this, perhaps the correct answer is option C:9.54 A. But I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos(\theta)}}
\]

### Step 1: Substituting the parameters
For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and \( \cos(30^\circ) = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866 \). Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) \cos(30^\circ)}}
\]

### Step 2: Simplifying the denominator
1. \( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \),
2. \( 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos(30^\circ) = 2(1 + 1 + 1) \cdot 0.866 = 6 \cdot 0.866 = 5.196 \).

Thus, the denominator becomes:

\[
\sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
\]

### Step 3: Calculating \( d_{111} \)
\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with the options
The calculated interplanar distance \( d_{111} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9–10 Å. This suggests a potential misunderstanding of the problem or a mismatch in the interpretation of the given interatomic distance.

### Step 5: Reassessing the interatomic distance
If the interatomic distance refers to the nearest neighbor distance in the rhombohedral lattice, the lattice parameter \( a \) must be recalculated. For a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor distance is given by:

\[
\text{Nearest neighbor distance} = \sqrt{2a^2(1 - \cos(30^\circ))}
\]

Setting this equal to 10 Å:

\[
\sqrt{2a^2(1 - \cos(30^\circ))} = 10
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
2a^2(1 - \cos(30^\circ)) = 100
\]

Substituting \( \cos(30^\circ) = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866 \):

\[
2a^2(1 - 0.866) = 100 \implies 2a^2(0.134) = 100 \implies a^2 = \frac{100}{0.268} \approx 373.2 \implies a \approx 19.32 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 6: Recalculating \( d_{111} \) with \( a \approx 19.32 \, \text{Å} \)
Using the same formula for \( d_{111} \):

\[
d_{111} = \frac{19.32}{\sqrt{3 + 5.196}} = \frac{19.32}{2.863} \approx 6.75 \, \text{Å}
\]

This value still does not match the options. Given the mismatch, it is possible that the problem assumes a different interpretation or formula for the interplanar distance. Based on the options provided, the closest plausible answer is **option C: 9.54 Å**, though the reasoning behind this choice is unclear.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Alright, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystal structures, but let me think this through.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms in the structure, right? But in a crystal, that's the lattice constant, the edge length 'a'. So, in a rhombohedral system, all edges are equal, a = b = c, but the angles can be different. Oh wait, no, in a rhombohedral system, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all equal. So in this case, all three angles are 30 degrees.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember there's a formula for calculating interplanar distances using the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

The formula I recall is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - sqrt(2)(hk + hl + kl) * cos(theta) ) ) / (something?), wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but rhombohedral isn't cubic. So I must be using a different formula.

Wait, right! For a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2√3)/a² * (h k + h l + k l) * cos(theta)

But wait, theta here is the angle between the lattice vectors. In a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, so theta is 30 degrees in this case.

Alternatively, another approach: The general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, am I getting this right? Because sometimes the formula varies based on whether it's a primitive or non-primitive lattice, and the type of unit cell.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The general formula for interplanar distances in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is given by the formula:

1/d² = (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c²) + (2hk cos gamma)/(a b) + (2hl cos beta)/(a c) + (2kl cos alpha)/(b c)

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma = theta (30 degrees here). So substituting that in, the formula simplifies.

So, substituting a = b = c = a, and alpha = beta = gamma = theta = 30 degrees. So, the equation becomes:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (2hk cos(theta))/(a²) + (2hl cos(theta))/(a²) + (2kl cos(theta))/(a²)

Wait, because each term like hk is multiplied by cos of the angle between the respective axes. Since all angles are the same, 30 degrees, and a = b = c, all the terms are the same.

So simplifying, that's 1/d² = (h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos(theta) + 2hl cos(theta) + 2kl cos(theta)) ) / a²

Wait, but another approach: when all three angles are equal, the formula for d_{hkl} can be written as:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, is that correct? Because in the cubic case, cos(theta) is zero (since angles are 90 degrees), so the formula reduces to the familiar d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). So yes, that makes sense.

So given that, for a rhombohedral system with theta = 30 degrees, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about the (111) plane. So h, k, l are all 1.

So substituting h = k = l =1, we get:

d^2 = a² / [ (1 + 1 + 1) + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) * cos(30) ]

Calculating the denominator inside the sqrt:

1+1+1 =3.

The second part: 2*(1+1+1) * cos(30) = 2*3*(√3/2) )= 3√3.

So the denominator is 3 + 3√3.

So d^2 = a² / (3 + 3√3 ) = a² / [ 3(1 + √3) ) ].

Taking square root, d = a / sqrt(3(1 + √3)).

Hmm, let's compute that numerically.

Given a is 10 Angstroms.

So compute the denominator: 3*(1 + sqrt(3)).

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So 1 + 1.732 = 2.732.

3 * 2.732 ≈ 8.196.

So d = 10 / sqrt(8.196).

Wait, sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.

So d ≈ 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.491 Angstroms? Wait, but none of the options look like that. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, I must have messed up the formula somewhere.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula as per the general case is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (2 hk cos gamma)/(a²) + (2 hl cos beta)/(a²) + (2 kl cos alpha)/(a² )

But in the rhombohedral case, alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees. So each cos term is cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So,

1/d² = (3)/(10²) + [2*(1*1)*0.866 + 2*(1*1)*0.866 + 2*(1*1)*0.866 ] / (10² )

Wait, let's compute that.

First term: 3/(10)^2 = 3/100 = 0.03.

Second term: [ 2*1*1*0.866 *3 ] / 100.

Because there are three terms: hk, hl, kl each multiplied by cos(theta). Each term is 2*1*1*0.866, so 3 terms make 3*(2*0.866) = 3*1.732=5.196. So 5.196 / 100 = 0.05196.

So total 1/d² = 0.03 + 0.05196 = 0.08196.

So d² = 1 / 0.08196 ≈ 12.20.

So d ≈ sqrt(12.20) ≈ 3.49 Angstroms. Wait, but this doesn't match any of the options either. The options are all around 9 Angstroms, except option D is 10.05, which is higher than a.

Hmm. That's a problem. Maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I confused the formula. Another approach: perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the lattice constants are such that a = b = c, but the angles are different. Wait, but in this case, all angles are 30 degrees, so it's a special case.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. I came across another formula when the crystal is rhombohedral. Maybe the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, but that's what I used earlier, leading to d ≈3.49 A, which isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral structure, the spacing is calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the general formula again. Oh wait, another source I recall, the formula for interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a^2) / ( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) ]^(1/2 )

Wait, that's similar to what I had earlier. Let me compute this again.

Given a =10 A, theta =30 degrees.

So compute denominator:

h² +k² +l² = 1+1+1=3.

2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta): 2*(1+1+1)* (sqrt(3)/2) )= 3*sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So denominator: 3 +5.196=8.196.

So d = 10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈10/2.863≈3.49 A.

Hmm, but the options are all about 9-10 A. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the structure. Wait, alternatively, in a rhombohedral system, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think about the unit cell.

Wait, a rhombohedral system has a basis which might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral system is a function of the lattice parameter.

Wait, wait. For a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a, but in a rhombohedral, the nearest neighbor distance would be a * sqrt( (2 - 2 cos(theta)) ), where theta is the angle.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance. So, if the interatomic distance is 10 A, then perhaps a is not 10 A. Let me think.

In a rhombohedral crystal, the nearest neighbor distance is given by the distance between two adjacent atoms along the edges of the lattice. But wait, no, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor is along the edge, but rhombohedral has a more complex structure.

Wait, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is along the edges (so same as a), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a * sqrt(1 - cos(theta)).

Wait, let's think: the vectors in a rhombohedral system are a, a, a, with angles theta between each pair.

The distance between nearest neighbors could be along the edge, which is a. But if the structure is such that the nearest neighbors are along the edges, then a is the interatomic distance, which is 10 A.

But then why the calculation gives d=3.49 A, which is much smaller than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length, a=10 A, but the (111) interplanar distance is computed as d = a / sqrt(3) ≈5.77 A. But again, that's not matching the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I got the angles wrong. The angles given are 30 degrees, which is quite a small angle. Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles can be less than 90 degrees (acute) or more than 90 degrees (obtuse).

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * sqrt(3) )

Wait, that would be if the angles are 60 degrees, because cos(60)=0.5. Let me see, if theta is 60, cos(theta)=0.5.

Wait, in our case, theta is 30 degrees, so cos(theta)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

Wait, let me recalculate using the formula 1/d² = [ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ] / a².

Wait, that's the same as before. So for hkl = 111, that's 3 + 2*3*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈3 + 5.196=8.196.

So 1/d² = 8.196 / (10^2) = 0.08196.

So d ≈ sqrt(1/0.08196) ≈ sqrt(12.2) ≈3.49 A.

But the options are around 9 A. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm considering the lattice.

Wait, perhaps the lattice is not primitive. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral system, the conventional unit cell can sometimes be larger. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance refers to something else.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the rhombohedral system here is actually a face-centered cubic or similar structure, but I don't think so. Rhombohedral is a separate system.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the formula. Let me check a reference.

Wait, according to my notes, for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar spacing d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = [ (a²) / (h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta)) ]^(1/2 )

Alternatively, another formula I found is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which is what I used earlier.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length of the unit cell. So a=10 A. Then, according to the formula, d=3.49 A. But this isn't matching any of the options.

Wait, but the options are all around 9 Angstroms. Hmm. That suggests that I must have made a mistake in the approach. Let's think differently.

Wait, perhaps the question isn't about the conventional unit cell but about the interatomic distance in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the (111) plane is not the first reflection.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes, so that's the same regardless of reflection.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think of the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different for non-cubic systems, and I'm not using the correct approach.

Wait, another thought: in a rhombohedral system, the Miller indices for the planes relate to the reciprocal lattice vectors. But maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I should use is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) * sqrt( [ 1 - ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) (1 - cos^2(theta)) )/(something) ] )

Wait, that's getting too vague. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the relationship between the lattice parameters and the interplanar distance in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the volume of the unit cell and the volume of the basis. No, that might not help here.

Wait, maybe I should approach this using vectors. Let me model the rhombohedral unit cell as vectors a, b, c each of length a=10 A, with angles 30 degrees between each pair.

The planes in the crystal are defined by their Miller indices (hkl). The (111) plane equation is h x + k y + l z = d. But I think the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the sum of the squares of the reciprocal lattice vectors, but that might be too vague.

Alternatively, the distance between two adjacent (111) planes can be found using the formula:

d = (1/√(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta))) ) * a

Wait, that's the same formula I used earlier.

Wait, but with a=10, theta=30, h=k=l=1.

So denominator is 3 + 2(3) * (sqrt(3)/2) ) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 3 +5.196=8.196.

So d=10 / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 A.

But the options are all around 9 A. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the angles are 30 degrees each, but in some references, the angles are defined differently. For example, sometimes rhombohedral systems are considered with angles of 60 degrees or 90 degrees, but in this case, it's given as 30 degrees.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different when all angles are equal and less than 90 degrees. Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a' but something else. For example, in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance might not be 'a' because the structure is non-cubic.

Wait, let's compute the nearest neighbor distance in a rhombohedral system with a =10 A and theta=30 degrees.

In a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor is a. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is along a diagonal. For example, in a face-centered cubic system, the nearest neighbor is a√2/2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the distance between adjacent atoms in a rhombohedral lattice can be found using the vectors. Let me model it.

The vectors are a, a, a, with angles of 30 degrees between each pair.

The positions of atoms can be described by vectors of the form (h a, k a, l a), but considering the angles, perhaps the distance between (100) and (010) is sqrt( a² + a² + 2 a a cos(theta) ). Wait, no, wait, for two vectors, the distance between two points (hkl) and (h'k'l') in the lattice is given by the magnitude of the difference vector.

So, the distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) is | (a,0,0) - (0,a,0) | = sqrt( (a)^2 + (-a)^2 + 0 ) = sqrt(2 a²) = a√2 ≈14.14 A. But that's larger than the given interatomic distance of 10 A. So that can't be the nearest neighbor.

Hmm, perhaps the nearest neighbor is along a different direction, like (1,1,0). Wait, let's compute that.

Wait, perhaps the nearest neighbor is along the (111) direction. Let me compute the distance from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1).

The vector is (a, a, a), but the angle between any two vectors is 30 degrees. So the distance squared is:

= a² + a² + a² + 2a² cos(theta) (for each pair of vectors). Wait, that's not right. Wait, the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,1) is the magnitude of the vector (a, a, a), but considering the angles between the axes.

Wait, no, the position vectors in a rhombohedral system involve the vectors a, b, c, each with angles of 30 degrees.

The distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) would be the magnitude of (a - b). Since vectors a and b have an angle of 30 degrees between them.

So, the magnitude squared is |a|² + |b|² - 2 a·b.

a·b = |a||b| cos(theta) = a² cos(30) = a² (√3/2).

So the distance squared is a² + a² - 2 a² (√3/2) = 2 a² - a² √3.

With a=10, 2*100=200. 200 - 100 *1.732≈200 -173.2=26.8.

So distance is sqrt(26.8)≈5.176 A. That's the nearest neighbor distance. So the given interatomic distance is 10 A, which is larger than this. So perhaps 'a' is not the interatomic distance but another parameter.

Wait, but the question says the interatomic distance is 10 A. So in that case, the nearest neighbor distance is 5.176 A, and a is 10 A? That can't be, because the given interatomic distance is 10 A.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify:

In the problem statement, the interatomic distance is given as 10 A. So for the rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor distance is 10 A. From my earlier calculation, when a=10, the nearest neighbor distance would be approximately 5.176 A. But in the problem, it's given as 10 A. So perhaps in this case, a is different.

Let me denote the interatomic distance as d_inter = 10 A.

From the calculation above, the nearest neighbor distance is sqrt(2 a² - 2 a² cos(theta) ). Wait, wait, no. Let me recalculate the nearest neighbor distance.

Wait, the nearest neighbor distance is the distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0), which is | (a) - (b) |.

The magnitude is sqrt( a² + a² - 2 a a cos(30°) ) = sqrt( 2 a² (1 - cos(30°) ) ).

Set this equal to 10 A:

sqrt( 2 a² (1 - sqrt(3)/2) ) =10.

Squaring both sides: 2 a² (1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) = 100.

Solve for a²:

a² = 100 / [ 2 (1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) ]

Compute denominator: 2*(1 - 0.866) ≈2*(0.134)=0.268.

a²=100 / 0.268 ≈373.2.

a ≈ sqrt(373.2)≈19.32 A.

Wait, so the lattice parameter a is approximately 19.32 A. But the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 A, so that's the nearest neighbor distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0).

So, now that I have a ≈19.32 A, I can compute the interplanar distance d_{111}.

Using the formula:

d_{111} = a / sqrt( 3 + 3*sqrt(3) )

a ≈19.32 A.

Compute denominator: 3 +3*sqrt(3)≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So d =19.32 / sqrt(8.196)≈19.32 /2.863≈6.75 A.

Hmm, but that's still not matching any of the options. The options are around 9 A.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the correct formula for the nearest neighbor distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the (111) planes are not the nearest planes. But the question is about the (111) plane, so it's the first set that's considered.

Wait, but according to my calculations, the interplanar distance is around 6.75 A. But the options are all around 9 A.

Hmm, maybe I should try a different approach. Let's think about the conventional formula for d-spacing in hexagonal systems, but wait, this is a rhombohedral system.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the given angles are the angles of the unit cell in terms of the vectors a, b, c, but the actual lattice is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula where the angles are 60 degrees instead of 30. Because in some cases, rhombohedral systems are described with angles of 60 degrees.

But the problem statement says 30 degrees, so that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps I should try plugging in the answer options into the formula to see which gives the correct result.

Let me try option C:9.54 A.

So, d=9.54 A.

Using the formula d= a / sqrt(3 + 3√3 )

We have a = d * sqrt(3 +3√3 )

So a=9.54 * sqrt(8.196) ≈9.54 * 2.863≈27.27 A.

Wait, but earlier I found a to be around 19.32 A when the nearest neighbor is 10 A. So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take another approach, such as using the volume of the unit cell.

Wait, the volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a³ * sqrt(1 - cos²(theta) - cos^2(theta) ) or something. Maybe I should compute the volume.

Wait, the volume of the rhombohedral unit cell is given by V = a³ * sqrt(1 - 3 cos(theta) + 3 cos^2(theta) ) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the volume can be computed using the scalar triple product.

The vectors a, b, c are each of length a, and the angles between each pair is theta.

The volume is | (a × b) · c |.

Which equals a*b*c * sqrt(1 + 2 cos(theta) cos(phi) cos(psi) - cos^2(theta) - cos^2(phi) - cos^2(psi)) )

But in a rhombohedral system, a=b=c, and theta=phi=psi=30 degrees.

So,

V = a³ * sqrt( 1 + 2 (cos(theta))^3 - 3 (cos(theta))^2 )

Substituting theta=30, cos(theta)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

So,

V = a³ * sqrt(1 + 2*(0.866)^3 -3*(0.866)^2 )

Compute each term:

(0.866)^2≈0.750.

(0.866)^3≈0.866 *0.750≈0.6495.

So,

1 + 2*0.6495=1+1.299=2.299.

3*(0.750)=2.25.

So, 2.299 - 2.25=0.049.

So V= a^3 * sqrt(0.049) ≈a^3 * 0.221.

So, V = a^3 * 0.221.

But I'm not sure how this helps me find the interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is related to the reciprocal of the reciprocal lattice vectors. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the conventional formula for a hexagonal system, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the interplanar distance for (111) is same as the interatomic distance, 10 A. But option D is 10.05 A. But that can't be correct because the interplanar distance should be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the (111) plane is not a close-packed plane, so the interplanar distance is larger.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me go back.

The correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a²) / ( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) ]^(1/2 )

So, with a=10, theta=30 degrees, hkl=111:

Denominator =3 + 2*(3) * cos(30) = 3 + 6*(0.866)≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So, d=10 / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 A.

But the options are all around 9 A. So perhaps the given a is not 10, but the interatomic distance is 10, which relates to a differently.

Wait, perhaps the lattice parameter a is not the same as the interatomic distance. Because in a simple cubic system, a is the interatomic distance, but in rhombohedral, perhaps the interatomic distance is a different function of a.

Let me think: the interatomic distance 'd_inter' is the distance between adjacent atoms in the structure. In a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbors are not along the edges (a), but perhaps along a diagonal.

Earlier, I calculated that when a=10 A, the nearest neighbor distance is approximately 5.176 A. But in the problem, the interatomic distance is 10 A. So, perhaps in this case, the nearest neighbor distance is 10 A, which would require a different a.

Let me find the value of a such that the nearest neighbor distance is 10 A.

As before, the nearest neighbor distance is the distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0), which is sqrt( 2 a² (1 - cos(theta)) ).

Set that equal to 10 A:

sqrt( 2 a² (1 - cos(30) ) ) =10.

Square both sides: 2 a² (1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) =100.

a² = 100 / [ 2 (1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) ].

Compute denominator: 2*(1 - 0.866)=2*(0.134)=0.268.

a²=100/0.268≈373.2.

a≈sqrt(373.2)≈19.32 A.

So, the lattice parameter a is about 19.32 A.

Now, using this a to compute the interplanar distance for (111):

d = a / sqrt(3 +3√3 )

a=19.32.

Denominator: 3 +3*1.732≈8.196.

So, d=19.32 / 2.863≈6.75 A.

But the options are all around 9 A. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the (111) plane isn't along a diagonal, but a different set.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the interplanar distance using the conventional formula for a hexagonal system, but that's a different structure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula I'm using is for a primitive unit cell, but in reality, the unit cell is larger. Alternatively, perhaps the (111) plane has a different interplanar distance due to the basis.

But without more information, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the interplanar distance is given by the reciprocal of the sum of the squares of the reciprocal lattice vectors.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the problem in terms of the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length. So a=10 A, and then using the formula, d=3.49 A. But that's not matching any option. So perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula used is d = a / (h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta)).

Wait, but that can't be, because d would have the same units as a, but the denominator is dimensionless. Hmm, no, the formula must have a squared in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²) / (a²) + ( ... )

But I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:9.54 Angstrom.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the formula is

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / [ sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) ]

Wait, that seems complicated, but let's compute it.

For h=k=l=1,

numerator: sqrt(3),

denominator: sqrt(3 + 3√3 )=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So, d= a * 1.732/2.863 ≈a * 0.605.

If a=10, d=6.05 A. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of a face-centered cubic structure or something else, but the question says it's a rhombohedral crystal.

Wait, perhaps the formula is reciprocal in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are different.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / sqrt( (h +k + l)^2 (1 - cos(theta) ) ) )

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / sqrt( (h +k + l)^2 (1 - cos(theta) ) ) )

Wait, but for (111), h +k +l=3.

But with theta=30, 1 - cos(theta)=0.134.

So d= a * sqrt(3) / (3 * sqrt(0.134) )

=10 *1.732/(3 * 0.366 )

=17.32/(1.098) ≈15.77 A.

Still not matching.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of the options. Option C is 9.54 A.

What if I compute 10 / (sqrt(3) ) ≈5.77 A. No, too small. 10 / 2=5 A. No.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * [ (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ]^(-1/2)

Which is the same as before. So a=10, d≈3.49 A. Not matching.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the angles given are the angles between the planes, but that's not how Miller indices work.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe for a rhombohedral system, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) )

But with angles, perhaps cos(theta) is 1, which would imply theta=0 degrees, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for the correct formula.

After some research, I found that the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is indeed:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

So, with a=10, theta=30, hkl=111.

Denominator = 3 + 2*(3)*(√3/2) =3 + 3√3≈8.196.

So, d=10 / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 A.

But the options don't include this. Therefore, perhaps the problem is considering a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the diagonal of the unit cell. For a cube, the face diagonal is a√2, space diagonal a√3. But in a rhombohedral system, the diagonals are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the (111) direction. Let's compute the length of that vector.

The vector (1,1,1) would have a magnitude of sqrt( a² + a² + a² + 2a² cos(theta) + 2a² cos(theta) + 2a² cos(theta) )

Which is sqrt(3 a² + 6 a² cos(theta) )

Set this equal to 10 A:

sqrt(3 a² +6 a² cos(theta) )=10.

Square both sides:3 a² +6 a² (sqrt(3)/2 )=100.

Simplify:3a² +3sqrt(3) a² =100.

Factor a²: a² (3 +3√3 )=100.

So a²=100/(3+3√3 )=100/(3*(1+√3 ))=approx 100/(3*2.732)=100/(8.196)=12.20.

a= sqrt(12.20)= approx3.49 A.

Now, using this a to compute the interplanar distance d_{111}.

Using the formula d= a / sqrt(3 +3√3 )

a=3.49 A.

Denominator= sqrt(3 +3√3 )=2.863.

So d=3.49 /2.863≈1.219 A. That's even smaller, which doesn't match the options.

Hmm. This suggests that perhaps the interatomic distance is not along the (111) direction.

I think I've exhausted the approaches I can think of. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C:9.54 A.

But wait, let me compute 10 / sqrt( (1/3) )

Wait, 1/3 square root is about 0.577. 10/0.577≈17.32 A. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the formula without considering the angles, treating it as a cubic system. So d= a / sqrt(3)=10/sqrt(3)=5.77 A. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of a different formula, perhaps one that's incorrect but leads to one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² ), ignoring the angles. So for (111), d=10/sqrt(3)=5.77 A. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / (h +k + l), which would give 10 * sqrt(3)/3 ≈5.77 A.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to provide the interplanar distance without considering the angles, treating it as a cubic system. So, for a cubic system with a=10 A, d=10/sqrt(3)=5.77 A. But the options are higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are 90 degrees, making it a cubic system. Then, d=10/sqrt(3)=5.77 A. But that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the intended answer is option C:9.54 A, which would be 10/sqrt( 1.1547 ) ≈10/1.074≈9.31, which is close to 9.54.

Wait, but that doesn't align with any formula I know.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) ) / ( ... )

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the reciprocal of h, k, l, but I'm not sure.

In the end, I think the intended answer is option C:9.54 A, but I'm not confident. However, based on the calculations I've done, the correct interplanar distance should be about 3.49 A, which isn't an option, suggesting I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different formula. Let me try using the formula for a face-centered cubic system, but that's a different crystal system.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) ]^(1/2 )

Wait, that's the same as I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the angles are the angles between the planes, not between the lattice vectors. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, let's try that. For (111), hkl=1, theta=30.

Denominator =3 - 2*3*(0.866)=3 -5.196= -2.196.

But square root of negative number? No, that can't be.

So that's impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator correctly.

Wait, denominator is 3 + 3√3 =8.196. So d=10 / sqrt(8.196)=3.49.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the diagonal of the face, which in a square face would be a√2. But in rhombohedral, the face diagonal would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the diagonal of the unit cell, which is a√3 in a cubic system. But in rhombohedral, it's more complex.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between two opposite corners of the unit cell, which in a rhombohedral system would be a√(3 + 6 cos(theta) )

So, set that equal to 10.

a√(3 +6 cos(theta) )=10.

With theta=30, cos(theta)=sqrt(3)/2=0.866.

So,

3 +6*0.866=3 +5.196=8.196.

So,

a=10 / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 A.

Then, compute the interplanar distance using a=3.49.

d=3.49 / sqrt(8.196)=3.49/2.863≈1.219 A. No, that's not matching.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the intended answer is option C:9.54 A, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A or B.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula used is d = a / ( h² +k² + l² )^(1/2 ), ignoring the angles.

So for (111), d=10/sqrt(3)=5.77 A. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / (h +k + l), which for (111) would be 10/3≈3.33 A. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / (h +k +l ), which for (111) is 10 * sqrt(3)/3 ≈5.77 A.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / (h² +k² +l²) )^(1/2 ), but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the distance between the planes, but considering all three axes. No, that's what we've been doing.

After all this, perhaps the correct answer is option C:9.54 A. But I'm not confident.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos(\theta)}}
\]

### Step 1: Substituting the parameters
For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and \( \cos(30^\circ) = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866 \). Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) \cos(30^\circ)}}
\]

### Step 2: Simplifying the denominator
1. \( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \),
2. \( 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos(30^\circ) = 2(1 + 1 + 1) \cdot 0.866 = 6 \cdot 0.866 = 5.196 \).

Thus, the denominator becomes:

\[
\sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
\]

### Step 3: Calculating \( d_{111} \)
\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with the options
The calculated interplanar distance \( d_{111} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9–10 Å. This suggests a potential misunderstanding of the problem or a mismatch in the interpretation of the given interatomic distance.

### Step 5: Reassessing the interatomic distance
If the interatomic distance refers to the nearest neighbor distance in the rhombohedral lattice, the lattice parameter \( a \) must be recalculated. For a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor distance is given by:

\[
\text{Nearest neighbor distance} = \sqrt{2a^2(1 - \cos(30^\circ))}
\]

Setting this equal to 10 Å:

\[
\sqrt{2a^2(1 - \cos(30^\circ))} = 10
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
2a^2(1 - \cos(30^\circ)) = 100
\]

Substituting \( \cos(30^\circ) = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866 \):

\[
2a^2(1 - 0.866) = 100 \implies 2a^2(0.134) = 100 \implies a^2 = \frac{100}{0.268} \approx 373.2 \implies a \approx 19.32 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 6: Recalculating \( d_{111} \) with \( a \approx 19.32 \, \text{Å} \)
Using the same formula for \( d_{111} \):

\[
d_{111} = \frac{19.32}{\sqrt{3 + 5.196}} = \frac{19.32}{2.863} \approx 6.75 \, \text{Å}
\]

This value still does not match the options. Given the mismatch, it is possible that the problem assumes a different interpretation or formula for the interplanar distance. Based on the options provided, the closest plausible answer is **option C: 9.54 Å**, though the reasoning behind this choice is unclear.

ANSWER: C
