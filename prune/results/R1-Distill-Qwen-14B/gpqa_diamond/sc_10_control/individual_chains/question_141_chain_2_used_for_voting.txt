Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about what happens when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but let's think it through.

First, I need to figure out what the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d is. Wait, what's that 'd' mean? Oh right, I think in organic chemistry, when a substituent is named with a number followed by 'd', it usually refers to the deuterium isotope. So 1-bromobenzene-2-d would have a bromine on the benzene ring at position 1 and a deuterium (a hydrogen replaced by deuterium) at position 2. So the benzene ring has Br at position 1 and D (deuterium) at position 2. So positions 1 and 2 are substituted, and the rest are hydrogen, except for the deuterium at position 2.

Now, the reaction is with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. Sodium amide is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent. In aromatic chemistry, especially with deuterium, this might have something to do with elimination or substitution reactions.

Wait, when we have a deuterium present, the reaction conditions could lead to something called a "Hoffmann elimination" or maybe a "deuterium exchange"? Or perhaps it's about dehydrohalogenation, especially in aromatic systems.

Wait, wait. Another thought: NaNH2 in ammonia is a common condition for dehydrohalogenation. For example, in the synthesis of benzynes. But wait, benzynes are typically prepared from dihalobenzenes. For example, o-dihalobenzenes undergo elimination to form benzyne, which can then undergo various reactions like cycloadditions.

But in this case, we have only one bromine and a deuterium. So wait, is there enough leaving groups for elimination? Let's see. The structure is bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. If we eliminate, we would need two adjacent positions to lose HX. But in this case, the substituents are at 1 and 2. So are they adjacent? Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1 and 2 are adjacent.

So, if the molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium at the adjacent position, maybe the base (NH2-) would abstract a proton (or deuterium) leading to elimination of HBr (but wait, it's deuterium, so would it be DBr?).

Wait, but wait. The substituents are Br at 1 and D at 2. So if the base abstracts the D from position 2, then the Br at position 1 would leave as Br-? Or maybe not. Because elimination typically requires two adjacent leaving groups or a leaving group and a proton.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of elimination where the base abstracts a proton (or deuterium) adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a double bond, but in aromatic systems, that leads to a diradical or a triple bond, forming a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, benzene can't form a double bond because it's already conjugated. Oh wait, no, when two substituents are adjacent, like in o-dihalobenzene, they eliminate to form a triple bond (benzyne). So the benzene ring would lose two substituents (X) and form a triple bond between the two adjacent carbons. But in our case, we don't have two halogens. We have a bromine and a deuterium.

Hmm, so maybe this isn't an elimination reaction. Or perhaps deuterium is acting as a hydrogen here. Because deuterium is a heavy isotope of hydrogen, but in reactions, sometimes it behaves similarly, unless the reaction is highly sensitive to isotope effects, like in some elimination or substitution reactions.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a simple dehydrohalogenation. So NaNH2, a strong base, abstracts a proton (or deuterium) adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond (a diradical intermediate?) or perhaps a benzene ring with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but wait. If we have 1-bromobenzene-2-d, and we treat it with NaNH2 (a strong base) in NH3, perhaps the base abstracts the deuterium (if possible) from position 2, and then the Br leaves, leading to a benzene ring with a positive charge somewhere. But wait, benzene is aromatic, so that's not possible. Maybe not a substitution, but elimination.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of elimination to form a benzene ring with a triple bond, but only if two adjacent leaving groups are present. Alternatively, maybe the Br is replaced by something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about possible products. The reaction is in condensed ammonia with NaNH2, which is a strong base. So perhaps we're looking at a dehydrohalogenation reaction. For example, in such conditions, vicinal dihalides can eliminate to form alkenes or in aromatic cases, benzynes.

But in our case, it's a mono-bromide with a deuterium. So perhaps the deuterium is not a leaving group, but a hydrogen adjacent to Br. Wait, but D is not a good leaving group. So maybe the base abstracts a proton (deuterium) from a position adjacent to Br, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a triple bond.

Wait, but wait. The molecule is 1-bromo-2-d. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So if the base abstracts the D from position 2, then the Br at position 1 would leave as Br-? But then, what happens between the two carbons? You get a triple bond, as in benzynes. But that requires two leaving groups. Wait, but in our case, only one leaving group (Br) and a D, which is not a leaving group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Wait, but substitution would require a good leaving group. Br is a good leaving group, but in aromatic substitution, you usually have more than one leaving group or some activating group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but only with one leaving group. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let's try to think again.

In aromatic systems, elimination reactions often require two adjacent leaving groups. For example, o-dibromobenzene can lose two Br atoms to form benzyne. But in this case, we only have one Br and a deuterium. So maybe the deuterium isn't a leaving group. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the deuterium is involved in some kind of acid-base reaction. Normally, in such conditions, the base (NH2-) would abstract a proton (H+) to form an aromatic ring with a negative charge. But wait, if the H is deuterium, would it be abstracted? Deuterium is less acidic than protium, but under strong basic conditions, maybe it can be abstracted.

So, if the base abstracts the D from position 2, then the adjacent Br at position 1 would have a lone pair, perhaps leading to elimination. But wait, elimination usually requires a proton adjacent to the leaving group. So if the D is abstracted, then the adjacent Br could leave, but that would require a proton to be abstracted, and the Br would leave as Br-.

So, in this scenario, the Br is at position 1 and the D is at position 2. After deprotonation (deuteration), the Br could leave, and a triple bond would form between positions 1 and 2. But wait, the resulting structure would be a triple bond in the benzene ring, making it benzyne. But wait, benzyne is a highly strained structure, but it's a known intermediate.

Wait, but if we start with 1-bromo-2-d benzene, and eliminate HBr (but wait, D is abstracted), would that even form HBr? Or would it be DBr? Because the deuterium is abstracted, so the Br would leave as Br- and the D would combine with the base. Wait, no, the base would abstract the deuterium, and then the Br would leave. So the elimination would produce a triple bond between C1 and C2, releasing HBr? Or would it be H-D?

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. The reaction is NaNH2 in NH3. So the base is NH2^-.

The structure is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So, the Br is at position 1, and the D is at position 2. The ring is benzene with Br and D adjacent.

When NaNH2 is added, the NH2^- would deprotonate the D. Wait, but D is not a proton. No, wait, in this molecule, the position 2 has a deuterium, which is a substituent. So the deuterium is attached to the benzene ring. So the base (NH2^-) would abstract the D from position 2, forming a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 2 and a Br at position 1.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from somewhere else, but in this case, the only other hydrogens are on the ring, but if we have a deuterium at position 2, maybe the base can abstract a hydrogen from another position adjacent to the Br.

Wait, but position 1 has Br, position 2 has D. So maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination where the base abstracts a proton from position 2 (but it's a D, so maybe that's not possible). Wait, but deuterium is less acidic than regular hydrogen, but under strong basic conditions, perhaps it can be abstracted.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the possible products.

If the reaction is elimination, the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But how would that happen? Because we need two leaving groups adjacent to each other, but in this case, we have only one Br and a D.

Wait, maybe the D is a good enough leaving group under these conditions. No, D is not a good leaving group. It's more like a proton (which is a poor leaving group) but heavier.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution. But where would the substitution occur? The Br is a good leaving group. So perhaps the NH2^- acts as a nucleophile and substitutes the Br. But wait, in aromatic substitution, that would require activation of the ring. Electrophilic substitution usually requires activating groups, but NaNH2 is a strong base and a good nucleophile. But aromatic nucleophilic substitution is not common unless the ring is highly activated, like with electron-withdrawing groups.

In this case, the ring has a Br (an EWG) and a D. So perhaps the ring is activated towards nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but I thought that typically, strong bases like NaNH2 are used for elimination rather than substitution in such cases.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a benzyne formation. For benzyne, you usually have two adjacent leaving groups. Without two leaving groups, it's not possible. So perhaps in this case, the D is not a leaving group. So maybe elimination isn't possible. Then what?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation. Let's think: if the base abstracts a hydrogen (or deuterium) adjacent to the Br, and the Br leaves, forming a triple bond. But wait, would that happen with only one leaving group?

Alternatively, perhaps the D is a hydrogen that can be abstracted, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which then eliminates the Br as Br^-.

Wait, let me think about the mechanism. The base (NH2^-) abstracts the D from position 2, making a negative charge on position 2. Then, the Br at position 1 leaves as Br^-, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, the triple bond in benzene (benzyne) is a high-energy structure, but it's possible under such conditions.

So the product would be benzyne (a triple bond between C1 and C2), but with the ring having substituents? Wait, no, because both Br and D are eliminated. So the benzene ring would have a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, but that's the only product.

Wait, but the problem is about the number of possible products. So if the reaction forms only benzyne, then that's one product. But wait, maybe there are other possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's unlikely because the conditions are strong base.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the deuterium doesn't affect the reaction, and the product is the same as if it were 1-bromobenzene. So in that case, the product would be benzyne, but in that scenario, the number of products would be one.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the stereochemistry. If the Br is at position 1 and the D at position 2, and elimination occurs, forming a triple bond between 1 and 2, then the resulting benzyne would have a triple bond in that position. But is there any possibility of forming different products based on the positions?

Wait, no, because the triple bond is between 1 and 2, which are adjacent. So the structure would be a single product.

Alternatively, maybe there's another possible product. For example, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from a different position, but I don't think that's possible. Because the only adjacent H/D is at position 2, and perhaps positions 6 and other, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me draw it out mentally. The benzene ring has Br at position 1. The positions adjacent to Br are positions 2 and 6. Position 2 has a D, so the base could abstract that D. Alternatively, position 6 has a hydrogen. So the base could abstract the H from position 6, leading to elimination of Br from position 1, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6.

Wait, that's a possibility I hadn't considered. So the Br is at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has D, position 6 has H. So the base could abstract D from position 2, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between 1 and 2. Alternatively, the base could abstract H from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and a triple bond between 1 and 6.

Wait, but wait. So if elimination occurs, the triple bond could form between 1 and 2 (if D is abstracted) or between 1 and 6 (if H is abstracted). So that would give two possible products: triple bonds at 1-2 and 1-6. But wait, are those different structures?

Wait, in benzene, positions 1 and 6 are adjacent, so the triple bond between 1 and 6 is the same as between 1 and 2, but in different orientations. But wait, no. If the triple bond is between 1 and 2, that's a different position than between 1 and 6. So are they different products?

Wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering is arbitrary. So perhaps the positions don't matter because of the ring's symmetry. Wait, no. If the triple bond is between 1 and 2, the structure is different from 1 and 6, but because of the ring's symmetry, they are actually the same. Because benzene is symmetric, so whether the triple bond is between 1 and 2 or 1 and 6, it's the same structure because you can rotate the ring.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the benzene ring is numbered in such a way that position 1 is fixed, then position 2 is adjacent to 1 in one direction, and position 6 is adjacent in the other. So if you form a triple bond between 1 and 2, that's a different structure than between 1 and 6. Because the ring's substituents are arranged in a certain way.

Wait, but in the starting material, the substituents are at 1 and 2. So when you eliminate, the positions where the triple bond forms are determined by the positions of the H and Br. So in this case, when you eliminate, the triple bond forms between 1 and 2 (because the abstracted D is at 2), or between 1 and 6 (if the abstracted H is at 6).

Wait, but the starting material has Br at 1 and D at 2. So if the base abstracts the D from position 2, elimination occurs between 1 and 2, forming a triple bond there. If the base abstracts a H from position 6 (assuming that position 6 is available), then elimination would occur between 1 and 6. So that would give two different products.

Wait, but is position 6 available? Because in the starting molecule, positions 1, 2, and 6 are adjacent to position 1. But position 6 is just a hydrogen (since the molecule is 1-bromo-2-d). So position 6 has a hydrogen, which can be abstracted by the base, leading to elimination between 1 and 6.

So in that case, you could have two possible sites for elimination: between 1-2 (using D at 2) and between 1-6 (using H at 6). So that would give two different products, right?

Wait, but in reality, would the base preferentially abstract D or H? Because deuterium is less acidic than protium, so the base would prefer to abstract a proton (H) over a deuterium. So perhaps the major product would be the elimination between 1 and 6, but the minor product could be elimination between 1 and 2.

Alternatively, maybe the base can abstract either, leading to two possible products.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the actual reaction conditions. NaNH2 is a very strong base, so it's possible that both H and D are abstracted. But deuterium is less acidic, so maybe the H abstraction is more favorable. So the major product would be the triple bond between 1 and 6, but perhaps a minor product exists between 1 and 2.

But if the problem is asking for the number of possible products, regardless of their amounts, then both would be considered. So that would give two products.

Wait, but wait. When you eliminate between 1 and 2, you have a triple bond between those two, and when you eliminate between 1 and 6, you have another triple bond. But are those considered different structures? Because the benzene ring is symmetric, but the substituents are fixed.

Wait, in the starting material, substituents are at 1 and 2. So if the triple bond forms between 1 and 2, that's a specific orientation. If it forms between 1 and 6, that's another. But since the ring is symmetric, perhaps these are not different structures. Wait, no, because the substituents (Br and D) are at specific positions.

Wait, no. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So the Br is at position 1, and D is at position 2. So when the triple bond forms between 1 and 2, the ring would have the triple bond adjacent to the D. But when it forms between 1 and 6, the triple bond is adjacent to position 6, which is a hydrogen (not D). So these are two different products.

Wait, but in the reaction, which substituents are present? Because when the triple bond forms, the substituents (Br and D) are lost. Wait, no, because the Br leaves as Br^- when elimination occurs.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The elimination reaction involves losing HBr (or HD?), but in this case, the Br is leaving as Br^- and the D is being abstracted as D^- (or H-D? I'm getting a bit confused here).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of mechanism. The base (NH2^-) abstracts a proton (H or D) adjacent to the Br. Then the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between the two adjacent carbons.

So in this case, the Br is at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has D, position 6 has H.

So if the base abstracts the H from position 6, then the Br at 1 leaves, and a triple bond forms between 1 and 6. Similarly, if the base abstracts the D from position 2, the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between 1 and 2.

So that would lead to two different products: one with the triple bond between 1 and 6, and another between 1 and 2.

Wait, but in the starting material, the substituents are at positions 1 (Br) and 2 (D). So when elimination occurs, the substituents are removed, and the triple bond is formed. So what's left is a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 2, or between 1 and 6.

But wait, in terms of the molecule, after elimination, do we have any substituents left? Because the Br and the H/D are both leaving. So the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between two adjacent carbons, and no substituents other than the ring itself.

Wait, no. Because the substituents (Br and D) are on adjacent positions, and when they both leave, the triple bond is formed in their place. So perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 2 (if the D is abstracted from 2) or between 1 and 6 (if H is abstracted from 6).

Wait, but once the triple bond forms, the substituents (Br and D) are no longer present. So the product is simply benzyne, which is a benzene ring with a triple bond between two positions.

But wait, benzyne is a cyclic diradical, but often depicted as having a triple bond. So the product is benzyne, but how many isomers are possible?

In benzene, if the triple bond can be in different positions, then each position would give a different benzyne isomer. But in our case, the starting material has substituents at positions 1 and 2, so the triple bond can form between 1 and 2, or between 1 and 6 (but I'm not sure about that).

Wait, but the starting material has substituents at positions 1 and 2. So when the base abstracts a proton (or D) from position 2, the triple bond forms between 1 and 2, leading to benzyne with the triple bond there. If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, the triple bond forms between 1 and 6, leading to a different benzyne structure.

But wait, can the triple bond form between 1 and 6? Because position 6 is adjacent to position 1, so yes. So that would give two different products.

But wait, no. Because the benzyne is a ring, the triple bond can be in any position, but in our case, the initial substituents fix the positions where elimination can occur.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is the same regardless of where the elimination occurs because of the symmetry of the benzene ring.

Wait, no. Because the starting material has substituents at positions 1 and 2, which are adjacent. So the two possible eliminations would lead to triple bonds in different positions relative to the ring's substituents, but since the substituents are gone in the product, perhaps the position of the triple bond doesn't matter.

Wait, but the product is just benzyne. So regardless of where the triple bond is, it's the same molecule. Or is it?

Wait, no. Benzyne is a cyclic molecule with a triple bond. Depending on where the triple bond is, the structure can be different. For example, in ortho-benzyne, the triple bond is between two adjacent positions (like 1 and 2), and in meta positions, but benzene doesn't have meta positions for a triple bond. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so if the triple bond is between 1 and 2, it's the same as between 2 and 3, etc., due to rotation.

Wait, no, the triple bond is fixed between specific carbons. So in this case, the position of the triple bond is fixed based on where the elimination occurs. So if elimination occurs between 1 and 2, the triple bond is there. If between 1 and 6, it's there. But in a benzene ring, these are different positions relative to each other.

But wait, since the benzene ring is symmetric, the position of the triple bond could be in different positions, but they are all equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. So, perhaps regardless of which adjacent position is chosen for elimination, the product is the same.

But in this case, the starting material has substituents that fix the positions. For example, in 1-bromo-2-d benzene, elimination can only occur between positions 1 and 2 (using the D) or between 1 and 6 (using the H). So the product would be a benzyne with the triple bond in either position 1-2 or 1-6, but are these two different structures?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the benzene ring as a hexagon. Position 1 is at the top, position 2 at the top-right, position 3 at the bottom-right, position 4 at the bottom, position 5 at the bottom-left, and position 6 at the top-left.

So if the triple bond is between 1 and 2 (top and top-right), or between 1 and 6 (top and top-left). Now, is a triple bond between 1 and 2 the same as between 1 and 6? Because the ring can be rotated, but in this specific case, the substituents were at 1 and 2, so the orientation is fixed.

Wait, but in the product, after elimination, the substituents (Br and D) are gone. So the benzene ring is just a plain ring with a triple bond. But the triple bond could be in any position, but in this case, the reaction leads to only two possible positions: 1-2 and 1-6.

Wait, but in reality, the benzene ring is symmetric, so a triple bond between positions 1-2 is the same as between 2-3, etc., due to rotation. So regardless of where the triple bond forms, it's the same structure. So perhaps only one product is formed.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the starting material's substituents are fixed. So elimination can only occur between 1-2 and 1-6, leading to two different triple bond positions.

But if the product is just a triple bond anywhere, due to the ring's symmetry, perhaps only one product is possible. Because the triple bond can be anywhere in the ring, and the ring can rotate, so it's considered the same molecule regardless of where the triple bond is.

Wait, but I'm not sure. If the starting material's substituents are fixed, the elimination can only occur in certain positions, leading to specific triple bond positions. But if the product is just a plain benzene ring with a triple bond, the position doesn't matter because the molecule can rotate.

Wait, no. In reality, the product would have a fixed triple bond position based on the starting material. For example, if the triple bond is between 1 and 2, and another is between 1 and 6, these are distinct structures, but due to the ring's symmetry, they are actually the same. Because you can rotate the ring 180 degrees, and the triple bond would be in the same position relative to the ring's structure.

Wait, perhaps not. Because the starting material has substituents at 1 and 2, which are adjacent. So when elimination occurs, the triple bond is either between 1 and 2 (same as substituent positions) or between 1 and 6. But since the substituents are gone, the product is a plain benzene ring with a triple bond. So the position of the triple bond doesn't matter, and the product is the same.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to summarize:

1. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene.
2. NaNH2 is a strong base that can abstract protons (H) or deuterium (D).
3. The Br is at position 1, and D is at position 2.
4. The base can abstract H from position 6 or D from position 2, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between 1-6 or 1-2.
5. Each elimination leads to a different product, but due to the ring's symmetry, these products are actually the same.

Therefore, only one product is formed. But wait, am I confident about that?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because the deuterium isn't a good enough leaving group. But I think the base would abstract the H from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of the triple bond between 1 and 6.

Wait, but then what about the D at position 2? After elimination, the D is gone as part of the elimination? Or is it just abstracted as H-D?

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts the H from position 6, leading to elimination of Br, and the D remains on the ring. No, that can't be because the D is at position 2, and the elimination is between 1 and 6.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, which is either position 2 (D) or position 6 (H). If the base abstracts D from position 2, then the elimination would occur between 1 and 2, forming a triple bond there. If the base abstracts H from position 6, the elimination would be between 1 and 6, forming a triple bond there.

In both cases, the D would remain on position 2, but that's not possible because the elimination removes the adjacent H or D. Wait, no. Wait, in elimination, the leaving group (Br) and the abstracted proton (H or D) are removed, and the triple bond forms between the two carbons.

Wait, no. The Br is at position 1. The abstracted proton is at position 2 or 6. So when the Br leaves, the electrons from the C-Br bond form a bond with the adjacent carbon, leading to a triple bond.

So in the case where the base abstracts position 2's D, the Br leaves, and the triple bond forms between 1 and 2. The D is abstracted as HD (since the base is NH2^-), which isn't a leaving group but is part of the elimination.

Wait, but I'm getting confused again. Let's think about the mechanism:

1. Base (NH2^-) abstracts a proton (H or D) from a position adjacent to Br (positions 2 or 6).
2. This creates a carbanion at that position.
3. The Br leaves as Br^-.
4. The carbanion and the adjacent carbon (formerly bonded to Br) share electrons, forming a triple bond.

So, in the case where the base abstracts D from position 2, the triple bond forms between 1 and 2. The D is abstracted as part of the base and leaves as HD (but that's probably negligible in this context). Similarly, if the base abstracts H from position 6, the triple bond forms between 1 and 6.

In each case, the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between two adjacent positions. But because the benzene ring is symmetric, these two triple bonds are equivalent. So regardless of whether the elimination occurs at 1-2 or 1-6, the product is the same benzyne.

Wait, but benzyne is a symmetric molecule, so the position of the triple bond doesn't matter. So only one product is formed.

Wait, but that can't be right because the starting material has Br and D in specific positions, leading to different possible eliminations. But perhaps the product is the same regardless.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzyne at all. Maybe the conditions are such that substitution occurs instead. Let me think.

If the Br is replaced by the amide ion (NH2^-), then the product would be 1-amino-2-d benzene. But wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and in aromatic substitution, it's more likely to lead to elimination than substitution, especially without activating groups. So perhaps substitution isn't the major pathway here.

Wait, but the ring has a Br (an EWG) and a D. So perhaps the ring is activated towards nucleophilic substitution. But I'm not sure. In any case, the question is about possible products, so substitution could be a possibility.

But in this case, substitution would result in a single product: 1-amino-2-d benzene. So that's another possibility.

Wait, but then we have two possible reaction pathways: elimination (forming benzyne) or substitution (forming aniline derivative). But I'm not sure if substitution occurs under these conditions.

Wait, sodium amide is a strong base and a good nucleophile. In aromatic substitution, especially when the ring is activated, substitution can occur. But in our case, the ring has a Br, which is an EWG, but also a D, which is just a substituent.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the D is replaced. But D is not a good leaving group, so substitution at D isn't likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form benzyne, which then can undergo other reactions, but the question is only about the products of the initial reaction. So only benzyne is formed.

But earlier, I thought that elimination could lead to two different products, but due to ring symmetry, it's just one product.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product as a single species, regardless of the elimination position. So the number of possible organic products is one.

But wait, another point: the reaction could also produce a diradical intermediate, leading to different products. Or perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but I think it does.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any product, but that's unlikely.

So putting it all together: the reaction forms benzyne as the product. Because the starting material's substituents are fixed, but the product is a plain benzene ring with a triple bond, which can be anywhere due to symmetry, leading to only one product.

Wait, but earlier I thought that elimination could occur in two positions, leading to two products, but due to symmetry, they are the same. So only one product forms.

Wait, but another possibility: when the triple bond forms, it's between 1 and 2, which are adjacent. But in the product, the ring's substituents are gone, so the structure is just benzyne. So regardless of the starting substituents, the product is the same.

Wait, but in the starting material, the substituents are at 1 and 2, so the triple bond could form between 1 and 2 or between 1 and 6, but those are two different positions. But in the ring, these positions are equivalent due to the ring's symmetry.

Wait, no. If the triple bond is between 1 and 2, then the structure is different from between 1 and 6. Because the benzene ring is symmetric, but the numbering is fixed. So if you have a triple bond between 1 and 2, it's a different structure than between 1 and 6, but in reality, the two are related by rotation, so they are the same.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. The question is asking how many possible organic products are there. The possible products are either benzyne or some substitution product.

But substitution is less likely, so perhaps elimination is the main pathway, giving one product.

Wait, but another thing: the reaction could produce a mixture of products if the elimination occurs at different positions, but in reality, the starting material's substituents would direct where the elimination can occur.

Wait, in 1-bromo-2-d benzene, the Br is at 1 and D at 2. The base can abstract H from position 6 or D from position 2. So if both are possible, then two products are formed: triple bonds at 1-2 and 1-6. But in the benzene ring, these are equivalent structures because the ring can be rotated.

So the product is the same in both cases, leading to a single product.

Wait, but in reality, the elimination can only occur at specific positions. For example, the D is at 2, so the base can abstract that, leading to a specific triple bond position. But the H at 6 is also available, leading to another position.

But the product would be the same because the ring's structure doesn't care where the triple bond is. So only one product is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to two different products because the triple bond can be in two different positions relative to the starting material's substituents.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: think about what the options are. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the product is benzyne, which is a single structure, then only one product is formed. So the answer would be B)1.

Alternatively, if two different products are possible, the answer would be C)2.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any product, but that's not likely.

Another thought: maybe the reaction leads to more than one product because of different possible substitution patterns. For example, if the substitution occurs at position 1 (Br replaced by NH2), that's one product. And elimination forms another product (benzyne). So that would be two products.

But I think substitution is less likely here because the conditions are strongly basic, favoring elimination.

So if the reaction is substitution, product is 1-amino-2-d benzene. If elimination, product is benzyne. But I'm not sure if both can happen.

Alternatively, perhaps only elimination occurs, leading to one product.

In that case, the number of products is one, so answer B)1.

But earlier I thought that elimination could lead to two products, but due to ring symmetry, it's one. So I'm leaning towards B)1.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. The molecule has a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2 on the benzene ring. Sodium amide (NaNH₂) is a strong base, commonly used for dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. The key steps and considerations are as follows:

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The benzene ring has a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. Positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, making them potential candidates for elimination.

2. **Reaction Mechanism**:  
   NaNH₂ acts as a base and can abstract a proton or deuterium from a position adjacent to the bromine. This leads to the elimination of HBr (or HD) and the formation of a triple bond (benzyne) between the two adjacent carbons.

3. **Possible Elimination Sites**:  
   - The base can abstract the deuterium from position 2, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 2.  
   - The base can also abstract a hydrogen from position 6 (adjacent to position 1), leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6.

4. **Symmetry of Benzene**:  
   Benzene is a symmetric molecule, and the positions of the triple bond (between 1-2 or 1-6) are equivalent due to the ring's rotational symmetry. Therefore, regardless of where the elimination occurs, the product is the same: benzyne.

5. **Substitution vs. Elimination**:  
   Substitution reactions are less likely under these strongly basic conditions, as elimination is favored. Thus, the primary product is benzyne.

6. **Number of Products**:  
   Since the reaction leads to a single product (benzyne), regardless of the specific elimination site, there is only one possible organic product.

**Conclusion**: The reaction produces one product, benzyne.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about what happens when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but let's think it through.

First, I need to figure out what the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d is. Wait, what's that 'd' mean? Oh right, I think in organic chemistry, when a substituent is named with a number followed by 'd', it usually refers to the deuterium isotope. So 1-bromobenzene-2-d would have a bromine on the benzene ring at position 1 and a deuterium (a hydrogen replaced by deuterium) at position 2. So the benzene ring has Br at position 1 and D (deuterium) at position 2. So positions 1 and 2 are substituted, and the rest are hydrogen, except for the deuterium at position 2.

Now, the reaction is with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. Sodium amide is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent. In aromatic chemistry, especially with deuterium, this might have something to do with elimination or substitution reactions.

Wait, when we have a deuterium present, the reaction conditions could lead to something called a "Hoffmann elimination" or maybe a "deuterium exchange"? Or perhaps it's about dehydrohalogenation, especially in aromatic systems.

Wait, wait. Another thought: NaNH2 in ammonia is a common condition for dehydrohalogenation. For example, in the synthesis of benzynes. But wait, benzynes are typically prepared from dihalobenzenes. For example, o-dihalobenzenes undergo elimination to form benzyne, which can then undergo various reactions like cycloadditions.

But in this case, we have only one bromine and a deuterium. So wait, is there enough leaving groups for elimination? Let's see. The structure is bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. If we eliminate, we would need two adjacent positions to lose HX. But in this case, the substituents are at 1 and 2. So are they adjacent? Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1 and 2 are adjacent.

So, if the molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium at the adjacent position, maybe the base (NH2-) would abstract a proton (or deuterium) leading to elimination of HBr (but wait, it's deuterium, so would it be DBr?).

Wait, but wait. The substituents are Br at 1 and D at 2. So if the base abstracts the D from position 2, then the Br at position 1 would leave as Br-? Or maybe not. Because elimination typically requires two adjacent leaving groups or a leaving group and a proton.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of elimination where the base abstracts a proton (or deuterium) adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a double bond, but in aromatic systems, that leads to a diradical or a triple bond, forming a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, benzene can't form a double bond because it's already conjugated. Oh wait, no, when two substituents are adjacent, like in o-dihalobenzene, they eliminate to form a triple bond (benzyne). So the benzene ring would lose two substituents (X) and form a triple bond between the two adjacent carbons. But in our case, we don't have two halogens. We have a bromine and a deuterium.

Hmm, so maybe this isn't an elimination reaction. Or perhaps deuterium is acting as a hydrogen here. Because deuterium is a heavy isotope of hydrogen, but in reactions, sometimes it behaves similarly, unless the reaction is highly sensitive to isotope effects, like in some elimination or substitution reactions.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a simple dehydrohalogenation. So NaNH2, a strong base, abstracts a proton (or deuterium) adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond (a diradical intermediate?) or perhaps a benzene ring with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but wait. If we have 1-bromobenzene-2-d, and we treat it with NaNH2 (a strong base) in NH3, perhaps the base abstracts the deuterium (if possible) from position 2, and then the Br leaves, leading to a benzene ring with a positive charge somewhere. But wait, benzene is aromatic, so that's not possible. Maybe not a substitution, but elimination.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of elimination to form a benzene ring with a triple bond, but only if two adjacent leaving groups are present. Alternatively, maybe the Br is replaced by something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about possible products. The reaction is in condensed ammonia with NaNH2, which is a strong base. So perhaps we're looking at a dehydrohalogenation reaction. For example, in such conditions, vicinal dihalides can eliminate to form alkenes or in aromatic cases, benzynes.

But in our case, it's a mono-bromide with a deuterium. So perhaps the deuterium is not a leaving group, but a hydrogen adjacent to Br. Wait, but D is not a good leaving group. So maybe the base abstracts a proton (deuterium) from a position adjacent to Br, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a triple bond.

Wait, but wait. The molecule is 1-bromo-2-d. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So if the base abstracts the D from position 2, then the Br at position 1 would leave as Br-? But then, what happens between the two carbons? You get a triple bond, as in benzynes. But that requires two leaving groups. Wait, but in our case, only one leaving group (Br) and a D, which is not a leaving group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Wait, but substitution would require a good leaving group. Br is a good leaving group, but in aromatic substitution, you usually have more than one leaving group or some activating group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but only with one leaving group. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let's try to think again.

In aromatic systems, elimination reactions often require two adjacent leaving groups. For example, o-dibromobenzene can lose two Br atoms to form benzyne. But in this case, we only have one Br and a deuterium. So maybe the deuterium isn't a leaving group. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the deuterium is involved in some kind of acid-base reaction. Normally, in such conditions, the base (NH2-) would abstract a proton (H+) to form an aromatic ring with a negative charge. But wait, if the H is deuterium, would it be abstracted? Deuterium is less acidic than protium, but under strong basic conditions, maybe it can be abstracted.

So, if the base abstracts the D from position 2, then the adjacent Br at position 1 would have a lone pair, perhaps leading to elimination. But wait, elimination usually requires a proton adjacent to the leaving group. So if the D is abstracted, then the adjacent Br could leave, but that would require a proton to be abstracted, and the Br would leave as Br-.

So, in this scenario, the Br is at position 1 and the D is at position 2. After deprotonation (deuteration), the Br could leave, and a triple bond would form between positions 1 and 2. But wait, the resulting structure would be a triple bond in the benzene ring, making it benzyne. But wait, benzyne is a highly strained structure, but it's a known intermediate.

Wait, but if we start with 1-bromo-2-d benzene, and eliminate HBr (but wait, D is abstracted), would that even form HBr? Or would it be DBr? Because the deuterium is abstracted, so the Br would leave as Br- and the D would combine with the base. Wait, no, the base would abstract the deuterium, and then the Br would leave. So the elimination would produce a triple bond between C1 and C2, releasing HBr? Or would it be H-D?

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. The reaction is NaNH2 in NH3. So the base is NH2^-.

The structure is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So, the Br is at position 1, and the D is at position 2. The ring is benzene with Br and D adjacent.

When NaNH2 is added, the NH2^- would deprotonate the D. Wait, but D is not a proton. No, wait, in this molecule, the position 2 has a deuterium, which is a substituent. So the deuterium is attached to the benzene ring. So the base (NH2^-) would abstract the D from position 2, forming a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 2 and a Br at position 1.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from somewhere else, but in this case, the only other hydrogens are on the ring, but if we have a deuterium at position 2, maybe the base can abstract a hydrogen from another position adjacent to the Br.

Wait, but position 1 has Br, position 2 has D. So maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination where the base abstracts a proton from position 2 (but it's a D, so maybe that's not possible). Wait, but deuterium is less acidic than regular hydrogen, but under strong basic conditions, perhaps it can be abstracted.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the possible products.

If the reaction is elimination, the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But how would that happen? Because we need two leaving groups adjacent to each other, but in this case, we have only one Br and a D.

Wait, maybe the D is a good enough leaving group under these conditions. No, D is not a good leaving group. It's more like a proton (which is a poor leaving group) but heavier.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution. But where would the substitution occur? The Br is a good leaving group. So perhaps the NH2^- acts as a nucleophile and substitutes the Br. But wait, in aromatic substitution, that would require activation of the ring. Electrophilic substitution usually requires activating groups, but NaNH2 is a strong base and a good nucleophile. But aromatic nucleophilic substitution is not common unless the ring is highly activated, like with electron-withdrawing groups.

In this case, the ring has a Br (an EWG) and a D. So perhaps the ring is activated towards nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but I thought that typically, strong bases like NaNH2 are used for elimination rather than substitution in such cases.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a benzyne formation. For benzyne, you usually have two adjacent leaving groups. Without two leaving groups, it's not possible. So perhaps in this case, the D is not a leaving group. So maybe elimination isn't possible. Then what?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation. Let's think: if the base abstracts a hydrogen (or deuterium) adjacent to the Br, and the Br leaves, forming a triple bond. But wait, would that happen with only one leaving group?

Alternatively, perhaps the D is a hydrogen that can be abstracted, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which then eliminates the Br as Br^-.

Wait, let me think about the mechanism. The base (NH2^-) abstracts the D from position 2, making a negative charge on position 2. Then, the Br at position 1 leaves as Br^-, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, the triple bond in benzene (benzyne) is a high-energy structure, but it's possible under such conditions.

So the product would be benzyne (a triple bond between C1 and C2), but with the ring having substituents? Wait, no, because both Br and D are eliminated. So the benzene ring would have a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, but that's the only product.

Wait, but the problem is about the number of possible products. So if the reaction forms only benzyne, then that's one product. But wait, maybe there are other possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's unlikely because the conditions are strong base.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the deuterium doesn't affect the reaction, and the product is the same as if it were 1-bromobenzene. So in that case, the product would be benzyne, but in that scenario, the number of products would be one.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the stereochemistry. If the Br is at position 1 and the D at position 2, and elimination occurs, forming a triple bond between 1 and 2, then the resulting benzyne would have a triple bond in that position. But is there any possibility of forming different products based on the positions?

Wait, no, because the triple bond is between 1 and 2, which are adjacent. So the structure would be a single product.

Alternatively, maybe there's another possible product. For example, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from a different position, but I don't think that's possible. Because the only adjacent H/D is at position 2, and perhaps positions 6 and other, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me draw it out mentally. The benzene ring has Br at position 1. The positions adjacent to Br are positions 2 and 6. Position 2 has a D, so the base could abstract that D. Alternatively, position 6 has a hydrogen. So the base could abstract the H from position 6, leading to elimination of Br from position 1, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6.

Wait, that's a possibility I hadn't considered. So the Br is at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has D, position 6 has H. So the base could abstract D from position 2, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between 1 and 2. Alternatively, the base could abstract H from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and a triple bond between 1 and 6.

Wait, but wait. So if elimination occurs, the triple bond could form between 1 and 2 (if D is abstracted) or between 1 and 6 (if H is abstracted). So that would give two possible products: triple bonds at 1-2 and 1-6. But wait, are those different structures?

Wait, in benzene, positions 1 and 6 are adjacent, so the triple bond between 1 and 6 is the same as between 1 and 2, but in different orientations. But wait, no. If the triple bond is between 1 and 2, that's a different position than between 1 and 6. So are they different products?

Wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering is arbitrary. So perhaps the positions don't matter because of the ring's symmetry. Wait, no. If the triple bond is between 1 and 2, the structure is different from 1 and 6, but because of the ring's symmetry, they are actually the same. Because benzene is symmetric, so whether the triple bond is between 1 and 2 or 1 and 6, it's the same structure because you can rotate the ring.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the benzene ring is numbered in such a way that position 1 is fixed, then position 2 is adjacent to 1 in one direction, and position 6 is adjacent in the other. So if you form a triple bond between 1 and 2, that's a different structure than between 1 and 6. Because the ring's substituents are arranged in a certain way.

Wait, but in the starting material, the substituents are at 1 and 2. So when you eliminate, the positions where the triple bond forms are determined by the positions of the H and Br. So in this case, when you eliminate, the triple bond forms between 1 and 2 (because the abstracted D is at 2), or between 1 and 6 (if the abstracted H is at 6).

Wait, but the starting material has Br at 1 and D at 2. So if the base abstracts the D from position 2, elimination occurs between 1 and 2, forming a triple bond there. If the base abstracts a H from position 6 (assuming that position 6 is available), then elimination would occur between 1 and 6. So that would give two different products.

Wait, but is position 6 available? Because in the starting molecule, positions 1, 2, and 6 are adjacent to position 1. But position 6 is just a hydrogen (since the molecule is 1-bromo-2-d). So position 6 has a hydrogen, which can be abstracted by the base, leading to elimination between 1 and 6.

So in that case, you could have two possible sites for elimination: between 1-2 (using D at 2) and between 1-6 (using H at 6). So that would give two different products, right?

Wait, but in reality, would the base preferentially abstract D or H? Because deuterium is less acidic than protium, so the base would prefer to abstract a proton (H) over a deuterium. So perhaps the major product would be the elimination between 1 and 6, but the minor product could be elimination between 1 and 2.

Alternatively, maybe the base can abstract either, leading to two possible products.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the actual reaction conditions. NaNH2 is a very strong base, so it's possible that both H and D are abstracted. But deuterium is less acidic, so maybe the H abstraction is more favorable. So the major product would be the triple bond between 1 and 6, but perhaps a minor product exists between 1 and 2.

But if the problem is asking for the number of possible products, regardless of their amounts, then both would be considered. So that would give two products.

Wait, but wait. When you eliminate between 1 and 2, you have a triple bond between those two, and when you eliminate between 1 and 6, you have another triple bond. But are those considered different structures? Because the benzene ring is symmetric, but the substituents are fixed.

Wait, in the starting material, substituents are at 1 and 2. So if the triple bond forms between 1 and 2, that's a specific orientation. If it forms between 1 and 6, that's another. But since the ring is symmetric, perhaps these are not different structures. Wait, no, because the substituents (Br and D) are at specific positions.

Wait, no. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So the Br is at position 1, and D is at position 2. So when the triple bond forms between 1 and 2, the ring would have the triple bond adjacent to the D. But when it forms between 1 and 6, the triple bond is adjacent to position 6, which is a hydrogen (not D). So these are two different products.

Wait, but in the reaction, which substituents are present? Because when the triple bond forms, the substituents (Br and D) are lost. Wait, no, because the Br leaves as Br^- when elimination occurs.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The elimination reaction involves losing HBr (or HD?), but in this case, the Br is leaving as Br^- and the D is being abstracted as D^- (or H-D? I'm getting a bit confused here).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of mechanism. The base (NH2^-) abstracts a proton (H or D) adjacent to the Br. Then the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between the two adjacent carbons.

So in this case, the Br is at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has D, position 6 has H.

So if the base abstracts the H from position 6, then the Br at 1 leaves, and a triple bond forms between 1 and 6. Similarly, if the base abstracts the D from position 2, the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between 1 and 2.

So that would lead to two different products: one with the triple bond between 1 and 6, and another between 1 and 2.

Wait, but in the starting material, the substituents are at positions 1 (Br) and 2 (D). So when elimination occurs, the substituents are removed, and the triple bond is formed. So what's left is a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 2, or between 1 and 6.

But wait, in terms of the molecule, after elimination, do we have any substituents left? Because the Br and the H/D are both leaving. So the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between two adjacent carbons, and no substituents other than the ring itself.

Wait, no. Because the substituents (Br and D) are on adjacent positions, and when they both leave, the triple bond is formed in their place. So perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 2 (if the D is abstracted from 2) or between 1 and 6 (if H is abstracted from 6).

Wait, but once the triple bond forms, the substituents (Br and D) are no longer present. So the product is simply benzyne, which is a benzene ring with a triple bond between two positions.

But wait, benzyne is a cyclic diradical, but often depicted as having a triple bond. So the product is benzyne, but how many isomers are possible?

In benzene, if the triple bond can be in different positions, then each position would give a different benzyne isomer. But in our case, the starting material has substituents at positions 1 and 2, so the triple bond can form between 1 and 2, or between 1 and 6 (but I'm not sure about that).

Wait, but the starting material has substituents at positions 1 and 2. So when the base abstracts a proton (or D) from position 2, the triple bond forms between 1 and 2, leading to benzyne with the triple bond there. If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, the triple bond forms between 1 and 6, leading to a different benzyne structure.

But wait, can the triple bond form between 1 and 6? Because position 6 is adjacent to position 1, so yes. So that would give two different products.

But wait, no. Because the benzyne is a ring, the triple bond can be in any position, but in our case, the initial substituents fix the positions where elimination can occur.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is the same regardless of where the elimination occurs because of the symmetry of the benzene ring.

Wait, no. Because the starting material has substituents at positions 1 and 2, which are adjacent. So the two possible eliminations would lead to triple bonds in different positions relative to the ring's substituents, but since the substituents are gone in the product, perhaps the position of the triple bond doesn't matter.

Wait, but the product is just benzyne. So regardless of where the triple bond is, it's the same molecule. Or is it?

Wait, no. Benzyne is a cyclic molecule with a triple bond. Depending on where the triple bond is, the structure can be different. For example, in ortho-benzyne, the triple bond is between two adjacent positions (like 1 and 2), and in meta positions, but benzene doesn't have meta positions for a triple bond. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so if the triple bond is between 1 and 2, it's the same as between 2 and 3, etc., due to rotation.

Wait, no, the triple bond is fixed between specific carbons. So in this case, the position of the triple bond is fixed based on where the elimination occurs. So if elimination occurs between 1 and 2, the triple bond is there. If between 1 and 6, it's there. But in a benzene ring, these are different positions relative to each other.

But wait, since the benzene ring is symmetric, the position of the triple bond could be in different positions, but they are all equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. So, perhaps regardless of which adjacent position is chosen for elimination, the product is the same.

But in this case, the starting material has substituents that fix the positions. For example, in 1-bromo-2-d benzene, elimination can only occur between positions 1 and 2 (using the D) or between 1 and 6 (using the H). So the product would be a benzyne with the triple bond in either position 1-2 or 1-6, but are these two different structures?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the benzene ring as a hexagon. Position 1 is at the top, position 2 at the top-right, position 3 at the bottom-right, position 4 at the bottom, position 5 at the bottom-left, and position 6 at the top-left.

So if the triple bond is between 1 and 2 (top and top-right), or between 1 and 6 (top and top-left). Now, is a triple bond between 1 and 2 the same as between 1 and 6? Because the ring can be rotated, but in this specific case, the substituents were at 1 and 2, so the orientation is fixed.

Wait, but in the product, after elimination, the substituents (Br and D) are gone. So the benzene ring is just a plain ring with a triple bond. But the triple bond could be in any position, but in this case, the reaction leads to only two possible positions: 1-2 and 1-6.

Wait, but in reality, the benzene ring is symmetric, so a triple bond between positions 1-2 is the same as between 2-3, etc., due to rotation. So regardless of where the triple bond forms, it's the same structure. So perhaps only one product is formed.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the starting material's substituents are fixed. So elimination can only occur between 1-2 and 1-6, leading to two different triple bond positions.

But if the product is just a triple bond anywhere, due to the ring's symmetry, perhaps only one product is possible. Because the triple bond can be anywhere in the ring, and the ring can rotate, so it's considered the same molecule regardless of where the triple bond is.

Wait, but I'm not sure. If the starting material's substituents are fixed, the elimination can only occur in certain positions, leading to specific triple bond positions. But if the product is just a plain benzene ring with a triple bond, the position doesn't matter because the molecule can rotate.

Wait, no. In reality, the product would have a fixed triple bond position based on the starting material. For example, if the triple bond is between 1 and 2, and another is between 1 and 6, these are distinct structures, but due to the ring's symmetry, they are actually the same. Because you can rotate the ring 180 degrees, and the triple bond would be in the same position relative to the ring's structure.

Wait, perhaps not. Because the starting material has substituents at 1 and 2, which are adjacent. So when elimination occurs, the triple bond is either between 1 and 2 (same as substituent positions) or between 1 and 6. But since the substituents are gone, the product is a plain benzene ring with a triple bond. So the position of the triple bond doesn't matter, and the product is the same.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to summarize:

1. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene.
2. NaNH2 is a strong base that can abstract protons (H) or deuterium (D).
3. The Br is at position 1, and D is at position 2.
4. The base can abstract H from position 6 or D from position 2, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between 1-6 or 1-2.
5. Each elimination leads to a different product, but due to the ring's symmetry, these products are actually the same.

Therefore, only one product is formed. But wait, am I confident about that?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because the deuterium isn't a good enough leaving group. But I think the base would abstract the H from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of the triple bond between 1 and 6.

Wait, but then what about the D at position 2? After elimination, the D is gone as part of the elimination? Or is it just abstracted as H-D?

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts the H from position 6, leading to elimination of Br, and the D remains on the ring. No, that can't be because the D is at position 2, and the elimination is between 1 and 6.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, which is either position 2 (D) or position 6 (H). If the base abstracts D from position 2, then the elimination would occur between 1 and 2, forming a triple bond there. If the base abstracts H from position 6, the elimination would be between 1 and 6, forming a triple bond there.

In both cases, the D would remain on position 2, but that's not possible because the elimination removes the adjacent H or D. Wait, no. Wait, in elimination, the leaving group (Br) and the abstracted proton (H or D) are removed, and the triple bond forms between the two carbons.

Wait, no. The Br is at position 1. The abstracted proton is at position 2 or 6. So when the Br leaves, the electrons from the C-Br bond form a bond with the adjacent carbon, leading to a triple bond.

So in the case where the base abstracts position 2's D, the Br leaves, and the triple bond forms between 1 and 2. The D is abstracted as HD (since the base is NH2^-), which isn't a leaving group but is part of the elimination.

Wait, but I'm getting confused again. Let's think about the mechanism:

1. Base (NH2^-) abstracts a proton (H or D) from a position adjacent to Br (positions 2 or 6).
2. This creates a carbanion at that position.
3. The Br leaves as Br^-.
4. The carbanion and the adjacent carbon (formerly bonded to Br) share electrons, forming a triple bond.

So, in the case where the base abstracts D from position 2, the triple bond forms between 1 and 2. The D is abstracted as part of the base and leaves as HD (but that's probably negligible in this context). Similarly, if the base abstracts H from position 6, the triple bond forms between 1 and 6.

In each case, the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between two adjacent positions. But because the benzene ring is symmetric, these two triple bonds are equivalent. So regardless of whether the elimination occurs at 1-2 or 1-6, the product is the same benzyne.

Wait, but benzyne is a symmetric molecule, so the position of the triple bond doesn't matter. So only one product is formed.

Wait, but that can't be right because the starting material has Br and D in specific positions, leading to different possible eliminations. But perhaps the product is the same regardless.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzyne at all. Maybe the conditions are such that substitution occurs instead. Let me think.

If the Br is replaced by the amide ion (NH2^-), then the product would be 1-amino-2-d benzene. But wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and in aromatic substitution, it's more likely to lead to elimination than substitution, especially without activating groups. So perhaps substitution isn't the major pathway here.

Wait, but the ring has a Br (an EWG) and a D. So perhaps the ring is activated towards nucleophilic substitution. But I'm not sure. In any case, the question is about possible products, so substitution could be a possibility.

But in this case, substitution would result in a single product: 1-amino-2-d benzene. So that's another possibility.

Wait, but then we have two possible reaction pathways: elimination (forming benzyne) or substitution (forming aniline derivative). But I'm not sure if substitution occurs under these conditions.

Wait, sodium amide is a strong base and a good nucleophile. In aromatic substitution, especially when the ring is activated, substitution can occur. But in our case, the ring has a Br, which is an EWG, but also a D, which is just a substituent.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the D is replaced. But D is not a good leaving group, so substitution at D isn't likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form benzyne, which then can undergo other reactions, but the question is only about the products of the initial reaction. So only benzyne is formed.

But earlier, I thought that elimination could lead to two different products, but due to ring symmetry, it's just one product.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product as a single species, regardless of the elimination position. So the number of possible organic products is one.

But wait, another point: the reaction could also produce a diradical intermediate, leading to different products. Or perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but I think it does.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any product, but that's unlikely.

So putting it all together: the reaction forms benzyne as the product. Because the starting material's substituents are fixed, but the product is a plain benzene ring with a triple bond, which can be anywhere due to symmetry, leading to only one product.

Wait, but earlier I thought that elimination could occur in two positions, leading to two products, but due to symmetry, they are the same. So only one product forms.

Wait, but another possibility: when the triple bond forms, it's between 1 and 2, which are adjacent. But in the product, the ring's substituents are gone, so the structure is just benzyne. So regardless of the starting substituents, the product is the same.

Wait, but in the starting material, the substituents are at 1 and 2, so the triple bond could form between 1 and 2 or between 1 and 6, but those are two different positions. But in the ring, these positions are equivalent due to the ring's symmetry.

Wait, no. If the triple bond is between 1 and 2, then the structure is different from between 1 and 6. Because the benzene ring is symmetric, but the numbering is fixed. So if you have a triple bond between 1 and 2, it's a different structure than between 1 and 6, but in reality, the two are related by rotation, so they are the same.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. The question is asking how many possible organic products are there. The possible products are either benzyne or some substitution product.

But substitution is less likely, so perhaps elimination is the main pathway, giving one product.

Wait, but another thing: the reaction could produce a mixture of products if the elimination occurs at different positions, but in reality, the starting material's substituents would direct where the elimination can occur.

Wait, in 1-bromo-2-d benzene, the Br is at 1 and D at 2. The base can abstract H from position 6 or D from position 2. So if both are possible, then two products are formed: triple bonds at 1-2 and 1-6. But in the benzene ring, these are equivalent structures because the ring can be rotated.

So the product is the same in both cases, leading to a single product.

Wait, but in reality, the elimination can only occur at specific positions. For example, the D is at 2, so the base can abstract that, leading to a specific triple bond position. But the H at 6 is also available, leading to another position.

But the product would be the same because the ring's structure doesn't care where the triple bond is. So only one product is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to two different products because the triple bond can be in two different positions relative to the starting material's substituents.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: think about what the options are. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the product is benzyne, which is a single structure, then only one product is formed. So the answer would be B)1.

Alternatively, if two different products are possible, the answer would be C)2.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any product, but that's not likely.

Another thought: maybe the reaction leads to more than one product because of different possible substitution patterns. For example, if the substitution occurs at position 1 (Br replaced by NH2), that's one product. And elimination forms another product (benzyne). So that would be two products.

But I think substitution is less likely here because the conditions are strongly basic, favoring elimination.

So if the reaction is substitution, product is 1-amino-2-d benzene. If elimination, product is benzyne. But I'm not sure if both can happen.

Alternatively, perhaps only elimination occurs, leading to one product.

In that case, the number of products is one, so answer B)1.

But earlier I thought that elimination could lead to two products, but due to ring symmetry, it's one. So I'm leaning towards B)1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. The molecule has a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2 on the benzene ring. Sodium amide (NaNH₂) is a strong base, commonly used for dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. The key steps and considerations are as follows:

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The benzene ring has a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. Positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, making them potential candidates for elimination.

2. **Reaction Mechanism**:  
   NaNH₂ acts as a base and can abstract a proton or deuterium from a position adjacent to the bromine. This leads to the elimination of HBr (or HD) and the formation of a triple bond (benzyne) between the two adjacent carbons.

3. **Possible Elimination Sites**:  
   - The base can abstract the deuterium from position 2, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 2.  
   - The base can also abstract a hydrogen from position 6 (adjacent to position 1), leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6.

4. **Symmetry of Benzene**:  
   Benzene is a symmetric molecule, and the positions of the triple bond (between 1-2 or 1-6) are equivalent due to the ring's rotational symmetry. Therefore, regardless of where the elimination occurs, the product is the same: benzyne.

5. **Substitution vs. Elimination**:  
   Substitution reactions are less likely under these strongly basic conditions, as elimination is favored. Thus, the primary product is benzyne.

6. **Number of Products**:  
   Since the reaction leads to a single product (benzyne), regardless of the specific elimination site, there is only one possible organic product.

**Conclusion**: The reaction produces one product, benzyne.
