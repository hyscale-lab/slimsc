Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a given spin state.

Hmm, the problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I'm assuming that's a two-component spinor, right? So it's a column vector with two elements, probably written as [3i; 4]. Or wait, maybe it's (3i,4) as a row vector? Oh, no, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually column vectors. So the state |ψ> is [3i; 4]. But wait, sometimes they might represent it as a row vector, but for the expectation value, I think it's better to stick with column vectors.

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket product: <ψ|Ô|ψ>, where Ô is the operator. So for S_y, I need to find <S_y> = <ψ| S_y |ψ>.

Wait, but what's S_y in terms of Pauli matrices? Oh right, the spin operators are given by S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, and S_z = (ħ/2) σ_z. So σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Wait, but wait, the question says σ_y is given as that matrix, so S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y. So to compute the expectation value, I need to calculate ψ† (S_y) ψ.

But wait, ψ is given as (3i,4). So is that a row vector? Because when I take the conjugate transpose (bra vector), it would be a row vector. So perhaps the state is a column vector [3i; 4]. So ψ = [3i; 4], and ψ† would be [3i*, 4*], but 3i is 3i, so its complex conjugate is -3i. And 4 is real, so its conjugate is 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So now, the expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ. Let's compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as ψ† (ħ/2 σ_y) ψ.

So let's write this out. Let me compute ψ† σ_y ψ first, then multiply by ħ/2.

So σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when I multiply σ_y by ψ, which is [3i;4], I get:

σ_y ψ = [0*3i + (-i)*4, i*3i + 0*4 ] ?

Wait, no. Let me compute it properly. Matrix multiplication is done row by column.

So σ_y is a 2x2 matrix:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0

So when you multiply σ_y by ψ = [a; b], you get:

Row 1: (0*a) + (-i)*b

Row 2: (i*a) + (0)*b

So σ_y * ψ = [ (-i)*b ; i*a ]

So for our specific ψ = [3i;4], then:

σ_y ψ = [ (-i)*4 ; i*(3i) ]

Calculating each component:

First component: (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ = [ -4i ; -3 ].

Now, ψ† σ_y ψ is ψ† multiplied by (σ_y ψ). So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Multiplying, [ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i ; -3 ].

So this is (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i)(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

So sum is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Wait, but that's just the trace of ψ† σ_y ψ? Or is it the inner product? Wait, no, no. Wait, when you compute ψ† σ_y ψ, it's a scalar, not a matrix. Oh right, because ψ is a 2x1 vector, σ_y is 2x2, so σ_y ψ is 2x1. Then ψ† (which is 1x2) multiplied by (σ_y ψ, which is 2x1) gives 1x1, a scalar.

So the calculation is correct: ψ† σ_y ψ = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12 i^2 + (-12) = 12*(-1) -12 = -12 -12 = -24.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by this result.

So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ħ)/2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is -12*hbar/25. Hmm, that's not matching my result. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me check each step again.

First, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], correct.

ψ is [3i;4], correct.

σ_y * ψ: Let me recompute.

First component:

Row 1: 0 * (3i) + (-i) *4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component:

Row 2: i*(3i) +0*4 = i*3i = 3i^2 = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i; -3 ], correct.

ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ] (since ψ is [3i;4], which is a column vector, so ψ† would be the conjugate transpose, so [ (3i)*, 4* ] → [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, ψ† σ_y ψ is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by σ_y ψ (which is [ -4i; -3 ]).

Wait, no, no. Wait, ψ† σ_y ψ is ψ† multiplied by (σ_y ψ), which is a scalar. So:

ψ† σ_y ψ = [ -3i 4 ] * [ -4i; -3 ]

So that's (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) =-12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

Adding: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So that's correct.

Thus, <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24/2) ħ = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are:

A) -12ħ/25

B)12ħ/25

C)25ħ/2

D) -25ħ/2

Hmm, none of the options match -12ħ. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the normalization of the state. Oh right! The spinor needs to be normalized. Because the state given is (3i,4), which might not be a unit vector.

Wait, that's a crucial point. Because the expectation value calculation requires the state vector to be normalized. So perhaps I forgot to normalize the state.

So let's compute the norm of ψ. The norm is |ψ|^2 = (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) ) → wait, wait, no. The norm is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the components.

So |ψ|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (3)^2 + (4)^2 = 9 +16=25.

So the norm is 25, so the state is not normalized. So the correct procedure is to normalize the state first. Because expectation values are calculated for normalized states.

So the normalized state is ψ_normalized = (1/5) [3i;4], because 5^2=25, so 1/sqrt(25)=1/5.

So let me redo the calculation with the normalized state.

So ψ_normalized = (1/5) [3i;4].

Then, ψ_normalized† = (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ].

So now, when I compute ψ_normalized† σ_y ψ_normalized, it's (1/5)^2 times [ -3i, 4 ] [ -4i; -3 ].

Wait, or wait, let's compute σ_y acting on ψ_normalized first.

σ_y ψ_normalized = (1/5) [ -4i; (-3) ].

Wait, because earlier, σ_y [3i;4] was [ -4i; -3 ], so σ_y (1/5 [3i;4]) is (1/5) [ -4i; -3 ].

Then, ψ_normalized† is (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ].

So the product ψ_normalized† (σ_y ψ_normalized) is (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by (1/5) [ -4i; -3 ].

So the scalar product is (1/5)(1/5) [ (-3i)(-4i) +4*(-3) ].

Which is (1/25) [12 i^2 + (-12) ].

12 i^2 is -12.

So (-12) + (-12) = -24.

So the product is (1/25) * (-24) = -24/25.

Then, the expectation value <S_y> is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-24 ħ) / (50) )= (-12 ħ)/25.

Ah, okay, so that matches option A: -12hbar/25.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the given spin state \( \psi = (3i, 4) \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator \( S_y \) is related to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) by \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \).

2. **State Vector**: The given spin state is \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \). This is not normalized, as \( |\psi|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 \). The normalized state is therefore \( \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \).

3. **Expectation Value Formula**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger S_y \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger \sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}}.
   \]

4. **Matrix Multiplication**: Compute \( \sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}} \):
   \[
   \sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} (-i)(4) \\ (i)(3i) \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Inner Product**: Compute \( \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}}) \):
   \[
   \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   The inner product is:
   \[
   \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}}) = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Expanding:
   \[
   (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i^2 - 12 = 12(-1) - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}}) = \frac{1}{25}(-24) = -\frac{24}{25}.
   \]

6. **Final Expectation Value**: Multiply by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \):
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left(-\frac{24}{25}\right) = -\frac{12\hbar}{25}.
   \]

7. **Match with Options**: The result matches option **A**, which is \( -\frac{12\hbar}{25} \).

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a given spin state.

Hmm, the problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I'm assuming that's a two-component spinor, right? So it's a column vector with two elements, probably written as [3i; 4]. Or wait, maybe it's (3i,4) as a row vector? Oh, no, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually column vectors. So the state |ψ> is [3i; 4]. But wait, sometimes they might represent it as a row vector, but for the expectation value, I think it's better to stick with column vectors.

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket product: <ψ|Ô|ψ>, where Ô is the operator. So for S_y, I need to find <S_y> = <ψ| S_y |ψ>.

Wait, but what's S_y in terms of Pauli matrices? Oh right, the spin operators are given by S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, and S_z = (ħ/2) σ_z. So σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Wait, but wait, the question says σ_y is given as that matrix, so S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y. So to compute the expectation value, I need to calculate ψ† (S_y) ψ.

But wait, ψ is given as (3i,4). So is that a row vector? Because when I take the conjugate transpose (bra vector), it would be a row vector. So perhaps the state is a column vector [3i; 4]. So ψ = [3i; 4], and ψ† would be [3i*, 4*], but 3i is 3i, so its complex conjugate is -3i. And 4 is real, so its conjugate is 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So now, the expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ. Let's compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as ψ† (ħ/2 σ_y) ψ.

So let's write this out. Let me compute ψ† σ_y ψ first, then multiply by ħ/2.

So σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when I multiply σ_y by ψ, which is [3i;4], I get:

σ_y ψ = [0*3i + (-i)*4, i*3i + 0*4 ] ?

Wait, no. Let me compute it properly. Matrix multiplication is done row by column.

So σ_y is a 2x2 matrix:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0

So when you multiply σ_y by ψ = [a; b], you get:

Row 1: (0*a) + (-i)*b

Row 2: (i*a) + (0)*b

So σ_y * ψ = [ (-i)*b ; i*a ]

So for our specific ψ = [3i;4], then:

σ_y ψ = [ (-i)*4 ; i*(3i) ]

Calculating each component:

First component: (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ = [ -4i ; -3 ].

Now, ψ† σ_y ψ is ψ† multiplied by (σ_y ψ). So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Multiplying, [ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i ; -3 ].

So this is (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i)(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

So sum is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Wait, but that's just the trace of ψ† σ_y ψ? Or is it the inner product? Wait, no, no. Wait, when you compute ψ† σ_y ψ, it's a scalar, not a matrix. Oh right, because ψ is a 2x1 vector, σ_y is 2x2, so σ_y ψ is 2x1. Then ψ† (which is 1x2) multiplied by (σ_y ψ, which is 2x1) gives 1x1, a scalar.

So the calculation is correct: ψ† σ_y ψ = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12 i^2 + (-12) = 12*(-1) -12 = -12 -12 = -24.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by this result.

So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ħ)/2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is -12*hbar/25. Hmm, that's not matching my result. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me check each step again.

First, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], correct.

ψ is [3i;4], correct.

σ_y * ψ: Let me recompute.

First component:

Row 1: 0 * (3i) + (-i) *4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component:

Row 2: i*(3i) +0*4 = i*3i = 3i^2 = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i; -3 ], correct.

ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ] (since ψ is [3i;4], which is a column vector, so ψ† would be the conjugate transpose, so [ (3i)*, 4* ] → [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, ψ† σ_y ψ is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by σ_y ψ (which is [ -4i; -3 ]).

Wait, no, no. Wait, ψ† σ_y ψ is ψ† multiplied by (σ_y ψ), which is a scalar. So:

ψ† σ_y ψ = [ -3i 4 ] * [ -4i; -3 ]

So that's (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) =-12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

Adding: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So that's correct.

Thus, <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24/2) ħ = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are:

A) -12ħ/25

B)12ħ/25

C)25ħ/2

D) -25ħ/2

Hmm, none of the options match -12ħ. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the normalization of the state. Oh right! The spinor needs to be normalized. Because the state given is (3i,4), which might not be a unit vector.

Wait, that's a crucial point. Because the expectation value calculation requires the state vector to be normalized. So perhaps I forgot to normalize the state.

So let's compute the norm of ψ. The norm is |ψ|^2 = (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) ) → wait, wait, no. The norm is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the components.

So |ψ|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (3)^2 + (4)^2 = 9 +16=25.

So the norm is 25, so the state is not normalized. So the correct procedure is to normalize the state first. Because expectation values are calculated for normalized states.

So the normalized state is ψ_normalized = (1/5) [3i;4], because 5^2=25, so 1/sqrt(25)=1/5.

So let me redo the calculation with the normalized state.

So ψ_normalized = (1/5) [3i;4].

Then, ψ_normalized† = (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ].

So now, when I compute ψ_normalized† σ_y ψ_normalized, it's (1/5)^2 times [ -3i, 4 ] [ -4i; -3 ].

Wait, or wait, let's compute σ_y acting on ψ_normalized first.

σ_y ψ_normalized = (1/5) [ -4i; (-3) ].

Wait, because earlier, σ_y [3i;4] was [ -4i; -3 ], so σ_y (1/5 [3i;4]) is (1/5) [ -4i; -3 ].

Then, ψ_normalized† is (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ].

So the product ψ_normalized† (σ_y ψ_normalized) is (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by (1/5) [ -4i; -3 ].

So the scalar product is (1/5)(1/5) [ (-3i)(-4i) +4*(-3) ].

Which is (1/25) [12 i^2 + (-12) ].

12 i^2 is -12.

So (-12) + (-12) = -24.

So the product is (1/25) * (-24) = -24/25.

Then, the expectation value <S_y> is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-24 ħ) / (50) )= (-12 ħ)/25.

Ah, okay, so that matches option A: -12hbar/25.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the given spin state \( \psi = (3i, 4) \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator \( S_y \) is related to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) by \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \).

2. **State Vector**: The given spin state is \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \). This is not normalized, as \( |\psi|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 \). The normalized state is therefore \( \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \).

3. **Expectation Value Formula**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger S_y \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger \sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}}.
   \]

4. **Matrix Multiplication**: Compute \( \sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}} \):
   \[
   \sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} (-i)(4) \\ (i)(3i) \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Inner Product**: Compute \( \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}}) \):
   \[
   \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   The inner product is:
   \[
   \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}}) = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Expanding:
   \[
   (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i^2 - 12 = 12(-1) - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}}) = \frac{1}{25}(-24) = -\frac{24}{25}.
   \]

6. **Final Expectation Value**: Multiply by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \):
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left(-\frac{24}{25}\right) = -\frac{12\hbar}{25}.
   \]

7. **Match with Options**: The result matches option **A**, which is \( -\frac{12\hbar}{25} \).

Answer: A
