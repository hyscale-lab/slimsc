Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's temperature and the planet's distance from the star. But wait, the question gives me a lot of data about the planets and the star. Let me try to unpack this.

First, let's read through the problem again. So, there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has 1.5 solar masses, 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with a radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which I think means they reflect the same amount of light.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. So I need to find T1 over T2.

I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^{1/4} ). Wait, or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the formula is T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^{1/4 }, where A is the albedo. But wait, no, wait. Another version is that the equilibrium temperature is given by T_eq = T_star * ( ( L_star / (16π σ a^2 (1 - A) ) ) )^{1/4 }, but L_star is the star's luminosity. Hmm, maybe I should think about the star's luminosity first.

The star's luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R_star^2 σ T_star^4. So for the star, L = 4π (1.2 R_sun)^2 σ (6300)^4.

Wait, but when calculating the equilibrium temperature of a planet, the formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^{1/4 }, where T_s is the star's effective temperature, R_s is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, I think I might have messed up the formula. Alternatively, another formula I recall is T_p = T_s * sqrt( (R_s / a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^{1/4 } / sqrt(2) ). Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law for flux.

The flux received by the planet is F = L / (4π a²). The planet's equilibrium temperature is determined by F = σ T_p^4 / ( (1 - A) ), assuming it's a perfect blackbody emitter and considering the albedo.

So plugging F into that, we get:

L/(4π a²) = σ T_p^4 / (1 - A)

But L is 4π R_s^2 σ T_s^4. So substituting that in:

(4π R_s^2 σ T_s^4) / (4π a²) ) = σ T_p^4 / (1 - A)

Simplify: (R_s^2 T_s^4) / a² = T_p^4 / (1 - A)

Take the fourth root on both sides:

T_p = T_s * ( ( R_s^2 / a² ) * (1 - A) )^{1/4 }

Which can also be written as:

T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s / a ) * ( (1 - A) )^{1/4 } / sqrt(2)

Wait, because ( R_s^2 / a^2 ) is (R_s/a)^2, and the square root would be R_s/a. Then, sqrt(R_s/a) is (R_s/a)^(1/2). Hmm, maybe I should re-express it as:

T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^{1/4 }

Wait, wait. Let me go back. The above equation after substitution was:

(R_s^2 T_s^4 ) / a² = T_p^4 / (1 - A)

Taking both sides to the 1/4:

T_p = T_s * ( ( R_s^2 / a² ) / (1 - A) )^{1/4 }

Which can be written as:

T_p = T_s * ( R_s^2 / (a² (1 - A)) )^{1/4 }

Which is the same as T_s * ( R_s / a )^{1/2} * (1/(1-A))^{1/4 }

Which makes:

T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s / a ) * ( (1/(1 - A) ) )^{1/4 }

Wait, but since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - A) factors would cancel out when taking the ratio. So when we take T1 / T2, the albedo term would be ( (1-A)/(1-A) )^{1/4 } = 1. So that part doesn't affect the ratio.

So the main ratio would be ( T_s * sqrt( R_s / a1 ) ) / ( T_s * sqrt( R_s / a2 ) ) )

Which simplifies to sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because sqrt(R_s/a1) / sqrt(R_s/a2) = sqrt( (R_s/a1) * (a2/R_s) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So we need to find the ratio of a2 to a1, take the square root, and that's the temperature ratio.

But how do we find a1 and a2? Since both planets are detected via transit and RV methods, we can use the RV method to find their masses and perhaps their orbital periods and hence the semi-major axes.

The RV method gives the mass of the planet, but it's actually the minimum mass because we don't know the inclination. But in this case, since the transit method also detected them, the inclination must be such that the planet transits, so the inclination is close to 90 degrees. So we can assume that the mass is the actual mass, not a minimum.

The RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) * sin i ) / ( ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) * (2π * P ) )^(1/3) ) )

But since the planets have much smaller mass than the star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also, the problem states that the orbits are circular, so e=0, so (1 - e²)^0.5 is 1. And since the planets transit, i is about 90 degrees, so sin i ≈ 1.

So K ≈ ( (G M_star )^(1/3) ) / ( (2π P )^(1/3) ) )

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, another formula for K is:

K = (v) = (2π G )^(1/3) (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) P )^(1/3) )

Again, since M_p << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So,

K ≈ (2π G )^(1/3) (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star^(2/3) P )^(1/3) )

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of the Doppler shift given.

The problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. Similarly, Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å.

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which is related to the velocity of the star. The Doppler shift Δλ/λ = v / c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us, and c is the speed of light.

So for Planet1, the maximum shift is 0.03 Å. The line is at 6300 Å. So the velocity v1 is (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) * c.

Wait, let me compute that. Wait, no, the formula is v = (Δλ / λ) * c.

So for Planet1:

Δλ = 0.03 Å = 0.03e-10 m
λ = 6300 Å = 6300e-10 m

So v1 = (0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 ) * c = (0.03 / 6300 ) * c.

Wait, 0.03 / 6300 = 0.03 / 6.3e3 = 3e-3 / 6.3e3 = approximately 4.76e-6.

So v1 ≈ (4.76e-6) * c.

But wait, c is about 3e8 m/s. So v1 ≈ 4.76e-6 * 3e8 = approximately 1.428e3 m/s, which is 1.428 km/s.

Similarly, for Planet2, Δλ is 0.04 Å.

v2 = (0.04e-10 / 6300e-10 ) * c = (0.04 / 6300 ) * c.

0.04 / 6300 = 4e-3 / 6.3e3 = approximately 6.349e-7.

v2 ≈ 6.349e-7 * 3e8 = ~190.47 m/s? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.04 / 6300 is 0.04 / 6300 = 0.000006349, which is about 6.349e-6.

Wait, no, 0.04 / 6300 = 0.0000047619... oh, wait, no, 0.04 / 6300 = 4e-3 / 6.3e3 = (4/6.3) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.6349 * 1e-6 = 6.349e-7.

So v2 = 6.349e-7 * 3e8 m/s = 6.349e-7 * 3e8 = approx 190.47 m/s. Wait, no, 6.349e-7 * 3e8 = 6.349 * 3 * 1e1 = 19.047 * 1e1 = 190.47 m/s.

Wait, but for Planet1, I calculated v1 as approximately 1.428 km/s, which is 1428 m/s. So Planet1's induced velocity is larger than Planet2's by a factor of about 1428 / 190.5 ≈ 7.5 times.

But wait, according to the RV method, the star's velocity is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_total^(2/3)) (something with period). Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the mass function.

The RV formula for the semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3).

But since e=0 and M_p << M_star, this simplifies.

Alternatively, another approach is that the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi ) / (2 * c^3) )^(1/3) * ( G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

But I think a more straightforward approach might be to relate the velocities to the planet masses and orbital periods.

Alternatively, since both planets orbit the same star, the ratio of their velocities can be related to the ratio of (M_p / P^(1/3)) ), or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (P^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2, and relate that to the ratio of (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * (a1^(-1/3) / a2^(-1/3) ), because the period is related to a via Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law states that P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star)) a^3.

So P = ( (4π² a^3 ) / ( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )

But perhaps I can express P in terms of a.

Alternatively, since both planets have the same star, the ratio of their periods would be (a1^3 / a2^3 )^(1/2 ) = (a1/a2 )^(3/2 )

But I'm not sure. Let me try another approach.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) * (1/(P) )^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps a better way is to write Kepler's third law in terms of the velocity.

Another formula I found online is K = ( (27 * pi )^(1/3) * G^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( c * (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3 )

But perhaps I can find the ratio K1/K2.

Given that both planets have the same star, M_star is the same, and sin i is close to 1 for both (since they transit, so i is ~90 degrees). So:

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) )

Because:

K ∝ ( M_p ) / ( P^(1/3) )

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (P2)/(P1) )^(1/3 )

But from Kepler's third law, P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_star.

So,

P1^2 / P2^2 = (a1^3 / a2^3 ) / ( M_star / M_star ) ) → P1^2 / P2^2 = (a1/a2 )^3 → (P1/P2 ) = (a1/a2 )^(3/2 )

So,

( P2 / P1 ) = (a2 / a1 )^(3/2 )

Substitute into the K ratio:

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( ( (a2/a1 )^(3/2 ) ) )^(1/3 )

Which simplifies to:

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(1/2 ) )

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, let me double-check:

( (a2/a1 )^(3/2 ) )^(1/3 ) = (a2/a1 )^( (3/2) * (1/3) ) ) = (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

Yes.

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But from earlier, the temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So if I can find the K1/K2 ratio, I can relate it to sqrt(a2/a1 ), which is the same as T1/T2.

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( T1/T2 )

Wait, substituting sqrt(a2/a1) as T1/T2.

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( T1/T2 )

But we can rearrange this to find T1/T2 = ( K1/K2 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )

So,

T1/T2 = ( K1/K2 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )

Because M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, and M_p2 is 5.

So M_p2 / M_p1 = 5/7.

Now, what is K1 and K2?

From the problem statement, Planet1 causes a shift of 0.03 Å, Planet2 causes 0.04 Å.

So K1 is 0.03 Å / 6300 Å * c.

Wait, no, the velocity is v = (Δλ/λ) * c.

So K1 = v1 = (0.03 / 6300 ) * c.

Similarly, K2 = (0.04 / 6300 ) * c.

So K1/K2 = (0.03 / 6300 ) / (0.04 / 6300 ) ) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So,

T1/T2 = (0.75) * (5/7) = (0.75 * 5 ) / 7 = 3.75 /7 ≈ 0.5357.

Hmm, that's roughly 0.536.

But wait, earlier we have T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Which is the same as sqrt( a2/a1 ) = T1/T2.

But according to this calculation, T1 is about 0.5357 times T2, so the ratio of T1 to T2 is approximately 0.5357, which is about 0.536. So the equilibrium temperatures are lower for Planet1 than Planet2.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which seems to match.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, let me recheck the K ratio.

K1 = (0.03/6300) * c

K2 = (0.04/6300) * c

So K1/K2 = (0.03 / 6300) / (0.04 / 6300) ) = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75.

So K1/K2 is 0.75.

M_p1 is 7, M_p2 is 5.

So M_p2/M_p1 = 5/7 ≈ 0.7143.

So T1/T2 = K1/K2 * (M_p2/M_p1 ) = 0.75 * 5/7 = 3.75/7 ≈ 0.5357, which is approximately 0.536. So the ratio is about 0.53.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A) ~0.98

B) ~1.30

C) ~0.53

D) ~1.05

So the correct answer is C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_p = T_s \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{2a}} \cdot \left(\frac{1 - A}{1}\right)^{1/4}
\]

where \(T_s\) is the star's effective temperature, \(R_s\) is the star's radius, \(a\) is the planet's orbital distance, and \(A\) is the albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, the \((1 - A)\) term cancels out when taking the ratio of their temperatures. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to \((M_p \sin i) / P^{1/3}\), where \(M_p\) is the planet's mass and \(P\) is the orbital period. From Kepler's third law, \(P^2 \propto a^3 / M_s\), so the ratio of periods is related to the ratio of semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting this into the RV formula, the ratio of \(K_1\) to \(K_2\) becomes:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_p1}{M_p2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Rearranging for \(\sqrt{a_2 / a_1}\), we find:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_p2}{M_p1}
\]

From the problem, \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\), \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\), \(M_p1 = 7 \, M_\text{Earth}\), and \(M_p2 = 5 \, M_\text{Earth}\). Thus:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75, \quad \frac{M_p2}{M_p1} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = 0.75 \cdot 0.714 \approx 0.536
\]

This is the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.536
\]

From the given options, the closest value is **C) ~0.53**.

Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's temperature and the planet's distance from the star. But wait, the question gives me a lot of data about the planets and the star. Let me try to unpack this.

First, let's read through the problem again. So, there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has 1.5 solar masses, 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with a radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which I think means they reflect the same amount of light.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. So I need to find T1 over T2.

I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^{1/4} ). Wait, or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the formula is T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^{1/4 }, where A is the albedo. But wait, no, wait. Another version is that the equilibrium temperature is given by T_eq = T_star * ( ( L_star / (16π σ a^2 (1 - A) ) ) )^{1/4 }, but L_star is the star's luminosity. Hmm, maybe I should think about the star's luminosity first.

The star's luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R_star^2 σ T_star^4. So for the star, L = 4π (1.2 R_sun)^2 σ (6300)^4.

Wait, but when calculating the equilibrium temperature of a planet, the formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^{1/4 }, where T_s is the star's effective temperature, R_s is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, I think I might have messed up the formula. Alternatively, another formula I recall is T_p = T_s * sqrt( (R_s / a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^{1/4 } / sqrt(2) ). Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law for flux.

The flux received by the planet is F = L / (4π a²). The planet's equilibrium temperature is determined by F = σ T_p^4 / ( (1 - A) ), assuming it's a perfect blackbody emitter and considering the albedo.

So plugging F into that, we get:

L/(4π a²) = σ T_p^4 / (1 - A)

But L is 4π R_s^2 σ T_s^4. So substituting that in:

(4π R_s^2 σ T_s^4) / (4π a²) ) = σ T_p^4 / (1 - A)

Simplify: (R_s^2 T_s^4) / a² = T_p^4 / (1 - A)

Take the fourth root on both sides:

T_p = T_s * ( ( R_s^2 / a² ) * (1 - A) )^{1/4 }

Which can also be written as:

T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s / a ) * ( (1 - A) )^{1/4 } / sqrt(2)

Wait, because ( R_s^2 / a^2 ) is (R_s/a)^2, and the square root would be R_s/a. Then, sqrt(R_s/a) is (R_s/a)^(1/2). Hmm, maybe I should re-express it as:

T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^{1/4 }

Wait, wait. Let me go back. The above equation after substitution was:

(R_s^2 T_s^4 ) / a² = T_p^4 / (1 - A)

Taking both sides to the 1/4:

T_p = T_s * ( ( R_s^2 / a² ) / (1 - A) )^{1/4 }

Which can be written as:

T_p = T_s * ( R_s^2 / (a² (1 - A)) )^{1/4 }

Which is the same as T_s * ( R_s / a )^{1/2} * (1/(1-A))^{1/4 }

Which makes:

T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s / a ) * ( (1/(1 - A) ) )^{1/4 }

Wait, but since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - A) factors would cancel out when taking the ratio. So when we take T1 / T2, the albedo term would be ( (1-A)/(1-A) )^{1/4 } = 1. So that part doesn't affect the ratio.

So the main ratio would be ( T_s * sqrt( R_s / a1 ) ) / ( T_s * sqrt( R_s / a2 ) ) )

Which simplifies to sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because sqrt(R_s/a1) / sqrt(R_s/a2) = sqrt( (R_s/a1) * (a2/R_s) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So we need to find the ratio of a2 to a1, take the square root, and that's the temperature ratio.

But how do we find a1 and a2? Since both planets are detected via transit and RV methods, we can use the RV method to find their masses and perhaps their orbital periods and hence the semi-major axes.

The RV method gives the mass of the planet, but it's actually the minimum mass because we don't know the inclination. But in this case, since the transit method also detected them, the inclination must be such that the planet transits, so the inclination is close to 90 degrees. So we can assume that the mass is the actual mass, not a minimum.

The RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) * sin i ) / ( ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) * (2π * P ) )^(1/3) ) )

But since the planets have much smaller mass than the star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also, the problem states that the orbits are circular, so e=0, so (1 - e²)^0.5 is 1. And since the planets transit, i is about 90 degrees, so sin i ≈ 1.

So K ≈ ( (G M_star )^(1/3) ) / ( (2π P )^(1/3) ) )

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, another formula for K is:

K = (v) = (2π G )^(1/3) (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) P )^(1/3) )

Again, since M_p << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So,

K ≈ (2π G )^(1/3) (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star^(2/3) P )^(1/3) )

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of the Doppler shift given.

The problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. Similarly, Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å.

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which is related to the velocity of the star. The Doppler shift Δλ/λ = v / c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us, and c is the speed of light.

So for Planet1, the maximum shift is 0.03 Å. The line is at 6300 Å. So the velocity v1 is (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) * c.

Wait, let me compute that. Wait, no, the formula is v = (Δλ / λ) * c.

So for Planet1:

Δλ = 0.03 Å = 0.03e-10 m
λ = 6300 Å = 6300e-10 m

So v1 = (0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 ) * c = (0.03 / 6300 ) * c.

Wait, 0.03 / 6300 = 0.03 / 6.3e3 = 3e-3 / 6.3e3 = approximately 4.76e-6.

So v1 ≈ (4.76e-6) * c.

But wait, c is about 3e8 m/s. So v1 ≈ 4.76e-6 * 3e8 = approximately 1.428e3 m/s, which is 1.428 km/s.

Similarly, for Planet2, Δλ is 0.04 Å.

v2 = (0.04e-10 / 6300e-10 ) * c = (0.04 / 6300 ) * c.

0.04 / 6300 = 4e-3 / 6.3e3 = approximately 6.349e-7.

v2 ≈ 6.349e-7 * 3e8 = ~190.47 m/s? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.04 / 6300 is 0.04 / 6300 = 0.000006349, which is about 6.349e-6.

Wait, no, 0.04 / 6300 = 0.0000047619... oh, wait, no, 0.04 / 6300 = 4e-3 / 6.3e3 = (4/6.3) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.6349 * 1e-6 = 6.349e-7.

So v2 = 6.349e-7 * 3e8 m/s = 6.349e-7 * 3e8 = approx 190.47 m/s. Wait, no, 6.349e-7 * 3e8 = 6.349 * 3 * 1e1 = 19.047 * 1e1 = 190.47 m/s.

Wait, but for Planet1, I calculated v1 as approximately 1.428 km/s, which is 1428 m/s. So Planet1's induced velocity is larger than Planet2's by a factor of about 1428 / 190.5 ≈ 7.5 times.

But wait, according to the RV method, the star's velocity is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_total^(2/3)) (something with period). Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the mass function.

The RV formula for the semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3).

But since e=0 and M_p << M_star, this simplifies.

Alternatively, another approach is that the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi ) / (2 * c^3) )^(1/3) * ( G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

But I think a more straightforward approach might be to relate the velocities to the planet masses and orbital periods.

Alternatively, since both planets orbit the same star, the ratio of their velocities can be related to the ratio of (M_p / P^(1/3)) ), or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (P^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2, and relate that to the ratio of (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * (a1^(-1/3) / a2^(-1/3) ), because the period is related to a via Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law states that P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star)) a^3.

So P = ( (4π² a^3 ) / ( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )

But perhaps I can express P in terms of a.

Alternatively, since both planets have the same star, the ratio of their periods would be (a1^3 / a2^3 )^(1/2 ) = (a1/a2 )^(3/2 )

But I'm not sure. Let me try another approach.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) * (1/(P) )^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps a better way is to write Kepler's third law in terms of the velocity.

Another formula I found online is K = ( (27 * pi )^(1/3) * G^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( c * (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3 )

But perhaps I can find the ratio K1/K2.

Given that both planets have the same star, M_star is the same, and sin i is close to 1 for both (since they transit, so i is ~90 degrees). So:

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) )

Because:

K ∝ ( M_p ) / ( P^(1/3) )

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (P2)/(P1) )^(1/3 )

But from Kepler's third law, P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_star.

So,

P1^2 / P2^2 = (a1^3 / a2^3 ) / ( M_star / M_star ) ) → P1^2 / P2^2 = (a1/a2 )^3 → (P1/P2 ) = (a1/a2 )^(3/2 )

So,

( P2 / P1 ) = (a2 / a1 )^(3/2 )

Substitute into the K ratio:

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( ( (a2/a1 )^(3/2 ) ) )^(1/3 )

Which simplifies to:

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(1/2 ) )

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, let me double-check:

( (a2/a1 )^(3/2 ) )^(1/3 ) = (a2/a1 )^( (3/2) * (1/3) ) ) = (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

Yes.

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But from earlier, the temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So if I can find the K1/K2 ratio, I can relate it to sqrt(a2/a1 ), which is the same as T1/T2.

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( T1/T2 )

Wait, substituting sqrt(a2/a1) as T1/T2.

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( T1/T2 )

But we can rearrange this to find T1/T2 = ( K1/K2 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )

So,

T1/T2 = ( K1/K2 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )

Because M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, and M_p2 is 5.

So M_p2 / M_p1 = 5/7.

Now, what is K1 and K2?

From the problem statement, Planet1 causes a shift of 0.03 Å, Planet2 causes 0.04 Å.

So K1 is 0.03 Å / 6300 Å * c.

Wait, no, the velocity is v = (Δλ/λ) * c.

So K1 = v1 = (0.03 / 6300 ) * c.

Similarly, K2 = (0.04 / 6300 ) * c.

So K1/K2 = (0.03 / 6300 ) / (0.04 / 6300 ) ) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So,

T1/T2 = (0.75) * (5/7) = (0.75 * 5 ) / 7 = 3.75 /7 ≈ 0.5357.

Hmm, that's roughly 0.536.

But wait, earlier we have T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Which is the same as sqrt( a2/a1 ) = T1/T2.

But according to this calculation, T1 is about 0.5357 times T2, so the ratio of T1 to T2 is approximately 0.5357, which is about 0.536. So the equilibrium temperatures are lower for Planet1 than Planet2.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which seems to match.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, let me recheck the K ratio.

K1 = (0.03/6300) * c

K2 = (0.04/6300) * c

So K1/K2 = (0.03 / 6300) / (0.04 / 6300) ) = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75.

So K1/K2 is 0.75.

M_p1 is 7, M_p2 is 5.

So M_p2/M_p1 = 5/7 ≈ 0.7143.

So T1/T2 = K1/K2 * (M_p2/M_p1 ) = 0.75 * 5/7 = 3.75/7 ≈ 0.5357, which is approximately 0.536. So the ratio is about 0.53.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A) ~0.98

B) ~1.30

C) ~0.53

D) ~1.05

So the correct answer is C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_p = T_s \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{2a}} \cdot \left(\frac{1 - A}{1}\right)^{1/4}
\]

where \(T_s\) is the star's effective temperature, \(R_s\) is the star's radius, \(a\) is the planet's orbital distance, and \(A\) is the albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, the \((1 - A)\) term cancels out when taking the ratio of their temperatures. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to \((M_p \sin i) / P^{1/3}\), where \(M_p\) is the planet's mass and \(P\) is the orbital period. From Kepler's third law, \(P^2 \propto a^3 / M_s\), so the ratio of periods is related to the ratio of semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting this into the RV formula, the ratio of \(K_1\) to \(K_2\) becomes:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_p1}{M_p2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Rearranging for \(\sqrt{a_2 / a_1}\), we find:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_p2}{M_p1}
\]

From the problem, \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\), \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\), \(M_p1 = 7 \, M_\text{Earth}\), and \(M_p2 = 5 \, M_\text{Earth}\). Thus:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75, \quad \frac{M_p2}{M_p1} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = 0.75 \cdot 0.714 \approx 0.536
\]

This is the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.536
\]

From the given options, the closest value is **C) ~0.53**.
