Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. But wait, I also remember something about meso compounds. Those are compounds that have chiral centers but are achiral overall because of a plane of symmetry. So they don't show optical activity.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many are optically active. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Wait, what's the structure here? So it's 1-chloro and 2-methyl but-1-ene. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The configuration is Z, so the higher priority groups are on the same side. But for optical activity, we're looking for chiral centers. Let's see: the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. Wait, 1-chloro would mean Cl is on C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1 is Cl, double bond to C2, which has a methyl group (since it's 2-methyl). So the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded. So it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait no, maybe I'm getting confused.

   Alternatively, maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would make it Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond. Wait, no. Structure of 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2? Wait no. Wait, 2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Or is it CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)? Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that would be 1-chloro-2-methylpropene? Hmm.

   Alternatively, perhaps it's more straightforward to consider whether the molecule has a chiral center. For a chiral center, it must have four different groups attached. So looking at the molecule: if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C1 has Cl, and maybe two other substituents.

   Wait, maybe I should think about the structure again. The compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The formula would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? But wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro is Cl on the first carbon, which is part of the double bond. So it's Cl on C1, which is connected to C2 (double bond) and two CH2 groups? Wait, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe 2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, that's 2-methylbut-1-ene. So 1-chloro would have Cl on the first carbon. So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that's perhaps 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. 

   Now, looking for chiral centers. The molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, perhaps it's Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? But with a double bond. Wait, maybe it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group (so 2-methyl), and another substituent. Hmm.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Let me try drawing it. The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait, that's a single bond. No, no, it's but-1-ene, so double bond between C1 and C2. So C1 is Cl attached (Cl-CH2-), double bonded to C2, which is CH(CH3). So C2 is CH(CH3), double bonded to C1, and connected to C3 which is CH2 and C4 which is CH3. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that doesn't make sense because but-1-ene is four carbons. Wait, perhaps it's Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2-CH3? No, wait that's five carbons. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should just think about whether the molecule has a chiral center. Let's see, the configuration is Z, which refers to the double bond geometry. But if the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, that's a single bond, but with a double bond, perhaps.

   Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the double bond. For a molecule to have a chiral center, it's about the carbon atoms attached to the double bond. But in alkenes, each double-bonded carbon is connected to two substituents. So for the carbons in the double bond, each has two substituents (each is bonded to two groups). So, for example, in this case, C1 is Cl and CH2, but wait, is that correct?

   Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and then C3 is CH2, C4 is CH3. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that would make it CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2CH3, but that's five carbons, so perhaps it's CH2Cl=C(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but that's 2-methyl-1-chlorobut-1-ene? No, but-1-ene is four carbons, so perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2.

   Anyway, regardless of the exact structure, let's see: is there a chiral center here? For a carbon to be chiral, it needs four different substituents. Let's look at the double bond. The two carbons in the double bond (C1 and C2) each have two substituents. For C1, it's Cl and two CH2 groups? Or maybe not. Let me think again. 

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Because in the double bond, each carbon is only attached to two groups, so even if the substituents are different, they're not four different groups. So maybe this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So it's not optically active.

   Wait, but wait. If the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, perhaps the structure is Cl on C1, and C2 has a methyl group and a CH2CH2 group. Wait, maybe the substituents are Cl, CH2CH2CH3, and two CH2 groups. No, I'm getting stuck, perhaps it's better to move on and come back.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
   Wow, that's a mouthful. Okay, so the molecule has a complex structure. Let's break it down. The main part is hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. That suggests a bicyclic structure, perhaps with two ketone groups (dione) and a methano bridge (4,7-methano). The substituent is 8-(chloromethylene), which is a CH2Cl group attached.

   The configuration is (3aR,7aS,E). So the 'E' refers to the configuration around the double bond. The molecule has a double bond somewhere, perhaps in the chloromethylene group. So the E configuration indicates the substituents are opposite each other.

   Now, for optical activity: does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. The substituents attached to the ring may lead to some stereogenic centers. The (3aR,7aS) suggests that these bridgehead carbons (3a and 7a) are stereogenic. 

   Wait, bridgehead carbons can sometimes be chiral centers if they have four different substituents. So 3aR and 7aS indicate that these carbons are stereogenic. So this molecule has chiral centers, but does it have a plane of symmetry? I don't think so because the substituents on the bridgeheads are different. So this molecule is chiral and optically active.

   Also, the E configuration on the chloromethylene might affect the overall structure. But regardless, the presence of stereogenic centers should make it optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When it's 2,3-dimethyl, the structure becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, the configuration is (2R,3S). Wait, but does this have a plane of symmetry?

   Let's imagine the molecule. The two methyl groups are on C2 and C3. If they're in the R and S configurations respectively, are there any symmetry? Let's consider the structure: the two central carbons are each attached to a methyl group, a COOH group, a hydrogen, and the adjacent carbon.

   Wait, the two carbonyl groups are on either end. So, are the two chiral centers mirror images? If the configurations are R and S, then the molecule might be a meso compound if there's a plane of symmetry. Wait, in this case, (2R,3S) would mean that on each chiral center, the groups are arranged differently. Let me think: each chiral center has a COOH group, a CH(CH3) group, a hydrogen, and a CH(CH3) from the other side. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the two chiral centers are mirror images, leading to an internal plane of symmetry.

   For example, in tartaric acid, when you have (R,S) configuration and the molecule is meso, it's achiral. So in this case, if the two chiral centers are in R and S configurations, but the entire molecule is symmetrical, then it's a meso compound and not optically active.

   So let me visualize the structure. The two middle carbons are each attached to a methyl group, a COOH (on either end), and two other groups. If the configurations are R and S, would that create a plane of symmetry? Because if the arrangement on C2 is R and on C3 is S, but the substituents on each are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule could be meso.

   For example, if the substituents on C2 and C3 are arranged so that each has the same groups but opposite configurations, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry through the center, making it achiral. So in this case, (2R,3S) would be a meso compound, hence no optical activity.

   Alternatively, if the substituents aren't arranged symmetrically, then it might not be a meso compound. But in this case, since the molecule is symmetric (succinic acid is a symmetrical molecule), adding methyl groups on symmetric positions could result in a meso form.

   Therefore, this compound is a meso compound and not optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Now, same base structure as the previous compound, but the configuration is (2R,3R). So both chiral centers are R.

   Let's think about symmetry again. If both are R, then the arrangement on each carbon would be the same. So if you have, say, on C2: COOH, CH(CH3), H, and CH(CH3) from C3. Wait, no, each chiral center is attached to:

   - C2: COOH, CH(CH3), CH(CH3), and something else? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Each middle carbon (C2 and C3) is attached to:

   - C2: COOH, CH(CH3), a hydrogen, and the next carbon (which is CH(CH3)).

   Wait, perhaps the groups on each chiral center are:

   For C2: the substituents are:

   - COOH (on one side),
   - CH(CH3) (on C3),
   - a hydrogen,
   - and CH(CH3) (on C2? No, wait, wait. Wait, C2 is connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), a hydrogen, and a methyl group? No, no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

   So for C2: groups are COOH, CH(CH3), H, and CH2? Wait, no. Wait, C2 is CH(CH3), so the four substituents are:

   - The adjacent COOH (from C1),
   - Two CH(CH3) groups (no, wait, C2 is CH(CH3), so its substituents are:

   - C1: COOH,
   - C3: CH(CH3),
   - a hydrogen (since it's CH(CH3), so two Hs? No, wait, no. Wait, CH(CH3) has three substituents: CH3, and two CH2 groups? I'm getting confused.

   Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the configurations. If both C2 and C3 are R, then each has a certain arrangement. But without a plane of symmetry, this molecule would be chiral.

   Wait, because in the (2R,3S) case, the molecule is meso. But in this case, (2R,3R), the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Because both are R, the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry. So this would be a chiral molecule, thus optically active.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the mirror image. If you have both R, would the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Probably not. So it would be chiral.

   So this compound is optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
   So a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group on C1 and the double bond between C3 and C4 (since it's 3-en). The configuration is R. 

   Now, cyclohexene derivatives can have axial or equatorial substituents, but does that affect chirality? Let's see. The molecule has a hydroxyl group on C1. Are there four different substituents on that carbon?

   C1 is attached to:

   - -OH,
   - two CH2 groups (since it's cyclohexane, each adjacent carbon is CH2),
   - and the cyclohexene ring itself.

   Wait, no. The ring is a six-membered ring, so each carbon is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So C1 is connected to C6 and C2. So the substituents on C1 are:

   - -OH,
   - ring (so two CH groups attached to adjacent carbons),
   - and the other substituent is the cyclohexene ring.

   Wait, perhaps it's better to think that in a cyclohexene, each carbon is bonded to two ring carbons and two substituents. So C1 has OH, and two ring bonds. So perhaps the substituents on C1 are OH, two CH2 groups (from the ring), and another CH group (maybe).

   Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about whether the carbon with the OH group has four different substituents. If it's substituted in such a way that all four are different, then it's a chiral center.

   So, in (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the OH is on C1, which is part of a ring. The ring has double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is a cyclohexene with substituents.

   For C1, what are the four substituents? Let's imagine:

   - OH group,
   - two adjacent CH2 groups (since it's a ring, each adjacent is a CH2 connected to the next carbon),
   - and the ring's position beyond that (maybe a CH connected to the double bond).

   Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

   - OH,
   - two CH2 groups (from C6 and C2),
   - and another group from the ring, perhaps a CH connected to the double bond.

   Wait, but in reality, each carbon in the ring is connected to two adjacent carbons, so the substituents on C1 would be:

   - OH,
   - two CH2 groups (C2 and C6),
   - and the bridge to the double bond (C3 and C4).

   Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of the substituents as:

   On C1: -OH, CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C6), and a CH (from C3, which is part of the double bond). Wait, but that would make four different substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (but wait, are they identical?), and a CH group. Or if C3 is part of a double bond, perhaps the substituent is a CH with a double bond to C4.

   Wait, perhaps I should draw this mentally. C1 has OH, then to C2 and C6, each is a CH2 group. Then, from C1 to C3, which is a CH that's part of the double bond (C3-C4). So the substituents on C1 are OH, CH2 (C2), CH2 (C6), and CH (C3). Are any of these substituents the same? If C2 and C6 are both CH2, then they're the same. So the substituents would be: OH, CH2, CH2, and CH. So two substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups), so C1 is not a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule wouldn't be chiral.

   Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the substituents on C1 are:

   - OH,
   - two different CH2 groups (because one is attached to C2, which is next to C3, which is in the double bond, and the other is attached to C6, which is next to C5, which is a CH2 group).

   Alternatively, perhaps the substituents aren't identical. Because even if both are CH2, their positions (attached to different parts of the ring) make them different. Hmm, no, if the two substituents are both CH2 groups, regardless of their position, they are the same. So in that case, C1 has three substituents: OH, CH2, CH2, and another CH group. Wait, no, four substituents: OH, CH2 (C2), CH2 (C6), and CH (C3). So two of the substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups), meaning C1 isn't a chiral center. So the molecule isn't chiral. Therefore, it's not optically active.

   Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps the substituents on the adjacent carbons affect the substituents on C1. For example, if C2 is connected to C3, which is part of the double bond, then C2 might have a different structure than C6, which is connected to C5, a CH2. So perhaps the substituents on C1 are:

   - OH,
   - CH2-C3 (which is in the double bond),
   - CH2-C6 (which is connected to C5, a CH2),
   - and another substituent.

   Wait, maybe the substituents are: OH, CH2-CH2 (C2), CH2-CH (C6), and CH (C3). No, I'm getting confused again.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral despite the R configuration. Or perhaps the R configuration refers to a chiral center elsewhere.

   Wait, maybe I'm mistaken. If the molecule is (R) configuration, that implies a chiral center. So perhaps I was wrong earlier. If the molecule is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, that suggests that C1 is a chiral center with four different substituents. But earlier analysis suggested that two substituents are the same (both CH2), which would make C1 not a chiral center. So perhaps I'm missing something.

   Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C1 are:

   - OH,
   - two different CH groups (since the ring has different substituents on either side),
   - and another substituent.

   Wait, perhaps the ring substituents are not the same, making the two CH2 groups different. For example, if C2 is next to the double bond (C3), and C6 is not, then the substituents on C1 from C2 and C6 are different. So the substituents on C1 would be:

   - OH,
   - CH-CH2 (from C2, which is attached to C3 which is in the double bond),
   - CH-CH2 (from C6, which is attached to C5, which is CH2),
   - and another substituent.

   Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Maybe I should think about this differently. If a cyclohexene has a substituent on C1, and the ring is such that the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then C1 could be a chiral center.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. Therefore, the substituents on C1 are:

   - OH,
   - two CH2 groups (C2 and C6),
   - and a CH group (C3).

   Wait, but if the two CH2 groups (C2 and C6) are different because C2 is adjacent to the double bond (C3), whereas C6 is adjacent to a CH2 (C5), then the substituents are different. So the substituents on C1 are:

   - OH,
   - CH2 (C2, next to double bond),
   - CH2 (C6, next to CH2),
   - and CH (C3, which is part of the double bond).

   So all four substituents are different. Therefore, C1 would be a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and optically active.

   But wait, earlier I thought that the two CH2 groups would be same, but perhaps they're different because of their positions. So if the substituents on C2 are different from those on C6, then the two CH2 groups are different. So yes, C1 would have four different substituents, making it chiral.

   Therefore, this compound is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
   So a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. The configurations are all s (so all S configurations). Now, I need to determine if this molecule is chiral.

   First, check for any plane of symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral despite having stereogenic centers.

   Let me imagine the cyclohexane ring with -OH groups on 1,3,5. These positions are all every other carbon. So the substituents are symmetrically placed. So the molecule could have a plane of symmetry through the center, making it a meso compound.

   For example, if the configuration is (1s,3s,5s), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then the mirror images would cancel out, making it achiral.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry because the configurations are all the same. Wait, no. Let me think: if all the hydroxyls are on the same face, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. For instance, in the case of 1,3,5-triol, each OH is at 120-degree intervals. If all are in the same configuration (all R or all S), the molecule might be symmetric.

   Wait, but in this case, the configurations are all s (S). So would that create a plane of symmetry? Let me think about it. If each OH is pointing in the same direction relative to the ring, then the molecule might have a center of symmetry. For example, if all OHs are axial and pointing in the same direction, the molecule would be superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the multiple stereogenic centers don't allow for a plane of symmetry. Wait, but if all three are S, perhaps the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image due to the symmetry.

   Wait, another approach: the number of stereogenic centers is three. A compound with three stereogenic centers can be chiral if it doesn't have a plane of symmetry. But sometimes, like in the case of 1,3,5-trihydroxy cyclohexane, the molecule can be a meso compound.

   For example, if the substituents are arranged such that there's a plane of symmetry, then it's meso. So in this case, perhaps the (1s,3s,5s) configuration leads to a meso form, making the molecule achiral.

   Alternatively, maybe it's not a meso compound. Let me think about a simpler case: 1,2,3-trihydroxy cyclopropane. If all three substituents are on the same face, the molecule is chiral. But in a six-membered ring, the situation is different.

   Okay, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound. Because the three OH groups are placed symmetrically (1,3,5), and all are S configuration, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

   Or wait, perhaps the configuration leads to a lack of symmetry. If all OHs are on the same face (axial), then the molecule might have a center of inversion, making it a meso compound.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of the substituents doesn't allow for symmetry. I'm a bit stuck on this one.

   Another approach: think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. The positions 1,3,5 are symmetrically placed. So if the substituents are all the same, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, for example, a plane running through the center of the ring, perpendicular to the plane of the ring, might make the molecule symmetrical.

   Therefore, the molecule might be achiral, despite having three stereogenic centers. Thus, it's a meso compound and not optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
   Structure: the molecule has a cyclopentyl group attached to C1, a methyl group on C3, and a ketone (butan-1-one). So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

   The question is whether there's a chiral center here. Let's look at each carbon.

   The carbonyl carbon (C1) is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. C2 is connected to the carbonyl, so it's CH2. C3 has a methyl group, and C4 is CH3.

   Wait, let's list the substituents for each possible chiral center.

   C2: attached to C1 (cyclopentyl ketone), two CH2 groups, and a CH(CH3) group? Or wait, the structure is:

   O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? No, wait, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but in this case, it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

   So the carbonyl is at C1, then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH3.

   Wait, but that would make the structure:

   O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? No, perhaps I should think again. Wait, butan-1-one is:

   CH3-CH2-CH2-C(O)R, but in this case, R is cyclopentyl, and there's a methyl on C3. So structure is:

   cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

   So the carbonyl is at C1. Then, C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH3.

   Now, looking for chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is not chiral. C2 is CH2, so not a chiral center. C3 is CH(CH3), attached to:

   - carbonyl (C1),
   - CH2 (C2),
   - CH3 (from C4),
   - and another CH3 from the methyl group.

   Wait, no. Let me think about the substituents on C3. So C3 is connected to:

   - C2 (which is CH2),
   - C4 (which is CH3),
   - the methyl group (CH(CH3)),
   - and the carbonyl group (O=C).

   Wait, no, in the structure, C3 is CH(CH3), meaning it's attached to:

   - C2: CH2,
   - C4: CH3,
   - a methyl group (CH3),
   - and the carbonyl carbon (C1: R-CO-).

   So substituents on C3 are: CO-R (cyclopentyl), CH2, CH3, and another CH3. So two substituents are CH3. Therefore, C3 has four substituents: CO-R, CH2, CH3, CH3. So two substituents are same (two CH3 groups), so C3 is not a chiral center.

   Therefore, no chiral centers in the molecule. Hence, it's not optically active.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and is not a meso compound (a compound with multiple stereogenic centers but an overall plane of symmetry, making it achiral).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   The molecule has a double bond, and the carbons in the double bond are each bonded to two substituents. Neither carbon in the double bond is bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers. This compound is not optically active.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This complex bicyclic compound has stereogenic centers at the bridgehead carbons (3a and 7a), as they are each bonded to four different groups. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral and optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, due to the symmetry of the succinic acid backbone, the molecule is a meso compound (it has a plane of symmetry), making it achiral and not optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. Unlike the meso compound in the previous case, this molecule lacks a plane of symmetry because the configurations at both chiral centers are the same (both R). This makes the molecule chiral and optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, two different CH2 groups (due to the asymmetry of the cyclohexene ring), and a CH group adjacent to the double bond. This makes C1 a chiral center, and the molecule is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   The molecule has three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, which are symmetrically equivalent on the cyclohexane ring. Despite having three stereogenic centers, the molecule is a meso compound due to a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and not optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbonyl carbon (C1) is not a chiral center due to the double bond with oxygen. The other carbons in the molecule (C2, C3, and C4) do not have four different substituents. Specifically, C3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. This compound is not optically active.

### Conclusion:
Out of the seven compounds, four exhibit optical activity:  
- **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
- **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
- **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
- **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. But wait, I also remember something about meso compounds. Those are compounds that have chiral centers but are achiral overall because of a plane of symmetry. So they don't show optical activity.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many are optically active. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Wait, what's the structure here? So it's 1-chloro and 2-methyl but-1-ene. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The configuration is Z, so the higher priority groups are on the same side. But for optical activity, we're looking for chiral centers. Let's see: the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. Wait, 1-chloro would mean Cl is on C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1 is Cl, double bond to C2, which has a methyl group (since it's 2-methyl). So the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded. So it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait no, maybe I'm getting confused.

   Alternatively, maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would make it Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond. Wait, no. Structure of 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2? Wait no. Wait, 2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Or is it CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)? Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that would be 1-chloro-2-methylpropene? Hmm.

   Alternatively, perhaps it's more straightforward to consider whether the molecule has a chiral center. For a chiral center, it must have four different groups attached. So looking at the molecule: if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C1 has Cl, and maybe two other substituents.

   Wait, maybe I should think about the structure again. The compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The formula would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? But wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro is Cl on the first carbon, which is part of the double bond. So it's Cl on C1, which is connected to C2 (double bond) and two CH2 groups? Wait, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe 2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, that's 2-methylbut-1-ene. So 1-chloro would have Cl on the first carbon. So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that's perhaps 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. 

   Now, looking for chiral centers. The molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, perhaps it's Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? But with a double bond. Wait, maybe it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group (so 2-methyl), and another substituent. Hmm.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Let me try drawing it. The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait, that's a single bond. No, no, it's but-1-ene, so double bond between C1 and C2. So C1 is Cl attached (Cl-CH2-), double bonded to C2, which is CH(CH3). So C2 is CH(CH3), double bonded to C1, and connected to C3 which is CH2 and C4 which is CH3. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that doesn't make sense because but-1-ene is four carbons. Wait, perhaps it's Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2-CH3? No, wait that's five carbons. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should just think about whether the molecule has a chiral center. Let's see, the configuration is Z, which refers to the double bond geometry. But if the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, that's a single bond, but with a double bond, perhaps.

   Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the double bond. For a molecule to have a chiral center, it's about the carbon atoms attached to the double bond. But in alkenes, each double-bonded carbon is connected to two substituents. So for the carbons in the double bond, each has two substituents (each is bonded to two groups). So, for example, in this case, C1 is Cl and CH2, but wait, is that correct?

   Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and then C3 is CH2, C4 is CH3. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that would make it CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2CH3, but that's five carbons, so perhaps it's CH2Cl=C(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but that's 2-methyl-1-chlorobut-1-ene? No, but-1-ene is four carbons, so perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2.

   Anyway, regardless of the exact structure, let's see: is there a chiral center here? For a carbon to be chiral, it needs four different substituents. Let's look at the double bond. The two carbons in the double bond (C1 and C2) each have two substituents. For C1, it's Cl and two CH2 groups? Or maybe not. Let me think again. 

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Because in the double bond, each carbon is only attached to two groups, so even if the substituents are different, they're not four different groups. So maybe this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So it's not optically active.

   Wait, but wait. If the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, perhaps the structure is Cl on C1, and C2 has a methyl group and a CH2CH2 group. Wait, maybe the substituents are Cl, CH2CH2CH3, and two CH2 groups. No, I'm getting stuck, perhaps it's better to move on and come back.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
   Wow, that's a mouthful. Okay, so the molecule has a complex structure. Let's break it down. The main part is hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. That suggests a bicyclic structure, perhaps with two ketone groups (dione) and a methano bridge (4,7-methano). The substituent is 8-(chloromethylene), which is a CH2Cl group attached.

   The configuration is (3aR,7aS,E). So the 'E' refers to the configuration around the double bond. The molecule has a double bond somewhere, perhaps in the chloromethylene group. So the E configuration indicates the substituents are opposite each other.

   Now, for optical activity: does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. The substituents attached to the ring may lead to some stereogenic centers. The (3aR,7aS) suggests that these bridgehead carbons (3a and 7a) are stereogenic. 

   Wait, bridgehead carbons can sometimes be chiral centers if they have four different substituents. So 3aR and 7aS indicate that these carbons are stereogenic. So this molecule has chiral centers, but does it have a plane of symmetry? I don't think so because the substituents on the bridgeheads are different. So this molecule is chiral and optically active.

   Also, the E configuration on the chloromethylene might affect the overall structure. But regardless, the presence of stereogenic centers should make it optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When it's 2,3-dimethyl, the structure becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, the configuration is (2R,3S). Wait, but does this have a plane of symmetry?

   Let's imagine the molecule. The two methyl groups are on C2 and C3. If they're in the R and S configurations respectively, are there any symmetry? Let's consider the structure: the two central carbons are each attached to a methyl group, a COOH group, a hydrogen, and the adjacent carbon.

   Wait, the two carbonyl groups are on either end. So, are the two chiral centers mirror images? If the configurations are R and S, then the molecule might be a meso compound if there's a plane of symmetry. Wait, in this case, (2R,3S) would mean that on each chiral center, the groups are arranged differently. Let me think: each chiral center has a COOH group, a CH(CH3) group, a hydrogen, and a CH(CH3) from the other side. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the two chiral centers are mirror images, leading to an internal plane of symmetry.

   For example, in tartaric acid, when you have (R,S) configuration and the molecule is meso, it's achiral. So in this case, if the two chiral centers are in R and S configurations, but the entire molecule is symmetrical, then it's a meso compound and not optically active.

   So let me visualize the structure. The two middle carbons are each attached to a methyl group, a COOH (on either end), and two other groups. If the configurations are R and S, would that create a plane of symmetry? Because if the arrangement on C2 is R and on C3 is S, but the substituents on each are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule could be meso.

   For example, if the substituents on C2 and C3 are arranged so that each has the same groups but opposite configurations, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry through the center, making it achiral. So in this case, (2R,3S) would be a meso compound, hence no optical activity.

   Alternatively, if the substituents aren't arranged symmetrically, then it might not be a meso compound. But in this case, since the molecule is symmetric (succinic acid is a symmetrical molecule), adding methyl groups on symmetric positions could result in a meso form.

   Therefore, this compound is a meso compound and not optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Now, same base structure as the previous compound, but the configuration is (2R,3R). So both chiral centers are R.

   Let's think about symmetry again. If both are R, then the arrangement on each carbon would be the same. So if you have, say, on C2: COOH, CH(CH3), H, and CH(CH3) from C3. Wait, no, each chiral center is attached to:

   - C2: COOH, CH(CH3), CH(CH3), and something else? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Each middle carbon (C2 and C3) is attached to:

   - C2: COOH, CH(CH3), a hydrogen, and the next carbon (which is CH(CH3)).

   Wait, perhaps the groups on each chiral center are:

   For C2: the substituents are:

   - COOH (on one side),
   - CH(CH3) (on C3),
   - a hydrogen,
   - and CH(CH3) (on C2? No, wait, wait. Wait, C2 is connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), a hydrogen, and a methyl group? No, no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

   So for C2: groups are COOH, CH(CH3), H, and CH2? Wait, no. Wait, C2 is CH(CH3), so the four substituents are:

   - The adjacent COOH (from C1),
   - Two CH(CH3) groups (no, wait, C2 is CH(CH3), so its substituents are:

   - C1: COOH,
   - C3: CH(CH3),
   - a hydrogen (since it's CH(CH3), so two Hs? No, wait, no. Wait, CH(CH3) has three substituents: CH3, and two CH2 groups? I'm getting confused.

   Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the configurations. If both C2 and C3 are R, then each has a certain arrangement. But without a plane of symmetry, this molecule would be chiral.

   Wait, because in the (2R,3S) case, the molecule is meso. But in this case, (2R,3R), the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Because both are R, the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry. So this would be a chiral molecule, thus optically active.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the mirror image. If you have both R, would the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Probably not. So it would be chiral.

   So this compound is optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
   So a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group on C1 and the double bond between C3 and C4 (since it's 3-en). The configuration is R. 

   Now, cyclohexene derivatives can have axial or equatorial substituents, but does that affect chirality? Let's see. The molecule has a hydroxyl group on C1. Are there four different substituents on that carbon?

   C1 is attached to:

   - -OH,
   - two CH2 groups (since it's cyclohexane, each adjacent carbon is CH2),
   - and the cyclohexene ring itself.

   Wait, no. The ring is a six-membered ring, so each carbon is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So C1 is connected to C6 and C2. So the substituents on C1 are:

   - -OH,
   - ring (so two CH groups attached to adjacent carbons),
   - and the other substituent is the cyclohexene ring.

   Wait, perhaps it's better to think that in a cyclohexene, each carbon is bonded to two ring carbons and two substituents. So C1 has OH, and two ring bonds. So perhaps the substituents on C1 are OH, two CH2 groups (from the ring), and another CH group (maybe).

   Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about whether the carbon with the OH group has four different substituents. If it's substituted in such a way that all four are different, then it's a chiral center.

   So, in (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the OH is on C1, which is part of a ring. The ring has double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is a cyclohexene with substituents.

   For C1, what are the four substituents? Let's imagine:

   - OH group,
   - two adjacent CH2 groups (since it's a ring, each adjacent is a CH2 connected to the next carbon),
   - and the ring's position beyond that (maybe a CH connected to the double bond).

   Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

   - OH,
   - two CH2 groups (from C6 and C2),
   - and another group from the ring, perhaps a CH connected to the double bond.

   Wait, but in reality, each carbon in the ring is connected to two adjacent carbons, so the substituents on C1 would be:

   - OH,
   - two CH2 groups (C2 and C6),
   - and the bridge to the double bond (C3 and C4).

   Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of the substituents as:

   On C1: -OH, CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C6), and a CH (from C3, which is part of the double bond). Wait, but that would make four different substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (but wait, are they identical?), and a CH group. Or if C3 is part of a double bond, perhaps the substituent is a CH with a double bond to C4.

   Wait, perhaps I should draw this mentally. C1 has OH, then to C2 and C6, each is a CH2 group. Then, from C1 to C3, which is a CH that's part of the double bond (C3-C4). So the substituents on C1 are OH, CH2 (C2), CH2 (C6), and CH (C3). Are any of these substituents the same? If C2 and C6 are both CH2, then they're the same. So the substituents would be: OH, CH2, CH2, and CH. So two substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups), so C1 is not a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule wouldn't be chiral.

   Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the substituents on C1 are:

   - OH,
   - two different CH2 groups (because one is attached to C2, which is next to C3, which is in the double bond, and the other is attached to C6, which is next to C5, which is a CH2 group).

   Alternatively, perhaps the substituents aren't identical. Because even if both are CH2, their positions (attached to different parts of the ring) make them different. Hmm, no, if the two substituents are both CH2 groups, regardless of their position, they are the same. So in that case, C1 has three substituents: OH, CH2, CH2, and another CH group. Wait, no, four substituents: OH, CH2 (C2), CH2 (C6), and CH (C3). So two of the substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups), meaning C1 isn't a chiral center. So the molecule isn't chiral. Therefore, it's not optically active.

   Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps the substituents on the adjacent carbons affect the substituents on C1. For example, if C2 is connected to C3, which is part of the double bond, then C2 might have a different structure than C6, which is connected to C5, a CH2. So perhaps the substituents on C1 are:

   - OH,
   - CH2-C3 (which is in the double bond),
   - CH2-C6 (which is connected to C5, a CH2),
   - and another substituent.

   Wait, maybe the substituents are: OH, CH2-CH2 (C2), CH2-CH (C6), and CH (C3). No, I'm getting confused again.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral despite the R configuration. Or perhaps the R configuration refers to a chiral center elsewhere.

   Wait, maybe I'm mistaken. If the molecule is (R) configuration, that implies a chiral center. So perhaps I was wrong earlier. If the molecule is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, that suggests that C1 is a chiral center with four different substituents. But earlier analysis suggested that two substituents are the same (both CH2), which would make C1 not a chiral center. So perhaps I'm missing something.

   Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C1 are:

   - OH,
   - two different CH groups (since the ring has different substituents on either side),
   - and another substituent.

   Wait, perhaps the ring substituents are not the same, making the two CH2 groups different. For example, if C2 is next to the double bond (C3), and C6 is not, then the substituents on C1 from C2 and C6 are different. So the substituents on C1 would be:

   - OH,
   - CH-CH2 (from C2, which is attached to C3 which is in the double bond),
   - CH-CH2 (from C6, which is attached to C5, which is CH2),
   - and another substituent.

   Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Maybe I should think about this differently. If a cyclohexene has a substituent on C1, and the ring is such that the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then C1 could be a chiral center.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. Therefore, the substituents on C1 are:

   - OH,
   - two CH2 groups (C2 and C6),
   - and a CH group (C3).

   Wait, but if the two CH2 groups (C2 and C6) are different because C2 is adjacent to the double bond (C3), whereas C6 is adjacent to a CH2 (C5), then the substituents are different. So the substituents on C1 are:

   - OH,
   - CH2 (C2, next to double bond),
   - CH2 (C6, next to CH2),
   - and CH (C3, which is part of the double bond).

   So all four substituents are different. Therefore, C1 would be a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and optically active.

   But wait, earlier I thought that the two CH2 groups would be same, but perhaps they're different because of their positions. So if the substituents on C2 are different from those on C6, then the two CH2 groups are different. So yes, C1 would have four different substituents, making it chiral.

   Therefore, this compound is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
   So a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. The configurations are all s (so all S configurations). Now, I need to determine if this molecule is chiral.

   First, check for any plane of symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral despite having stereogenic centers.

   Let me imagine the cyclohexane ring with -OH groups on 1,3,5. These positions are all every other carbon. So the substituents are symmetrically placed. So the molecule could have a plane of symmetry through the center, making it a meso compound.

   For example, if the configuration is (1s,3s,5s), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then the mirror images would cancel out, making it achiral.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry because the configurations are all the same. Wait, no. Let me think: if all the hydroxyls are on the same face, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. For instance, in the case of 1,3,5-triol, each OH is at 120-degree intervals. If all are in the same configuration (all R or all S), the molecule might be symmetric.

   Wait, but in this case, the configurations are all s (S). So would that create a plane of symmetry? Let me think about it. If each OH is pointing in the same direction relative to the ring, then the molecule might have a center of symmetry. For example, if all OHs are axial and pointing in the same direction, the molecule would be superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the multiple stereogenic centers don't allow for a plane of symmetry. Wait, but if all three are S, perhaps the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image due to the symmetry.

   Wait, another approach: the number of stereogenic centers is three. A compound with three stereogenic centers can be chiral if it doesn't have a plane of symmetry. But sometimes, like in the case of 1,3,5-trihydroxy cyclohexane, the molecule can be a meso compound.

   For example, if the substituents are arranged such that there's a plane of symmetry, then it's meso. So in this case, perhaps the (1s,3s,5s) configuration leads to a meso form, making the molecule achiral.

   Alternatively, maybe it's not a meso compound. Let me think about a simpler case: 1,2,3-trihydroxy cyclopropane. If all three substituents are on the same face, the molecule is chiral. But in a six-membered ring, the situation is different.

   Okay, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound. Because the three OH groups are placed symmetrically (1,3,5), and all are S configuration, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

   Or wait, perhaps the configuration leads to a lack of symmetry. If all OHs are on the same face (axial), then the molecule might have a center of inversion, making it a meso compound.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of the substituents doesn't allow for symmetry. I'm a bit stuck on this one.

   Another approach: think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. The positions 1,3,5 are symmetrically placed. So if the substituents are all the same, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, for example, a plane running through the center of the ring, perpendicular to the plane of the ring, might make the molecule symmetrical.

   Therefore, the molecule might be achiral, despite having three stereogenic centers. Thus, it's a meso compound and not optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
   Structure: the molecule has a cyclopentyl group attached to C1, a methyl group on C3, and a ketone (butan-1-one). So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

   The question is whether there's a chiral center here. Let's look at each carbon.

   The carbonyl carbon (C1) is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. C2 is connected to the carbonyl, so it's CH2. C3 has a methyl group, and C4 is CH3.

   Wait, let's list the substituents for each possible chiral center.

   C2: attached to C1 (cyclopentyl ketone), two CH2 groups, and a CH(CH3) group? Or wait, the structure is:

   O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? No, wait, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but in this case, it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

   So the carbonyl is at C1, then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH3.

   Wait, but that would make the structure:

   O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? No, perhaps I should think again. Wait, butan-1-one is:

   CH3-CH2-CH2-C(O)R, but in this case, R is cyclopentyl, and there's a methyl on C3. So structure is:

   cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

   So the carbonyl is at C1. Then, C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH3.

   Now, looking for chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is not chiral. C2 is CH2, so not a chiral center. C3 is CH(CH3), attached to:

   - carbonyl (C1),
   - CH2 (C2),
   - CH3 (from C4),
   - and another CH3 from the methyl group.

   Wait, no. Let me think about the substituents on C3. So C3 is connected to:

   - C2 (which is CH2),
   - C4 (which is CH3),
   - the methyl group (CH(CH3)),
   - and the carbonyl group (O=C).

   Wait, no, in the structure, C3 is CH(CH3), meaning it's attached to:

   - C2: CH2,
   - C4: CH3,
   - a methyl group (CH3),
   - and the carbonyl carbon (C1: R-CO-).

   So substituents on C3 are: CO-R (cyclopentyl), CH2, CH3, and another CH3. So two substituents are CH3. Therefore, C3 has four substituents: CO-R, CH2, CH3, CH3. So two substituents are same (two CH3 groups), so C3 is not a chiral center.

   Therefore, no chiral centers in the molecule. Hence, it's not optically active.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and is not a meso compound (a compound with multiple stereogenic centers but an overall plane of symmetry, making it achiral).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   The molecule has a double bond, and the carbons in the double bond are each bonded to two substituents. Neither carbon in the double bond is bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers. This compound is not optically active.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This complex bicyclic compound has stereogenic centers at the bridgehead carbons (3a and 7a), as they are each bonded to four different groups. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral and optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, due to the symmetry of the succinic acid backbone, the molecule is a meso compound (it has a plane of symmetry), making it achiral and not optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. Unlike the meso compound in the previous case, this molecule lacks a plane of symmetry because the configurations at both chiral centers are the same (both R). This makes the molecule chiral and optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, two different CH2 groups (due to the asymmetry of the cyclohexene ring), and a CH group adjacent to the double bond. This makes C1 a chiral center, and the molecule is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   The molecule has three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, which are symmetrically equivalent on the cyclohexane ring. Despite having three stereogenic centers, the molecule is a meso compound due to a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and not optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbonyl carbon (C1) is not a chiral center due to the double bond with oxygen. The other carbons in the molecule (C2, C3, and C4) do not have four different substituents. Specifically, C3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. This compound is not optically active.

### Conclusion:
Out of the seven compounds, four exhibit optical activity:  
- **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
- **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
- **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
- **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
