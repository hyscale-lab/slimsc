Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma rays annihilating with the CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the photon background and particle interactions. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by this annihilation process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. So, I guess the gamma-rays are high energy, and they're interacting with the low-energy CMB photons.

I recall that when a high-energy photon interacts with a low-energy photon, they can produce an electron-positron pair. The process is gamma + gamma -> e+ e-. For this to happen, the energy of the gamma must be above a certain threshold. Oh right, there's a threshold condition because you need enough energy to create the rest mass of the electron-positron pair.

Wait, the rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. So, each electron and positron has that mass. So the total rest mass is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. But wait, more accurately, the center-of-mass energy needs to be at least 1.022 MeV for the pair production to occur. Because you can't have a rest mass lower than the sum needed.

But how does that relate to the individual photon energies? I think it comes down to the condition that the sum of the energies in the center-of-mass frame must be at least twice the electron mass. Alternatively, maybe it's using the fact that the product of the energies divided by the square of their wavelengths (or something with their frequencies) has to meet a certain condition.

Wait, photons are massless, so their energy is E = h f. I think the condition for pair production is that the product of their energies (E1 * E2) must be at least (m_e c^2)^2 /4, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh wait, maybe the condition is that the sum of their energies when considering their relative motion is enough.

Alternatively, I remember that for pair production by a photon in the Coulomb field of a nucleus (like in pair production when a gamma photon interacts with a nucleus), the photon needs energy above 1.022 MeV because the nucleus provides the necessary rest mass. But in this case, both photons are part of the interaction, so it's a two-photon process.

Wait, correct me if I'm wrong. The threshold condition for two photons to produce an electron-positron pair is that their combined energy in the center-of-mass frame should be at least twice the electron rest mass. Because each photon's energy contributes to the total energy available.

So, the condition is:

sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ) >= 2 m_e c^2

But since photons are massless, their momentum is E/(c). So, p1 = E1/(c), p2 = E2/(c).

Assuming the two photons are moving in opposite directions (since they are in a head-on collision), their momenta would add in magnitude but opposite in direction. Wait, no, if they collide head-on, their momenta would be in opposite directions, so their vector sum would be |p1 - p2| or something like that. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the invariant quantity.

Wait, the invariant squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 (since if they're moving opposite, their momenta vectors subtract). But since one photon is the CMB photon (low energy) and the other is the high-energy gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the threshold condition when two photons collide: the product E1 * E2 must be at least (m_e c^2)^2 / 4. I think that's right because when you have two photons with energies E1 and E2, the condition for them to produce a pair is E1 * E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2 /4.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the center-of-mass energy squared would be (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 (if they're moving opposite). Since E1 = p1 c and E2 = p2 c, so substituting:

(E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2.

So, the invariant is 4 E1 E2. For this to be >= (2 m_e c^2)^2.

So, 4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 → E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me do the math carefully. The invariant squared is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. For two photons moving in opposite directions, E_total is E1 + E2, and p_total is (E1/(c) - E2/(c)) because they're in opposite directions. So:

(E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1 - E2)/c * c )^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2.

Expanding this:

= [E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] - [E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2]
= 4 E1 E2.

So, the invariant s = 4 E1 E2.

For the process to happen, the invariant s must be at least equal to (2 m_e c^2)^2, because that's the rest mass squared of the electron-positron pair (since the pair has mass 2 m_e c^2 each).

So, 4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 → 4 E1 E2 >= 4 m_e^2 c^4.

Dividing both sides by 4:

E1 E2 >= m_e^2 c^4.

So, E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2.

So, each gamma photon must have energy E_gamma such that E_gamma * E_photon >= (m_e c^2)^2.

Given that the average photon energy of the CMB is E_photon = 1e-3 eV. So,

E_gamma >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E_photon.

Wait, m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV. So, (0.511 MeV)^2 is (0.511)^2 * (1e6 eV)^2.

Let me compute that:

0.511 MeV = 5.11e5 eV.

So, (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 eV² = approx 26.1121 * 1e10 eV².

Then, E_gamma >= (26.1121e10 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) )

Dividing, E_gamma >= 26.1121e13 eV.

Wait, because 1e10 / 1e-3 is 1e13.

Wait, 26.1121e10 (eV²) divided by 1e-3 eV is 26.1121e13 eV. So, E_gamma >= approximately 2.611e14 eV.

Wait, but wait, let's see. 26.1121e10 is 2.61121e11? No, wait, 1e10 is 10^10. So 26.1121e10 = 2.61121e11? No, wait, 26.1121e10 is 2.61121 × 10^11 eV². Then dividing by 1e-3 eV:

(2.61121e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) )= 2.61121e14 eV.

But wait that's 2.61121 × 1e14 eV. That's 2.61121e14 eV. Which is 2.61121 × 1e8 GeV, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. Wait no, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 1e14 eV is 1e5 GeV.

Wait, 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So, 1e14 eV is 1e14 / 1e9 = 1e5 GeV. So 2.61121e14 eV is 2.61121e5 GeV, which is 2.61121 × 1e5 GeV, which is 2.61121 × 10^5 GeV.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So that's about 2.6 × 1e5 GeV. So, that's the threshold energy. So, gamma-rays with energies above this would have their lifetimes limited by this annihilation process.

Wait, but why? Because when a gamma-ray has enough energy, the probability of it annihilating with a CMB photon becomes significant, so the gamma-ray would have a shorter lifetime before such a process occurs. So, their mean lifetime would be determined by this interaction rate.

So, the energy threshold is E_gamma ≈ (m_e c^2)^2 / E_photon.

Plugging in the numbers:

(m_e c^2) = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.

So, (511,000 eV)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11)^2 × 1e10 eV² ≈ 26.11 × 1e10 eV² = 2.611e11 eV².

E_photon = 1e-3 eV.

So, E_gamma = (2.611e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) = 2.611e14 eV.

Which is 2.611e14 eV = 2.611e5 GeV. So, approximately 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. I think I may have made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check. The condition is E1 * E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2.

But in this case, E_photon is the CMB photon's energy, which is small (~1e-3 eV), and E_gamma is the high-energy photon we're interested in.

So, E_gamma * E_photon >= (m_e c^2)^2.

Therefore, E_gamma >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E_photon.

Yes, that's correct. So the calculation holds.

So, the answer should be about 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C.

To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we analyze the threshold condition for this interaction. The process requires the combined energy of the two photons to be sufficient to produce an electron-positron pair, which has a rest mass energy of $2m_e c^2 = 1.022$ MeV. 

The threshold condition for two photons to produce an electron-positron pair is given by the invariant quantity:

\[
s = 4E_1E_2 \geq (2m_e c^2)^2,
\]

where $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the energies of the two photons. For a high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\gamma$) interacting with a low-energy CMB photon ($E_{\text{CMB}}$), the condition simplifies to:

\[
E_\gamma \cdot E_{\text{CMB}} \geq (m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Given that the average photon energy of the CMB is $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3}$ eV, we solve for $E_\gamma$:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}.
\]

The rest energy of the electron is $m_e c^2 = 0.511$ MeV, or $511,000$ eV. Substituting the values:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}.
\]

First, calculate $(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2$:

\[
(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2 = (5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV})^2 = 26.1121 \times 10^{10} \, \text{eV}^2.
\]

Now divide by $10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{26.1121 \times 10^{10} \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 26.1121 \times 10^{13} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Convert to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_\gamma \geq 26.1121 \times 10^{13} \, \text{eV} = 26.1121 \times 10^4 \, \text{GeV} = 2.61121 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus, the threshold energy for the gamma-rays is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5$ GeV. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) $2.6 \times 10^5$ GeV.**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma rays annihilating with the CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the photon background and particle interactions. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by this annihilation process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. So, I guess the gamma-rays are high energy, and they're interacting with the low-energy CMB photons.

I recall that when a high-energy photon interacts with a low-energy photon, they can produce an electron-positron pair. The process is gamma + gamma -> e+ e-. For this to happen, the energy of the gamma must be above a certain threshold. Oh right, there's a threshold condition because you need enough energy to create the rest mass of the electron-positron pair.

Wait, the rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. So, each electron and positron has that mass. So the total rest mass is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. But wait, more accurately, the center-of-mass energy needs to be at least 1.022 MeV for the pair production to occur. Because you can't have a rest mass lower than the sum needed.

But how does that relate to the individual photon energies? I think it comes down to the condition that the sum of the energies in the center-of-mass frame must be at least twice the electron mass. Alternatively, maybe it's using the fact that the product of the energies divided by the square of their wavelengths (or something with their frequencies) has to meet a certain condition.

Wait, photons are massless, so their energy is E = h f. I think the condition for pair production is that the product of their energies (E1 * E2) must be at least (m_e c^2)^2 /4, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh wait, maybe the condition is that the sum of their energies when considering their relative motion is enough.

Alternatively, I remember that for pair production by a photon in the Coulomb field of a nucleus (like in pair production when a gamma photon interacts with a nucleus), the photon needs energy above 1.022 MeV because the nucleus provides the necessary rest mass. But in this case, both photons are part of the interaction, so it's a two-photon process.

Wait, correct me if I'm wrong. The threshold condition for two photons to produce an electron-positron pair is that their combined energy in the center-of-mass frame should be at least twice the electron rest mass. Because each photon's energy contributes to the total energy available.

So, the condition is:

sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ) >= 2 m_e c^2

But since photons are massless, their momentum is E/(c). So, p1 = E1/(c), p2 = E2/(c).

Assuming the two photons are moving in opposite directions (since they are in a head-on collision), their momenta would add in magnitude but opposite in direction. Wait, no, if they collide head-on, their momenta would be in opposite directions, so their vector sum would be |p1 - p2| or something like that. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the invariant quantity.

Wait, the invariant squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 (since if they're moving opposite, their momenta vectors subtract). But since one photon is the CMB photon (low energy) and the other is the high-energy gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the threshold condition when two photons collide: the product E1 * E2 must be at least (m_e c^2)^2 / 4. I think that's right because when you have two photons with energies E1 and E2, the condition for them to produce a pair is E1 * E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2 /4.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the center-of-mass energy squared would be (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 (if they're moving opposite). Since E1 = p1 c and E2 = p2 c, so substituting:

(E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2.

So, the invariant is 4 E1 E2. For this to be >= (2 m_e c^2)^2.

So, 4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 → E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me do the math carefully. The invariant squared is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. For two photons moving in opposite directions, E_total is E1 + E2, and p_total is (E1/(c) - E2/(c)) because they're in opposite directions. So:

(E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1 - E2)/c * c )^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2.

Expanding this:

= [E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] - [E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2]
= 4 E1 E2.

So, the invariant s = 4 E1 E2.

For the process to happen, the invariant s must be at least equal to (2 m_e c^2)^2, because that's the rest mass squared of the electron-positron pair (since the pair has mass 2 m_e c^2 each).

So, 4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 → 4 E1 E2 >= 4 m_e^2 c^4.

Dividing both sides by 4:

E1 E2 >= m_e^2 c^4.

So, E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2.

So, each gamma photon must have energy E_gamma such that E_gamma * E_photon >= (m_e c^2)^2.

Given that the average photon energy of the CMB is E_photon = 1e-3 eV. So,

E_gamma >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E_photon.

Wait, m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV. So, (0.511 MeV)^2 is (0.511)^2 * (1e6 eV)^2.

Let me compute that:

0.511 MeV = 5.11e5 eV.

So, (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 eV² = approx 26.1121 * 1e10 eV².

Then, E_gamma >= (26.1121e10 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) )

Dividing, E_gamma >= 26.1121e13 eV.

Wait, because 1e10 / 1e-3 is 1e13.

Wait, 26.1121e10 (eV²) divided by 1e-3 eV is 26.1121e13 eV. So, E_gamma >= approximately 2.611e14 eV.

Wait, but wait, let's see. 26.1121e10 is 2.61121e11? No, wait, 1e10 is 10^10. So 26.1121e10 = 2.61121e11? No, wait, 26.1121e10 is 2.61121 × 10^11 eV². Then dividing by 1e-3 eV:

(2.61121e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) )= 2.61121e14 eV.

But wait that's 2.61121 × 1e14 eV. That's 2.61121e14 eV. Which is 2.61121 × 1e8 GeV, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. Wait no, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 1e14 eV is 1e5 GeV.

Wait, 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So, 1e14 eV is 1e14 / 1e9 = 1e5 GeV. So 2.61121e14 eV is 2.61121e5 GeV, which is 2.61121 × 1e5 GeV, which is 2.61121 × 10^5 GeV.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So that's about 2.6 × 1e5 GeV. So, that's the threshold energy. So, gamma-rays with energies above this would have their lifetimes limited by this annihilation process.

Wait, but why? Because when a gamma-ray has enough energy, the probability of it annihilating with a CMB photon becomes significant, so the gamma-ray would have a shorter lifetime before such a process occurs. So, their mean lifetime would be determined by this interaction rate.

So, the energy threshold is E_gamma ≈ (m_e c^2)^2 / E_photon.

Plugging in the numbers:

(m_e c^2) = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.

So, (511,000 eV)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11)^2 × 1e10 eV² ≈ 26.11 × 1e10 eV² = 2.611e11 eV².

E_photon = 1e-3 eV.

So, E_gamma = (2.611e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) = 2.611e14 eV.

Which is 2.611e14 eV = 2.611e5 GeV. So, approximately 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. I think I may have made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check. The condition is E1 * E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2.

But in this case, E_photon is the CMB photon's energy, which is small (~1e-3 eV), and E_gamma is the high-energy photon we're interested in.

So, E_gamma * E_photon >= (m_e c^2)^2.

Therefore, E_gamma >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E_photon.

Yes, that's correct. So the calculation holds.

So, the answer should be about 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C.


To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we analyze the threshold condition for this interaction. The process requires the combined energy of the two photons to be sufficient to produce an electron-positron pair, which has a rest mass energy of $2m_e c^2 = 1.022$ MeV. 

The threshold condition for two photons to produce an electron-positron pair is given by the invariant quantity:

\[
s = 4E_1E_2 \geq (2m_e c^2)^2,
\]

where $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the energies of the two photons. For a high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\gamma$) interacting with a low-energy CMB photon ($E_{\text{CMB}}$), the condition simplifies to:

\[
E_\gamma \cdot E_{\text{CMB}} \geq (m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Given that the average photon energy of the CMB is $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3}$ eV, we solve for $E_\gamma$:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}.
\]

The rest energy of the electron is $m_e c^2 = 0.511$ MeV, or $511,000$ eV. Substituting the values:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}.
\]

First, calculate $(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2$:

\[
(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2 = (5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV})^2 = 26.1121 \times 10^{10} \, \text{eV}^2.
\]

Now divide by $10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{26.1121 \times 10^{10} \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 26.1121 \times 10^{13} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Convert to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_\gamma \geq 26.1121 \times 10^{13} \, \text{eV} = 26.1121 \times 10^4 \, \text{GeV} = 2.61121 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus, the threshold energy for the gamma-rays is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5$ GeV. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) $2.6 \times 10^5$ GeV.**

Answer: C
