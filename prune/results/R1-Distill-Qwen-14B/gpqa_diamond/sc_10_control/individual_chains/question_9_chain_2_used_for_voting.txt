Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about molecular symmetry. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h is a type of point group, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this.

First, I should probably recall what C3h symmetry means. Point groups are determined based on the symmetry elements a molecule has. C3h, if I'm not mistaken, is a trigonal planar point group. The 'h' stands for horizontal, I think. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), right? Oh wait, wait, no—C3h is actually the combination of a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. Or is it that the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane and a three-fold rotation axis that's perpendicular to that plane?

Wait, maybe I should remember the different point groups. The common ones are like C1, C2, C3, C4, etc., and then their h, v, and d versions. Oh right, the h point groups have a horizontal mirror plane. So for C3h, the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and at least one horizontal mirror plane (σh). Also, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane usually implies that the molecule is planar in some way.

Now, looking at the options, the molecules are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I need to figure out which of these has C3h symmetry.

Let me start by recalling each molecule's structure.

Triisopropyl borate: Structure-wise, boron is at the center, bonded to three isopropyl groups. The formula is B(OiC(CH2CH3)2)3. Each isopropyl group is a substituent on the boron. Since all three substituents are the same, this molecule should have a trigonal planar geometry around boron. So the point group would be D3h, I think. Wait, because if all three groups are identical and there's a plane of symmetry, then yes, D3h. But wait, D3h is higher symmetry than C3h. So maybe this isn't the right one because the question is about C3h, not D3h.

Wait, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents and no other symmetry elements beyond C3? Or does it have a center of inversion? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's not D3h. Let me think again. Triisopropyl borate has three identical substituents, so the molecule is symmetric. The point group would be Td? No, wait, that's for tetrahedral structures. No, it's trigonal planar, so D3h. So if it's D3h, then perhaps it's not the correct answer because the question is about C3h.

Next, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, a norbornane derivative with an amine group. The structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivative, I think. Wait, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. Quinuclidine has a bridge structure. The molecule should have a certain symmetry. Norbornane itself has a C2 axis and some mirror planes. Quinuclidine is known to have a plane of symmetry. Wait, does it have a three-fold rotation axis? I don't think so. Quinuclidine's structure is more like a seven-membered ring with two bridgeheads. So perhaps it has a C2 axis, making its point group D2h or maybe C2v. Not sure, but I don't think it's C3h.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize. It's a benzo-fused trifuran system. Trifuran is a structure with three furan rings connected in a row, I think. Benzo substitution would add a benzene ring somewhere. Wait, the substituents are at different positions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tricyclic system with three furan moieties and a benzene. Alternatively, maybe the structure is a fused ring system with multiple rings. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tricyclic molecule with three fused rings, each containing oxygen. But regardless, I need to think about its symmetry.

Then, option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene attached somewhere. Triphenylene is a tricyclic aromatic compound—three benzene rings connected in a way that forms a sort of triangular structure. So when it's attached to a trifuran system, perhaps the overall structure is more symmetric.

Wait, so for C3h symmetry, the molecule must have a three-fold axis perpendicular to a mirror plane. So, for example, if you have a trigonal planar molecule with a mirror plane through the center, then C3h would apply.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric when rotated 120 degrees, and has a mirror plane.

Let me think about each compound again.

Triisopropyl borate (option C) has three identical isopropyl groups around boron. So, in that case, the molecule is symmetric. The boron is at the center, each substituent is the same. So the point group would likely be D3h, which includes a C3 axis and a σh plane. Wait, that's exactly C3h's elements. Wait, no, D3h is a higher symmetry point group that includes more symmetry elements, like a horizontal mirror plane and a three-fold rotation. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it definitely has C3h symmetry as well. Wait, no, point groups are subsets. So, if a molecule belongs to D3h, then it's in the same family as C3h. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate is in the D3h point group, which includes C3h. But the question is specifically about C3h, which is a lower symmetry than D3h. So perhaps the correct molecule has only C3h symmetry and not higher.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a molecule that has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane but no other symmetry elements. So, perhaps the molecule isn't as symmetric as D3h.

Let me think about the other options.

Option B: benzo...trifuran...hexaone. Let's imagine the structure. It's a benzofused trifuran. Trifuran is a tricyclic structure with three five-membered rings containing oxygen. When benzofused, perhaps a benzene is fused to one of the rings. So the molecule would have a bridged structure. Now, does this structure have a three-fold rotation axis? Perhaps not.

Option A: triphenyleno...trifuran...hexaone. Triphenylene is a triangular structure of three benzene rings connected. So when attached to a trifuran system, perhaps the molecule's structure has multiple substituents arranged symmetrically. If the substituents are arranged such that there is a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it could have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the triphenylene part is arranged symmetrically, perhaps leading to a three-fold axis.

Wait, triphenylene itself has a D3h symmetry. It's a tricyclic compound with three benzene rings arranged in a triangular fashion. So when it's attached to a trifuran, perhaps the overall molecule retains some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the triphenylene group is arranged such that the molecule has a three-fold axis, and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule, and a three-fold axis perpendicular to that plane, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, let's think about each structure.

Quinuclidine (option D) is a bicyclic molecule. The structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane with an amine group. It has a plane of symmetry, perhaps a mirror plane, but I'm not sure if it has a three-fold rotation axis. I think quinuclidine has a C2 axis, so its point group is D2h, perhaps. So it doesn't fit C3h.

Triisopropyl borate, option C, if it's trigonal planar with three identical substituents, then it should have D3h symmetry, which includes a C3 axis and a σh plane. So if the question is about C3h, which is a subgroup of D3h, then perhaps it would have C3h symmetry as well. But I'm a bit confused on whether D3h is a higher symmetry group that includes C3h. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for a molecule that specifically has C3h and not a higher symmetry.

Wait, C3h is a lower symmetry than D3h. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it would have all the elements of C3h plus more. So a molecule with D3h symmetry would have C3h symmetry as well. So if option C is D3h, then it would have C3h as a subset. But the question is which has C3h, so perhaps that's the answer. Hmm.

But wait, another thought: triisopropyl borate is trigonal planar, so it's D3h. So it has a C3 axis and a σh plane. So it definitely has C3h symmetry as well. So option C would be a possible answer.

Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D, and the question is which one has C3h symmetry. So why isn't it option C?

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about triisopropyl borate's point group. Let me think again. The structure is B with three isopropyl groups. Since all three substituents are identical and arranged in a trigonal planar fashion, the point group is indeed D3h. So this molecule would have C3h symmetry as part of D3h. But the question is, which molecule has C3h symmetry. So triisopropyl borate does have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but another option is option B or A. Let me think about benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Benzo substituents in the trifuran system. The numbering suggests substituents in specific positions. So the molecule might have a three-fold axis? Or perhaps a mirror plane. It's hard to visualize, but without more details, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B or A.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the point group C3h. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The molecule must be symmetric under a 120-degree rotation about the C3 axis and reflection across the σh plane. Also, any point on one side of the molecule must have a corresponding mirror image in the opposite side across the σh plane.

Looking at the structures again, triisopropyl borate (option C) has a trigonal planar structure with three identical substituents. So it definitely has a C3 axis and a σh plane. So it must have C3h symmetry. So why isn't that the answer? Because the question is about which of the options has C3h symmetry, and option C is triisopropyl borate.

Wait, but the options are listed as A, B, C, D. So the options are:

A) triphenyleno...hexaone
B) benzo...hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

So the options are labeled A, B, C, D as per the user's question.

So the options are:

Option C is triisopropyl borate.

So if triisopropyl borate is D3h, which includes C3h, then it would have C3h.

But wait, the question is which has C3h symmetry, so if any of the other options has exactly C3h without higher symmetry, that would be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate has D3h, so the correct answer is not C but another option.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about the point groups.

The point group D3h is a higher symmetry than C3h. So if a molecule has D3h, it has all the symmetry elements of C3h plus more. But the question is, which has C3h symmetry. So even if a molecule has D3h, it still has C3h.

So why would the answer not be option C?

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the molecule belongs solely to C3h and not a higher group. Because if a molecule has D3h, it's more than just C3h.

But the question is simply asking which of the molecules has C3h symmetry. So any molecule that has C3h, regardless of higher symmetry, would be the correct answer.

So if triisopropyl borate has D3h, it does have C3h as a subset. So it would be a correct answer.

But wait, if the question is asking which has C3h and not a higher group, then it's more complicated.

But the way the question is phrased, it's simply asking which has C3h symmetry, regardless of whether it has more. So option C would be correct.

But wait, another thought: the triisopropyl borate molecule actually has a center of inversion symmetry as well. Because each isopropyl group is identical, and the molecule can be inverted through the center. So if the molecule has a center of inversion, then what's its point group?

Wait, a center of inversion (i) would imply that the molecule is in the same point group as its mirror image. So if a molecule has a center of inversion, does that change the point group from D3h to something else?

Wait, no. D3h includes a center of inversion as well, because the combination of C3 and σh could lead to inversion. Alternatively, perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, the presence of a center of inversion would mean that the molecule also has the inversion center, which is part of the D3h group. So if triisopropyl borate has a center of inversion, then its point group is D3h, which includes C3h.

So in that case, option C would have C3h symmetry.

But then, why is that not the answer? Unless I'm missing something about the substituents or the structure.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the correct answer is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (option B). Let me imagine the structure. It's a benzo-fused trifuran. Trifuran is a structure with three rings. If the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution pattern in option B leads to a three-fold symmetry.

Wait, the numbering in the molecule (1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone) suggests that there are ketone groups. So the molecule is a tricyclic structure with several ketone groups.

Hmm, but without a clear picture, it's hard to be certain. Maybe the correct approach is to look for the most likely candidate.

Wait, another approach: Quinuclidine (option D) has a plane of symmetry but not a three-fold axis. So its point group is probably C2v or D2h, not C3h.

Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (option A) has triphenylene attached to a trifuran. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure with D3h symmetry. So when attached to the trifuran, perhaps the overall molecule has D3h symmetry, which would include C3h.

Alternatively, maybe the substitution in option A is such that it has a three-fold axis, leading to C3h symmetry.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) triphenyleno...trifuran...hexaone

B) benzo...trifuran...hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So, option C: triisopropyl borate. If it has three identical substituents around a central atom, the point group is D3h, which includes C3h. So it should have C3h symmetry. Therefore, if the question is which has C3h, option C would be correct.

Wait, but the options are labeled A, B, C, D. So the options in the user's question are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So in the user's question, the correct answer would be either C or another option.

Wait, but the question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry. So, if triisopropyl borate has D3h, then it has C3h. So it's a correct answer. So the answer should be option C.

But wait, earlier I thought that option C is triisopropyl borate, which would have D3h. So in that case, it does have C3h symmetry, so the answer is C.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought the question might be more about a molecule that's not as symmetric as D3h, but perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think about the point group of triisopropyl borate again.

Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So the central atom (B) is in a trigonal planar geometry. The three substituents are all isopropyl groups, which are identical.

In such a case, the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which is perpendicular to the trigonal plane. Additionally, it has a center of inversion (i), which is why the point group is D3h.

So, since D3h includes C3h, triisopropyl borate has C3h symmetry. So option C would be correct.

But I'm a bit uncertain because the question is about C3h and not D3h. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is triisopropyl borate. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit torn because I'm not entirely sure about the point group of triphenylene or the other compounds. But given the options, the most confident is option C.

But wait, I'm second-guessing because sometimes in such multiple-choice questions, the answer might not be the most obvious one. Let me think about another approach: looking for the presence of a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure, so yes, a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So it's C3h.

Alternatively, if one of the other molecules has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then that would be the correct answer.

Wait, let me think about option A: triphenyleno...trifuran. Triphenylene has three benzene rings arranged symmetrically. So when attached to a trifuran system, the overall structure might have a three-fold axis. For example, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically around a central point, the molecule could have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of the substituents in option A leads to C3h symmetry.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to be certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Let me think: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

If the benzo substituents are arranged in a symmetric way, maybe the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should base my answer on what I know about triisopropyl borate.

So, after considering everything, I think the answer is triisopropyl borate, option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃h** symmetry requires a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). Below is the analysis of each option:

---

### **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
- This molecule consists of a triphenylene group fused with a trifuran system. Triphenylene itself is a symmetric structure with **D₃h** symmetry, but the fusion with the trifuran system may disrupt higher symmetry.
- The overall structure does not clearly exhibit a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). Thus, it is unlikely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

---

### **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
- This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran system. The benzo substitution pattern introduces asymmetry, and the overall structure does not clearly exhibit a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) or a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ).
- Therefore, it is unlikely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

---

### **Option C: Triisopropyl Borate**
- Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule with boron at the center and three identical isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically.
- It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ), which satisfies the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry.
- While the molecule also has a center of inversion, this does not exclude it from having **C₃h** symmetry. Thus, it is a strong candidate for the correct answer.

---

### **Option D: Quinuclidine**
- Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework. It has a plane of symmetry but lacks a three-fold rotation axis (C₃).
- Its point group is **D₂h**, which does not include **C₃h** symmetry. Therefore, it is not the correct answer.

---

### **Conclusion**
Among the given options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that has **C₃h** symmetry due to its trigonal planar geometry with a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ).

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about molecular symmetry. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h is a type of point group, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this.

First, I should probably recall what C3h symmetry means. Point groups are determined based on the symmetry elements a molecule has. C3h, if I'm not mistaken, is a trigonal planar point group. The 'h' stands for horizontal, I think. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), right? Oh wait, wait, no—C3h is actually the combination of a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. Or is it that the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane and a three-fold rotation axis that's perpendicular to that plane?

Wait, maybe I should remember the different point groups. The common ones are like C1, C2, C3, C4, etc., and then their h, v, and d versions. Oh right, the h point groups have a horizontal mirror plane. So for C3h, the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and at least one horizontal mirror plane (σh). Also, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane usually implies that the molecule is planar in some way.

Now, looking at the options, the molecules are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I need to figure out which of these has C3h symmetry.

Let me start by recalling each molecule's structure.

Triisopropyl borate: Structure-wise, boron is at the center, bonded to three isopropyl groups. The formula is B(OiC(CH2CH3)2)3. Each isopropyl group is a substituent on the boron. Since all three substituents are the same, this molecule should have a trigonal planar geometry around boron. So the point group would be D3h, I think. Wait, because if all three groups are identical and there's a plane of symmetry, then yes, D3h. But wait, D3h is higher symmetry than C3h. So maybe this isn't the right one because the question is about C3h, not D3h.

Wait, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents and no other symmetry elements beyond C3? Or does it have a center of inversion? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's not D3h. Let me think again. Triisopropyl borate has three identical substituents, so the molecule is symmetric. The point group would be Td? No, wait, that's for tetrahedral structures. No, it's trigonal planar, so D3h. So if it's D3h, then perhaps it's not the correct answer because the question is about C3h.

Next, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, a norbornane derivative with an amine group. The structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivative, I think. Wait, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. Quinuclidine has a bridge structure. The molecule should have a certain symmetry. Norbornane itself has a C2 axis and some mirror planes. Quinuclidine is known to have a plane of symmetry. Wait, does it have a three-fold rotation axis? I don't think so. Quinuclidine's structure is more like a seven-membered ring with two bridgeheads. So perhaps it has a C2 axis, making its point group D2h or maybe C2v. Not sure, but I don't think it's C3h.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize. It's a benzo-fused trifuran system. Trifuran is a structure with three furan rings connected in a row, I think. Benzo substitution would add a benzene ring somewhere. Wait, the substituents are at different positions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tricyclic system with three furan moieties and a benzene. Alternatively, maybe the structure is a fused ring system with multiple rings. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tricyclic molecule with three fused rings, each containing oxygen. But regardless, I need to think about its symmetry.

Then, option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene attached somewhere. Triphenylene is a tricyclic aromatic compound—three benzene rings connected in a way that forms a sort of triangular structure. So when it's attached to a trifuran system, perhaps the overall structure is more symmetric.

Wait, so for C3h symmetry, the molecule must have a three-fold axis perpendicular to a mirror plane. So, for example, if you have a trigonal planar molecule with a mirror plane through the center, then C3h would apply.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric when rotated 120 degrees, and has a mirror plane.

Let me think about each compound again.

Triisopropyl borate (option C) has three identical isopropyl groups around boron. So, in that case, the molecule is symmetric. The boron is at the center, each substituent is the same. So the point group would likely be D3h, which includes a C3 axis and a σh plane. Wait, that's exactly C3h's elements. Wait, no, D3h is a higher symmetry point group that includes more symmetry elements, like a horizontal mirror plane and a three-fold rotation. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it definitely has C3h symmetry as well. Wait, no, point groups are subsets. So, if a molecule belongs to D3h, then it's in the same family as C3h. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate is in the D3h point group, which includes C3h. But the question is specifically about C3h, which is a lower symmetry than D3h. So perhaps the correct molecule has only C3h symmetry and not higher.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a molecule that has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane but no other symmetry elements. So, perhaps the molecule isn't as symmetric as D3h.

Let me think about the other options.

Option B: benzo...trifuran...hexaone. Let's imagine the structure. It's a benzofused trifuran. Trifuran is a tricyclic structure with three five-membered rings containing oxygen. When benzofused, perhaps a benzene is fused to one of the rings. So the molecule would have a bridged structure. Now, does this structure have a three-fold rotation axis? Perhaps not.

Option A: triphenyleno...trifuran...hexaone. Triphenylene is a triangular structure of three benzene rings connected. So when attached to a trifuran system, perhaps the molecule's structure has multiple substituents arranged symmetrically. If the substituents are arranged such that there is a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it could have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the triphenylene part is arranged symmetrically, perhaps leading to a three-fold axis.

Wait, triphenylene itself has a D3h symmetry. It's a tricyclic compound with three benzene rings arranged in a triangular fashion. So when it's attached to a trifuran, perhaps the overall molecule retains some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the triphenylene group is arranged such that the molecule has a three-fold axis, and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule, and a three-fold axis perpendicular to that plane, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, let's think about each structure.

Quinuclidine (option D) is a bicyclic molecule. The structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane with an amine group. It has a plane of symmetry, perhaps a mirror plane, but I'm not sure if it has a three-fold rotation axis. I think quinuclidine has a C2 axis, so its point group is D2h, perhaps. So it doesn't fit C3h.

Triisopropyl borate, option C, if it's trigonal planar with three identical substituents, then it should have D3h symmetry, which includes a C3 axis and a σh plane. So if the question is about C3h, which is a subgroup of D3h, then perhaps it would have C3h symmetry as well. But I'm a bit confused on whether D3h is a higher symmetry group that includes C3h. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for a molecule that specifically has C3h and not a higher symmetry.

Wait, C3h is a lower symmetry than D3h. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it would have all the elements of C3h plus more. So a molecule with D3h symmetry would have C3h symmetry as well. So if option C is D3h, then it would have C3h as a subset. But the question is which has C3h, so perhaps that's the answer. Hmm.

But wait, another thought: triisopropyl borate is trigonal planar, so it's D3h. So it has a C3 axis and a σh plane. So it definitely has C3h symmetry as well. So option C would be a possible answer.

Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D, and the question is which one has C3h symmetry. So why isn't it option C?

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about triisopropyl borate's point group. Let me think again. The structure is B with three isopropyl groups. Since all three substituents are identical and arranged in a trigonal planar fashion, the point group is indeed D3h. So this molecule would have C3h symmetry as part of D3h. But the question is, which molecule has C3h symmetry. So triisopropyl borate does have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but another option is option B or A. Let me think about benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Benzo substituents in the trifuran system. The numbering suggests substituents in specific positions. So the molecule might have a three-fold axis? Or perhaps a mirror plane. It's hard to visualize, but without more details, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B or A.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the point group C3h. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The molecule must be symmetric under a 120-degree rotation about the C3 axis and reflection across the σh plane. Also, any point on one side of the molecule must have a corresponding mirror image in the opposite side across the σh plane.

Looking at the structures again, triisopropyl borate (option C) has a trigonal planar structure with three identical substituents. So it definitely has a C3 axis and a σh plane. So it must have C3h symmetry. So why isn't that the answer? Because the question is about which of the options has C3h symmetry, and option C is triisopropyl borate.

Wait, but the options are listed as A, B, C, D. So the options are:

A) triphenyleno...hexaone
B) benzo...hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

So the options are labeled A, B, C, D as per the user's question.

So the options are:

Option C is triisopropyl borate.

So if triisopropyl borate is D3h, which includes C3h, then it would have C3h.

But wait, the question is which has C3h symmetry, so if any of the other options has exactly C3h without higher symmetry, that would be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate has D3h, so the correct answer is not C but another option.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about the point groups.

The point group D3h is a higher symmetry than C3h. So if a molecule has D3h, it has all the symmetry elements of C3h plus more. But the question is, which has C3h symmetry. So even if a molecule has D3h, it still has C3h.

So why would the answer not be option C?

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the molecule belongs solely to C3h and not a higher group. Because if a molecule has D3h, it's more than just C3h.

But the question is simply asking which of the molecules has C3h symmetry. So any molecule that has C3h, regardless of higher symmetry, would be the correct answer.

So if triisopropyl borate has D3h, it does have C3h as a subset. So it would be a correct answer.

But wait, if the question is asking which has C3h and not a higher group, then it's more complicated.

But the way the question is phrased, it's simply asking which has C3h symmetry, regardless of whether it has more. So option C would be correct.

But wait, another thought: the triisopropyl borate molecule actually has a center of inversion symmetry as well. Because each isopropyl group is identical, and the molecule can be inverted through the center. So if the molecule has a center of inversion, then what's its point group?

Wait, a center of inversion (i) would imply that the molecule is in the same point group as its mirror image. So if a molecule has a center of inversion, does that change the point group from D3h to something else?

Wait, no. D3h includes a center of inversion as well, because the combination of C3 and σh could lead to inversion. Alternatively, perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, the presence of a center of inversion would mean that the molecule also has the inversion center, which is part of the D3h group. So if triisopropyl borate has a center of inversion, then its point group is D3h, which includes C3h.

So in that case, option C would have C3h symmetry.

But then, why is that not the answer? Unless I'm missing something about the substituents or the structure.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the correct answer is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (option B). Let me imagine the structure. It's a benzo-fused trifuran. Trifuran is a structure with three rings. If the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution pattern in option B leads to a three-fold symmetry.

Wait, the numbering in the molecule (1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone) suggests that there are ketone groups. So the molecule is a tricyclic structure with several ketone groups.

Hmm, but without a clear picture, it's hard to be certain. Maybe the correct approach is to look for the most likely candidate.

Wait, another approach: Quinuclidine (option D) has a plane of symmetry but not a three-fold axis. So its point group is probably C2v or D2h, not C3h.

Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (option A) has triphenylene attached to a trifuran. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure with D3h symmetry. So when attached to the trifuran, perhaps the overall molecule has D3h symmetry, which would include C3h.

Alternatively, maybe the substitution in option A is such that it has a three-fold axis, leading to C3h symmetry.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) triphenyleno...trifuran...hexaone

B) benzo...trifuran...hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So, option C: triisopropyl borate. If it has three identical substituents around a central atom, the point group is D3h, which includes C3h. So it should have C3h symmetry. Therefore, if the question is which has C3h, option C would be correct.

Wait, but the options are labeled A, B, C, D. So the options in the user's question are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So in the user's question, the correct answer would be either C or another option.

Wait, but the question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry. So, if triisopropyl borate has D3h, then it has C3h. So it's a correct answer. So the answer should be option C.

But wait, earlier I thought that option C is triisopropyl borate, which would have D3h. So in that case, it does have C3h symmetry, so the answer is C.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought the question might be more about a molecule that's not as symmetric as D3h, but perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think about the point group of triisopropyl borate again.

Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So the central atom (B) is in a trigonal planar geometry. The three substituents are all isopropyl groups, which are identical.

In such a case, the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which is perpendicular to the trigonal plane. Additionally, it has a center of inversion (i), which is why the point group is D3h.

So, since D3h includes C3h, triisopropyl borate has C3h symmetry. So option C would be correct.

But I'm a bit uncertain because the question is about C3h and not D3h. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is triisopropyl borate. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit torn because I'm not entirely sure about the point group of triphenylene or the other compounds. But given the options, the most confident is option C.

But wait, I'm second-guessing because sometimes in such multiple-choice questions, the answer might not be the most obvious one. Let me think about another approach: looking for the presence of a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure, so yes, a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So it's C3h.

Alternatively, if one of the other molecules has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then that would be the correct answer.

Wait, let me think about option A: triphenyleno...trifuran. Triphenylene has three benzene rings arranged symmetrically. So when attached to a trifuran system, the overall structure might have a three-fold axis. For example, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically around a central point, the molecule could have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of the substituents in option A leads to C3h symmetry.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to be certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Let me think: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

If the benzo substituents are arranged in a symmetric way, maybe the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should base my answer on what I know about triisopropyl borate.

So, after considering everything, I think the answer is triisopropyl borate, option C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃h** symmetry requires a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). Below is the analysis of each option:

---

### **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
- This molecule consists of a triphenylene group fused with a trifuran system. Triphenylene itself is a symmetric structure with **D₃h** symmetry, but the fusion with the trifuran system may disrupt higher symmetry.
- The overall structure does not clearly exhibit a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). Thus, it is unlikely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

---

### **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
- This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran system. The benzo substitution pattern introduces asymmetry, and the overall structure does not clearly exhibit a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) or a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ).
- Therefore, it is unlikely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

---

### **Option C: Triisopropyl Borate**
- Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule with boron at the center and three identical isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically.
- It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ), which satisfies the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry.
- While the molecule also has a center of inversion, this does not exclude it from having **C₃h** symmetry. Thus, it is a strong candidate for the correct answer.

---

### **Option D: Quinuclidine**
- Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework. It has a plane of symmetry but lacks a three-fold rotation axis (C₃).
- Its point group is **D₂h**, which does not include **C₃h** symmetry. Therefore, it is not the correct answer.

---

### **Conclusion**
Among the given options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that has **C₃h** symmetry due to its trigonal planar geometry with a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ).

**Answer: C**
