Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson field X. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question is about what the allowed decays are for the boson X at the lowest order. I remember that in particle physics, the decay products must satisfy conservation laws and also the energy must be sufficient.

First, I'll look at the Lagrangian given: it's written as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I think the structure here suggests that the boson X interacts with fermions. The interaction term probably looks like a Yukawa coupling, where the fermion fields are ψ_f and the boson is X. So, the interaction is between X and the fermions, and the fermions must have a charge that allows this.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, when X decays, it will produce pairs of particles (like fermions and their antiparticles). The available energy is 6 GeV, so each pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Now, the possible decay products are pairs of fermions. So I need to consider all possible fermion pairs that can result from the decay. But wait, each fermion has its own mass. The sum of the masses of the fermion and antifermion must be less than or equal to the mass of X, because energy and mass are related via E=mc². So for each possible pair, their combined mass should be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me list all the possible fermions that could be produced:

- Up quark (u): mass around ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV, so definitely can't be produced here
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are possible too, but the problem only lists charged leptons in the options, so maybe we don't need to consider neutrinos for this question.

Wait, but in the options, the decay products include things like b bbar, which is bottom quarks. Let me check their masses. Bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV each. So a pair would be about 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. Oh wait, so that's impossible. So X can't decay into b bbar because the mass is 6 GeV, and each b quark is about 4.5 GeV. That would require 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So that's not allowed. So options A and D have b bbar, which is not allowed. So probably, those options are incorrect.

Wait, wait, did I get the masses right? I might be confusing the masses. Let me double-check. For quarks:

- u is about 2 MeV
- d is about 5 MeV
- s is about 100 MeV
- c is around 1.2 GeV (I might have said 1.5 earlier, but let's say 1.2 for calculation)
- b is about 4.7 GeV
- t is 173 GeV, way too big.

So for a boson of 6 GeV, the maximum possible rest mass for a fermion pair is 6 GeV. So the sum of the two fermion masses can't exceed 6 GeV.

So for each possible fermion pair:

- e+ e- : each electron is 0.5 MeV. So 1 MeV total. Well under 6 GeV. So allowed.
- mu+ mu- : each muon is about 105 MeV. So 210 MeV total. Allowed.
- tau+ tau- : each is about 1.78 GeV. So 3.56 GeV total. 3.56 <6, so allowed.
- u and anti-u: 2*(2 MeV) =4 MeV. Allowed.
- d and anti-d: 5 MeV each, total 10 MeV. Allowed.
- s and anti-s: 100 MeV each, total 200 MeV. Allowed.
- c and anti-c: 1.2 GeV each, total 2.4 GeV. 2.4 <6, so allowed.
- b and anti-b: 4.7*2=9.4 GeV. That's more than 6, so not allowed. So X can't decay into b bbar.

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b bbar. So that's not allowed. So A is out.

Option B: includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau tau, and e e. Also includes mu+ mu-.

So check each: c cbar is allowed (2.4 GeV), and all others are allowed. So B has all these, plus more. Wait, let me check the option.

Option B says: X→c cbar, ssbar, uu, dd, tau, mu, e. So all these are allowed.

Option C: X→c cbar, ssbar, uu, dd, t tbar, tau, mu, e. But t is 173 GeV, so each t is way beyond 6 GeV. So can't decay into t tbar. So C is out.

Option D: Includes b bbar, which we determined isn't allowed. So D is out.

So the correct option is B. So the allowed decays are into c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau tau, mu mu, and e e.

Wait, but let me make sure that the interaction is possible. The Lagrangian term is -λ f f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So it's an interaction between X and the fermion ψ_f. So ψ_f must be charged under the same symmetry as X. Wait, but the exact charges would determine what particles can interact. But in the problem statement, it's given as a general interaction, so perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling, meaning that the fermion can have a charge that allows the coupling.

Well, the specifics of the charges might not affect the kinematic limits, but only whether the interaction is possible. So as long as the fermion has a charge that allows it to interact with X, it's possible. But since the question is about kinematical decay possibilities, regardless of the actual interaction's existence in nature, but just what is allowed by energy.

Wait, but the problem says, what are the kinematically allowed decays AT THE LOWEST ORDER. So that would be considering if the decay is possible via the given interaction. So the interaction must allow the decay.

The interaction term is λ f f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps this represents a term like ψ_f^dagger (v + X) ψ_f. So the fermion ψ_f must be a Dirac fermion, and the interaction is Yukawa-type. So for each fermion ψ_f, the interaction term is present.

So the possible decay products would be any pair of fermions that ψ_f can produce. Wait, but in the interaction, each ψ_f is a specific fermion. So the fermion in the interaction is ψ_f, so X can decay into ψ_f and its antiparticle.

Wait no, the interaction term would allow X to couple to ψ_f. So when X decays, it can produce any of the fermions that are part of the interaction. So the available fermions are those that the interaction term allows.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify what ψ_f is. Oh wait, perhaps the interaction is for all possible fermions. Hmm, the way it's written, the Lagrangian has "f" as an index, perhaps indicating that it's summed over all fermions. So for each possible fermion, the interaction exists. So the possible decay products are all possible fermion pairs, as long as their combined mass is less than 6 GeV.

So considering that, the possible fermions are all the quarks and leptons. But the quarks have color, which complicates things. Because, in reality, when a boson couples to quarks, which are colored, the decay would have to produce quark-antiquark pairs, but in the case of a spin-0 boson, it would decay into a quark and antiquark. But in terms of the decay process, the X boson can decay into any quark-antiquark pair as long as their mass allows.

Wait, but for the available options, the quark pairs are considered. So the options include things like s sbar, c cbar, etc.

So, if X decays into quarks, but since quarks are confined, perhaps the decay would proceed into hadrons, but that's not relevant for the question, which is about possible decay products regardless of detection. The question is about kinematically allowed decays, so the possible final states are the quark-antiquark pairs and lepton pairs.

So, in that case, the possible decay modes would include all fermion pairs where the sum of the masses is less than 6 GeV. So, as I thought earlier, the possible fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

But let me check their masses again:

e: 0.5 MeV
mu: 105 MeV
tau: 1.78 GeV
u: 2 MeV
d: 5 MeV
s: 100 MeV
c: 1.25 GeV

So, for each pair:

e+ e-: 1 MeV → allowed.

mu+ mu-: 210 MeV → allowed.

tau+ tau-: 3.56 GeV → allowed.

u ubar: 4 MeV → allowed.

d dbar: 10 MeV → allowed.

s sbar: 200 MeV → allowed.

c cbar: 2.5 GeV → allowed.

b bbar: 9.4 GeV → not allowed.

So all of the fermion pairs in option B are allowed, except that in option B, I don't see any tbars. Oh wait, option B doesn't include top quarks, which is correct because top is too heavy.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e. So that's all the possible allowed fermion pairs. So option B is the correct one.

Wait, another thing: the problem says "lowest order". I think that just refers to tree-level decays, so higher-order processes like loop decays are not considered here. So the allowed decays are the ones that can proceed via the given interaction term directly, without needing loops.

So the answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. The interaction term suggests a Yukawa-like coupling between the boson \( X \) and fermions. The decays must satisfy energy conservation, meaning the total mass of the decay products must not exceed the mass of \( X \), which is 6 GeV.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Constraints**: For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \), the combined mass of the fermion \( f \) and its antiparticle \( \bar{f} \) must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. The masses of the fermions are as follows:
   - \( e \): \( 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \)
   - \( \mu \): \( 105 \, \text{MeV} \)
   - \( \tau \): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( u \): \( 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
   - \( d \): \( 5 \, \text{MeV} \)
   - \( s \): \( 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
   - \( c \): \( 1.25 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( b \): \( 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy, as \( 2 \times 4.7 = 9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
   - \( t \): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy, not allowed).

2. **Allowed Decays**: Based on the mass constraints, the allowed decays are:
   - \( X \to e^+ e^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \)
   - \( X \to u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( c \bar{c} \)

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because the combined mass of \( b \bar{b} \) exceeds 6 GeV. Hence, this option is incorrect.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \). All these decays are allowed based on the mass constraints. This option is correct.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( X \to t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because the top quark is too heavy (\( 173 \, \text{GeV} \)). Hence, this option is incorrect.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A. Hence, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The only kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order are those listed in **Option B**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson field X. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question is about what the allowed decays are for the boson X at the lowest order. I remember that in particle physics, the decay products must satisfy conservation laws and also the energy must be sufficient.

First, I'll look at the Lagrangian given: it's written as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I think the structure here suggests that the boson X interacts with fermions. The interaction term probably looks like a Yukawa coupling, where the fermion fields are ψ_f and the boson is X. So, the interaction is between X and the fermions, and the fermions must have a charge that allows this.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, when X decays, it will produce pairs of particles (like fermions and their antiparticles). The available energy is 6 GeV, so each pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Now, the possible decay products are pairs of fermions. So I need to consider all possible fermion pairs that can result from the decay. But wait, each fermion has its own mass. The sum of the masses of the fermion and antifermion must be less than or equal to the mass of X, because energy and mass are related via E=mc². So for each possible pair, their combined mass should be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me list all the possible fermions that could be produced:

- Up quark (u): mass around ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV, so definitely can't be produced here
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are possible too, but the problem only lists charged leptons in the options, so maybe we don't need to consider neutrinos for this question.

Wait, but in the options, the decay products include things like b bbar, which is bottom quarks. Let me check their masses. Bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV each. So a pair would be about 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. Oh wait, so that's impossible. So X can't decay into b bbar because the mass is 6 GeV, and each b quark is about 4.5 GeV. That would require 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So that's not allowed. So options A and D have b bbar, which is not allowed. So probably, those options are incorrect.

Wait, wait, did I get the masses right? I might be confusing the masses. Let me double-check. For quarks:

- u is about 2 MeV
- d is about 5 MeV
- s is about 100 MeV
- c is around 1.2 GeV (I might have said 1.5 earlier, but let's say 1.2 for calculation)
- b is about 4.7 GeV
- t is 173 GeV, way too big.

So for a boson of 6 GeV, the maximum possible rest mass for a fermion pair is 6 GeV. So the sum of the two fermion masses can't exceed 6 GeV.

So for each possible fermion pair:

- e+ e- : each electron is 0.5 MeV. So 1 MeV total. Well under 6 GeV. So allowed.
- mu+ mu- : each muon is about 105 MeV. So 210 MeV total. Allowed.
- tau+ tau- : each is about 1.78 GeV. So 3.56 GeV total. 3.56 <6, so allowed.
- u and anti-u: 2*(2 MeV) =4 MeV. Allowed.
- d and anti-d: 5 MeV each, total 10 MeV. Allowed.
- s and anti-s: 100 MeV each, total 200 MeV. Allowed.
- c and anti-c: 1.2 GeV each, total 2.4 GeV. 2.4 <6, so allowed.
- b and anti-b: 4.7*2=9.4 GeV. That's more than 6, so not allowed. So X can't decay into b bbar.

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b bbar. So that's not allowed. So A is out.

Option B: includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau tau, and e e. Also includes mu+ mu-.

So check each: c cbar is allowed (2.4 GeV), and all others are allowed. So B has all these, plus more. Wait, let me check the option.

Option B says: X→c cbar, ssbar, uu, dd, tau, mu, e. So all these are allowed.

Option C: X→c cbar, ssbar, uu, dd, t tbar, tau, mu, e. But t is 173 GeV, so each t is way beyond 6 GeV. So can't decay into t tbar. So C is out.

Option D: Includes b bbar, which we determined isn't allowed. So D is out.

So the correct option is B. So the allowed decays are into c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau tau, mu mu, and e e.

Wait, but let me make sure that the interaction is possible. The Lagrangian term is -λ f f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So it's an interaction between X and the fermion ψ_f. So ψ_f must be charged under the same symmetry as X. Wait, but the exact charges would determine what particles can interact. But in the problem statement, it's given as a general interaction, so perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling, meaning that the fermion can have a charge that allows the coupling.

Well, the specifics of the charges might not affect the kinematic limits, but only whether the interaction is possible. So as long as the fermion has a charge that allows it to interact with X, it's possible. But since the question is about kinematical decay possibilities, regardless of the actual interaction's existence in nature, but just what is allowed by energy.

Wait, but the problem says, what are the kinematically allowed decays AT THE LOWEST ORDER. So that would be considering if the decay is possible via the given interaction. So the interaction must allow the decay.

The interaction term is λ f f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps this represents a term like ψ_f^dagger (v + X) ψ_f. So the fermion ψ_f must be a Dirac fermion, and the interaction is Yukawa-type. So for each fermion ψ_f, the interaction term is present.

So the possible decay products would be any pair of fermions that ψ_f can produce. Wait, but in the interaction, each ψ_f is a specific fermion. So the fermion in the interaction is ψ_f, so X can decay into ψ_f and its antiparticle.

Wait no, the interaction term would allow X to couple to ψ_f. So when X decays, it can produce any of the fermions that are part of the interaction. So the available fermions are those that the interaction term allows.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify what ψ_f is. Oh wait, perhaps the interaction is for all possible fermions. Hmm, the way it's written, the Lagrangian has "f" as an index, perhaps indicating that it's summed over all fermions. So for each possible fermion, the interaction exists. So the possible decay products are all possible fermion pairs, as long as their combined mass is less than 6 GeV.

So considering that, the possible fermions are all the quarks and leptons. But the quarks have color, which complicates things. Because, in reality, when a boson couples to quarks, which are colored, the decay would have to produce quark-antiquark pairs, but in the case of a spin-0 boson, it would decay into a quark and antiquark. But in terms of the decay process, the X boson can decay into any quark-antiquark pair as long as their mass allows.

Wait, but for the available options, the quark pairs are considered. So the options include things like s sbar, c cbar, etc.

So, if X decays into quarks, but since quarks are confined, perhaps the decay would proceed into hadrons, but that's not relevant for the question, which is about possible decay products regardless of detection. The question is about kinematically allowed decays, so the possible final states are the quark-antiquark pairs and lepton pairs.

So, in that case, the possible decay modes would include all fermion pairs where the sum of the masses is less than 6 GeV. So, as I thought earlier, the possible fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

But let me check their masses again:

e: 0.5 MeV
mu: 105 MeV
tau: 1.78 GeV
u: 2 MeV
d: 5 MeV
s: 100 MeV
c: 1.25 GeV

So, for each pair:

e+ e-: 1 MeV → allowed.

mu+ mu-: 210 MeV → allowed.

tau+ tau-: 3.56 GeV → allowed.

u ubar: 4 MeV → allowed.

d dbar: 10 MeV → allowed.

s sbar: 200 MeV → allowed.

c cbar: 2.5 GeV → allowed.

b bbar: 9.4 GeV → not allowed.

So all of the fermion pairs in option B are allowed, except that in option B, I don't see any tbars. Oh wait, option B doesn't include top quarks, which is correct because top is too heavy.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e. So that's all the possible allowed fermion pairs. So option B is the correct one.

Wait, another thing: the problem says "lowest order". I think that just refers to tree-level decays, so higher-order processes like loop decays are not considered here. So the allowed decays are the ones that can proceed via the given interaction term directly, without needing loops.

So the answer should be option B.
