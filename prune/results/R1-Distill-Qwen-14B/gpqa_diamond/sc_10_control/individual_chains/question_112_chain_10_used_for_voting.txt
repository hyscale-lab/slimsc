Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Okay, the problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I know that |up> and |down> form an orthonormal basis for the spin-½ system.

The task has two parts. First, calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator's matrix representation A is given such that Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Then, find the average value of that operator.

Wait, let me parse that operator's matrix. The matrix A is 2x2 because it's for spin-½. So the matrix would have zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere? Let me write that out.

For a 2x2 matrix:
A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh right! That matrix is proportional to the Pauli X matrix. The Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (ħ/2) * σ_x.

Wait, but wait, the Pauli matrices usually have 1s off-diagonal. So for σ_x, it's [[0,1],[1,0]]. So if A has elements ħ/2 when i≠j, then A is (ħ/2) times σ_x. Because σ_x has 1s where A has ħ/2. So yes, A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

Now, the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of A. So the operator A has eigenstates which are the same as σ_x's. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction.

So the question is asking for the probability of measuring the electron in each of these eigenstates of A, given the state |alpha>.

Wait, but wait. The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So I think the first thing is to normalize |alpha> so that it's a unit vector.

Because right now, it's just proportional to that. So the state is |alpha> = c [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ], where c is a normalization constant. I need to find c such that <alpha|alpha> = 1.

So let's compute the inner product. Let me compute the squared magnitude of each coefficient.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i). Let's compute |1+i|^2 and |2-i|^2.

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
Wait, wait, no. |a + ib|^2 is a² + b². So 1² + 1² = 2.

Similarly, |2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

But wait, the state is a linear combination, so when you take the inner product, you get the sum of the squares of the magnitudes times the orthonormality of |up> and |down>.

Wait, no, more accurately, the inner product is (1+i)^* (1+i) + (2-i)^* (2 -i), since |up> and |down> are orthogonal.

So each term is the magnitude squared.

So |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 -i|^2 = (2)^2 + (1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization constant c is 1/sqrt(7). Because |alpha> is c times the vector, so |c|² (2+5) =1. So c=1/sqrt(7).

So the normalized state is |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Next, I need to find the probability of measuring the eigenstates of A. Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the same as those of A, up to a scalar. So let me write down the eigenstates of σ_x.

The eigenstates |+x> and |-x> can be written as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. The eigenstates of σ_x are the states where σ_x |+x> = +|+x>, and similarly for |−x>.

Alternatively, another way to write them is:

|+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) in the computational basis. But in our case, the basis is |up> and |down>, which correspond to |0> and |1> in computational terms. So yes, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So now, to find the probability of measuring +x or -x, I need to find the projection of |alpha> onto |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue a_i is |<a_i | alpha>|^2.

So let's compute < +x | alpha > and < -x | alpha >.

First, let's write |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ]

So to compute < +x | alpha >, which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] multiplied by (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Let me compute it step by step.

Compute the inner product:

<+x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

The inner product becomes:

(1/sqrt(2 * 7)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Since <up|up> = 1, <up|down> =0, <down|up> =0, <down|down> =1.

Simplify:

(1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i)(1) + (1+i)(0) + (2-i)(0) + (2 -i)(1) ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ]

Combine like terms:

1 + 2 =3; i - i =0. So 3.

So <+x| alpha> = 3 / sqrt(14).

The probability is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = (9)/(14).

Similarly, compute <+x| alpha> squared magnitude is 9/14.

Now the other eigenstate, |-x>:

< -x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

So inner product:

(1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Wait, no, let me do it correctly.

Wait, expanding it:

(1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <down| up> - (1+i) <up|down> - (2 -i) <down| down> ]

Wait, no, perhaps I should do it step by step.

< -x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ]

Multiply the two:

= (1 / sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (1+i) <up|down> - (2-i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The expansion is:

(1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <down|up> - (1+i) <up|down> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

But <up|up> is 1, <down|up> is 0, <up|down> is 0, <down|down> is 1.

So substituting all these:

(1/sqrt(14)) [ (1 + i) * 1 + (2 -i) * 0 - (1 + i)*0 - (2 - i)*1 ]

Simplify:

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [1 + i -2 + i ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (-1) + 2i ]

So <+x|alpha> was 3/sqrt(14), and <-x|alpha> is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are the squared magnitudes.

So for <+x|alpha>, |3/sqrt(14)|^2 =9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

For <-x|alpha>, |(-1 +2i)|^2 /14. Let's compute |(-1 +2i)|²: (-1)^2 + (2)^2=1+4=5. So 5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, but wait. 9/14 is about 0.6428, which is approximately 0.64. The other probability is 5/14 ≈0.357, which is about 0.357.

But wait, 9 +5=14, so it's correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

But wait, let's check the other part: the average value of the operator A.

Operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_x.

The expectation value of σ_x for state |alpha> is <alpha|σ_x|alpha>.

Alternatively, since σ_x is a Hermitian matrix, the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Wait, but A has eigenvalues (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So the expectation value of A is (probability of +x) * (ħ/2 *1) + (probability of -x) * (ħ/2 * (-1)).

Which is (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2).

= [ (9 -5) * ħ/2 ] /14

= (4 * ħ/2 ) /14

= (2 ħ ) /14

= ħ/7.

So the expectation value is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14≈0.6428 (≈0.64) and 5/14≈0.357 (≈0.36), and expectation value ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7.

So that's Option A.

Wait, looking back, the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but let's make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Another approach: since |alpha> can be written in the |up>, |down> basis, and operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x, which has matrix representation [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute that.

First, |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

So compute A |alpha>.

A |alpha> = (ħ/2) σ_x |alpha>.

σ_x |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ].

Because σ_x swaps |up> and |down>.

So sigma_x |up> = |down>, sigma_x |down> = |up>.

So A |alpha> = (ħ/2) (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ].

Now, <alpha| A |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 -i) <up| + (2 + i) <down| ] times A |alpha>.

Let me compute this inner product.

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 -i) <up| + (2 +i) <down| ] * (ħ/2) (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ]

Factor out (1/sqrt(7)) * (1/sqrt(7)) = 1/7 and (ħ/2).

So:

(ħ/2) * (1/7) [ (1 -i)( (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <up|up> ) + (2 +i)( (1+i) <down|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute each component.

Breaking it down:

The inner product is:

(1 -i) * (1+i) * <up|down> + (1 -i) * (2 -i) * <up|up>
+ (2 +i) * (1+i) * <down|down> + (2 +i) * (2 -i) * <down|up>

But <up|down> and <down|up> are zero. So only the terms where the states match.

So the non-zero terms are:

(1 -i)(2 -i) <up|up> + (2 +i)(1 +i) <down|down>

Compute each:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i)= 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i +i² = 2+3i -1 =1 +3i.

So the inner product becomes:

(1 -3i) *1 + (1 +3i)*1 = (1 -3i +1 +3i) = 2.

So putting it all together, the expectation value is:

(ħ/2) * (1/7) * 2 = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

Which matches our earlier calculation. So that's correct.

So the average value is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and average value is ħ/7. So the correct option is A.

The problem involves determining the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be calculated. The state of the electron is given as \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
- \( |1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \),
- \( |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \).

The normalization constant is \( c = 1/\sqrt{7} \), so the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) (and hence \( A \)) are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad
|-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
The probability of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) is \( |\langle +x|\alpha\rangle|^2 \), and the probability of measuring \( |-x\rangle \) is \( |\langle -x|\alpha\rangle|^2 \). Compute the inner products:
\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow| + \langle \downarrow| \right) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right),
\]
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow| - \langle \downarrow| \right) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]
Simplify:
\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are:
\[
P(|+x\rangle) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad
P(|-x\rangle) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by \( \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha|A|\alpha\rangle \). Using the eigenvalues of \( A \), \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Okay, the problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I know that |up> and |down> form an orthonormal basis for the spin-½ system.

The task has two parts. First, calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator's matrix representation A is given such that Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Then, find the average value of that operator.

Wait, let me parse that operator's matrix. The matrix A is 2x2 because it's for spin-½. So the matrix would have zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere? Let me write that out.

For a 2x2 matrix:
A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh right! That matrix is proportional to the Pauli X matrix. The Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (ħ/2) * σ_x.

Wait, but wait, the Pauli matrices usually have 1s off-diagonal. So for σ_x, it's [[0,1],[1,0]]. So if A has elements ħ/2 when i≠j, then A is (ħ/2) times σ_x. Because σ_x has 1s where A has ħ/2. So yes, A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

Now, the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of A. So the operator A has eigenstates which are the same as σ_x's. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction.

So the question is asking for the probability of measuring the electron in each of these eigenstates of A, given the state |alpha>.

Wait, but wait. The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So I think the first thing is to normalize |alpha> so that it's a unit vector.

Because right now, it's just proportional to that. So the state is |alpha> = c [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ], where c is a normalization constant. I need to find c such that <alpha|alpha> = 1.

So let's compute the inner product. Let me compute the squared magnitude of each coefficient.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i). Let's compute |1+i|^2 and |2-i|^2.

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
Wait, wait, no. |a + ib|^2 is a² + b². So 1² + 1² = 2.

Similarly, |2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

But wait, the state is a linear combination, so when you take the inner product, you get the sum of the squares of the magnitudes times the orthonormality of |up> and |down>.

Wait, no, more accurately, the inner product is (1+i)^* (1+i) + (2-i)^* (2 -i), since |up> and |down> are orthogonal.

So each term is the magnitude squared.

So |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 -i|^2 = (2)^2 + (1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization constant c is 1/sqrt(7). Because |alpha> is c times the vector, so |c|² (2+5) =1. So c=1/sqrt(7).

So the normalized state is |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Next, I need to find the probability of measuring the eigenstates of A. Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the same as those of A, up to a scalar. So let me write down the eigenstates of σ_x.

The eigenstates |+x> and |-x> can be written as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. The eigenstates of σ_x are the states where σ_x |+x> = +|+x>, and similarly for |−x>.

Alternatively, another way to write them is:

|+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) in the computational basis. But in our case, the basis is |up> and |down>, which correspond to |0> and |1> in computational terms. So yes, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So now, to find the probability of measuring +x or -x, I need to find the projection of |alpha> onto |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue a_i is |<a_i | alpha>|^2.

So let's compute < +x | alpha > and < -x | alpha >.

First, let's write |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ]

So to compute < +x | alpha >, which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] multiplied by (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Let me compute it step by step.

Compute the inner product:

<+x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

The inner product becomes:

(1/sqrt(2 * 7)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Since <up|up> = 1, <up|down> =0, <down|up> =0, <down|down> =1.

Simplify:

(1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i)(1) + (1+i)(0) + (2-i)(0) + (2 -i)(1) ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ]

Combine like terms:

1 + 2 =3; i - i =0. So 3.

So <+x| alpha> = 3 / sqrt(14).

The probability is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = (9)/(14).

Similarly, compute <+x| alpha> squared magnitude is 9/14.

Now the other eigenstate, |-x>:

< -x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

So inner product:

(1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Wait, no, let me do it correctly.

Wait, expanding it:

(1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <down| up> - (1+i) <up|down> - (2 -i) <down| down> ]

Wait, no, perhaps I should do it step by step.

< -x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ]

Multiply the two:

= (1 / sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (1+i) <up|down> - (2-i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The expansion is:

(1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <down|up> - (1+i) <up|down> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

But <up|up> is 1, <down|up> is 0, <up|down> is 0, <down|down> is 1.

So substituting all these:

(1/sqrt(14)) [ (1 + i) * 1 + (2 -i) * 0 - (1 + i)*0 - (2 - i)*1 ]

Simplify:

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [1 + i -2 + i ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (-1) + 2i ]

So <+x|alpha> was 3/sqrt(14), and <-x|alpha> is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are the squared magnitudes.

So for <+x|alpha>, |3/sqrt(14)|^2 =9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

For <-x|alpha>, |(-1 +2i)|^2 /14. Let's compute |(-1 +2i)|²: (-1)^2 + (2)^2=1+4=5. So 5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, but wait. 9/14 is about 0.6428, which is approximately 0.64. The other probability is 5/14 ≈0.357, which is about 0.357.

But wait, 9 +5=14, so it's correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

But wait, let's check the other part: the average value of the operator A.

Operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_x.

The expectation value of σ_x for state |alpha> is <alpha|σ_x|alpha>.

Alternatively, since σ_x is a Hermitian matrix, the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Wait, but A has eigenvalues (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So the expectation value of A is (probability of +x) * (ħ/2 *1) + (probability of -x) * (ħ/2 * (-1)).

Which is (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2).

= [ (9 -5) * ħ/2 ] /14

= (4 * ħ/2 ) /14

= (2 ħ ) /14

= ħ/7.

So the expectation value is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14≈0.6428 (≈0.64) and 5/14≈0.357 (≈0.36), and expectation value ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7.

So that's Option A.

Wait, looking back, the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but let's make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Another approach: since |alpha> can be written in the |up>, |down> basis, and operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x, which has matrix representation [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute that.

First, |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

So compute A |alpha>.

A |alpha> = (ħ/2) σ_x |alpha>.

σ_x |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ].

Because σ_x swaps |up> and |down>.

So sigma_x |up> = |down>, sigma_x |down> = |up>.

So A |alpha> = (ħ/2) (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ].

Now, <alpha| A |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 -i) <up| + (2 + i) <down| ] times A |alpha>.

Let me compute this inner product.

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 -i) <up| + (2 +i) <down| ] * (ħ/2) (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ]

Factor out (1/sqrt(7)) * (1/sqrt(7)) = 1/7 and (ħ/2).

So:

(ħ/2) * (1/7) [ (1 -i)( (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <up|up> ) + (2 +i)( (1+i) <down|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute each component.

Breaking it down:

The inner product is:

(1 -i) * (1+i) * <up|down> + (1 -i) * (2 -i) * <up|up>
+ (2 +i) * (1+i) * <down|down> + (2 +i) * (2 -i) * <down|up>

But <up|down> and <down|up> are zero. So only the terms where the states match.

So the non-zero terms are:

(1 -i)(2 -i) <up|up> + (2 +i)(1 +i) <down|down>

Compute each:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i)= 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i +i² = 2+3i -1 =1 +3i.

So the inner product becomes:

(1 -3i) *1 + (1 +3i)*1 = (1 -3i +1 +3i) = 2.

So putting it all together, the expectation value is:

(ħ/2) * (1/7) * 2 = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

Which matches our earlier calculation. So that's correct.

So the average value is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and average value is ħ/7. So the correct option is A.


The problem involves determining the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be calculated. The state of the electron is given as \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
- \( |1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \),
- \( |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \).

The normalization constant is \( c = 1/\sqrt{7} \), so the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) (and hence \( A \)) are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad
|-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
The probability of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) is \( |\langle +x|\alpha\rangle|^2 \), and the probability of measuring \( |-x\rangle \) is \( |\langle -x|\alpha\rangle|^2 \). Compute the inner products:
\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow| + \langle \downarrow| \right) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right),
\]
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow| - \langle \downarrow| \right) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]
Simplify:
\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are:
\[
P(|+x\rangle) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad
P(|-x\rangle) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by \( \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha|A|\alpha\rangle \). Using the eigenvalues of \( A \), \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
