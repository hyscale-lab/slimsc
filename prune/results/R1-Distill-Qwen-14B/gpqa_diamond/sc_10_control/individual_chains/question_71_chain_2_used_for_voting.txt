Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets in a system. The setup is that there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. They're in orbital resonance, and their periods are in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All have the same albedo, so that should simplify things a bit because albedo affects how much light they reflect, but since it's the same for all, maybe it cancels out in the ratio.

The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So, T4 over T2, I think.

I recall that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its orbital period. The formula for equilibrium temperature, as far as I remember, is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) / (1 + e) )^(1/2), but since the albedo is the same for both and the orbits are circular (so e=0), that part cancels out. So T is proportional to T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)). But wait, T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star its radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, but since all planets are orbiting the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for all, so the equilibrium temperature depends only on the semi-major axis a. Which for circular orbits is just the orbital radius.

So T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). Because T is proportional to 1 over square root of a. Because T = T_eff * L (luminosity of star) and other factors, but I think the key is that the equilibrium temperature formula simplifies to T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4), but wait, I might be mixing up some exponents. Alternatively, the standard formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Or maybe another version. Let me think. Oh right, the formula I remember is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) ) * ( (1-A)/4 )^(1/4), where A is albedo. Since A is same for both planets, the ratio between T4 and T2 will be sqrt(R/(2a)) evaluated for each planet, but since R and star's T are same, the ratio is just sqrt( (1/(2a4)) / (1/(2a2)) ) ), which simplifies to sqrt(a2/a4). Because the 2a in denominator, so when you take the ratio, the 2's cancel.

Wait, let me make it precise. The formula for equilibrium temperature, assuming a circular orbit and same star, is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * [ (1 - A) / 4 ]^(1/4). Since A is same for both, the ratio T4/T2 is sqrt( (R/(2a4)) / (R/(2a2)) ) )^(1/2) )? Wait, wait, maybe I should express it as (a2/a4)^(1/2).

Alternatively, let's think about T being proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T ∝ 1/√a. So if I have two planets, T1 and T2, their temperatures are T1 = k / sqrt(a1), T2 = k / sqrt(a2), where k is some constant. So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt(a2/a1).

So for Planet_4 and Planet_2, T4 and T2.

We need T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ). Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so the larger a planet is, the smaller its temperature.

Wait, but wait. Let me get the orbital periods right. The problem states that the orbital periods are in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 has P2=2*P1, Planet3 P3=2.5 P1, Planet4 P4=3.5 P1, and Planet5 P5=5 P1.

But wait, Kepler's third law says that P² is proportional to a³. So (P1²)/(a1³) = (P2²)/(a2³) = ... = constant. So the ratio of a's can be found from the ratio of P's.

So (a2/a1) = (P2/P1)^(2/3). So a2 = a1*(2)^(2/3).

Similarly, a4 = a1*(3.5)^(2/3).

Wait, but in the ratio T4/T2, which is (T4)/(T2) = (sqrt(a2/a4)).

Wait, no. Wait, equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4 = T2 * sqrt(a2/a4). So T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/(a4) ).

So I need to find a2 and a4 in terms of a1, then find the ratio a2/a4.

So let's compute a2 and a4.

From P^2 ∝ a^3, so a ∝ P^(2/3).

Thus, a2 = a1 * (2)^(2/3)

a4 = a1 * (3.5)^(2/3)

Thus, a2/a4 = (2/3.5)^(2/3)

Wait, 3.5 is 7/2. So 2/(7/2) = 4/7.

So a2/a4 = (4/7)^(2/3).

Wait, no. Wait, a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). Because P is proportional to a^(3/2), so a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So 2/3.5 is 4/7.

Wait, 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7.

So a2/a4 = (4/7)^(2/3)

Thus, T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Wait, because sqrt is the same as raising to the 1/2 power. So ( (4/7)^(2/3) )^(1/2) ) = (4/7)^(1/3).

So the ratio is (4/7)^(1/3). Let's compute that. Let's calculate 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

The cube root of 0.5714 is approximately... Hmm. Because 0.5714 is about 4/7, and cube root of 1 is 1, cube root of 8 is 2, cube root of 1/8 is 0.5. Wait, cube root of 0.5714. Let's think: 0.5714 is approximately 0.571. Let's compute 0.571^(1/3):

We know that 0.7^3 = 0.343, 0.8^3=0.512, 0.85^3=0.614125. Wait, but our number is 0.571. Wait, 0.82^3 is 0.82 * 0.82 = 0.6724, times 0.82 is approximately 0.551. 0.83^3: 0.83*0.83=0.6889, *0.83 ≈ 0.5717. Oh! So 0.83^3 ≈ 0.5717, which is very close to 0.5714. So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, wait, that can't be. Because 0.83^3 is 0.5717 as I just calculated. So 0.83 is the cube root of ~0.5717. So (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I think I messed up the exponents earlier. Let's double-check.

Wait, T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So T4 / T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2). Because T4 = T2 * (a2/a4)^(1/2).

Wait, no. Let me go back.

Equilibrium temperature formula: T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * [ (1 - A)/4 ]^(1/4). So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T ∝ 1/√a.

So T4 / T2 = (sqrt(a2) ) / (sqrt(a4) ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 ).

Wait, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so T4 = (1/sqrt(a4)) * T0, T2 = (1/sqrt(a2)) * T0. So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4).

Wait, no! Wait, let's model it.

T = k / sqrt(a), where k is a constant (includes T_star and R_star and (1-A)/4 factors, which are same for both planets).

So T4 = k / sqrt(a4)
T2 = k / sqrt(a2)
So T4 / T2 = [k/sqrt(a4)] / [k/sqrt(a2)] = sqrt(a2/a4).

So yes, the ratio is sqrt(a2/a4). So back to a2/a4.

a2 = a1 * (2)^(2/3), a4 = a1 * (3.5)^(2/3).

So a2/a4 = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3).

Wait, because 2/3.5 is 4/7. So 4/7 is 0.5714.

So (4/7)^(2/3) is (0.5714)^(2/3). Let's compute that.

Wait, 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. So (0.5714)^(1/3) is about 0.83, as before. Then, (0.5714)^(2/3) = [ (0.5714)^(1/3) ]^2 ≈ (0.83)^2 ≈ 0.6889.

So a2/a4 = (4/7)^(2/3) ≈ 0.6889.

Then, sqrt(a2/a4) is sqrt(0.6889) ≈ 0.83.

So T4/T2 is 0.83. Wait, but wait. Let me recheck.

Wait, a2/a4 = (4/7)^(2/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(2/3).

Wait, 0.5714 is roughly 4/7. Let me compute (4/7)^(1/3) first, which is approximately 0.83 as before.

Then (4/7)^(2/3) = (0.83)^2 ≈ 0.6889.

So a2/a4 is ~0.6889.

So T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt(0.6889) ≈ 0.83.

So the ratio is approximately 0.83. Now, looking at the options:

Options are:

A) ~0.57

B) ~0.69

C) ~0.83

D) ~0.75

So option C is ~0.83, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait. Did I mix up the order? The question is T4/T2. So the temperature of Planet_4 compared to Planet_2.

Wait, because Planet_4 is at a larger orbital distance than Planet_2, since its period is longer (3.5 vs 2). So a4 > a2, so T4 < T2. So the ratio T4/T2 should be less than 1. Our calculation gives 0.83, which is less than 1, so that makes sense.

Yes, so the answer should be C) ~0.83.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the fact that equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance, \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \). Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their orbital periods are given as \( P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), the semi-major axes can be expressed as \( a_i \propto P_i^{2/3} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the ratio of semi-major axes
For Planet_2 and Planet_4:
\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}.
\]
Approximating \( \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \), we compute:
\[
\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3} \approx (0.5714)^{2/3}.
\]
First, calculate the cube root of \( 0.5714 \), which is approximately \( 0.83 \). Then, square this result:
\[
(0.83)^2 \approx 0.6889.
\]
Thus, \( \frac{a_2}{a_4} \approx 0.6889 \).

### Step 2: Compute the temperature ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is given by:
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}}.
\]
Substituting \( \frac{a_2}{a_4} \approx 0.6889 \):
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{0.6889} \approx 0.83.
\]

### Step 3: Verify consistency
Planet_4 is farther from the star than Planet_2 (since \( P_4 > P_2 \)), so \( T_4 < T_2 \). The ratio \( \frac{T_4}{T_2} \approx 0.83 \) is consistent with this expectation.

### Final Answer
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately **0.83**.

The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So, T4 over T2, I think.

I recall that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its orbital period. The formula for equilibrium temperature, as far as I remember, is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) / (1 + e) )^(1/2), but since the albedo is the same for both and the orbits are circular (so e=0), that part cancels out. So T is proportional to T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)). But wait, T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star its radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, but since all planets are orbiting the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for all, so the equilibrium temperature depends only on the semi-major axis a. Which for circular orbits is just the orbital radius.

So T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). Because T is proportional to 1 over square root of a. Because T = T_eff * L (luminosity of star) and other factors, but I think the key is that the equilibrium temperature formula simplifies to T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4), but wait, I might be mixing up some exponents.

Oh right, the formula I remember is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) ) * ( (1-A)/4 )^(1/4), where A is albedo. Since A is same for both planets, the ratio between T4 and T2 will be sqrt(R/(2a)) evaluated for each planet, but since R and star's T are same, the ratio is just sqrt( (1/(2a4)) / (1/(2a2)) ) ), which simplifies to sqrt(a2/a4). Because the 2a in denominator, so when you take the ratio, the 2's cancel.

Wait, let me make it precise. The formula for equilibrium temperature, assuming a circular orbit and same star, is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * [ (1 - A) / 4 ]^(1/4). Since A is same for both, the ratio T4/T2 is sqrt( (R/(2a4)) / (R/(2a2)) ) )^(1/2) )? Wait, wait, maybe I should express it as (a2/a4)^(1/2).

Alternatively, let's think about T being proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T ∝ 1/√a. So if I have two planets, T1 and T2, their temperatures are T1 = k / sqrt(a1), T2 = k / sqrt(a2), where k is some constant. So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt(a2/a1).

So for Planet_4 and Planet_2, T4 and T2.

We need T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ). Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so the larger a planet is, the smaller its temperature.

Wait, but wait. Let me get the orbital periods right. The problem states that the orbital periods are in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 has P2=2*P1, Planet3 P3=2.5 P1, Planet4 P4=3.5 P1, and Planet5 P5=5 P1.

But wait, Kepler's third law says that P² is proportional to a³. So (P1²)/(a1³) = (P2²)/(a2³) = ... = constant. So the ratio of a's can be found from the ratio of P's.

So (a2/a1) = (P2/P1)^(2/3). So a2 = a1*(2)^(2/3).

Similarly, a4 = a1*(3.5)^(2/3).

Wait, but in the ratio T4/T2, which is (T4)/(T2) = (sqrt(a2/a4)).

Wait, no. Wait, equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4 = T2 * sqrt(a2/a4). So T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/(a4) ).

So I need to find a2 and a4 in terms of a1, then find the ratio a2/a4.

So let's compute a2 and a4.

From P^2 ∝ a^3, so a ∝ P^(2/3).

Thus, a2 = a1 * (2)^(2/3)

a4 = a1 * (3.5)^(2/3)

Thus, a2/a4 = (2/3.5)^(2/3)

Wait, 3.5 is 7/2. So 2/(7/2) = 4/7.

So a2/a4 = (4/7)^(2/3).

Wait, no. Wait, a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). Because P is proportional to a^(3/2), so a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So 2/3.5 is 4/7.

Wait, 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7.

So a2/a4 = (4/7)^(2/3)

Thus, T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Wait, because sqrt is the same as raising to the 1/2 power. So ( (4/7)^(2/3) )^(1/2) ) = (4/7)^(1/3).

So the ratio is (4/7)^(1/3). Let's compute that. Let's calculate 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

The cube root of 0.5714 is approximately... Hmm. Because 0.5714 is about 4/7, and cube root of 1 is 1, cube root of 8 is 2, cube root of 1/8 is 0.5. Wait, cube root of 0.5714. Let's think: 0.5714 is approximately 0.571. Let's compute 0.571^(1/3):

We know that 0.7^3 = 0.343, 0.8^3=0.512, 0.85^3=0.614125. Wait, but our number is 0.571. Wait, 0.82^3 is 0.82 * 0.82 = 0.6724, times 0.82 is approximately 0.551. 0.83^3: 0.83*0.83=0.6889, *0.83 ≈ 0.5717. Oh! So 0.83^3 ≈ 0.5717, which is very close to 0.5714. So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, wait, that can't be. Because 0.83^3 is 0.5717 as I just calculated. So 0.83 is the cube root of ~0.5717. So (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I think I messed up the exponents earlier. Let's double-check.

Wait, T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So T4 / T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2). Because T4 = T2 * (a2/a4)^(1/2).

Wait, no. Let me go back.

Equilibrium temperature formula: T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * [ (1 - A)/4 ]^(1/4). So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T ∝ 1/√a.

So T4 / T2 = (sqrt(a2) ) / (sqrt(a4) ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 ).

Wait, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so T4 = (1/sqrt(a4)) * T0, T2 = (1/sqrt(a2)) * T0. So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4).

Wait, no! Wait, let's model it.

T = k / sqrt(a), where k is a constant (includes T_star and R_star and (1-A)/4 factors, which are same for both planets).

So T4 = k / sqrt(a4)
T2 = k / sqrt(a2)
So T4 / T2 = [k/sqrt(a4)] / [k/sqrt(a2)] = sqrt(a2/a4).

So yes, the ratio is sqrt(a2/a4). So back to a2/a4.

a2 = a1 * (2)^(2/3), a4 = a1 * (3.5)^(2/3).

So a2/a4 = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3).

Wait, because 2/3.5 is 4/7. So 4/7 is 0.5714.

So (4/7)^(2/3) is (0.5714)^(2/3). Let's compute that.

Wait, 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. So (0.5714)^(1/3) is about 0.83, as before. Then, (0.5714)^(2/3) = [ (0.5714)^(1/3) ]^2 ≈ (0.83)^2 ≈ 0.6889.

So a2/a4 = (4/7)^(2/3) ≈ 0.6889.

Then, sqrt(a2/a4) is sqrt(0.6889) ≈ 0.83.

So T4/T2 is 0.83. Wait, but wait. Let me recheck.

Wait, a2/a4 = (4/7)^(2/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(2/3).

Wait, 0.5714 is roughly 4/7. Let me compute (4/7)^(1/3) first, which is approximately 0.83 as before.

Then (4/7)^(2/3) = (0.83)^2 ≈ 0.6889.

So a2/a4 is ~0.6889.

So T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt(0.6889) ≈ 0.83.

So the ratio is approximately 0.83. Now, looking at the options:

Options are:

A) ~0.57

B) ~0.69

C) ~0.83

D) ~0.75

So option C is ~0.83, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait. Did I mix up the order? The question is T4/T2. So the temperature of Planet_4 compared to Planet_2.

Wait, because Planet_4 is at a larger orbital distance than Planet_2, since its period is longer (3.5 vs 2). So a4 > a2, so T4 < T2. So the ratio T4/T2 should be less than 1. Our calculation gives 0.83, which is less than 1, so that makes sense.

Yes, so the answer should be C) ~0.83.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the fact that equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance, \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \). Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their orbital periods are given as \( P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), the semi-major axes can be expressed as \( a_i \propto P_i^{2/3} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the ratio of semi-major axes
For Planet_2 and Planet_4:
\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}.
\]
Approximating \( \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \), we compute:
\[
\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3} \approx (0.5714)^{2/3}.
\]
First, calculate the cube root of \( 0.5714 \), which is approximately \( 0.83 \). Then, square this result:
\[
(0.83)^2 \approx 0.6889.
\]
Thus, \( \frac{a_2}{a_4} \approx 0.6889 \).

### Step 2: Compute the temperature ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is given by:
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}}.
\]
Substituting \( \frac{a_2}{a_4} \approx 0.6889 \):
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{0.6889} \approx 0.83.
\]

### Step 3: Verify consistency
Planet_4 is farther from the star than Planet_2 (since \( P_4 > P_2 \)), so \( T_4 < T_2 \). The ratio \( \frac{T_4}{T_2} \approx 0.83 \) is consistent with this expectation.

### Final Answer
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately **0.83**.

Answer: C
