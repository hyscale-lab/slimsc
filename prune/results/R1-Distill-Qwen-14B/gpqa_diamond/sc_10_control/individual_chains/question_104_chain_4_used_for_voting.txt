Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's orbit. The star moves a little back and forth as the planet tugs on it.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets, but the shift in the spectral lines is different. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has 7. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, so I need to find the ratio of their orbital periods. Let me think about the formula involved here. I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by some formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star.

Oh right, the formula for K is:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses, and the star is like the Sun, which is much more massive), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Another way I think about it is that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)), but wait, how does the period relate to the velocity?

Alternatively, I remember that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Let me see: K ∝ (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Wait another approach: Kepler's third law. The orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the masses. For a planet around a star, Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/G(M_star + M_p)) * a³. Since M_p is much smaller than M_star, this becomes approximately P² = (4π²/(G M_star)) * a³.

But how does this tie into the RV method and the semi-amplitude K? Oh, right. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π a sin i) / P

But a is the semi-major axis, and from Kepler's third law, we can express a in terms of P and M_star. Let me try substituting that.

From Kepler's law, a³ = G M_star * P²/(4π²). So a = [ (G M_star * P²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3).

Plugging this into K:

K = (2π * [ (G M_star * P²/(4π²))^(1/3) ] * sin i ) / P

Hmm, let's simplify this. Let's cube it, but perhaps it's easier to find the relationship between K and P.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the formula for K in terms of M_p and P. Another approach is to use the formula that K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to find the ratio of K1 and K2.

Wait, the problem says that both stars have the same mass as the Sun, so M1 = M2 = M_sun. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p1 = M_p2 = M_Neptune.

So, for both planets, M_p is the same, and M_star is the same. Therefore, the only variable is the period. So the ratio of K1 to K2 would be inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their periods.

Wait, because K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ). Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try writing the formula again.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (sin i) / (P)^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so:

K ≈ [ (G * M_p) / M_star^(2/3) ]^(1/3) * (sin i) / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the ratio K1/K2. Since M_p1 = M_p2 and M1 = M2,

K1/K2 = ( (1/P1^(1/3)) ) / ( (1/P2^(1/3)) ) )

Which simplifies to (P2 / P1)^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

But wait, the problem says that the shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms and for #2 it's 7. So K1 = 5, K2=7? But wait, wait—no, the shift is the semi-amplitude itself. So K1 is 5 mA and K2 is 7 mA.

Wait, no, the shift is the semi-amplitude. So K1 =5, K2=7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7.

From above, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We need to find P2/P1.

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364. Which would mean that P2 is about 0.36 times P1, so the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. But wait, the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then P2 is 0.36 times P1, so it's shorter. So how many times longer is it? It's 0.36 times as long, which is shorter.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So the ratio is P2/P1. If it's 0.36, then it's 0.36 times as long. So P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait, but I think I might have mixed up K and the periods. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, I thought K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3). So if K increases, P decreases.

So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1.

So when K increases, the period decreases because the star is moving more quickly (so the planet must be in a shorter orbital period to cause a larger shift).

So in this case, K2 is larger than K1, so P2 is smaller than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.36 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter. So the orbital period of #2 is shorter, which means it's not longer. The question is asking how many times longer is #2 than #1. So the answer would be about 0.36 times, meaning it's shorter.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So option A is ~0.36, which is the ratio P2/P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter. So the period is shorter, which would mean that P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So the correct answer is option A, approximately 0.36 times.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't flip the ratio. Let me re-express the formula.

Earlier, I said K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

(5^3)/(7^3) = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.36 times P1. So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is shorter than P1.

So the question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1? So (P2 / P1) = 0.36, which is about 0.36 times as long. So the correct answer is A, which is approximately 0.36 times longer. Meaning it's shorter, but the question is phrased as how many times longer. So the answer is 0.36, which is option A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The semi-amplitude of the RV signal, \( K \), is related to the orbital period \( P \) of the planet. Specifically, \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \), meaning that as the orbital period increases, the semi-amplitude decreases.

In this problem, two planets with similar masses to Neptune orbit stars with the same mass as the Sun. Planet #1 causes a spectral line shift of 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 = 5 \)), while Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 = 7 \)). Since \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \), the ratio of the periods \( P_2 / P_1 \) can be determined using the inverse relationship:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}.
\]

\[
\frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, \( P_2 / P_1 \approx 0.36 \), meaning the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36 times.

K1/K2 = ( (1/P1^(1/3)) ) / ( (1/P2^(1/3)) ) )

Which simplifies to (P2 / P1)^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The semi-amplitude of the RV signal, \( K \), is related to the orbital period \( P \) of the planet. Specifically, \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \), meaning that as the orbital period increases, the semi-amplitude decreases.

In this problem, two planets with similar masses to Neptune orbit stars with the same mass as the Sun. Planet #1 causes a spectral line shift of 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 = 5 \)), while Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 = 7 \)). Since \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \), the ratio of the periods \( P_2 / P_1 \) can be determined using the inverse relationship:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}.
\]

\[
\frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, \( P_2 / P_1 \approx 0.36 \), meaning the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36 times.
