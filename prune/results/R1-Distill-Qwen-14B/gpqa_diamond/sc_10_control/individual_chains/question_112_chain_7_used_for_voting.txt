Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's an electron in a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so that's the Sz operator. I remember that Sz has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for |up> and -ħ/2 for |down>.

The question is asking me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator, whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The elements Aij are ħ/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, I need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. So first, I think I need to find the eigenstates of this operator A. Once I have those, I can find the probabilities of the electron being in each eigenstate when measured. Also, the average value would be the expectation value of A with respect to the state |alpha>.

Wait, but the operator A has a specific matrix representation. Let me write it down. Since |up> and |down> form a basis, A is a 2x2 matrix. The elements are Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, that would look like:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0  ]

Is that right? Because for i≠j, the elements are ħ/2, and the diagonal elements (where i = j) are 0. Yes, that makes sense.

Now, this operator A is the same as the spin in the x-direction, Sx, multiplied by ħ/2? Because Sx in the standard basis has entries like [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]], right. So A must be proportional to Sx, but scaled by ħ/2 times something.

Wait, actually, the standard Sx matrix is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], so yes, A is exactly Sx. Because A_ij = (ħ/2) when i≠j, which is the same as (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So A is the spin-x operator.

Wait, no, hold on. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so Sx is (ħ/2) X. So A is exactly Sx, because A has (ħ/2) in the off-diagonals, which is exactly the same as Sx's matrix elements.

So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of Sx, which are the eigenstates of the x-projection of spin. Those eigenstates are superpositions of |up> and |down> along the x-axis. So they have equal probabilities for up and down, but with a phase difference.

But wait, perhaps I don't need to think about the physical meaning right now. Let me think about the math.

The operator A is a 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal. The eigenstates would be the eigenvectors of this matrix.

To find the eigenstates and eigenvalues, I can solve the equation A |v> = λ |v>.

The matrix for A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So the characteristic equation is determinant(A - λ I) = 0.

So:

| -λ       ħ/2         |
| ħ/2      -λ        |
= 0

The determinant is (λ^2) - (ħ/2)^2 = 0 → λ^2 = (ħ²/4) → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2, same as the eigenvalues of Sx. The eigenstates are the eigenvectors of A.

For each eigenvalue, we can find the eigenvectors.

First, for λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   -ħ/2 ]

Each row is -ħ/2 x + ħ/2 y = 0 → x = y.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (1,1) multiplied by a scalar. But since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, the eigenstates would be normalized. So the eigenvectors are |right> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |left> = (|up> - |down>)/√2, but wait, I might be getting ahead of myself. Wait, in this case, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Wait, let me think again. The equations for λ = ħ/2 are:

- (ħ/2) x + (ħ/2) y = 0 → -x + y = 0 → y = x.

So the eigenvector is (x, x) → x(1,1). So to normalize, the vector is (1,1)/√2.

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

The matrix becomes:

[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]

Which simplifies to (ħ/2)(x + y ) = 0 → x = -y.

So eigenvectors are (1, -1) normalized → (1, -1)/√2.

So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2.

So any state can be expressed in terms of these eigenstates. The given |alpha> is in the z-basis, so I need to express |alpha> in the x-basis (eigenbasis of A) to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, the probabilities can be found by expanding |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A.

Wait, but I think a more straightforward approach is to compute the inner products between |alpha> and each eigenstate of A.

Wait, first, let me write |alpha> as a vector.

The given state is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

Since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, |alpha> can be represented as the vector [ (1+i), (2 - i) ]^T (but normalized by some factor).

Wait, but the question says it's "proportional" to that, so let me compute the normalization factor.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the norm is sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). So the normalized state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So |alpha> = (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2 -i)/√7 |down>.

Now, to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenvalue of A (which are ± ħ/2), we need to find the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A.

The eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the eigenstates. Because I thought earlier that for λ = ħ/2, the eigenvector is (1,1), so |+x>, and for λ = -ħ/2, it's (1, -1), so |-x>.

So the inner product < +x | alpha > is [ (1, 1)/√2 ]^dagger multiplied by |alpha>.

Wait, actually, |+x> is [1/(√2)] (|up> + |down>), so the components are (1/√2, 1/√2).

Similarly, |-x> is (1/√2, -1/√2).

So, the inner product < +x | alpha > is (1/√2) * (1+i)/√7 + (1/√2) * (2 - i)/√7.

Let me compute that:

(1/√2)(1+i + 2 -i ) / sqrt(7) = (1/√2)(3)/sqrt(7) = 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

But wait, wait a second. Let me compute that correctly.

(1/√2) * (1+i) / sqrt(7) + (1/√2) * (2 - i) / sqrt(7) = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)).

Simplify numerator: 1 + i + 2 -i = 3.

So the inner product is 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Wait, but the magnitude squared is |3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) |^2 = (9)/(2*7) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857... So that's the probability of measuring +ħ/2.

Similarly, the inner product for |-x> would be < -x | alpha >.

That's (1/√2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + ( -1/√2 ) (2 - i)/sqrt(7) = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Compute numerator: 1 + i -2 + i = (-1) + 2i.

So the inner product is ( -1 + 2i ) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / (2 *7) )= (1 +4)/(14) )= 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait a second, but wait, let's compute that. The absolute value squared is (| -1 + 2i | )^2 = ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) = 1 +4 =5. So 5/(2*7) =5/14.

Hmm, but wait, 9/14 +5/14 is 14/14 =1, so that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.64286 and 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36 which would be 9/14 ≈ 0.64286 and 5/14 ≈ 0.3571. So option A's second probability is 0.36, which is 18/50=9/25=0.36. 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which doesn't exactly match 0.36, but perhaps it's close enough. Or maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inner product. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, the inner product for |-x> is (1/√2)(1+i)/√7 + (-1/√2)(2 -i)/√7.

So that's [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Which is (1+i -2 + i ) = (-1) + 2i.

So the inner product is [ (-1 + 2i) ] / (sqrt(14)).

The squared magnitude is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1+4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

So yeah, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64286 and 0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A gives 0.64 and 0.36. So that's the first part.

Now, the average value of operator A. The expectation value is < alpha | A | alpha >.

Since A is a Hermitian operator, the expectation value is the real part of the inner product.

But perhaps there's a better way. Wait, since |alpha> is not normalized in the question, but the state is given as proportional. Oh, wait no, in the beginning, I computed the normalization factor as 1/sqrt(7), so the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ].

So to compute <A>, which is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So |alpha> is a column vector: [ a, b ] where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Compute A |alpha>:

= [ 0*a + (ħ/2)*b , (ħ/2)*a + 0*b ]

= [ (ħ/2) b, (ħ/2) a ]

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is a^* * (ħ/2 b) + b^* * (ħ/2 a )

So that's (ħ/2) [ a^* b + b^* a ].

But a^* b + b^* a = 2 Re( a^* b )

So <A> = (ħ/2) * 2 Re( a^* b ) = ħ Re( a^* b )

Wait, let me compute a^* and b.

a = (1+i)/√7 → a^* = (1 -i)/√7.

b = (2 -i)/√7.

So a^* b = [ (1 -i)(2 -i) ] / 7.

Multiply numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i + i².

i² = -1, so 2 -3i -1 = (2-1) -3i → 1 -3i.

So a^* b = (1 -3i)/7.

The real part is (1)/7.

So Re(a^* b )= 1/7.

Thus, <A> = ħ * (1/7) = ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A's average is hbar/7. So that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and the average is ħ/7.

Which matches option A: 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7.

Wait, but option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which are approximate. Another option is option D: 0.61, 0.29, but that doesn't fit. So option A seems correct.

Wait, but wait, did I compute the probabilities correctly?

Wait, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, which after normalization becomes [ (1+i)/√7 , (2-i)/√7 ].

The eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2.

So the inner product < +x | alpha > is (1/√2)(1+i)/√7 + (1/√2)(2 -i)/√7.

Which is [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (√2√7) ) = [3 ] / (√14).

So |< +x | alpha>|^2 is 9/(14) → approximately 0.64286.

Similarly, the inner product for |-x> is (1/√2)(1+i)/√7 - (1/√2)(2 -i)/√7 = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (√14) → (-1 + 2i)/√14.

The magnitude squared is (1 +4 ) /14 →5/14 → approx 0.3571.

So in the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which are the closest to those values.

So the correct answer would be option A: probabilities 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and the average is hbar/7.

The problem involves an electron in a state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator (Sz). The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by Aij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j and 0 otherwise, and to find the average value of A.

### Step 1: Normalization of |α⟩
The given state |α⟩ is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize it, compute the norm squared:
\[
\| |α⟩ \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |down⟩.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of A
The operator A is a 2x2 matrix:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of A are ±ħ/2, and the corresponding eigenstates are:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ + |down⟩), \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ - |down⟩).
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of Measuring ±ħ/2
The probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues ±ħ/2 are given by the squared magnitudes of the inner products of |α⟩ with the eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, respectively.

#### Inner product with |+x⟩:
\[
⟨+x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(+\hbar/2) = \left| ⟨+x|α⟩ \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429.
\]

#### Inner product with |-x⟩:
\[
⟨-x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(-\hbar/2) = \left| ⟨-x|α⟩ \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

### Step 4: Average Value of A
The expectation value of A is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = ⟨α|A|α⟩.
\]
Using the matrix representation of A and the components of |α⟩, compute:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \text{Re}(a^* b) \right),
\]
where \( a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \). Compute \( a^* b = \frac{1-3i}{7} \), so:
\[
\text{Re}(a^* b) = \frac{1}{7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot \frac{1}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring ±ħ/2 are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is \( \hbar/7 \). These match the values in **Option A**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's an electron in a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so that's the Sz operator. I remember that Sz has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for |up> and -ħ/2 for |down>.

The question is asking me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator, whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The elements Aij are ħ/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, I need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. So first, I think I need to find the eigenstates of this operator A. Once I have those, I can find the probabilities of the electron being in each eigenstate when measured. Also, the average value would be the expectation value of A with respect to the state |alpha>.

Wait, but the operator A has a specific matrix representation. Let me write it down. Since |up> and |down> form a basis, A is a 2x2 matrix. The elements are Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, that would look like:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0  ]

Is that right? Because for i≠j, the elements are ħ/2, and the diagonal elements (where i = j) are 0. Yes, that makes sense.

Now, this operator A is the same as the spin in the x-direction, Sx, multiplied by ħ/2? Because Sx in the standard basis has entries like [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]], right. So A must be proportional to Sx, but scaled by ħ/2 times something.

Wait, actually, the standard Sx matrix is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], so yes, A is exactly Sx. Because A_ij = (ħ/2) when i≠j, which is the same as (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So A is the spin-x operator.

Wait, no, hold on. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so Sx is (ħ/2) X. So A is exactly Sx, because A has (ħ/2) in the off-diagonals, which is exactly the same as Sx's matrix elements.

So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of Sx, which are the eigenstates of the x-projection of spin. Those eigenstates are superpositions of |up> and |down> along the x-axis. So they have equal probabilities for up and down, but with a phase difference.

But wait, perhaps I don't need to think about the physical meaning right now. Let me think about the math.

The operator A is a 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal. The eigenstates would be the eigenvectors of this matrix.

To find the eigenstates and eigenvalues, I can solve the equation A |v> = λ |v>.

The matrix for A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So the characteristic equation is determinant(A - λ I) = 0.

So:

| -λ       ħ/2         |
| ħ/2      -λ        |
= 0

The determinant is (λ^2) - (ħ/2)^2 = 0 → λ^2 = (ħ²/4) → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2, same as the eigenvalues of Sx. The eigenstates are the eigenvectors of A.

For each eigenvalue, we can find the eigenvectors.

First, for λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   -ħ/2 ]

Each row is -ħ/2 x + ħ/2 y = 0 → x = y.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (1,1) multiplied by a scalar. But since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, the eigenstates would be normalized. So the eigenvectors are |right> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |left> = (|up> - |down>)/√2, but wait, I might be getting ahead of myself. Wait, in this case, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Wait, let me think again. The equations for λ = ħ/2 are:

- (ħ/2) x + (ħ/2) y = 0 → -x + y = 0 → y = x.

So the eigenvector is (x, x) → x(1,1). So to normalize, the vector is (1,1)/√2.

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

The matrix becomes:

[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]

Which simplifies to (ħ/2)(x + y ) = 0 → x = -y.

So eigenvectors are (1, -1) normalized → (1, -1)/√2.

So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2.

So any state can be expressed in terms of these eigenstates. The given |alpha> is in the z-basis, so I need to express |alpha> in the x-basis (eigenbasis of A) to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, the probabilities can be found by expanding |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A.

Wait, but I think a more straightforward approach is to compute the inner products between |alpha> and each eigenstate of A.

Wait, first, let me write |alpha> as a vector.

The given state is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

Since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, |alpha> can be represented as the vector [ (1+i), (2 - i) ]^T (but normalized by some factor).

Wait, but the question says it's "proportional" to that, so let me compute the normalization factor.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the norm is sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). So the normalized state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So |alpha> = (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2 -i)/√7 |down>.

Now, to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenvalue of A (which are ± ħ/2), we need to find the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A.

The eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the eigenstates. Because I thought earlier that for λ = ħ/2, the eigenvector is (1,1), so |+x>, and for λ = -ħ/2, it's (1, -1), so |-x>.

So the inner product < +x | alpha > is [ (1, 1)/√2 ]^dagger multiplied by |alpha>.

Wait, actually, |+x> is [1/(√2)] (|up> + |down>), so the components are (1/√2, 1/√2).

Similarly, |-x> is (1/√2, -1/√2).

So, the inner product < +x | alpha > is (1/√2) * (1+i)/√7 + (1/√2) * (2 - i)/√7.

Let me compute that:

(1/√2)(1+i + 2 -i ) / sqrt(7) = (1/√2)(3)/sqrt(7) = 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

But wait, wait a second. Let me compute that correctly.

(1/√2) * (1+i) / sqrt(7) + (1/√2) * (2 - i) / sqrt(7) = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)).

Simplify numerator: 1 + i + 2 -i = 3.

So the inner product is 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Wait, but the magnitude squared is |3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) |^2 = (9)/(2*7) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857... So that's the probability of measuring +ħ/2.

Similarly, the inner product for |-x> would be < -x | alpha >.

That's (1/√2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + ( -1/√2 ) (2 - i)/sqrt(7) = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Compute numerator: 1 + i -2 + i = (-1) + 2i.

So the inner product is ( -1 + 2i ) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / (2 *7) )= (1 +4)/(14) )= 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait a second, but wait, let's compute that. The absolute value squared is (| -1 + 2i | )^2 = ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) = 1 +4 =5. So 5/(2*7) =5/14.

Hmm, but wait, 9/14 +5/14 is 14/14 =1, so that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.64286 and 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36 which would be 9/14 ≈ 0.64286 and 5/14 ≈ 0.3571. So option A's second probability is 0.36, which is 18/50=9/25=0.36. 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which doesn't exactly match 0.36, but perhaps it's close enough. Or maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inner product. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, the inner product for |-x> is (1/√2)(1+i)/√7 + (-1/√2)(2 -i)/√7.

So that's [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Which is (1+i -2 + i ) = (-1) + 2i.

So the inner product is [ (-1 + 2i) ] / (sqrt(14)).

The squared magnitude is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1+4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

So yeah, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64286 and 0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A gives 0.64 and 0.36. So that's the first part.

Now, the average value of operator A. The expectation value is < alpha | A | alpha >.

Since A is a Hermitian operator, the expectation value is the real part of the inner product.

But perhaps there's a better way. Wait, since |alpha> is not normalized in the question, but the state is given as proportional. Oh, wait no, in the beginning, I computed the normalization factor as 1/sqrt(7), so the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ].

So to compute <A>, which is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So |alpha> is a column vector: [ a, b ] where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Compute A |alpha>:

= [ 0*a + (ħ/2)*b , (ħ/2)*a + 0*b ]

= [ (ħ/2) b, (ħ/2) a ]

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is a^* * (ħ/2 b) + b^* * (ħ/2 a )

So that's (ħ/2) [ a^* b + b^* a ].

But a^* b + b^* a = 2 Re( a^* b )

So <A> = (ħ/2) * 2 Re( a^* b ) = ħ Re( a^* b )

Wait, let me compute a^* and b.

a = (1+i)/√7 → a^* = (1 -i)/√7.

b = (2 -i)/√7.

So a^* b = [ (1 -i)(2 -i) ] / 7.

Multiply numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i + i².

i² = -1, so 2 -3i -1 = (2-1) -3i → 1 -3i.

So a^* b = (1 -3i)/7.

The real part is (1)/7.

So Re(a^* b )= 1/7.

Thus, <A> = ħ * (1/7) = ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A's average is hbar/7. So that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and the average is ħ/7.

Which matches option A: 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7.

Wait, but option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which are approximate. Another option is option D: 0.61, 0.29, but that doesn't fit. So option A seems correct.

Wait, but wait, did I compute the probabilities correctly?

Wait, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, which after normalization becomes [ (1+i)/√7 , (2-i)/√7 ].

The eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2.

So the inner product < +x | alpha > is (1/√2)(1+i)/√7 + (1/√2)(2 -i)/√7.

Which is [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (√2√7) ) = [3 ] / (√14).

So |< +x | alpha>|^2 is 9/(14) → approximately 0.64286.

Similarly, the inner product for |-x> is (1/√2)(1+i)/√7 - (1/√2)(2 -i)/√7 = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (√14) → (-1 + 2i)/√14.

The magnitude squared is (1 +4 ) /14 →5/14 → approx 0.3571.

So in the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which are the closest to those values.

So the correct answer would be option A: probabilities 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and the average is hbar/7.


The problem involves an electron in a state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator (Sz). The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by Aij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j and 0 otherwise, and to find the average value of A.

### Step 1: Normalization of |α⟩
The given state |α⟩ is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize it, compute the norm squared:
\[
\| |α⟩ \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |down⟩.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of A
The operator A is a 2x2 matrix:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of A are ±ħ/2, and the corresponding eigenstates are:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ + |down⟩), \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ - |down⟩).
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of Measuring ±ħ/2
The probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues ±ħ/2 are given by the squared magnitudes of the inner products of |α⟩ with the eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, respectively.

#### Inner product with |+x⟩:
\[
⟨+x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(+\hbar/2) = \left| ⟨+x|α⟩ \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429.
\]

#### Inner product with |-x⟩:
\[
⟨-x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(-\hbar/2) = \left| ⟨-x|α⟩ \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

### Step 4: Average Value of A
The expectation value of A is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = ⟨α|A|α⟩.
\]
Using the matrix representation of A and the components of |α⟩, compute:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \text{Re}(a^* b) \right),
\]
where \( a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \). Compute \( a^* b = \frac{1-3i}{7} \), so:
\[
\text{Re}(a^* b) = \frac{1}{7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot \frac{1}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring ±ħ/2 are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is \( \hbar/7 \). These match the values in **Option A**.
