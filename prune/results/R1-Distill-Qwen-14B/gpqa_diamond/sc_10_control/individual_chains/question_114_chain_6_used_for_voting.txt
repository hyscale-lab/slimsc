Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions. But let's try to break it down.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two different reactions. Let's look at each reaction one by one.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but under what conditions? Oh, right, I think the cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile here. So in the presence of an acid catalyst, the ketone gets protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon.

So the product is a cyanohydrin. But wait, the structure given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The carbon chain would have a hydroxyl and a cyanide group on the same carbon. So from butan-2-one, adding CN and OH groups. So the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. Okay, that makes sense.

So the reagent A here is probably an acid catalyst. Common choices are H3O+ or something like H2SO4. Looking at the options, A's possible choices are H3O+ or NaHSO3. So for the first reaction, the presence of an acid is essential. So that would make A either H3O+ or maybe another acid. So looking at the options, for A, the first part is either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, but wait. The reaction condition for forming cyanohydrin is usually under acidic conditions. So if the first reaction uses NaCN and an acid, then A is H3O+ maybe. So in the options, option A has A as H3O+, which would fit. Option C's A is NaHSO3, but I'm not sure about that. Hmm.

Now moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's reacting with reagent B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. For the conversion to carboxylic acids, you typically use strong acid conditions. Or wait, maybe it's hydrolysis with H2O and an acid catalyst. Another approach is using H2O and a strong acid like HCl or H2SO4.

Wait, but in the second reaction, B is used in H2O. So the reagent B is probably an acid. Because the product is a carboxylic acid. So if the nitrile is in an aqueous acidic environment, it would hydrolyze to form the acid. Alternatively, sometimes it's done with H2O and HCl as the catalyst.

Looking at the options, the possible B reagents are HCl, CH3COOH, or HCl again.

So for the second reaction, we need an acid. So which one is it?

Wait, but the first reaction uses A as an acid. Let's see what the options say.

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH.

So for the first reaction, if A is H3O+, that's a strong acid. So the first reaction would proceed. Let's think about the second.

But wait, the second reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. So the typical conditions are either with strong acid (like HCl) and heat or using a base. Wait, nitrile hydrolysis can be done in two ways. One is acidic conditions (like HCl and heat) leading to an amide intermediate, then further to the acid. The other is basic conditions, which gives a sodium salt, which can be acidified.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, not the salt. So if the hydrolysis is done in aqueous acid, then the conditions would involve H+.

But the problem says that reagent B is used along with H2O. So in the second reaction, H2O is the solvent, and B is the reagent.

So, in the second reaction, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. The nitrile is at the end of the chain, maybe?

Wait, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is (PhCH2Ph)C(OH)(CN)CH2CH2? Or maybe it's a four-carbon chain, with the substituents on the second carbon.

But the exact structure might not be critical for the reagents.

So, the nitrile group (CN) needs to be converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH). The reaction is nitrile hydrolysis.

The typical reaction is nitrile + H2O → amide → carboxylic acid under acidic or basic conditions.

But in the second reaction, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So maybe the reaction is hydrolyzing the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But how?

Wait, but the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile (CN) becomes a COOH group. So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid.

The conditions for that are strong acid or strong base. If it's acidic, H+ and H2O.

So the reagent B could be HCl (a strong acid) or maybe something else.

Looking back at the options, the possible B reagents are HCl (options A, C) or CH3COOH (options B, D).

Which is more suitable here?

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, which would provide H+ ions, which would help in the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid.

Alternatively, acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid. Could that work? I'm not so sure because the hydrolysis of nitriles to acids tends to require either strong acid or strong base conditions. So maybe HCl is more appropriate.

So for the second reaction, B should be HCl.

Looking at the options, option A and C have B as HCl.

So now, for the first reaction, let's confirm. If A is H3O+ (option A) then the reaction would proceed as the acid needed for the cyanohydrin formation.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, NaHSO3 is used in the formation of cyanohydrins. Because NaHSO3 provides H+ (from HSO3^-) and also some S-containing compounds, but wait, no. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Oh, wait, wait. Sulfur-related reagents are used in other reactions, like in the reduction of carbonyl groups.

Wait, but wait. The formation of cyanohydrin typically uses an acid catalyst, like H2SO4 or H3O+. So if A were NaHSO3, which is a source of H+, that could also work. So perhaps both H3O+ and NaHSO3 would work as acid catalysts.

But looking at the options, for A, the first reagent, the options are either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

So if the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as A, then the cyanohydrin would form. But is that the case? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, but I think that H3O+ is a common catalyst for such additions. So which option pairs that with HCl for the second reaction?

Looking at the options: option A says A=H3O+, B=HCl. So that would mean the first reaction uses H3O+ (acid) for cyanohydrin formation, and the second uses HCl (acid) for nitrile hydrolysis. That sounds plausible.

Wait, but wait another thing. The second reaction's reagent is B in H2O. So if B is HCl, the solution is HCl in H2O, which would be strongly acidic. That makes sense for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid.

So both reactions would require an acid. So option A fits, where A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

But wait, let me think about the first reaction again. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the cyanide is added to the carbonyl carbon, and the hydroxyl is added as well.

But wait, in the presence of HCN and an acid, the ketone would form the cyanohydrin. So the reagent A is the acid.

So, in this case, the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, which is correct.

So the correct option is A.

Wait, but I'm a bit conflicted because another option might have A as NaHSO3. Let me double-check. What if A is NaHSO3? NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+? Or stronger? HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+ (pKa around 1.2 for HSO3^- vs. ~-1.7 for H3O+), so H3O+ is a stronger acid. But in the first reaction, the acid is needed to protonate the carbonyl. So H3O+ would be a better acid for that.

So option A seems right.

Wait, but looking back at the second reaction, the product is a carboxylic acid. So when a nitrile is hydrolyzed, under acidic conditions (like HCl and H2O), it would form the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, it would form the carboxylate, which would then need to be acidified. But since the product is the acid, the reaction must be under acidic conditions, so HCl is probably the right choice.

So, putting it all together, option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which fits both reactions.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. 

### Reaction 1: 
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. For this reaction to proceed, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Common acid catalysts include H₃O⁺ or NaHSO₃. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is a strong acid and a suitable choice for this reaction.

### Reaction 2: 
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
Here, the nitrile group (CN) is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid (COOH). This reaction typically requires acidic conditions, such as HCl in water, to facilitate the hydrolysis. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and less suitable for this transformation. Therefore, HCl is the appropriate choice for reagent B.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This pair is suitable for both reactions. H₃O⁺ acts as an acid catalyst in the first reaction, and HCl provides the acidic environment needed for the second reaction.  

- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile in the second reaction.  

- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ is a weaker acid than H₃O⁺ and is less commonly used for cyanohydrin formation. While HCl is suitable for the second reaction, this combination is less ideal.  

- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  NaHSO₃ is not the best choice for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is insufficient for the second reaction.  

### Conclusion:
The most appropriate reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, as provided in **Option A**.  

Answer: A
