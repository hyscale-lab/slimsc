Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let's try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and it's located at a distance d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, some with exponents around 59 to 66 J/K. 

First, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula I think is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Or wait, was it A/(4 l_p^2), where l_p is the Planck length? Oh right, because the area is in terms of the Planck area. So the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) = (A)/(4 l_p²) * (c^3/(ħ G k_B)) — wait, maybe I should just look up the exact formula. Oh, right, the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) or S = A/(4 l_p²) * (1/(k_B)) where l_p is the Planck length. Wait, no, the exact formula is S = (A)/(4 l_p²) * (1/(k_B)) )? Wait no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recast it.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ), where A is the area of the event horizon. Alternatively, since the Planck area l_p² is (ħ c)/(G), so l_p² = ħ c/(G). So l_p squared is that. So if I substitute that into the formula, A/(4 l_p²) would be (A G)/(4 ħ c). Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the area A, then plug into the entropy formula.

So first, I need to find the radius of the event horizon, which is the Schwarzschild radius. The Schwarzschild radius R_s is 2 G M / c². So if I can find M, the mass of the black hole, I can compute R_s and then A = 4 π R_s².

But wait, how do I find M? Well, I have the angular size θ of the event horizon. The angular size θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the diameter of the event horizon divided by the distance d. So θ (rad) ≈ 2 R_s / d.

Wait, but θ is given in degrees, so I'll need to convert it to radians for the calculation. Oh right, because when θ is small, θ (in radians) ≈ θ (degrees) * (pi/180).

So θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * (pi/180). Let's compute that. Pi is about 3.1416, so 3.1416/180 is about 0.0174533 radians per degree. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * 0.0174533 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So θ_rad ≈ 2 R_s / d. So R_s ≈ (θ_rad * d) / 2.

Wait, but R_s is 2 G M / c². So substituting R_s into that equation:

2 G M / c² = (θ_rad * d ) / 2.

Wait, wait, no, because θ_rad is approximately equal to the diameter over d. The diameter is 2 R_s, so θ_rad ≈ (2 R_s) / d. So R_s ≈ (θ_rad * d) / 2.

Wait, no, wait: for small angles, the approximation tan(θ) ≈ θ, and the length is approx θ * d. So the angular size θ is subtended by the diameter of the event horizon (2 R_s) at distance d, so θ ≈ (2 R_s) / d.

So R_s = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

Once I have R_s, I can compute the area A = 4 π R_s², and then plug into the entropy formula.

Then, the entropy S is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ). Alternatively, S is proportional to A, with the proportionality constant involving other constants.

Wait, let me write down each step.

1. Convert θ from degrees to radians: θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180).

2. Compute R_s = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

But wait, d is given in parsecs. I need to convert parsecs to meters because all other units (like G, c) are in SI units.

1 parsec is approximately 3.0857e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m = 3.0857e26 meters.

So let's compute R_s:

R_s = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

θ_rad = 1e-17 degrees * (pi/180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So R_s = (1.745e-19 rad * 3.0857e26 m ) / 2.

Compute that:

1.745e-19 * 3.0857e26 = (1.745 * 3.0857) * 1e7. Let's calculate 1.745 * 3.0857 ≈ 5.374. So 5.374e7 m. Then divide by 2: ~2.687e7 m.

So R_s ≈ 2.687e7 meters.

Wait, 2.687e7 meters is 26,870,000 meters, which is about 26.87 million meters. That's a large radius, which makes sense for a supermassive black hole.

Now, the area A is 4 π R_s².

R_s is 2.687e7 m. So R_s squared is (2.687e7)^2 = (2.687)^2 * 1e14 = ~7.22e14 m².

Multiply by 4 pi: 4 * 3.1416 ≈ 12.566.

So A = 12.566 * 7.22e14 ≈ 9.05e15 m².

Wait, let me recheck that calculation.

Wait, (2.687e7)^2 = (2.687)^2 * 1e14. 2.687 squared: 2.687 * 2.687. Let's compute that.

2.687 * 2.687: 2 * 2 =4, 2 * 0.687 = 1.374; 0.687 * 2 =1.374, and 0.687^2≈0.472. So (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², where a=2, b=0.687.

So (2 + 0.687)^2 = 2² + 2*2*0.687 + 0.687² = 4 + 2.748 + 0.472 ≈ 7.22.

So yes, 7.22e14 m².

Multiply by 4 pi: 4 * pi is about 12.566, so 12.566 *7.22e14 ≈ 9.05e15 m².

So A ≈9.05e15 m².

Now, plug into the entropy formula.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Alternatively, the formula is S = (A)/(4 l_p²) * (k_B), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that S is proportional to A/(l_p²), with l_p being Planck length, and then the constants.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Or perhaps S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) * (k_B). Let me think about the units.

The Planck length l_p is sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ), so l_p^2 = ħ G / c^3. So 1/(l_p^2) = c^3/(ħ G).

So S = A/(4 l_p^2) * (1/(k_B)) ?

Wait, probably not. Let me look up the correct formula in my mind. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). So that's the formula.

So S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

I need to plug in the numbers.

Given that A is 9.05e15 m², what's the value of S?

Let me list the constants:

c = speed of light ≈ 3e8 m/s.

ħ = reduced Planck constant ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J s.

G = gravitational constant ≈ 6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

k_B = Boltzmann constant ≈ 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: A * c^3 = 9.05e15 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3.

(3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

So 9.05e15 * 2.7e25 = (9.05 * 2.7) * 1e40.

9.05 * 2.7: let's calculate that. 9*2.7=24.3, 0.05*2.7=0.135 → total 24.435.

So numerator ≈24.435e40 = 2.4435e41.

Denominator:4 ħ G k_B.

Compute 4 * ħ * G * k_B.

4 * 1.05457e-34 * 6.6743e-11 * 1.3806e-23.

Let me compute step by step.

First, multiply 4 * 1.05457e-34 ≈4.218e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.218e-34 *6.6743e-11 ≈ 4.218 *6.6743 ≈28.16e-45.

Wait, 4.218e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.218 *6.6743) * 1e-45.

4.218 *6.6743 → Approximately 4*6.6 is 26.4, and 0.218*6.6 is about 1.4448, and 4*0.0743 is 0.297, and 0.218*0.0743≈0.0162. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to compute 4.218 *6.6743.

Wait, 4*6=24, 4*0.6743=2.697, 0.218*6=1.308, 0.218 *0.6743≈0.1467.

But perhaps I'll take an approximate approach. Let me calculate 4.218 *6.6743:

Approximating,

4.218 *6 = 25.308,

4.218 *0.6743 ≈ 4.218 *0.6=2.5308, and 4.218 *0.0743≈0.3127. So total 2.5308 + 0.3127 = 2.8435. So total 25.308 +2.8435≈28.1515.

So 28.1515e-45.

Now multiply by 1.3806e-23 (k_B).

So 28.1515e-45 * 1.3806e-23 = (28.1515 * 1.3806) * 1e-68.

28.1515 *1.3806 ≈ let's compute:

28 *1.38= 38.64,

28 *0.0006=0.0168,

0.1515 *1.38≈0.208,

0.1515 *0.0006≈0.0000909.

Wait that's getting complicated. Alternatively, let's compute 28.1515 *1.3806.

Approximate:

28 *1.3806 = 38.6568,

0.1515 *1.3806 ≈ 0.208.

So total ≈38.6568 +0.208 ≈38.865.

So denominator is approximately 38.865e-68 =3.8865e-67.

So S = (2.4435e41) / (3.8865e-67) ) * (1/(4 ħ G k_B)) ? Wait no, denominator is 4 ħ G k_B, so it's 3.8865e-67.

So S ≈ (2.4435e41) / (3.8865e-67) ) → which is (2.4435 /3.8865) ) * 1e(41 +67) → (approx 0.629) * 1e108 → 6.29e107 J/K.

Wait, that's 1e108 * 0.629 ≈6.29e107 J/K.

Wait, but that's way higher than the options given (which are around 1e59 to 1e66). So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, this can't be right because the options are much smaller. So I must have messed up some calculation step. Let me retrace my steps.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating A. Let me go back.

Wait, calculating R_s again.

θ_rad is 1e-17 degrees.

1e-17 degrees in radians is 1e-17 * pi/180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

d is 1e10 parsecs, which is 1e10 *3.0857e16 m =3.0857e26 m.

So R_s = (θ_rad * d) / 2 = (1.745e-19 rad *3.0857e26 m ) / 2.

Let me compute 1.745e-19 *3.0857e26.

1.745e-19 *3.0857e26 = (1.745 *3.0857) *1e7.

1.745 *3.0857 ≈5.375.

So 5.375e7 meters. Then /2 is 2.6875e7 m.

That's correct.

Then A =4 pi R_s^2.

R_s is 2.6875e7 m. Squared is (2.6875e7)^2.

2.6875e7 squared is (2.6875)^2 * 1e14.

2.6875^2: 2.6875 is 2 +0.6875, so (2 + 0.6875)^2=4 + 2*2*0.6875 + (0.6875)^2.

Which is 4 + 2.75 + 0.4727 ≈7.2227.

So R_s squared ≈7.2227e14 m².

A=4 pi * 7.2227e14 ≈ 4 *3.1416 *7.2227e14 ≈12.566 *7.2227e14 ≈9.05e15 m². Correct.

Then, S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

So plug in the numbers.

A=9.05e15 m².

c^3= (3e8)^3=27e24=2.7e25 m³/s³.

So A c^3=9.05e15 * 2.7e25 =2.4435e41 (as before).

Denominator: 4 ħ G k_B.

Calculate ħ =1.05457e-34 J s.

G=6.6743e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.

k_B=1.3806e-23 J/K.

4 * ħ * G * k_B =4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.3806e-23.

Compute step by step.

First, 4 *1.05457e-34 =4.2183e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.2183e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.2183 *6.6743)e-45.

We calculated that earlier as approximately 28.15e-45.

Then multiply by 1.3806e-23: 28.15e-45 *1.3806e-23 = (28.15 *1.3806)e-68 ≈38.89e-68 =3.889e-67.

So denominator is 3.889e-67.

So S = (2.4435e41 ) / (3.889e-67) = (2.4435 /3.889) ) * 1e(41 +67) → (approx 0.628) *1e108 →6.28e107 J/K.

Wait, that's 6.28e107 J/K. But the options are 1e59, 1e62, 1e65, etc. So this is way off, which suggests I made a mistake in my approach.

Hmm, maybe I got the formula for entropy wrong. Let me think again. Oh wait! I think the formula might be S = (A)/(4 l_p^2), where l_p is the Planck length. Let me check that.

The Planck length l_p = sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ). So l_p squared is ħ G / c^3.

So S = A/(4 l_p^2) = A * c^3/(4 ħ G ). Because substituting l_p^2 = ħ G / c^3, so 1/l_p^2 = c^3/( ħ G ).

So S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G ) * (1/k_B ?) No, wait, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me rederive the formula.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

Alternatively, sometimes it's written as S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), but I think that's not correct. Wait, no.

Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. The correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B ), so including the Boltzmann constant.

So, my earlier calculation is correct, but the result is way too high. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, let's recalculate the denominator.

Denominator is 4 * ħ * G * k_B.

Compute each term:

4 =4.

ħ =1.05457e-34 J s.

G =6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

k_B=1.3806e-23 J/K.

So the denominator is 4 * ħ * G *k_B.

Multiplying all together:

4 * 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.3806e-23.

Let me compute the exponents separately.

4 is 4.

1e-34 *1e-11 *1e-23 =1e-68.

Now the constants: 4 *1.05457 *6.6743 *1.3806.

Compute 4 *1.05457 =4.21828.

4.21828 *6.6743 ≈4.21828 *6.6743.

Let me compute 4 *6.6743 =26.6972,

0.21828 *6.6743 ≈1.457.

So total approx 26.6972 +1.457 ≈28.154.

Then multiply by 1.3806: 28.154 *1.3806.

28 *1.38=38.64,

0.154 *1.38=0.213.

So total approx 38.64 +0.213≈38.853.

So denominator is 38.853e-68 =3.8853e-67.

So S = 2.4435e41 / 3.8853e-67 = (2.4435 /3.8853) * 1e(41+67) → (approx 0.629) *1e108 →6.29e107 J/K.

But this is way higher than the given options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating A?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating R_s.

Wait, let me recheck R_s.

θ_rad = 1e-17 degrees in radians.

1 degree = pi/180 radians, so 1e-17 degrees = 1e-17 * pi/180 ≈1.74533e-19 rad.

d=1e10 parsecs =1e10 *3.0857e16 m =3.0857e26 m.

R_s = (theta_rad * d)/2 → 1.74533e-19 *3.0857e26 /2.

Compute 1.74533e-19 *3.0857e26 = (1.74533 *3.0857) *1e7 (since 1e-19 *1e26 =1e7).

1.74533 *3.0857 ≈5.374 →5.374e7 m.

Divide by 2: 2.687e7 m. So that's correct.

So R_s is correct.

Hmm, maybe the formula is different. Oh wait! The area A is 4 pi R_s^2, but perhaps R_s is the Schwarzschild radius, which is 2 G M / c². Oh right, but that's how we calculated R_s. So maybe another approach is to find M, the mass, then compute the entropy.

Wait, because the entropy also depends on the mass (since M relates to the area). Alternatively, perhaps I should find M from R_s.

R_s = 2 G M / c² → M = (R_s c² )/(2 G ).

So M = (2.687e7 m * (3e8 m/s)^2 )/(2 *6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2 )

Compute numerator: 2.687e7 *9e16 = 2.687e7 *9e16 =2.4183e24 kg m²/s²? Wait, no, actually, units may not be correct. Let me just compute the numbers.

2.687e7 m * (3e8 m/s)^2 =2.687e7 *9e16 =2.687e7 *9e16 =2.4183e24.

Wait, 2.687e7 *9e16 = (2.687 *9) *1e(7+16) =24.183 *1e23 =2.4183e24.

Denominator: 2 *6.6743e-11 ≈1.33486e-10.

So M =2.4183e24 /1.33486e-10 = (2.4183 /1.33486) *1e(24 +10) →approx 1.812 *1e34 kg.

Wait, 1.812e34 kg. That's a huge mass, but supermassive black holes can be that big. The Sun is about 2e30 kg, so this is 1e4 times larger, but that's possible.

Now, the entropy of a black hole can also be expressed in terms of the mass: S = ( (c^6 )/( G ħ ) ) * (M^2) * (1/(k_B)) * (some constants). Wait, I'm not sure, but perhaps another approach is to compute the area A from R_s and then use the entropy formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), which is the same as (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B ), which is what I did before.

But the result was 6.29e107 J/K, which is way higher than the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me compute the denominator again.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G *k_B.

4 =4.

ħ =1.05457e-34 J s.

G=6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

k_B=1.3806e-23 J/K.

Multiply all together:

4 * 1.05457e-34 * 6.6743e-11 * 1.3806e-23

Let me compute the exponents: 1e-34 *1e-11=1e-45, *1e-23=1e-68.

The constants: 4 *1.05457 *6.6743 *1.3806.

Compute 4 *1.05457=4.21828.

4.21828 *6.6743 ≈28.154.

28.154 *1.3806 ≈38.85.

So denominator is 38.85e-68 →3.885e-67.

Numerator: A c^3 =9.05e15 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3.

(3e8)^3=2.7e24 m³/s³.

Multiply by 9.05e15 m²: 9.05e15 *2.7e24 =2.4435e40 m^5/s³.

Wait, no: (m²) * (m³/s³ )=m^5/s³. But the units don't affect the exponent calculation.

So numerator is 2.4435e40.

So S = (2.4435e40 ) / (3.885e-67 ) = (2.4435 /3.885 ) *1e(40 +67) →approx 0.629 *1e107 →6.29e106 J/K.

Wait, 40 +67 is 107, so yes.

So S ≈6.29e106 J/K.

But this is still way larger than the options given. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is wrong. Maybe the entropy formula uses the area in cm² or another unit? Or perhaps I forgot a conversion factor.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have the area in cm². Let me think about the units.

Wait, the Planck area is about 2.6e53 cm². So perhaps when using A in cm², the formula would be different.

Let me try that approach.

First, convert A from m² to cm².

A=9.05e15 m².

1 m² =1e4 dm² =1e4 *1e2 cm² →1e4 * (1e2)^2 cm²? Wait, no. 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m²= (100 cm)^2 =1e4 cm².

So 9.05e15 m² =9.05e15 *1e4 cm² =9.05e19 cm².

Now, the Bekenstein-Hawking formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). But when using A in cm², we might have to include conversion factors.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute all the constants in cgs units, but that's going to get complicated.

Alternatively, I can check the formula again. Wait, another approach: find the entropy expression using the Schwarzschild radius and then express it in terms of known constants.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), which is the same as before. But with A in m², I'm getting exponents that are way too high.

Wait, I found that S is about 6e106 J/K, which is way beyond the given options. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting parsecs to meters. Let me check: 1 parsec is 3.0857e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 *3.0857e16 =3.0857e26 m. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the area A in terms of the Planck area.

The Planck area l_p² is approximately (ħ c)/(G), which is about 2.6e-35 m².

So A =9.05e15 m² → in Planck areas, it's 9.05e15 / 2.6e-35 ≈3.48e50.

Then, the entropy S is A/(4 l_p²) * (k_B) ?

Wait, no. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B ), which in terms of Planck area is S = (A_p )/(4) * (k_B) ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, l_p^2 = ħ G / c^3 → Planck area is l_p².

So, S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ) = (A/(l_p²)) * ( c^3/(4 ħ G k_B )) * ( l_p^2 ) / ( l_p^2 ). Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of the numerator and denominator exponents.

Let me recompute the denominator.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G *k_B.

ħ =1.05457e-34 J s.

G=6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

k_B=1.3806e-23 J/K.

So 4 *1.05457e-34 =4.2183e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.2183e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.2183 *6.6743) *1e-45.

4.2183 *6.6743 ≈28.154 →28.154e-45.

Multiply by k_B: 28.154e-45 *1.3806e-23 = (28.154 *1.3806) *1e-68.

28.154 *1.3806 ≈38.85 →38.85e-68 =3.885e-67.

So denominator is 3.885e-67.

Numerator: A c^3 =9.05e15 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3 =9.05e15 *2.7e24 =2.4435e40.

So S=2.4435e40 / 3.885e-67 = (2.4435 /3.885 ) *1e(40 +67) →0.629 *1e107 →6.29e106 J/K.

Hmm, same result again. But the options are 1e59, etc. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the entropy in terms of the event horizon's area, but perhaps I should use the formula that relates entropy to the area in terms of the Planck area, which would be S = (A / l_p^2 )/(4) * (some constants).

Wait, the area A in Planck units is A_p = A / l_p².

So A_p = (9.05e15 m² ) / ( (sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ))^2 ) → (9.05e15 ) / ( ħ G / c^3 ) →9.05e15 * c^3/( ħ G ).

But then S = A_p/(4) * (k_B c^3 )/( ħ G ), but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ), which I have been using.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the entropy is actually (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ), which is what I've been using.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), which is the same as S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B^{-1} ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express A in terms of the Schwarzschild radius and use the formula S = (k_B c^3/(4 ħ G )) * (R_s^2 *4 pi )/(4 ). Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for entropy in terms of the mass M. Because entropy S is proportional to M².

So, S = (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G ) * (4 pi (2 G M / c² )^2 )/(4 ) → simplifying.

Wait, let's compute that.

S = (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G ) * [4 pi (4 G² M²)/(c^4 ) ]/(4 )

Wait, the 4 in the numerator and denominator cancels. So,

S = (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G ) * pi (4 G² M²)/(c^4 )

Simplify:

= (k_B c^3 * pi *4 G² M² )/(4 ħ G c^4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4/4 cancels.

c^3 / c^4 = 1/c.

G² / G = G.

So,

S= (k_B pi G M^2 )/( ħ c )

Which is S = ( pi k_B G M² )/( ħ c )

So, perhaps using this formula is easier.

So, S = (pi k_B G M² )/( ħ c )

We have M from earlier: M ≈1.812e34 kg.

So, let's compute this.

Compute numerator: pi * k_B * G * M².

pi ≈3.1416.

k_B=1.3806e-23 J/K.

G=6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

M=1.812e34 kg.

M²= (1.812e34)^2 =3.283e68 kg².

So numerator: 3.1416 *1.3806e-23 *6.6743e-11 *3.283e68.

Compute step by step.

First, 3.1416 *1.3806e-23 ≈4.328e-23.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.328e-23 *6.6743e-11 ≈2.888e-33.

Multiply by 3.283e68: 2.888e-33 *3.283e68 ≈9.44e35.

Denominator: ħ c =1.05457e-34 J s *3e8 m/s =3.1637e-26 J m.

So S =9.44e35 /3.1637e-26 → approx 2.98e61 J/K.

Hmm, that's 3e61 J/K, which is close to option C (1e66) but not exactly. Wait, but this is 1e61, but the options don't have that either. Wait, the options are 1e59, 1e62, etc. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the numerator.

Compute pi *k_B * G * M².

pi ≈3.1416.

k_B=1.3806e-23.

G=6.6743e-11.

M=1.812e34 kg → M²=3.283e68 kg².

So:

pi * k_B =3.1416 *1.3806e-23 ≈4.328e-23.

Multiply by G:4.328e-23 *6.6743e-11 ≈2.889e-33.

Multiply by M²:2.889e-33 *3.283e68 → (2.889 *3.283) *1e( -33 +68 ) →9.44e35.

Denominator: ħ c =1.05457e-34 *3e8 =3.1637e-26.

So S=9.44e35 /3.1637e-26 =9.44/3.1637 *1e(35 +26) →3.0 *1e61 →3e61 J/K.

But the options are A)1e62, B)1e59, C)1e66, D)1e65.

Hmm, 3e61 is about 1e61, but that's not one of the options. So I'm probably making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating M. Let's recheck that.

M = (R_s c² )/(2 G )

R_s =2.687e7 m.

c=3e8 m/s → c²=9e16 m²/s².

So numerator:2.687e7 *9e16 =2.4183e24.

Denominator:2 *6.6743e-11 ≈1.33486e-10.

So M=2.4183e24 /1.33486e-10 →2.4183e24 /1.33486e-10 = (2.4183 /1.33486 ) *1e(24 +10 ) →approx 1.813 *e34 kg.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula for entropy in terms of M. Let me rederive it.

From the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B ). And A =4 pi R_s² =4 pi (2 G M /c² )².

So A =16 pi G² M² / c^4.

Substituting into S:

S = [ (16 pi G^2 M² / c^4 ) * c^3 ] / (4 ħ G k_B )

= [16 pi G^2 M² c^-4 * c^3 ] / (4 ħ G k_B )

Simplify exponents: c^(-4+3) =c^-1.

Numerator: 16 pi G² M² c^-1.

Denominator:4 ħ G k_B.

So,

S = (16 pi G^2 M² c^-1 )/(4 ħ G k_B )

Simplify: 16/4=4, G²/G = G.

So,

S = (4 pi G M² c^-1 )/( ħ k_B )

So,

S = (4 pi G M² )/( ħ c k_B )

Which is the same as earlier.

So with M=1.812e34 kg,

S=4 pi G M²/( ħ c k_B )

Plugging in numbers:

4 pi ≈12.566.

G=6.6743e-11.

M=1.812e34 → M²=3.283e68.

So numerator:12.566 *6.6743e-11 *3.283e68.

Compute:

12.566 *6.6743e-11 =8.392e-10.

8.392e-10 *3.283e68 =2.753e59.

Denominator: ħ c k_B =1.05457e-34 *3e8 *1.3806e-23.

Compute:

1.05457e-34 *3e8 =3.1637e-26.

3.1637e-26 *1.3806e-23 =4.37e-49.

So S=2.753e59 /4.37e-49 = approx 6.28e107 J/K.

Wait, no, that's the same as before. Wait, wait, no, that can't be right. Because numerator is 2.753e59, denominator is 4.37e-49.

So 2.753e59 /4.37e-49 = (2.753/4.37 ) *1e(59 +49) → approx 0.629 *1e108 →6.29e107 J/K.

Hmm, same result as before. So this is way larger than the options.

I'm confused because the options are much smaller. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the angular size.

Wait, the question says the angular size is measured to be θ=1e-17 degrees. That's a very small angle, implying a large black hole. But according to my calculations, the entropy is 1e107 J/K, which is way beyond the options.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question and the distance is 1e10 meters instead of parsecs. Wait, the question says d=1e10 parsecs. No, definitely parsecs.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area again in terms of the Schwarzschild radius, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), but perhaps the area should be in terms of the Planck area. Let me compute A in Planck areas.

A_p =A / l_p².

l_p²= ħ G / c^3 → so A_p = A c^3/( ħ G ) →9.05e15 *3e24 / (1.05e-34 *6.67e-11 )

Wait, 3e24 is c^3=2.7e24, approx 3e24.

So A_p =9.05e15 *3e24 / ( (1.05e-34)(6.67e-11) )

Compute denominator:1.05e-34 *6.67e-11 ≈7.0e-45.

Numerator:9.05e15 *3e24 =2.715e40.

So A_p=2.715e40 /7e-45 → approx 3.88e84.

Then, the entropy S = A_p/(4) * (k_B ) → because S = A_p/(4) *k_B.

Wait, no, because S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ) → which is A_p/(4) * (k_B )

Because A_p =A c^3/( ħ G ), so S = (A_p c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ) → wait, no.

Alternatively, S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ) = (A_p )/(4) * (k_B )

Because A_p =A c^3/( ħ G )

So S = A_p/(4) * (k_B ) → S= (3.88e84 )/(4) *1.38e-23 → 9.7e83 *1.38e-23 →1.33e61 J/K.

Hmm, that's about 1e61, which is close to option A which is 1e62. But in the options, option C is 1e66, which is larger.

Wait, but earlier I got around 3e61 J/K, which is 1e61 order of magnitude.

But the options are 1e59, 1e62, etc. So perhaps the correct answer is around 1e61, but it's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was wrong, and I should use the formula S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), but without the k_B in the denominator? Let me try that.

Wait, what if the formula is S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G ) / k_B.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the units wouldn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ).

Which is what I've been using.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the entropy is given as S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ) → which would change the calculation.

So S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G ) * (1/ k_B ), but I think that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G ) * (1/ k_B ), which would make the entropy 6e107 /1e-23 =6e130, which is even worse.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can find the entropy using the formula S = (pi k_B c^3 M^2 )/( ħ G ).

Which I derived earlier, leading to S=3e61 J/K.

But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is S = (k_B c^3 M^2 )/( ħ G ) * something else.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area in terms of the Schwarzschild radius and then use the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the entropy using the event horizon radius in terms of the Planck length.

The Planck mass is M_p = sqrt( ħ c / G ) / (some factors?), but perhaps the number of Planck areas would give the entropy.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the order of magnitude.

The options are around 1e59 to 1e66. My calculation gave 3e61, which is 1e61. None of the options match, but perhaps the closest option is A)1e62.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the angular size is the diameter, not the radius. But no, the event horizon's angular size is the diameter over the distance, which I used.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the angular size is the radius, not the diameter. But that would make R_s much smaller, which would make the area smaller, leading to lower entropy.

Wait, let me recheck that. If θ is the radius, then R_s = θ_rad *d.

Wait, no, the angular size is typically the diameter.

Wait, let me think again. The angular diameter is given by θ ≈ 2 R / d. So if θ is given as the diameter's angular size, then R is (θ *d/2 ). Which is what I did.

So I think my calculation is correct, but the result doesn't match the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the numerator and denominator exponents.

Let me recompute the entropy formula.

S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B )

A=9.05e15 m².

c^3=2.7e24 m³/s³.

So A c^3 =9.05e15 *2.7e24 =2.4435e40.

Denominator:4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.3806e-23.

=4 * (1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 ) *1.3806e-23.

Compute 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 =7.0e-45.

7.0e-45 *1.38e-23 =9.66e-68.

Multiply by 4:3.864e-67.

So S=2.4435e40 /3.864e-67 =6.32e106 J/K.

Still the same result. So perhaps the given options are incorrect, or I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the entropy formula uses the area in cm², not m².

So let's compute A in cm².

A=9.05e15 m² =9.05e15 *1e4 dm² → no, wait, 1 m²=1e4 dm², and 1 dm²=1e2 cm² →1 m²=1e4 *1e2 cm²=1e4 cm²? No, 1 m=100 cm →1 m²=10000 cm². So 1 m²=1e4 cm².

So A=9.05e15 m² =9.05e19 cm².

Now, the formula becomes S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B )

But to use cm², we need to adjust the constants.

Let me convert ħ, G, and k_B into cgs units.

ħ in erg s: 1 J =10^7 erg, so ħ=1.05457e-34 J s =1.05457e-34 *1e7 erg s =1.05457e-27 erg s.

G in cm³ g⁻¹ s⁻²: G=6.6743e-8 cm³ g⁻¹ s⁻².

k_B in erg/K: k_B=1.3806e-16 erg/K.

c in cm/s: c=3e10 cm/s.

So, plug into the formula:

S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B )

A=9.05e19 cm².

c^3= (3e10 cm/s )^3 =2.7e30 cm³/s³.

cubed is correct.

So numerator:9.05e19 cm² *2.7e30 cm³/s³ =2.4435e49 cm^5/s³.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G *k_B =4 *1.05457e-27 erg s *6.6743e-8 cm³ g⁻¹ s⁻² *1.3806e-16 erg/K.

Compute in cgs units.

So,

4 *1.05457e-27 *6.6743e-8 *1.3806e-16.

First, multiply the constants:

4 *1.05457 ≈4.218.

4.218 *6.6743≈28.15.

28.15 *1.3806≈38.85.

Now the exponents: 1e-27 *1e-8=1e-35; *1e-16=1e-51.

So denominator:38.85e-51=3.885e-50.

So,

S=2.4435e49 / 3.885e-50 = (2.4435 /3.885 ) *1e99 →0.629 *1e99→6.29e98 erg/K.

Convert erg to Joules: 1 erg =1e-7 J.

So 6.29e98 erg/K =6.29e98 *1e-7 J/K =6.29e91 J/K.

This is even worse, 1e91, way larger than the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should abandon this approach and think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the area in a different unit. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of magnitude.

Wait, perhaps the event horizon's radius is R_s= (θ * d )/(2), but θ in radians.

Wait, let me compute R_s again.

θ_rad =1e-17 degrees * (pi/180) ≈1.745e-19 radians.

d=1e10 pc =3.0857e26 m.

So R_s = (1.745e-19 rad *3.0857e26 m ) /2 → (5.374e7 m ) /2 =2.687e7 m. Correct.

Another approach: find the mass M in terms of solar masses.

The Sun's mass M_sun ≈2e30 kg.

M=1.812e34 kg → 1.812e34 /2e30 =9.06e3 solar masses.

Wait, that's only about 10,000 solar masses. But supermassive black holes are millions to billions of solar masses. So this implies I made a mistake in calculating M.

Wait, no, let me double-check M.

M = (R_s c² )/(2 G )

R_s=2.687e7 m.

c²=9e16 m²/s².

So numerator:2.687e7 *9e16 =2.418e24.

Denominator:2 *6.6743e-11 =1.33486e-10.

So M=2.418e24 /1.33486e-10 → (2.418e24 )/(1.33486e-10 ) → approx 1.812e34 kg.

Yes, correct. So M is 1.8e34 kg, which is 9e3 solar masses. Hmm, which is a very massive black hole, but not supermassive. Wait, supermassive black holes are like millions to billions of solar masses. So perhaps my calculation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R_s. Let me recheck.

Wait, angular size θ=1e-17 degrees. So in radians, that's 1e-17 * pi/180 ≈1.745e-19 radians.

Distance d=1e10 pc =3.0857e26 m.

R_s= (theta_rad * d )/2 → (1.745e-19 *3.0857e26 )/2 → (5.37e7 )/2 →2.687e7 m. Correct.

Wait, wait, 1.745e-19 *3.0857e26 = (1.745 *3.0857) *1e7 →5.374e7 m. Divide by 2 →2.687e7 m.

Hmm, that's correct.

But that leads to M=1.8e34 kg, which is 9e3 solar masses. Which is a very massive black hole, but not as big as some supermassive ones. So perhaps the problem is correct.

But the entropy is 3e61 J/K, which is 1e61, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 1e66, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to cube the radius somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the entropy formula is S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ). So with A=9e15 m², c^3=2.7e24, putting numerator at 2.43e40.

Denominator 4 *1.05e-34 *6.67e-11 *1.38e-23 → 3.88e-67.

So S=2.43e40 /3.88e-67 →6.27e106 J/K.

Hmm, but that's way higher than the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option C) 1e66.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents in the denominator.

Wait,

Denominator:4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.3806e-23.

=4 * (1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 ) *1.3806e-23.

Compute 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 → (1.05457 *6.6743 )e-45 →≈7.0e-45.

Multiply by 1.3806e-23 →9.66e-68.

Multiply by 4 →3.864e-67.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is 1e66 J/K, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I should express the entropy in terms of the number of bits or something else, but that's probably not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Schwarzschild radius. Let me think again.

Wait, R_s = (theta_rad * d)/2.

theta_rad =1e-17 degrees =1e-17 * pi/180 ≈1.745e-19 radians.

d=3.0857e26 m.

So R_s = (1.745e-19 *3.0857e26 )/2 → (5.374e7 )/2 →2.687e7 m.

Correct.

So I think my calculations are correct, but the answer doesn't match the options. Perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the entropy using natural units. Let me think.

In natural units, ħ=G=c=k_B=1, but that's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S = (A)/(4 l_p^2 ), where l_p is the Planck length.

So,

A=9.05e15 m².

l_p^2= (sqrt( ħ G /c^3 ))^2 → ħ G /c^3.

So l_p^2= (1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 )/(2.7e24 ) → (7.0e-45 )/(2.7e24 ) → approx 2.59e-69 m².

So A/(4 l_p^2 )=9.05e15/(4 *2.59e-69 ) →9.05e15 /1.036e-68 →8.73e83.

That's the number of Planck areas. Then, since each Planck area contributes a factor of k_B to the entropy, S=8.73e83 *k_B →8.73e83 *1.38e-23 →1.2e61 J/K.

Again, around 1e61, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ) is correct, but I forgot that the area should be in Planck units. So perhaps I should compute A in terms of Planck area.

A =9.05e15 m².

Planck area l_p²= ħ G /c^3 →1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 / (2.7e24 ) → (7.0e-45 )/(2.7e24 )=2.59e-69 m².

So A_p =A / l_p² =9.05e15 /2.59e-69 →3.5e83.

So S= A_p/(4) * (k_B ) →3.5e83 /4 *1.38e-23 →9.375e82 *1.38e-23 →1.28e60 J/K.

Still around 1e60, but no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 1e66 J/K, but I don't see how to get that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R_s. Let me check that again.

Wait, 1e-17 degrees is a very small angle. For example, the angular size of the Milky Way from a distance of 1 Mpc is about 1 degree. So at 1e10 parsecs, the angular size would be tiny. So the event horizon being 1e-17 degrees implies a very large black hole.

But according to my calculations, R_s is 2.687e7 meters, which is about 26 million meters. Let me compare that to known black holes.

The Schwarzschild radius of the Sun is about 3 km. For a black hole of 1e6 solar masses, R_s=3e3 m *1e6=3e9 m. So 3 million kilometers. My calculation gives R_s=2.687e7 m → about 26.87 million meters → about 26.87 million meters, which is 26,870 km. That's about 4.5 times the Schwarzschild radius of a 1e6 solar mass black hole. So M would be about 4.5e6 solar masses, which is a plausible supermassive black hole.

Wait, earlier I calculated M=1.8e34 kg, which is 9e3 solar masses. So perhaps I made a mistake there.

Wait, let me recompute M.

M = (R_s c^2 )/(2 G )

R_s=2.687e7 m.

c^2=9e16 m²/s².

So numerator:2.687e7 *9e16 =2.4183e24 kg m²/s².

Denominator:2 *6.6743e-11 =1.33486e-10.

So M=2.4183e24 /1.33486e-10 →2.4183e24 /1.33486e-10 = (2.4183 /1.33486 ) *1e34 →1.812 *1e34 kg →1.812e34 kg.

Which is 1.812e34 / 1.9885e30 (solar mass) →approx 9.12e3 solar masses.

So M≈9e3 solar masses.

Hmm, which is a massive black hole, but not supermassive. So perhaps the problem has a typo, and the distance is 1e10 meters instead of parsecs. Let me try that.

If d=1e10 meters → then d=1e10 m.

Then,

R_s = (theta_rad *d )/2.

theta_rad=1e-17 degrees=1.745e-19 radians.

So,

R_s = (1.745e-19 *1e10 )/2 →1.745e-9 meters.

That's 1.745e-9 m, which is 1.745 nanometers. That would be a microscopic black hole, which is not the case. So no, the distance must be 1e10 parsecs.

I'm stuck. All my calculations give an entropy around 1e61 J/K, but the options don't have that. Perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but since that's unlikely, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula for entropy is S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), without the denominator k_B. Let me compute that.

So S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G ) * (1/k_B )

Wait, no, the correct formula includes k_B in the denominator. So perhaps I should double-check.

Another approach: look up the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. It states that S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ), which is what I've been using.

So in conclusion, I think the correct entropy is around 6e106 J/K, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option C)1e66, but I can't see how to get there.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the area. Let me recalculate A.

R_s=2.687e7 m.

A=4 pi R_s^2 →4 *3.1416*(2.687e7)^2.

(2.687e7)^2= (2.687)^2 *1e14 →7.22e14 m².

So A=4 *3.1416 *7.22e14 →approx 9.05e15 m². Correct.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since that's unlikely, I'll have to choose the closest option, which is option C)1e66.

Wait, but my calculation gives 6e106 J/K, which is 1e107. None of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is option D)1e65.

Wait, another thought. Perhaps I messed up the exponents in the calculation.

Wait, in calculating S=2.44e40 /3.88e-67 →2.44e40 /3.88e-67 = (2.44/3.88) * 1e(40 +67) →0.629 *1e107 →6.29e106 J/K.

Which is 6.29e106 →6.29e106 is about 1e107.

But the options are all lower. So perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation of the numerator or denominator.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for c. Let me check: c=3e8 m/s → c^3=2.7e24.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ) → which I've done.

Hmm. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps the intended answer is C)1e66.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option D)1e65.

But without further insights, I'm stuck.

The problem involves calculating the entropy of a supermassive black hole given its angular size and distance. The entropy of a black hole is determined by its event horizon area, which is related to its Schwarzschild radius \( R_s \). The Schwarzschild radius is derived from the angular size \( \theta \) and distance \( d \) using the formula \( R_s = \frac{\theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d}{2} \), where \( \theta_{\text{rad}} \) is the angular size in radians.

### Key Steps:
1. **Convert Angular Size to Radians**:  
   The angular size is given as \( \theta = 10^{-17} \, \text{degrees} \). Converting to radians:  
   \[
   \theta_{\text{rad}} = \theta \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
   \]

2. **Calculate Schwarzschild Radius**:  
   The distance to the black hole is \( d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \), which converts to meters:  
   \[
   d = 10^{10} \cdot 3.0857 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m} = 3.0857 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
   \]  
   Using \( R_s = \frac{\theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d}{2} \):  
   \[
   R_s = \frac{(1.745 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (3.0857 \times 10^{26})}{2} \approx 2.687 \times 10^{7} \, \text{m}.
   \]

3. **Calculate Event Horizon Area**:  
   The area of the event horizon is given by \( A = 4 \pi R_s^2 \). Substituting \( R_s \):  
   \[
   A = 4 \pi (2.687 \times 10^{7})^2 \approx 9.05 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2.
   \]

4. **Calculate Entropy**:  
   The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is:  
   \[
   S = \frac{A c^3}{4 \hbar G k_B}.
   \]  
   Substituting constants:  
   \[
   c = 3 \times 10^{8} \, \text{m/s}, \quad \hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}, \quad G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}, \quad k_B = 1.3806 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}.
   \]  
   Compute the numerator \( A c^3 \):  
   \[
   A c^3 = (9.05 \times 10^{15}) \cdot (3 \times 10^{8})^3 = 9.05 \times 10^{15} \cdot 2.7 \times 10^{24} = 2.4435 \times 10^{40}.
   \]  
   Compute the denominator \( 4 \hbar G k_B \):  
   \[
   4 \hbar G k_B = 4 \cdot (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (1.3806 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 3.885 \times 10^{-67}.
   \]  
   Finally, calculate \( S \):  
   \[
   S = \frac{2.4435 \times 10^{40}}{3.885 \times 10^{-67}} \approx 6.29 \times 10^{106} \, \text{J/K}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
The calculated entropy \( S \approx 6.29 \times 10^{106} \, \text{J/K} \) is far larger than any of the provided options (\( 10^{59}, 10^{62}, 10^{65}, 10^{66} \, \text{J/K} \)). This discrepancy suggests either an issue with the problem setup (e.g., incorrect distance or angular size) or a misinterpretation of the formula. However, based on the calculations, the closest order of magnitude to the computed result is \( 10^{107} \, \text{J/K} \), which is not listed among the options. Given the available choices, the most reasonable answer is **C) \( 10^{66} \, \text{J/K} \)**, though this does not match the derived value.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let's try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and it's located at a distance d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, some with exponents around 59 to 66 J/K. 

First, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula I think is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Or wait, was it A/(4 l_p^2), where l_p is the Planck length? Oh right, because the area is in terms of the Planck area. So the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) = (A)/(4 l_p²) * (c^3/(ħ G k_B)) — wait, maybe I should just look up the exact formula. Oh, right, the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) or S = A/(4 l_p²) * (1/(k_B)) where l_p is the Planck length. Wait, no, the exact formula is S = (A)/(4 l_p²) * (1/(k_B)) )? Wait no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recast it.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ), where A is the area of the event horizon. Alternatively, since the Planck area l_p² is (ħ c)/(G), so l_p² = ħ c/(G). So l_p squared is that. So if I substitute that into the formula, A/(4 l_p²) would be (A G)/(4 ħ c). Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the area A, then plug into the entropy formula.

So first, I need to find the radius of the event horizon, which is the Schwarzschild radius. The Schwarzschild radius R_s is 2 G M / c². So if I can find M, the mass of the black hole, I can compute R_s and then A = 4 π R_s².

But wait, how do I find M? Well, I have the angular size θ of the event horizon. The angular size θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the diameter of the event horizon divided by the distance d. So θ (rad) ≈ 2 R_s / d.

Wait, but θ is given in degrees, so I'll need to convert it to radians for the calculation. Oh right, because when θ is small, θ (in radians) ≈ θ (degrees) * (pi/180).

So θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * (pi/180). Let's compute that. Pi is about 3.1416, so 3.1416/180 is about 0.0174533 radians per degree. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * 0.0174533 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So θ_rad ≈ 2 R_s / d. So R_s ≈ (θ_rad * d) / 2.

Wait, but R_s is 2 G M / c². So substituting R_s into that equation:

2 G M / c² = (θ_rad * d ) / 2.

Wait, wait, no, because θ_rad is approximately equal to the diameter over d. The diameter is 2 R_s, so θ_rad ≈ (2 R_s) / d. So R_s ≈ (θ_rad * d) / 2.

Wait, no, wait: for small angles, the approximation tan(θ) ≈ θ, and the length is approx θ * d. So the angular size θ is subtended by the diameter of the event horizon (2 R_s) at distance d, so θ ≈ (2 R_s) / d.

So R_s = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

Once I have R_s, I can compute the area A = 4 π R_s², and then plug into the entropy formula.

Then, the entropy S is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ). Alternatively, S is proportional to A, with the proportionality constant involving other constants.

Wait, let me write down each step.

1. Convert θ from degrees to radians: θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180).

2. Compute R_s = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

But wait, d is given in parsecs. I need to convert parsecs to meters because all other units (like G, c) are in SI units.

1 parsec is approximately 3.0857e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m = 3.0857e26 meters.

So let's compute R_s:

R_s = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

θ_rad = 1e-17 degrees * (pi/180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So R_s = (1.745e-19 rad * 3.0857e26 m ) / 2.

Compute that:

1.745e-19 * 3.0857e26 = (1.745 * 3.0857) * 1e7. Let's calculate 1.745 * 3.0857 ≈ 5.374. So 5.374e7 m. Then divide by 2: ~2.687e7 m.

So R_s ≈ 2.687e7 meters.

Wait, 2.687e7 meters is 26,870,000 meters, which is about 26.87 million meters. That's a large radius, which makes sense for a supermassive black hole.

Now, the area A is 4 π R_s².

R_s is 2.687e7 m. So R_s squared is (2.687e7)^2 = (2.687)^2 * 1e14 = ~7.22e14 m².

Multiply by 4 pi: 4 * 3.1416 ≈ 12.566.

So A = 12.566 * 7.22e14 ≈ 9.05e15 m².

Wait, let me recheck that calculation.

Wait, (2.687e7)^2 = (2.687)^2 * 1e14. 2.687 squared: 2.687 * 2.687. Let's compute that.

2.687 * 2.687: 2 * 2 =4, 2 * 0.687 = 1.374; 0.687 * 2 =1.374, and 0.687^2≈0.472. So (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², where a=2, b=0.687.

So (2 + 0.687)^2 = 2² + 2*2*0.687 + 0.687² = 4 + 2.748 + 0.472 ≈ 7.22.

So yes, 7.22e14 m².

Multiply by 4 pi: 4 * pi is about 12.566, so 12.566 *7.22e14 ≈ 9.05e15 m².

So A ≈9.05e15 m².

Now, plug into the entropy formula.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Alternatively, the formula is S = (A)/(4 l_p²) * (k_B), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that S is proportional to A/(l_p²), with l_p being Planck length, and then the constants.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Or perhaps S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) * (k_B). Let me think about the units.

The Planck length l_p is sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ), so l_p^2 = ħ G / c^3. So 1/(l_p^2) = c^3/(ħ G).

So S = A/(4 l_p^2) * (1/(k_B)) ?

Wait, probably not. Let me look up the correct formula in my mind. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). So that's the formula.

So S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

I need to plug in the numbers.

Given that A is 9.05e15 m², what's the value of S?

Let me list the constants:

c = speed of light ≈ 3e8 m/s.

ħ = reduced Planck constant ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J s.

G = gravitational constant ≈ 6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

k_B = Boltzmann constant ≈ 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: A * c^3 = 9.05e15 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3.

(3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

So 9.05e15 * 2.7e25 = (9.05 * 2.7) * 1e40.

9.05 * 2.7: let's calculate that. 9*2.7=24.3, 0.05*2.7=0.135 → total 24.435.

So numerator ≈24.435e40 = 2.4435e41.

Denominator:4 ħ G k_B.

Compute 4 * ħ * G * k_B.

4 * 1.05457e-34 * 6.6743e-11 * 1.3806e-23.

Let me compute step by step.

First, multiply 4 * 1.05457e-34 ≈4.218e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.218e-34 *6.6743e-11 ≈ 4.218 *6.6743 ≈28.16e-45.

Wait, 4.218e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.218 *6.6743) * 1e-45.

4.218 *6.6743 → Approximately 4*6.6 is 26.4, and 0.218*6.6 is about 1.4448, and 4*0.0743 is 0.297, and 0.218*0.0743≈0.0162. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to compute 4.218 *6.6743.

Wait, 4*6=24, 4*0.6743=2.697, 0.218*6=1.308, 0.218 *0.6743≈0.1467.

But perhaps I'll take an approximate approach. Let me calculate 4.218 *6.6743:

Approximating,

4.218 *6 = 25.308,

4.218 *0.6743 ≈ 4.218 *0.6=2.5308, and 4.218 *0.0743≈0.3127. So total 2.5308 + 0.3127 = 2.8435. So total 25.308 +2.8435≈28.1515.

So 28.1515e-45.

Now multiply by 1.3806e-23 (k_B).

So 28.1515e-45 * 1.3806e-23 = (28.1515 * 1.3806) * 1e-68.

28.1515 *1.3806 ≈ let's compute:

28 *1.38= 38.64,

28 *0.0006=0.0168,

0.1515 *1.38≈0.208,

0.1515 *0.0006≈0.0000909.

Wait that's getting complicated. Alternatively, let's compute 28.1515 *1.3806.

Approximate:

28 *1.3806 = 38.6568,

0.1515 *1.3806 ≈ 0.208.

So total ≈38.6568 +0.208 ≈38.865.

So denominator is approximately 38.865e-68 =3.8865e-67.

So S = (2.4435e41) / (3.8865e-67) ) * (1/(4 ħ G k_B)) ? Wait no, denominator is 4 ħ G k_B, so it's 3.8865e-67.

So S ≈ (2.4435e41) / (3.8865e-67) ) → which is (2.4435 /3.8865) ) * 1e(41 +67) → (approx 0.629) * 1e108 → 6.29e107 J/K.

Wait, that's 1e108 * 0.629 ≈6.29e107 J/K.

Wait, but that's way higher than the options given (which are around 1e59 to 1e66). So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, this can't be right because the options are much smaller. So I must have messed up some calculation step. Let me retrace my steps.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating A. Let me go back.

Wait, calculating R_s again.

θ_rad is 1e-17 degrees.

1e-17 degrees in radians is 1e-17 * pi/180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

d is 1e10 parsecs, which is 1e10 *3.0857e16 m =3.0857e26 m.

So R_s = (θ_rad * d) / 2 = (1.745e-19 rad *3.0857e26 m ) / 2.

Let me compute 1.745e-19 *3.0857e26.

1.745e-19 *3.0857e26 = (1.745 *3.0857) *1e7.

1.745 *3.0857 ≈5.375.

So 5.375e7 meters. Then /2 is 2.6875e7 m.

That's correct.

Then A =4 pi R_s^2.

R_s is 2.6875e7 m. Squared is (2.6875e7)^2.

2.6875e7 squared is (2.6875)^2 * 1e14.

2.6875^2: 2.6875 is 2 +0.6875, so (2 + 0.6875)^2=4 + 2*2*0.6875 + (0.6875)^2.

Which is 4 + 2.75 + 0.4727 ≈7.2227.

So R_s squared ≈7.2227e14 m².

A=4 pi * 7.2227e14 ≈ 4 *3.1416 *7.2227e14 ≈12.566 *7.2227e14 ≈9.05e15 m². Correct.

Then, S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

So plug in the numbers.

A=9.05e15 m².

c^3= (3e8)^3=27e24=2.7e25 m³/s³.

So A c^3=9.05e15 * 2.7e25 =2.4435e41 (as before).

Denominator: 4 ħ G k_B.

Calculate ħ =1.05457e-34 J s.

G=6.6743e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.

k_B=1.3806e-23 J/K.

4 * ħ * G * k_B =4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.3806e-23.

Compute step by step.

First, 4 *1.05457e-34 =4.2183e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.2183e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.2183 *6.6743)e-45.

We calculated that earlier as approximately 28.15e-45.

Then multiply by 1.3806e-23: 28.15e-45 *1.3806e-23 = (28.15 *1.3806)e-68 ≈38.89e-68 =3.889e-67.

So denominator is 3.889e-67.

So S = (2.4435e41 ) / (3.889e-67) = (2.4435 /3.889) ) * 1e(41 +67) → (approx 0.628) *1e108 →6.28e107 J/K.

Wait, that's 6.28e107 J/K. But the options are 1e59, 1e62, 1e65, etc. So this is way off, which suggests I made a mistake in my approach.

Hmm, maybe I got the formula for entropy wrong. Let me think again. Oh wait! I think the formula might be S = (A)/(4 l_p^2), where l_p is the Planck length. Let me check that.

The Planck length l_p = sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ). So l_p squared is ħ G / c^3.

So S = A/(4 l_p^2) = A * c^3/(4 ħ G ). Because substituting l_p^2 = ħ G / c^3, so 1/l_p^2 = c^3/( ħ G ).

So S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G ) * (1/k_B ?) No, wait, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me rederive the formula.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

Alternatively, sometimes it's written as S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), but I think that's not correct. Wait, no.

Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. The correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B ), so including the Boltzmann constant.

So, my earlier calculation is correct, but the result is way too high. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, let's recalculate the denominator.

Denominator is 4 * ħ * G * k_B.

Compute each term:

4 =4.

ħ =1.05457e-34 J s.

G =6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

k_B=1.3806e-23 J/K.

So the denominator is 4 * ħ * G *k_B.

Multiplying all together:

4 * 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.3806e-23.

Let me compute the exponents separately.

4 is 4.

1e-34 *1e-11 *1e-23 =1e-68.

Now the constants: 4 *1.05457 *6.6743 *1.3806.

Compute 4 *1.05457 =4.21828.

4.21828 *6.6743 ≈4.21828 *6.6743.

Let me compute 4 *6.6743 =26.6972,

0.21828 *6.6743 ≈1.457.

So total approx 26.6972 +1.457 ≈28.154.

Then multiply by 1.3806: 28.154 *1.3806.

28 *1.38=38.64,

0.154 *1.38=0.213.

So total approx 38.64 +0.213≈38.853.

So denominator is 38.853e-68 =3.8853e-67.

So S = 2.4435e41 / 3.8853e-67 = (2.4435 /3.8853) * 1e(41+67) → (approx 0.629) *1e108 →6.29e107 J/K.

But this is way higher than the given options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating A?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating R_s.

Wait, let me recheck R_s.

θ_rad = 1e-17 degrees in radians.

1 degree = pi/180 radians, so 1e-17 degrees = 1e-17 * pi/180 ≈1.74533e-19 rad.

d=1e10 parsecs =1e10 *3.0857e16 m =3.0857e26 m.

R_s = (theta_rad * d)/2 → 1.74533e-19 *3.0857e26 /2.

Compute 1.74533e-19 *3.0857e26 = (1.74533 *3.0857) *1e7 (since 1e-19 *1e26 =1e7).

1.74533 *3.0857 ≈5.374 →5.374e7 m.

Divide by 2: 2.687e7 m. So that's correct.

So R_s is correct.

Hmm, maybe the formula is different. Oh wait! The area A is 4 pi R_s^2, but perhaps R_s is the Schwarzschild radius, which is 2 G M / c². Oh right, but that's how we calculated R_s. So maybe another approach is to find M, the mass, then compute the entropy.

Wait, because the entropy also depends on the mass (since M relates to the area). Alternatively, perhaps I should find M from R_s.

R_s = 2 G M / c² → M = (R_s c² )/(2 G ).

So M = (2.687e7 m * (3e8 m/s)^2 )/(2 *6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2 )

Compute numerator: 2.687e7 *9e16 = 2.687e7 *9e16 =2.4183e24 kg m²/s²? Wait, no, actually, units may not be correct. Let me just compute the numbers.

2.687e7 m * (3e8 m/s)^2 =2.687e7 *9e16 =2.687e7 *9e16 =2.4183e24.

Wait, 2.687e7 *9e16 = (2.687 *9) *1e(7+16) =24.183 *1e23 =2.4183e24.

Denominator: 2 *6.6743e-11 ≈1.33486e-10.

So M =2.4183e24 /1.33486e-10 = (2.4183 /1.33486) *1e(24 +10) →approx 1.812 *1e34 kg.

Wait, 1.812e34 kg. That's a huge mass, but supermassive black holes can be that big. The Sun is about 2e30 kg, so this is 1e4 times larger, but that's possible.

Now, the entropy of a black hole can also be expressed in terms of the mass: S = ( (c^6 )/( G ħ ) ) * (M^2) * (1/(k_B)) * (some constants). Wait, I'm not sure, but perhaps another approach is to compute the area A from R_s and then use the entropy formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), which is the same as (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B ), which is what I did before.

But the result was 6.29e107 J/K, which is way higher than the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me compute the denominator again.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G *k_B.

4 =4.

ħ =1.05457e-34 J s.

G=6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

k_B=1.3806e-23 J/K.

Multiply all together:

4 * 1.05457e-34 * 6.6743e-11 * 1.3806e-23

Let me compute the exponents: 1e-34 *1e-11=1e-45, *1e-23=1e-68.

The constants: 4 *1.05457 *6.6743 *1.3806.

Compute 4 *1.05457=4.21828.

4.21828 *6.6743 ≈28.154.

28.154 *1.3806 ≈38.85.

So denominator is 38.85e-68 →3.885e-67.

Numerator: A c^3 =9.05e15 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3.

(3e8)^3=2.7e24 m³/s³.

Multiply by 9.05e15 m²: 9.05e15 *2.7e24 =2.4435e40 m^5/s³.

Wait, no: (m²) * (m³/s³ )=m^5/s³. But the units don't affect the exponent calculation.

So numerator is 2.4435e40.

So S = (2.4435e40 ) / (3.885e-67 ) = (2.4435 /3.885 ) *1e(40 +67) →approx 0.629 *1e107 →6.29e106 J/K.

Wait, 40 +67 is 107, so yes.

So S ≈6.29e106 J/K.

But this is still way larger than the options given. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is wrong. Maybe the entropy formula uses the area in cm² or another unit? Or perhaps I forgot a conversion factor.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have the area in cm². Let me think about the units.

Wait, the Planck area is about 2.6e53 cm². So perhaps when using A in cm², the formula would be different.

Let me try that approach.

First, convert A from m² to cm².

A=9.05e15 m².

1 m² =1e4 dm² =1e4 *1e2 cm² →1e4 * (1e2)^2 cm²? Wait, no. 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m²= (100 cm)^2 =1e4 cm².

So 9.05e15 m² =9.05e15 *1e4 cm² =9.05e19 cm².

Now, the Bekenstein-Hawking formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). But when using A in cm², we might have to include conversion factors.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute all the constants in cgs units, but that's going to get complicated.

Alternatively, I can check the formula again. Wait, another approach: find the entropy expression using the Schwarzschild radius and then express it in terms of known constants.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), which is the same as before. But with A in m², I'm getting exponents that are way too high.

Wait, I found that S is about 6e106 J/K, which is way beyond the given options. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting parsecs to meters. Let me check: 1 parsec is 3.0857e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 *3.0857e16 =3.0857e26 m. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the area A in terms of the Planck area.

The Planck area l_p² is approximately (ħ c)/(G), which is about 2.6e-35 m².

So A =9.05e15 m² → in Planck areas, it's 9.05e15 / 2.6e-35 ≈3.48e50.

Then, the entropy S is A/(4 l_p²) * (k_B) ?

Wait, no. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B ), which in terms of Planck area is S = (A_p )/(4) * (k_B) ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, l_p^2 = ħ G / c^3 → Planck area is l_p².

So, S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ) = (A/(l_p²)) * ( c^3/(4 ħ G k_B )) * ( l_p^2 ) / ( l_p^2 ). Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of the numerator and denominator exponents.

Let me recompute the denominator.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G *k_B.

ħ =1.05457e-34 J s.

G=6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

k_B=1.3806e-23 J/K.

So 4 *1.05457e-34 =4.2183e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.2183e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.2183 *6.6743) *1e-45.

4.2183 *6.6743 ≈28.154 →28.154e-45.

Multiply by k_B: 28.154e-45 *1.3806e-23 = (28.154 *1.3806) *1e-68.

28.154 *1.3806 ≈38.85 →38.85e-68 =3.885e-67.

So denominator is 3.885e-67.

Numerator: A c^3 =9.05e15 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3 =9.05e15 *2.7e24 =2.4435e40.

So S=2.4435e40 / 3.885e-67 = (2.4435 /3.885 ) *1e(40 +67) →0.629 *1e107 →6.29e106 J/K.

Hmm, same result again. But the options are 1e59, etc. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the entropy in terms of the event horizon's area, but perhaps I should use the formula that relates entropy to the area in terms of the Planck area, which would be S = (A / l_p^2 )/(4) * (some constants).

Wait, the area A in Planck units is A_p = A / l_p².

So A_p = (9.05e15 m² ) / ( (sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ))^2 ) → (9.05e15 ) / ( ħ G / c^3 ) →9.05e15 * c^3/( ħ G ).

But then S = A_p/(4) * (k_B c^3 )/( ħ G ), but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ), which I have been using.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the entropy is actually (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ), which is what I've been using.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), which is the same as S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B^{-1} ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express A in terms of the Schwarzschild radius and use the formula S = (k_B c^3/(4 ħ G )) * (R_s^2 *4 pi )/(4 ). Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for entropy in terms of the mass M. Because entropy S is proportional to M².

So, S = (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G ) * (4 pi (2 G M / c² )^2 )/(4 ) → simplifying.

Wait, let's compute that.

S = (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G ) * [4 pi (4 G² M²)/(c^4 ) ]/(4 )

Wait, the 4 in the numerator and denominator cancels. So,

S = (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G ) * pi (4 G² M²)/(c^4 )

Simplify:

= (k_B c^3 * pi *4 G² M² )/(4 ħ G c^4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4/4 cancels.

c^3 / c^4 = 1/c.

G² / G = G.

So,

S= (k_B pi G M^2 )/( ħ c )

Which is S = ( pi k_B G M² )/( ħ c )

So, perhaps using this formula is easier.

So, S = (pi k_B G M² )/( ħ c )

We have M from earlier: M ≈1.812e34 kg.

So, let's compute this.

Compute numerator: pi * k_B * G * M².

pi ≈3.1416.

k_B=1.3806e-23 J/K.

G=6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

M=1.812e34 kg.

M²= (1.812e34)^2 =3.283e68 kg².

So numerator: 3.1416 *1.3806e-23 *6.6743e-11 *3.283e68.

Compute step by step.

First, 3.1416 *1.3806e-23 ≈4.328e-23.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.328e-23 *6.6743e-11 ≈2.888e-33.

Multiply by 3.283e68: 2.888e-33 *3.283e68 ≈9.44e35.

Denominator: ħ c =1.05457e-34 J s *3e8 m/s =3.1637e-26 J m.

So S =9.44e35 /3.1637e-26 → approx 2.98e61 J/K.

Hmm, that's 3e61 J/K, which is close to option C (1e66) but not exactly. Wait, but this is 1e61, but the options don't have that either. Wait, the options are 1e59, 1e62, etc. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the numerator.

Compute pi *k_B * G * M².

pi ≈3.1416.

k_B=1.3806e-23.

G=6.6743e-11.

M=1.812e34 kg → M²=3.283e68 kg².

So:

pi * k_B =3.1416 *1.3806e-23 ≈4.328e-23.

Multiply by G:4.328e-23 *6.6743e-11 ≈2.889e-33.

Multiply by M²:2.889e-33 *3.283e68 → (2.889 *3.283) *1e( -33 +68 ) →9.44e35.

Denominator: ħ c =1.05457e-34 *3e8 =3.1637e-26.

So S=9.44e35 /3.1637e-26 =9.44/3.1637 *1e(35 +26) →3.0 *1e61 →3e61 J/K.

But the options are A)1e62, B)1e59, C)1e66, D)1e65.

Hmm, 3e61 is about 1e61, but that's not one of the options. So I'm probably making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating M. Let's recheck that.

M = (R_s c² )/(2 G )

R_s =2.687e7 m.

c=3e8 m/s → c²=9e16 m²/s².

So numerator:2.687e7 *9e16 =2.4183e24.

Denominator:2 *6.6743e-11 ≈1.33486e-10.

So M=2.4183e24 /1.33486e-10 →2.4183e24 /1.33486e-10 = (2.4183 /1.33486 ) *1e(24 +10 ) →approx 1.813 *e34 kg.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula for entropy in terms of M. Let me rederive it.

From the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B ). And A =4 pi R_s² =4 pi (2 G M /c² )².

So A =16 pi G² M² / c^4.

Substituting into S:

S = [ (16 pi G^2 M² / c^4 ) * c^3 ] / (4 ħ G k_B )

= [16 pi G^2 M² c^-4 * c^3 ] / (4 ħ G k_B )

Simplify exponents: c^(-4+3) =c^-1.

Numerator: 16 pi G² M² c^-1.

Denominator:4 ħ G k_B.

So,

S = (16 pi G^2 M² c^-1 )/(4 ħ G k_B )

Simplify: 16/4=4, G²/G = G.

So,

S = (4 pi G M² c^-1 )/( ħ k_B )

So,

S = (4 pi G M² )/( ħ c k_B )

Which is the same as earlier.

So with M=1.812e34 kg,

S=4 pi G M²/( ħ c k_B )

Plugging in numbers:

4 pi ≈12.566.

G=6.6743e-11.

M=1.812e34 → M²=3.283e68.

So numerator:12.566 *6.6743e-11 *3.283e68.

Compute:

12.566 *6.6743e-11 =8.392e-10.

8.392e-10 *3.283e68 =2.753e59.

Denominator: ħ c k_B =1.05457e-34 *3e8 *1.3806e-23.

Compute:

1.05457e-34 *3e8 =3.1637e-26.

3.1637e-26 *1.3806e-23 =4.37e-49.

So S=2.753e59 /4.37e-49 = approx 6.28e107 J/K.

Wait, no, that's the same as before. Wait, wait, no, that can't be right. Because numerator is 2.753e59, denominator is 4.37e-49.

So 2.753e59 /4.37e-49 = (2.753/4.37 ) *1e(59 +49) → approx 0.629 *1e108 →6.29e107 J/K.

Hmm, same result as before. So this is way larger than the options.

I'm confused because the options are much smaller. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the angular size.

Wait, the question says the angular size is measured to be θ=1e-17 degrees. That's a very small angle, implying a large black hole. But according to my calculations, the entropy is 1e107 J/K, which is way beyond the options.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question and the distance is 1e10 meters instead of parsecs. Wait, the question says d=1e10 parsecs. No, definitely parsecs.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area again in terms of the Schwarzschild radius, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), but perhaps the area should be in terms of the Planck area. Let me compute A in Planck areas.

A_p =A / l_p².

l_p²= ħ G / c^3 → so A_p = A c^3/( ħ G ) →9.05e15 *3e24 / (1.05e-34 *6.67e-11 )

Wait, 3e24 is c^3=2.7e24, approx 3e24.

So A_p =9.05e15 *3e24 / ( (1.05e-34)(6.67e-11) )

Compute denominator:1.05e-34 *6.67e-11 ≈7.0e-45.

Numerator:9.05e15 *3e24 =2.715e40.

So A_p=2.715e40 /7e-45 → approx 3.88e84.

Then, the entropy S = A_p/(4) * (k_B ) → because S = A_p/(4) *k_B.

Wait, no, because S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ) → which is A_p/(4) * (k_B )

Because A_p =A c^3/( ħ G ), so S = (A_p c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ) → wait, no.

Alternatively, S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ) = (A_p )/(4) * (k_B )

Because A_p =A c^3/( ħ G )

So S = A_p/(4) * (k_B ) → S= (3.88e84 )/(4) *1.38e-23 → 9.7e83 *1.38e-23 →1.33e61 J/K.

Hmm, that's about 1e61, which is close to option A which is 1e62. But in the options, option C is 1e66, which is larger.

Wait, but earlier I got around 3e61 J/K, which is 1e61 order of magnitude.

But the options are 1e59, 1e62, etc. So perhaps the correct answer is around 1e61, but it's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was wrong, and I should use the formula S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), but without the k_B in the denominator? Let me try that.

Wait, what if the formula is S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G ) / k_B.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the units wouldn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ).

Which is what I've been using.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the entropy is given as S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ) → which would change the calculation.

So S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G ) * (1/ k_B ), but I think that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G ) * (1/ k_B ), which would make the entropy 6e107 /1e-23 =6e130, which is even worse.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can find the entropy using the formula S = (pi k_B c^3 M^2 )/( ħ G ).

Which I derived earlier, leading to S=3e61 J/K.

But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is S = (k_B c^3 M^2 )/( ħ G ) * something else.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area in terms of the Schwarzschild radius and then use the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the entropy using the event horizon radius in terms of the Planck length.

The Planck mass is M_p = sqrt( ħ c / G ) / (some factors?), but perhaps the number of Planck areas would give the entropy.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the order of magnitude.

The options are around 1e59 to 1e66. My calculation gave 3e61, which is 1e61. None of the options match, but perhaps the closest option is A)1e62.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the angular size is the diameter, not the radius. But no, the event horizon's angular size is the diameter over the distance, which I used.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the angular size is the radius, not the diameter. But that would make R_s much smaller, which would make the area smaller, leading to lower entropy.

Wait, let me recheck that. If θ is the radius, then R_s = θ_rad *d.

Wait, no, the angular size is typically the diameter.

Wait, let me think again. The angular diameter is given by θ ≈ 2 R / d. So if θ is given as the diameter's angular size, then R is (θ *d/2 ). Which is what I did.

So I think my calculation is correct, but the result doesn't match the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the numerator and denominator exponents.

Let me recompute the entropy formula.

S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B )

A=9.05e15 m².

c^3=2.7e24 m³/s³.

So A c^3 =9.05e15 *2.7e24 =2.4435e40.

Denominator:4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.3806e-23.

=4 * (1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 ) *1.3806e-23.

Compute 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 =7.0e-45.

7.0e-45 *1.38e-23 =9.66e-68.

Multiply by 4:3.864e-67.

So S=2.4435e40 /3.864e-67 =6.32e106 J/K.

Still the same result. So perhaps the given options are incorrect, or I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the entropy formula uses the area in cm², not m².

So let's compute A in cm².

A=9.05e15 m² =9.05e15 *1e4 dm² → no, wait, 1 m²=1e4 dm², and 1 dm²=1e2 cm² →1 m²=1e4 *1e2 cm²=1e4 cm²? No, 1 m=100 cm →1 m²=10000 cm². So 1 m²=1e4 cm².

So A=9.05e15 m² =9.05e19 cm².

Now, the formula becomes S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B )

But to use cm², we need to adjust the constants.

Let me convert ħ, G, and k_B into cgs units.

ħ in erg s: 1 J =10^7 erg, so ħ=1.05457e-34 J s =1.05457e-34 *1e7 erg s =1.05457e-27 erg s.

G in cm³ g⁻¹ s⁻²: G=6.6743e-8 cm³ g⁻¹ s⁻².

k_B in erg/K: k_B=1.3806e-16 erg/K.

c in cm/s: c=3e10 cm/s.

So, plug into the formula:

S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B )

A=9.05e19 cm².

c^3= (3e10 cm/s )^3 =2.7e30 cm³/s³.

cubed is correct.

So numerator:9.05e19 cm² *2.7e30 cm³/s³ =2.4435e49 cm^5/s³.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G *k_B =4 *1.05457e-27 erg s *6.6743e-8 cm³ g⁻¹ s⁻² *1.3806e-16 erg/K.

Compute in cgs units.

So,

4 *1.05457e-27 *6.6743e-8 *1.3806e-16.

First, multiply the constants:

4 *1.05457 ≈4.218.

4.218 *6.6743≈28.15.

28.15 *1.3806≈38.85.

Now the exponents: 1e-27 *1e-8=1e-35; *1e-16=1e-51.

So denominator:38.85e-51=3.885e-50.

So,

S=2.4435e49 / 3.885e-50 = (2.4435 /3.885 ) *1e99 →0.629 *1e99→6.29e98 erg/K.

Convert erg to Joules: 1 erg =1e-7 J.

So 6.29e98 erg/K =6.29e98 *1e-7 J/K =6.29e91 J/K.

This is even worse, 1e91, way larger than the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should abandon this approach and think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the area in a different unit. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of magnitude.

Wait, perhaps the event horizon's radius is R_s= (θ * d )/(2), but θ in radians.

Wait, let me compute R_s again.

θ_rad =1e-17 degrees * (pi/180) ≈1.745e-19 radians.

d=1e10 pc =3.0857e26 m.

So R_s = (1.745e-19 rad *3.0857e26 m ) /2 → (5.374e7 m ) /2 =2.687e7 m. Correct.

Another approach: find the mass M in terms of solar masses.

The Sun's mass M_sun ≈2e30 kg.

M=1.812e34 kg → 1.812e34 /2e30 =9.06e3 solar masses.

Wait, that's only about 10,000 solar masses. But supermassive black holes are millions to billions of solar masses. So this implies I made a mistake in calculating M.

Wait, no, let me double-check M.

M = (R_s c² )/(2 G )

R_s=2.687e7 m.

c²=9e16 m²/s².

So numerator:2.687e7 *9e16 =2.418e24.

Denominator:2 *6.6743e-11 =1.33486e-10.

So M=2.418e24 /1.33486e-10 → (2.418e24 )/(1.33486e-10 ) → approx 1.812e34 kg.

Yes, correct. So M is 1.8e34 kg, which is 9e3 solar masses. Hmm, which is a very massive black hole, but not supermassive. Wait, supermassive black holes are like millions to billions of solar masses. So perhaps my calculation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R_s. Let me recheck.

Wait, angular size θ=1e-17 degrees. So in radians, that's 1e-17 * pi/180 ≈1.745e-19 radians.

Distance d=1e10 pc =3.0857e26 m.

R_s= (theta_rad * d )/2 → (1.745e-19 *3.0857e26 )/2 → (5.37e7 )/2 →2.687e7 m. Correct.

Wait, wait, 1.745e-19 *3.0857e26 = (1.745 *3.0857) *1e7 →5.374e7 m. Divide by 2 →2.687e7 m.

Hmm, that's correct.

But that leads to M=1.8e34 kg, which is 9e3 solar masses. Which is a very massive black hole, but not as big as some supermassive ones. So perhaps the problem is correct.

But the entropy is 3e61 J/K, which is 1e61, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 1e66, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to cube the radius somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the entropy formula is S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ). So with A=9e15 m², c^3=2.7e24, putting numerator at 2.43e40.

Denominator 4 *1.05e-34 *6.67e-11 *1.38e-23 → 3.88e-67.

So S=2.43e40 /3.88e-67 →6.27e106 J/K.

Hmm, but that's way higher than the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option C) 1e66.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents in the denominator.

Wait,

Denominator:4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.3806e-23.

=4 * (1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 ) *1.3806e-23.

Compute 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 → (1.05457 *6.6743 )e-45 →≈7.0e-45.

Multiply by 1.3806e-23 →9.66e-68.

Multiply by 4 →3.864e-67.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is 1e66 J/K, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I should express the entropy in terms of the number of bits or something else, but that's probably not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Schwarzschild radius. Let me think again.

Wait, R_s = (theta_rad * d)/2.

theta_rad =1e-17 degrees =1e-17 * pi/180 ≈1.745e-19 radians.

d=3.0857e26 m.

So R_s = (1.745e-19 *3.0857e26 )/2 → (5.374e7 )/2 →2.687e7 m.

Correct.

So I think my calculations are correct, but the answer doesn't match the options. Perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the entropy using natural units. Let me think.

In natural units, ħ=G=c=k_B=1, but that's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S = (A)/(4 l_p^2 ), where l_p is the Planck length.

So,

A=9.05e15 m².

l_p^2= (sqrt( ħ G /c^3 ))^2 → ħ G /c^3.

So l_p^2= (1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 )/(2.7e24 ) → (7.0e-45 )/(2.7e24 ) → approx 2.59e-69 m².

So A/(4 l_p^2 )=9.05e15/(4 *2.59e-69 ) →9.05e15 /1.036e-68 →8.73e83.

That's the number of Planck areas. Then, since each Planck area contributes a factor of k_B to the entropy, S=8.73e83 *k_B →8.73e83 *1.38e-23 →1.2e61 J/K.

Again, around 1e61, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ) is correct, but I forgot that the area should be in Planck units. So perhaps I should compute A in terms of Planck area.

A =9.05e15 m².

Planck area l_p²= ħ G /c^3 →1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 / (2.7e24 ) → (7.0e-45 )/(2.7e24 )=2.59e-69 m².

So A_p =A / l_p² =9.05e15 /2.59e-69 →3.5e83.

So S= A_p/(4) * (k_B ) →3.5e83 /4 *1.38e-23 →9.375e82 *1.38e-23 →1.28e60 J/K.

Still around 1e60, but no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 1e66 J/K, but I don't see how to get that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R_s. Let me check that again.

Wait, 1e-17 degrees is a very small angle. For example, the angular size of the Milky Way from a distance of 1 Mpc is about 1 degree. So at 1e10 parsecs, the angular size would be tiny. So the event horizon being 1e-17 degrees implies a very large black hole.

But according to my calculations, R_s is 2.687e7 meters, which is about 26 million meters. Let me compare that to known black holes.

The Schwarzschild radius of the Sun is about 3 km. For a black hole of 1e6 solar masses, R_s=3e3 m *1e6=3e9 m. So 3 million kilometers. My calculation gives R_s=2.687e7 m → about 26.87 million meters → about 26.87 million meters, which is 26,870 km. That's about 4.5 times the Schwarzschild radius of a 1e6 solar mass black hole. So M would be about 4.5e6 solar masses, which is a plausible supermassive black hole.

Wait, earlier I calculated M=1.8e34 kg, which is 9e3 solar masses. So perhaps I made a mistake there.

Wait, let me recompute M.

M = (R_s c^2 )/(2 G )

R_s=2.687e7 m.

c^2=9e16 m²/s².

So numerator:2.687e7 *9e16 =2.4183e24 kg m²/s².

Denominator:2 *6.6743e-11 =1.33486e-10.

So M=2.4183e24 /1.33486e-10 →2.4183e24 /1.33486e-10 = (2.4183 /1.33486 ) *1e34 →1.812 *1e34 kg →1.812e34 kg.

Which is 1.812e34 / 1.9885e30 (solar mass) →approx 9.12e3 solar masses.

So M≈9e3 solar masses.

Hmm, which is a massive black hole, but not supermassive. So perhaps the problem has a typo, and the distance is 1e10 meters instead of parsecs. Let me try that.

If d=1e10 meters → then d=1e10 m.

Then,

R_s = (theta_rad *d )/2.

theta_rad=1e-17 degrees=1.745e-19 radians.

So,

R_s = (1.745e-19 *1e10 )/2 →1.745e-9 meters.

That's 1.745e-9 m, which is 1.745 nanometers. That would be a microscopic black hole, which is not the case. So no, the distance must be 1e10 parsecs.

I'm stuck. All my calculations give an entropy around 1e61 J/K, but the options don't have that. Perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but since that's unlikely, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula for entropy is S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), without the denominator k_B. Let me compute that.

So S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G ) * (1/k_B )

Wait, no, the correct formula includes k_B in the denominator. So perhaps I should double-check.

Another approach: look up the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. It states that S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ), which is what I've been using.

So in conclusion, I think the correct entropy is around 6e106 J/K, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option C)1e66, but I can't see how to get there.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the area. Let me recalculate A.

R_s=2.687e7 m.

A=4 pi R_s^2 →4 *3.1416*(2.687e7)^2.

(2.687e7)^2= (2.687)^2 *1e14 →7.22e14 m².

So A=4 *3.1416 *7.22e14 →approx 9.05e15 m². Correct.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since that's unlikely, I'll have to choose the closest option, which is option C)1e66.

Wait, but my calculation gives 6e106 J/K, which is 1e107. None of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is option D)1e65.

Wait, another thought. Perhaps I messed up the exponents in the calculation.

Wait, in calculating S=2.44e40 /3.88e-67 →2.44e40 /3.88e-67 = (2.44/3.88) * 1e(40 +67) →0.629 *1e107 →6.29e106 J/K.

Which is 6.29e106 →6.29e106 is about 1e107.

But the options are all lower. So perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation of the numerator or denominator.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for c. Let me check: c=3e8 m/s → c^3=2.7e24.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B ) → which I've done.

Hmm. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps the intended answer is C)1e66.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option D)1e65.

But without further insights, I'm stuck.


The problem involves calculating the entropy of a supermassive black hole given its angular size and distance. The entropy of a black hole is determined by its event horizon area, which is related to its Schwarzschild radius \( R_s \). The Schwarzschild radius is derived from the angular size \( \theta \) and distance \( d \) using the formula \( R_s = \frac{\theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d}{2} \), where \( \theta_{\text{rad}} \) is the angular size in radians.

### Key Steps:
1. **Convert Angular Size to Radians**:  
   The angular size is given as \( \theta = 10^{-17} \, \text{degrees} \). Converting to radians:  
   \[
   \theta_{\text{rad}} = \theta \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
   \]

2. **Calculate Schwarzschild Radius**:  
   The distance to the black hole is \( d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \), which converts to meters:  
   \[
   d = 10^{10} \cdot 3.0857 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m} = 3.0857 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
   \]  
   Using \( R_s = \frac{\theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d}{2} \):  
   \[
   R_s = \frac{(1.745 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (3.0857 \times 10^{26})}{2} \approx 2.687 \times 10^{7} \, \text{m}.
   \]

3. **Calculate Event Horizon Area**:  
   The area of the event horizon is given by \( A = 4 \pi R_s^2 \). Substituting \( R_s \):  
   \[
   A = 4 \pi (2.687 \times 10^{7})^2 \approx 9.05 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2.
   \]

4. **Calculate Entropy**:  
   The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is:  
   \[
   S = \frac{A c^3}{4 \hbar G k_B}.
   \]  
   Substituting constants:  
   \[
   c = 3 \times 10^{8} \, \text{m/s}, \quad \hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}, \quad G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}, \quad k_B = 1.3806 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}.
   \]  
   Compute the numerator \( A c^3 \):  
   \[
   A c^3 = (9.05 \times 10^{15}) \cdot (3 \times 10^{8})^3 = 9.05 \times 10^{15} \cdot 2.7 \times 10^{24} = 2.4435 \times 10^{40}.
   \]  
   Compute the denominator \( 4 \hbar G k_B \):  
   \[
   4 \hbar G k_B = 4 \cdot (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (1.3806 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 3.885 \times 10^{-67}.
   \]  
   Finally, calculate \( S \):  
   \[
   S = \frac{2.4435 \times 10^{40}}{3.885 \times 10^{-67}} \approx 6.29 \times 10^{106} \, \text{J/K}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
The calculated entropy \( S \approx 6.29 \times 10^{106} \, \text{J/K} \) is far larger than any of the provided options (\( 10^{59}, 10^{62}, 10^{65}, 10^{66} \, \text{J/K} \)). This discrepancy suggests either an issue with the problem setup (e.g., incorrect distance or angular size) or a misinterpretation of the formula. However, based on the calculations, the closest order of magnitude to the computed result is \( 10^{107} \, \text{J/K} \), which is not listed among the options. Given the available choices, the most reasonable answer is **C) \( 10^{66} \, \text{J/K} \)**, though this does not match the derived value.

Answer: C
