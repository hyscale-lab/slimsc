Okay, so I have this physics problem about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state through two dipole transitions. I need to figure out which transition route is correct and what the corresponding probability is.

First, I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons. These transitions are governed by the selection rules. For dipole transitions, the selection rules are important. I think the dipole selection rules state that the angular momentum quantum number l can change by ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1. Oh wait, but wait, the principal quantum number n can change by any integer, but in practice, transitions are between adjacent levels because of energy considerations, but I'm not sure if that's a strict rule.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which has n=3, l=0 (s orbital), and m=0. It needs to decay to |1,0,0⟩, which has n=1, l=0, m=0. So, the process is two steps because you can't go from n=3 to n=1 in a single dipole transition. Let me check: in a dipole transition, Δn can be ±1. Wait, no, wait. I think the selection rule for n is that Δn can be any integer except 0, but usually, it's ±1 because higher changes require higher multipole moments. So for dipole (l=1), Δn can be ±1, ±2, but more accurately, the transition is allowed if the dipole matrix element is non-zero.

Wait, no, the standard dipole selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So for l, you can go from l to l±1. But for n, it's any allowed as long as l changes by ±1.

So, starting from n=3, l=0. To make a transition, l has to change to l=1, because l can't go to -1. So first step: from |3,0,0⟩ to a state with l=1.

Possible states after first transition would have l=1. So the possible states are |2,1, m⟩ or |4,1, m⟩, but since we're going to lower energy, probably to n=2 first.

Wait, but the decay is to |1,0,0⟩, which is a lower state. So maybe the first transition is from 3,0,0 to 2,1, m, and then from 2,1, m to 1,0,0.

So let me think about the possible m transitions. For the first transition, from m=0 to m can change by 0, ±1. So m can go to -1, 0, +1.

So possible first steps:
- |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩
- |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩
- |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩

Wait, but n can change by any amount as long as l changes by ±1. So from n=3, l=0, possible to go to l=1, so n can be 2 or 4? Because from n=3, you can go to n=2 (lower) or n=4 (higher). But since the overall energy is decreasing (from 3 to 1), perhaps it goes down in steps. So first to n=2, then to n=1.

So first transition from 3,0,0 → 2,1, m. Then, from 2,1, m → 1,0,0.

Wait, but from l=1 to l=0, that's a Δl of -1, which is allowed by dipole transitions. So yes, the second step is allowed.

Now, the options are about the possible routes. The options A, B, C, D give different transition paths and probabilities.

Let me look at the options.

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Option B: → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4.

Option C: → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4.

Option D: The first part isn't clear in the option description. Wait, looking again: D says |3,0,0> → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. So same path as A but different probability.

Hmm, so the question is about the correct transition paths and the probability.

Wait, but what determines the probability? The dipole matrix elements. The probability depends on the square of the matrix elements, which in turn depend on the angular parts. The matrix element for a transition from |n1, l1, m1⟩ to |n2, l2, m2⟩ is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the spherical harmonics integrals.

Alternatively, for hydrogen-like atoms, the transition probability can be determined by the selection rules and the possible m changes. Each allowed m transition contributes, and the total probability is the sum of the squares of these contributions.

Wait, for the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, m can be -1, 0, +1. But from |3,0,0⟩ (m=0) to |2,1,m⟩, the possible m changes are m = 0, 1, -1. So for each of these m transitions, there's a certain probability.

But wait, the matrix element for transition from m_initial to m_final is given by the integral of Y_{l', m'}* Y_{l, m_initial} Y_{1, Δm}, where Δm = m_final - m_initial. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the dipole operator has components along x, y, z, which correspond to m changes of 0, ±1.

Wait, the dipole operator is a vector, so it has three components: x, y, z. Each component has a matrix element for a specific m transition. The z-component (e.g., proportional to cosθ) would cause m to stay the same (Δm=0), while the x and y components can cause Δm=±1. So the transition probabilities for each m change are each proportional to some factors.

The total probability is the sum of the squares of each possible transition's amplitude. So for each allowed m, you calculate the amplitude, square it, and add them all.

But wait, in the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the initial m is 0. So the possible m's are -1, 0, +1.

The matrix element for the transition depends on the product of spherical harmonics. For the dipole operator, which has l=1, the matrix elements are non-zero only for Δm = 0, ±1.

So, the transition from m=0 to m'=1 will have a certain amplitude. Similarly for m'=0 and m'=-1.

The probability for each of these transitions would depend on the square of these matrix elements.

In the hydrogen atom, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the integral of Y_{1, m} Y_{l_initial}^* Y_{l_final}.

Wait, but for the initial state l=0 (s orbital), the spherical harmonic is Y_00. So when you transition to l=1, the integral becomes ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{00} Y_{1m'} dΩ. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, the dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1, m}, so the matrix element is ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{00} Y_{1m'} dΩ. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1, m} where m= -1, 0, +1. So when the initial state is l=0, the matrix element for each m is proportional to the integral of Y_{1m} Y_{00}.

Wait, but Y_{00} is a constant, so the integral of Y_{1m} Y_{00} is just the integral of Y_{1m}, which is zero because the integral of any spherical harmonic over all angles is zero (since they are orthonormal). Wait, that can't be right. Because for the dipole transition from l=0 to l=1, the matrix element would be non-zero because Y_{00} is spherically symmetric, and Y_{1m} has nodes that might allow some overlap.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the order. The dipole transition matrix element is:

⟨n', l', m' | e r | n, l, m⟩

Which is non-zero only if l' = l ± 1 (for dipole, l=1). So from l=0, l' must be 1.

But wait, the matrix element is also proportional to ∫ Y_{l'm'}^* Y_{1k} Y_{l m} dΩ, where k depends on the component of the dipole operator. For example, the x component might involve Y_{1,1} and Y_{1,-1}, while the z component is Y_{1,0}.

Wait, no, more accurately, the dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1m}(θ,φ). So when you compute the matrix element, it's ∫ Y_{l'm'}^* (e r Y_{1m}) Y_{l m} dΩ. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as:

⟨l', m' | r Y_{1m} | l, m ⟩

Which is non-zero only if l' = l ±1 and m' = m + m', where m is the m from the dipole component.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible m transitions.

The initial state is m=0. The dipole operator can cause transitions where m' = m + 0, +1, or -1. So the possible m' for the first transition are 0, +1, -1.

But the final state in the first transition has l=1, so m' can be -1, 0, +1. So each of those is a possibility.

Now, the probability for each of these transitions (to m'=+1, 0, or -1) is determined by the square of the matrix element for that m.

But wait, for the initial state l=0, m=0, and the dipole transition, the matrix element for each m' will be proportional to certain factors.

Wait, I think that when l=0 (s orbital), the only possible transition is to l'=1, and the m can change by 0, +1, or -1. But for l=0, the initial m is 0.

So, for the first transition, possible m' values are 0, +1, -1.

But what about the matrix elements for each m'? Since Y_{00} is isotropic, the transition probabilities for m' = +1 and m' = -1 might be the same, and perhaps m'=0 is different.

Wait, perhaps the matrix elements for m'=+1 and m'=-1 are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, but when squared, the probabilities are the same.

So, the first transition has three possible m' values, each contributing a certain probability.

Wait, but when you calculate the probability for each m', you need to compute the square of the matrix element for that m'.

So, the total probability for the first transition is the sum of the squares of all possible m' transitions.

Similarly, the second transition goes from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. So, in the second step, l goes from 1 to 0, so Δl = -1. So each of the m' states from the first transition can now transition to m=0.

But wait, from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, since the final state has m=0, the Δm for the second transition will be 0 - m.

So, for each m in the first transition, the second transition must have Δm = -m, because initial m is m, final m is 0. So Δm = -m.

But the dipole selection rules for Δm allow 0, ±1. So, for the second transition, -m must be 0, ±1. So m must be 0, ±1.

Wait, but in the first transition, m' can be 0, +1, -1. So for each of those m's, can they transition to m=0 in the second step?

Let me check:

If m'=0 in the first transition, then for the second transition, Δm=0-0=0 → allowed.

If m'=1, then Δm=0-1=-1 → allowed.

If m'=-1, then Δm=0-(-1)=+1 → allowed.

So all three possibilities from the first transition are allowed to transition to m=0 in the second step.

Wait, but does the second transition have the same selection rules? So for each of the first step's m', there's a possible transition to m=0.

So the overall process is a two-step transition, and the total probability is the sum over all possible paths.

So, the options suggest specific paths, each with a certain probability.

Looking back at the options:

A) 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0 and probability 1/3.

B) → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0, probability 1/4.

C) → 2,1,-1 → 1,0,0, probability 1/4.

D) → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0, probability 2/3.

Wait, but according to the possible paths, there are three possible first steps (m'=0, +1, -1), and each can lead to m=0 in the second step.

But the options only suggest single paths, not all possible paths. So perhaps each option represents a specific path, but the overall probability is the sum of the probabilities of each individual path.

Wait, so the problem says the transition happens via two dipole transitions. It's possible that the initial state decays through two steps, but the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability.

But the options are giving specific paths, each with a certain probability. So perhaps each option is considering a particular path, and we have to choose which path is possible with the given probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities in the options are the total probability for each path.

Wait, but for example, option A gives a path where both steps change m=0. So first transition m remains 0, then again m remains 0.

But let's think about the matrix elements in each step.

Let me think about the first transition: 3,0,0 → 2,1,m.

The matrix element for this transition is proportional to the integral of Y_{1m} Y_{00} Y_{2l’...} Wait, maybe I should think in terms of selection rules and possible m changes.

Wait, another approach: the total number of possible paths from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions is 3 possibilities because the first step can go to m=0, +1, -1, each of which can then go to 0 in the second step.

So each individual path's probability is the product of the probabilities of each step, and the total probability is the sum of all three path probabilities.

Alternatively, the given options are suggesting that each option is a possible path, but the probability is the total for that specific path.

Wait, perhaps each option's probability is the probability that the decay follows that exact two-step path.

So, for each path, the probability is the product of the first transition's probability and the second transition's probability.

So, let's consider each option:

Option A: Path is m=0 → m=0.

First transition: from m=0 to m=0. The matrix element for this is proportional to certain factors. The probability for this m=0 transition is (something), and then the second transition is from m=0 to m=0.

Similarly, for each option, compute the product.

But I'm not exactly sure about the exact probabilities for each m transition. But perhaps I can remember that for the dipole transitions, the m=0 component (z-axis) has a higher probability than the m=±1 components (x and y axes). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the dipole operator has components in x, y, and z directions. The z component (Y_{10}) is symmetric around the z-axis, while the x and y components (Y_{1, ±1}) are more directional. So, the matrix elements for transitions involving m=0 should be larger than those for m=±1. Because the integral of Y_{10} with Y_{00} is non-zero and possibly larger in magnitude.

Wait, but for the initial state |3,0,0⟩, which is Y_{00}, the dipole transition matrix elements are:

⟨2,1,m | e r |3,0,0⟩.

Which is proportional to ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{00} Y_{10} dΩ.

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing the operator.

The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1k}, where k is the component (like x, y, z). So for each component, the matrix element would involve integrating Y_{1k}^* Y_{00} Y_{l m}.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach is to use the selection rules and known transition probabilities.

In hydrogen, the transition probabilities are known, and for allowed transitions, the relative probabilities are determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, the transition from 3,0,0 → 2,1,m. The possible m's are -1, 0, +1. The probability for each m is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining m and m' to get m_final.

Wait, perhaps the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 (from dipole) to get l=1.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l1=0 and l2=1 to get l=1 and m.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, I remember that for the transition from l=0 to l=1, the allowed m_final are -1, 0, +1, and the relative probabilities for each m are in the ratio 1:2:1.

Wait, is that correct? Because the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the 0 and 1 to 1 state would determine the probabilities.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l1=0 and l2=1 to get l=1 and m:

For m=1: ⟨1,1 | 0,0⟩⟨1,1 | ...? Not exactly sure. Alternatively, the coefficients for the product Y_{00} Y_{1m} being expressed in terms of Y_{1m'}.

Wait, no, perhaps the product Y_{00} Y_{1m} can be expressed as a sum of Y_{l m} for l=0 and l=1, but since Y_{00} is a constant, multiplying by Y_{1m} gives Y_{1m} plus terms from l=0? No, because the product of Y_{l m} and Y_{l' m'} is a sum of Y_{l'' m''} where l'' can range from |l - l'| to l + l'.

So Y_{00} Y_{1m} = Y_{1m} (since Y_00 is 1/(sqrt(4π)) ), so when you multiply by Y_{1m}, you just get Y_{1m}.

But wait, when you compute the matrix element for transition from Y_{00} to Y_{1m}, it's the integral of Y_{1m}^* Y_{00} Y_{1m} (since the dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1m} part). Wait, perhaps that's not right. I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, I know that the transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which for the dipole operator is non-zero only for certain m changes. So for the first transition, the possible m's are 0, ±1, each contributing a certain probability.

If I assume that the probabilities for m=0, +1, -1 are 1, 2, 1 respectively, normalized to a total of 4 (sum 1+2+1=4), then the probabilities for each transition would be 1/4, 2/4=1/2, and 1/4.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, the transition probabilities for m=0, ±1 are equal because of symmetry. Wait, but that's not correct because the dipole operator's components are different.

Wait, another approach: the dipole operator has three components, each corresponding to m=0, +1, -1. The x and y components are similar, but the z component is different. So the matrix elements for m=0 would be different from those for m=±1.

But I'm not sure about the exact relative probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities for m=0, +1, -1 are equal, each 1/3. So the first transition's total probability is 1, and each m contributes 1/3.

Then, for the second transition, each of these m states would have a certain probability to transition to m=0.

For example, if the first transition's m=0 has a probability of 1/3, then in the second transition from m=0 to m=0, the probability would be 1, because from m=0, you can only transition to m=0 with Δm=0.

Wait, no. Because in the second step, the transition is from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, which requires m=0. So for the second step, the m must go from m=0 to 0, m=1 to -1, etc.

Wait, no, the second transition is from m to 0. So for each m in the first transition, the second transition's probability depends on m. For example, if the first step's m=1, then the second step's Δm= -1 (because final m=0), which is allowed.

But the probability for each second step would depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients again.

However, perhaps each second step has the same probability, regardless of the initial m. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities are the same for each possible path, leading to each path having an equal probability. So, there are three possible paths (m=0, m=1, m=-1), each with equal probability. So each has a 1/3 chance. But the options don't have any with 1/3 except option A and D.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option A: two-step path with m=0 each time, probability 1/3.

Option D: same path as A, but probability 2/3.

Wait, but if each path has a probability of 1/3, the total probability for all three paths would be 1. But the problem states that the decay occurs via two dipole transitions, so the total probability would be the sum of all possible paths. But the options are giving specific path probabilities, not total.

Wait, perhaps the given probabilities in the options are the total probabilities for each path, not considering others.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking which transition path is possible, and what is the probability of that specific path, not the total.

But the way the question is phrased is: "the transition route and the corresponding probability are".

Hmm, perhaps the correct transition path is the one that follows the selection rules, and the probability is determined by the product of the probabilities of each step.

So, let's say for each step, the transition from m=0 → m=0 has a certain probability, and then from m=0 → m=0 again. Or other m changes.

Alternatively, the first transition's probability for each m is known, and the second transition's probabilities depend on the first.

Let me try to think of it in terms of possible m transitions:

First transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩. The possible m are -1, 0, +1.

The probability for each m is proportional to (2l+1)δ_{l', l±1}, but I'm not sure about the exact factors.

Wait, perhaps the square of the matrix element for each m is given by:

|⟨2,1,m | e r |3,0,0⟩|² ∝ | ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{00} Y_{10} dΩ |².

Wait, Y_{00} is 1/(sqrt(4π)), and Y_{10} is sqrt(3/(4π)) * cosθ.

So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(4π)) * sqrt(3/(4π)) ∫ Y_{1m}^* cosθ dΩ.

But Y_{1m} are the spherical harmonics with l=1 and various m. Let's compute this integral for each m.

Wait, for m=0:

Y_{10} = sqrt(3/(4π)) cosθ.

So the integral becomes ∫ Y_{10}^* Y_{00} Y_{10} dΩ.

Which is ∫ Y_{10}^2 Y_{00} dΩ.

But Y_{10}^2 is proportional to cos²θ.

So ∫ Y_{10}^2 Y_{00} dΩ = ∫ (cos²θ) * (1/(4π)) * dΩ.

Which is (1/(4π)) ∫ cos²θ sinθ dθ dφ.

The integral over φ is from 0 to 2π, so gives 2π.

The integral over θ: ∫0^π cos²θ sinθ dθ.

Let u = cosθ, du = -sinθ dθ. The integral becomes ∫_{-1}^1 u² (-du) = ∫_{-1}^1 u² du = [u³/3] from -1 to 1 = (1/3 - (-1/3)) )= 2/3.

So total integral is (1/(4π)) * 2π * (2/3) )= (1/(4π)) * (4π/3) )= 1/3.

So the matrix element for m=0 is sqrt(1/3) times some constant.

For m=1 and m=-1, the integrals would be zero because Y_{1m} for m=1 or -1 involve sinθ terms which when multiplied by Y_{10} (cosθ) and Y_{00} (1) would integrate to zero.

Wait, wait, Y_{1m} for m=1 is proportional to sinθ e^{iφ}, and for m=-1, sinθ e^{-iφ}.

So when we take Y_{1m}^* Y_{10}, which is sinθ e^{-iφ} * cosθ.

The integral over φ would be ∫0^{2π} e^{-iφ} dφ = 0.

So for m=1 and m=-1, the integrals are zero. So the matrix elements for m=+1 and m=-1 are zero. Only m=0 contributes.

Wait, that can't be right because then the transition would only be possible for m=0, but that's not possible because dipole transitions should allow m changes of ±1 as well.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the selection of the dipole components.

Wait, the dipole operator has three components: x, y, z. Each corresponds to different spherical harmonic contributions.

- The z-component of the dipole is proportional to Y_{10}.

- The x and y components are proportional to Y_{11} and Y_{1,-1}.

So when considering the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the matrix elements involve each of these three components.

Wait, but the dipole operator is a vector, and each component can cause a transition with Δm = 0, +1, or -1.

So I think the correct approach is that each component of the dipole operator contributes to a specific Δm.

So, the transition amplitude for each m' is the sum of the contributions from each dipole component.

The matrix element for the dipole operator component Y_{1m_dip} would give a transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ where m = m_dip.

Because the initial m is 0, so the final m is m_dip.

So, the possible m_dip are -1, 0, +1.

Thus, the matrix element for each m' is proportional to the integral of Y_{2,1,m'}^* Y_{1,m_dip} Y_{3,0,0}.

Wait, perhaps it's simpler. The transition amplitude for each m' is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining the dipole component m_dip with the initial m=0 to get the final m'.

So the amplitude is proportional to CG coefficients.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l1=1 (dipole) and l2=0 (initial state) to get l=1 and m.

Wait, no, the initial state has l=0, m=0. The dipole operator has l=1, m=m_dip.

So the matrix element is proportional to the product of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨ l_final, m | l_dip, m_dip; l_initial, m_initial ⟩.

Since l_initial=0, m_initial=0, this simplifies to ⟨1, m | 1, m_dip; 0, 0⟩ = ⟨1, m | 1, m_dip⟩.

Which is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining (1, m_dip) and (0,0) to get (1, m).

But since (0,0) doesn't change the m, this coefficient is just ⟨1, m | 1, m_dip ⟩.

But wait, when combining two angular momenta, l1=1 and l2=0, the resulting l is 1, and m = m1 + m2.

So, for the initial state m=0, and dipole m_dip, the final m is m_dip.

Which implies that the transition will have m' = m_dip.

So, for each dipole component m_dip = -1, 0, +1, the transition will result in m' = m_dip.

Thus, the matrix element is non-zero only when m' is equal to m_dip.

So, the transition amplitude for m'=0 is proportional to the dipole's m_dip=0 component.

Similarly, for m'=+1, it's the dipole's m_dip=+1 component, and m'=-1 is dipole's m_dip=-1.

So, the matrix element for each m' is proportional to the corresponding dipole component.

The probability for each m' is the square of the amplitude.

Now, the dipole operator's components (x, y, z) have different normalization factors.

The z-component (Y_{10}) has a different normalization than the x and y components (Y_{1, ±1}).

In terms of their overlap with other states, the z-component might have a larger matrix element than the x and y components.

Wait, but let me think about the actual values. The spherical harmonic Y_{10} is sqrt(3/(4π)) cosθ.

Y_{1,1} is -sqrt(3/(8π)) e^{iφ} sinθ.

Y_{1,-1} is sqrt(3/(8π)) e^{-iφ} sinθ.

So when you compute the matrix element for the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the amplitude for each m is proportional to the integral of Y_{21m}^* Y_{1m_dip} Y_{300}.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the relative probabilities for m'=0, +1, -1 are 1:1:1, meaning each has a probability of 1/3.

But wait, earlier I thought that for m=1 and m=-1, the integrals were zero, but that can't be correct because that would imply only m=0 is allowed, which contradicts the selection rules.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial integral approach. Let me think again.

In the first transition, the transition occurs via the dipole operator, which has three components. Each component contributes to a specific m change.

The operator is r Y_{1m}, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the matrix element for each m' is proportional to the integral of Y_{1m'} Y_{00} Y_{1m}.

Wait, no, it's the integral of Y_{1m'}^* Y_{00} Y_{1m}.

Wait, Y_{00} is 1/sqrt(4π). Y_{1m} is as before.

So for the first transition:

When m_dip (the dipole component) is 0, the integral is ∫ Y_{10}^* Y_{00} Y_{10} dΩ.

Which is ∫ (sqrt(3/(4π)) cosθ )^* (1/sqrt(4π)) (sqrt(3/(4π)) cosθ ) dΩ.

Which simplifies to (3/(4π)) ∫ cos²θ sinθ dθ dφ.

As before, the φ integral gives 2π, θ integral gives 2/3. So the integral is (3/(4π)) * 2π * (2/3) )= (3/(4π)) * (4π/3) )= 1.

So the amplitude for m'=0 is 1 * some constant.

For m_dip=1, the integral is ∫ Y_{11}^* Y_{00} Y_{11} dΩ.

Which is ∫ [ -sqrt(3/(8π)) e^{-iφ} sinθ ]^* [1/sqrt(4π)] [ -sqrt(3/(8π)) e^{iφ} sinθ ] dΩ.

Simplifying, it's [3/(8π)] * ∫ sin²θ dΩ.

Because the exponentials cancel: e^{-iφ} * e^{iφ} =1.

The integral over φ is 2π, and the integral over θ is ∫0^π sin²θ sinθ dθ = ∫0^π sin^3θ dθ.

Let u = cosθ, du = -sinθ dθ.

The integral becomes ∫_{-1}^1 (1 - u²) (-du) )= ∫_{-1}^1 (1 - u²) du = [u - u³/3] from -1 to 1.

At 1: 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.

At -1: (-1) - (-1)^3/3 = (-1) - (-1/3) = (-2/3).

So difference is 2/3 - (-2/3) = 4/3.

So the integral becomes [3/(8π)] * (4/3) * 2π )= [3/(8π)] * (8π/3) )= 1.

So the amplitude for m'=1 is 1 * some constant.

Similarly, for m_dip=-1, the integral should be the same as for m_dip=1, because the complex conjugate would make it real and positive.

So the amplitude for m'=-1 is also 1 * some constant.

Wait, but that can't be correct because the dipole operator has different components, so the probabilities shouldn't be the same for all m'.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some factors. Let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps the normalization constants are different for Y_{1m}.

Y_{10} is sqrt(3/(4π)) cosθ.

Y_{11} is -sqrt(3/(8π)) e^{iφ} sinθ.

Y_{1-1} is sqrt(3/(8π)) e^{-iφ} sinθ.

So when I compute the integral for m_dip=1 (Y_{11}):

Amplitude = ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{00} Y_{11} dΩ.

Wait, but Y_{00} is 1/sqrt(4π), so:

Amplitude = (1/sqrt(4π)) * ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{11} dΩ.

Wait, no, that's not right. It should be:

Amplitude = ∫ Y_{1m'}^* (Y_{00}) (Y_{11}) dΩ.

Which is ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{00} Y_{11} dΩ.

But Y_{00} is 1/sqrt(4π), so:

Amplitude = (1/sqrt(4π)) ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{11} dΩ.

The integral ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{11} dΩ is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which is zero unless m' + 1 = 0 → m' = -1.

Wait, no, that's for combining angular momenta. Alternatively, the integral of Y_{l1 m1} Y_{l2 m2} Y_{l3 m3} is non-zero only when certain conditions are met, like m1 + m2 = m3, and |l1 - l2| ≤ l3 ≤ l1 + l2.

In this case, Y_{1m'}^* Y_{11} is being integrated, so l1=1, m1=m', and l2=1, m2=1.

The product Y_{1m'} Y_{11} can be expressed as a sum over Y_{l m}, where l can be 2 or 0. Because 1 +1 =2, and |1-1|=0.

So the integral ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{11} dΩ is non-zero only when l=0 or l=2.

But when you multiply Y_{1m'} and Y_{11}, the product includes terms with l=0 (only if m' +1 =0 → m' = -1).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the integral is non-zero only when m' = -1.

So for m'= -1, the integral is non-zero. For other m's, it's zero.

Wait, but earlier I thought for m_dip=1, the integral for m'=1 was non-zero, but according to this, it's only non-zero when m'= -1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the m's.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The dipole operator's x and y components (which correspond to m=±1) will cause transitions where the initial m=0 changes by ±1. So the first transition can go to m=+1 or m=-1.

But wait, according to the integral I did earlier for m_dip=1, the integral was non-zero because the product of Y_{11} and Y_{00} led to a non-zero result. But I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's best to refer to a standard result.

In hydrogen, the transition probability for a dipole transition from l=0 to l=1 is allowed for m changes of 0, ±1, and the relative probabilities are proportional to 1:2:1.

Wait, I think that the transition probabilities for m=0, +1, -1 are in the ratio 1:2:1. So the probabilities are 1/4, 2/4=1/2, and 1/4.

So the first transition would have probabilities:

m=0 → 1/4,

m=+1 → 1/2,

m=-1 → 1/4.

Wait, why?

Because when you have three possible m transitions, and the probabilities are proportional to the squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which for combining l=0 (m=0) and l=1 (m_dip) to get l=1 (m'):

The CG coefficients for m=0, m=+1, m=-1 are 1, sqrt(2), and 1 respectively, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, the CG coefficients for combining (l1=1, m1) and (l2=0, m2=0) to get (l=1, m').

The CG coefficients are:

⟨1, m' | 1, m1; 0, 0⟩.

Which is non-zero only when m' = m1.

So, m' can be -1, 0, +1.

The CG coefficients for these are:

For m'= -1: sqrt( (1 - 0)(1 + 1 + 1) )/(something) ) Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, the CG coefficients can be found from the formula.

The CG coefficient for adding two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get l and m is given by:

⟨ l, m | l1, m1; l2, m2 ⟩ 

Which is zero unless m = m1 + m2 and |l1 - l2| ≤ l ≤ l1 + l2.

In our case, l2=0, so m2=0. So m = m1.

And l must be |1-0|=1 ≤ l ≤ 1+0=1 → l=1.

So the CG coefficient is ⟨1, m | 1, m; 0, 0 ⟩.

Which is 1 for all m, because when l2=0, the state is just the same as l1.

Wait, that's probably correct. So the amplitude for each m' is 1. So the probability for each m' is 1^2 / (number of possible m's).

Wait, but that would give equal probability for each m', which would be 1/3 each.

But that contradicts earlier thoughts.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitudes are proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two angular momenta.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find a different approach.

If the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ has possible m values of -1, 0, +1, and the probabilities are proportional to (2l+1) for each m, then perhaps the probabilities are 1:2:1.

Wait, the selection rule for dipole transitions says that the transition is allowed when Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.

But the relative probabilities depend on the matrix element squared.

In hydrogen, the transition probability from n1, l1, m1 to n2, l2, m2 is proportional to (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) |⟨ l2 m2 | Y_{1 m_dip} | l1 m1⟩ |^2.

But I'm not sure about the exact expression.

Alternatively, for the first transition, the possible m are 0, ±1, and the probability for each is 1/3, leading to the second transition probabilities.

But given the confusion, perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the options and known physics.

From the options, the only possible correct path is one that goes through m=0 in both steps because that's the only way to get from m=0 → m=0 in two steps.

Wait, but in reality, the first transition could involve m=0 and the second transition must have m=0 as well. So the path in option A is possible.

But another thought: the initial state |3,0,0⟩ has m=0. For the first transition, it can go to m=0, +1, or -1.

But for the second transition to reach m=0 in the final state, the m must change by the opposite of the initial change.

So, for example, if the first step goes to m=+1, the second step must go to m= -1 to reach m=0. But wait, the final state is |1,0,0⟩, which has m=0.

So each step's m change must sum to zero.

So, for each possible first m, the second step's m change is -m.

Thus, for the first step m1, the second step must have m2 = 0 - m1.

But since the second step's dipole transition can only change m by 0, ±1, this requires that -m1 is 0, ±1.

Which is only possible if m1 is 0, ±1.

So, all three paths are possible.

But the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability.

Looking at the options, only options A, B, C, D have specific paths, but the correct answer must include the path that is possible.

Wait, but the correct answer is option A: |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Because, after the first transition to m=0, the second transition can only go to m=0, as this is required for the final state.

But earlier, I thought that the first transition's m=0 has a probability of 1/3, and the second step's m=0 has a probability of 1, leading to a total for this path of 1/3 * 1 = 1/3.

Alternatively, if the first transition's m=0 has a probability of 1/3, and the second transition's m=0 has a probability of 1, the path's total probability is 1/3.

So option A would have a probability of 1/3.

Similarly, the other paths would have their own probabilities.

But since the question is about the correct transition route and the corresponding probability, perhaps the correct answer is option A, with probability 1/3.

Wait, but wait: another thought. The first transition's m=0 may have a higher probability than the others. If the first transition's m=0 has a higher probability, say 1/2, then the second step would have a probability of 1, leading to a total for this path of 1/2.

But looking at the options, option D has the same path as option A but with probability 2/3.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two-step process's probability is the sum of the probabilities of all possible paths. But the options are giving only specific paths, so the correct path must be the one that's possible, with the given probability.

After considering all this, I think the correct answer is option A, which has the path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The selection rules for dipole transitions dictate that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ has n=3, l=0, and m=0, while the final state |1,0,0⟩ has n=1, l=0, and m=0. Since the transition occurs in two steps, the intermediate state must have l=1 (Δl = -1 for the second transition).

### Key Analysis:
1. **First Transition**:  
   The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (l=0, m=0) transitions to an intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ (l=1, m=-1, 0, +1). The possible m values after the first transition are -1, 0, +1. The probabilities for these transitions are proportional to the square of the dipole matrix elements, which depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The relative probabilities for m=-1, 0, +1 are in the ratio **1:2:1**, corresponding to probabilities **1/4, 1/2, 1/4**, respectively.

2. **Second Transition**:  
   The intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ transitions to the final state |1,0,0⟩ (l=0, m=0). For this to occur, the m value of the intermediate state must change by Δm = -m to reach m=0 in the final state. This is allowed by the selection rules for dipole transitions.

3. **Path Probabilities**:  
   Each possible path corresponds to a specific sequence of m values in the two transitions. The total probability for a path is the product of the probabilities of each step. For example:
   - Path A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩  
     Probability = (1/3) × 1 = **1/3** (assuming equal probabilities for m=0 in the first step).
   - Path B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩  
     Probability = (1/4) × 1 = **1/4**.
   - Path C: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩  
     Probability = (1/4) × 1 = **1/4**.
   - Path D: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩  
     Probability = (2/3) × 1 = **2/3**.

4. **Correct Path and Probability**:  
   The correct path must satisfy the selection rules and have the correct probability. Among the options, **Path A** is valid and has a probability of **1/3**, consistent with the selection rules and the relative probabilities of the transitions.

### Conclusion:
The correct transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, with a probability of **1/3**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state through two dipole transitions. I need to figure out which transition route is correct and what the corresponding probability is.

First, I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons. These transitions are governed by the selection rules. For dipole transitions, the selection rules are important. I think the dipole selection rules state that the angular momentum quantum number l can change by ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1. Oh wait, but wait, the principal quantum number n can change by any integer, but in practice, transitions are between adjacent levels because of energy considerations, but I'm not sure if that's a strict rule.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which has n=3, l=0 (s orbital), and m=0. It needs to decay to |1,0,0⟩, which has n=1, l=0, m=0. So, the process is two steps because you can't go from n=3 to n=1 in a single dipole transition. Let me check: in a dipole transition, Δn can be ±1. Wait, no, wait. I think the selection rule for n is that Δn can be any integer except 0, but usually, it's ±1 because higher changes require higher multipole moments. So for dipole (l=1), Δn can be ±1, ±2, but more accurately, the transition is allowed if the dipole matrix element is non-zero.

Wait, no, the standard dipole selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So for l, you can go from l to l±1. But for n, it's any allowed as long as l changes by ±1.

So, starting from n=3, l=0. To make a transition, l has to change to l=1, because l can't go to -1. So first step: from |3,0,0⟩ to a state with l=1.

Possible states after first transition would have l=1. So the possible states are |2,1, m⟩ or |4,1, m⟩, but since we're going to lower energy, probably to n=2 first.

Wait, but the decay is to |1,0,0⟩, which is a lower state. So maybe the first transition is from 3,0,0 to 2,1, m, and then from 2,1, m to 1,0,0.

So let me think about the possible m transitions. For the first transition, from m=0 to m can change by 0, ±1. So m can go to -1, 0, +1.

So possible first steps:
- |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩
- |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩
- |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩

Wait, but n can change by any amount as long as l changes by ±1. So from n=3, l=0, possible to go to l=1, so n can be 2 or 4? Because from n=3, you can go to n=2 (lower) or n=4 (higher). But since the overall energy is decreasing (from 3 to 1), perhaps it goes down in steps. So first to n=2, then to n=1.

So first transition from 3,0,0 → 2,1, m. Then, from 2,1, m → 1,0,0.

Wait, but from l=1 to l=0, that's a Δl of -1, which is allowed by dipole transitions. So yes, the second step is allowed.

Now, the options are about the possible routes. The options A, B, C, D give different transition paths and probabilities.

Let me look at the options.

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Option B: → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4.

Option C: → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4.

Option D: The first part isn't clear in the option description. Wait, looking again: D says |3,0,0> → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. So same path as A but different probability.

Hmm, so the question is about the correct transition paths and the probability.

Wait, but what determines the probability? The dipole matrix elements. The probability depends on the square of the matrix elements, which in turn depend on the angular parts. The matrix element for a transition from |n1, l1, m1⟩ to |n2, l2, m2⟩ is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the spherical harmonics integrals.

Alternatively, for hydrogen-like atoms, the transition probability can be determined by the selection rules and the possible m changes. Each allowed m transition contributes, and the total probability is the sum of the squares of these contributions.

Wait, for the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, m can be -1, 0, +1. But from |3,0,0⟩ (m=0) to |2,1,m⟩, the possible m changes are m = 0, 1, -1. So for each of these m transitions, there's a certain probability.

But wait, the matrix element for transition from m_initial to m_final is given by the integral of Y_{l', m'}* Y_{l, m_initial} Y_{1, Δm}, where Δm = m_final - m_initial. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the dipole operator has components along x, y, z, which correspond to m changes of 0, ±1.

Wait, the dipole operator is a vector, so it has three components: x, y, z. Each component has a matrix element for a specific m transition. The z-component (e.g., proportional to cosθ) would cause m to stay the same (Δm=0), while the x and y components can cause Δm=±1. So the transition probabilities for each m change are each proportional to some factors.

The total probability is the sum of the squares of each possible transition's amplitude. So for each allowed m, you calculate the amplitude, square it, and add them all.

But wait, in the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the initial m is 0. So the possible m's are -1, 0, +1.

The matrix element for the transition depends on the product of spherical harmonics. For the dipole operator, which has l=1, the matrix elements are non-zero only for Δm = 0, ±1.

So, the transition from m=0 to m'=1 will have a certain amplitude. Similarly for m'=0 and m'=-1.

The probability for each of these transitions would depend on the square of these matrix elements.

In the hydrogen atom, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the integral of Y_{1, m} Y_{l_initial}^* Y_{l_final}.

Wait, but for the initial state l=0 (s orbital), the spherical harmonic is Y_00. So when you transition to l=1, the integral becomes ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{00} Y_{1m'} dΩ. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, the dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1, m}, so the matrix element is ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{00} Y_{1m'} dΩ. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1, m} where m= -1, 0, +1. So when the initial state is l=0, the matrix element for each m is proportional to the integral of Y_{1m} Y_{00}.

Wait, but Y_{00} is a constant, so the integral of Y_{1m} Y_{00} is just the integral of Y_{1m}, which is zero because the integral of any spherical harmonic over all angles is zero (since they are orthonormal). Wait, that can't be right. Because for the dipole transition from l=0 to l=1, the matrix element would be non-zero because Y_{00} is spherically symmetric, and Y_{1m} has nodes that might allow some overlap.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the order. The dipole transition matrix element is:

⟨n', l', m' | e r | n, l, m⟩

Which is non-zero only if l' = l ± 1 (for dipole, l=1). So from l=0, l' must be 1.

But wait, the matrix element is also proportional to ∫ Y_{l'm'}^* Y_{1k} Y_{l m} dΩ, where k depends on the component of the dipole operator. For example, the x component might involve Y_{1,1} and Y_{1,-1}, while the z component is Y_{1,0}.

Wait, no, more accurately, the dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1m}(θ,φ). So when you compute the matrix element, it's ∫ Y_{l'm'}^* (e r Y_{1m}) Y_{l m} dΩ. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as:

⟨l', m' | r Y_{1m} | l, m ⟩

Which is non-zero only if l' = l ±1 and m' = m + m', where m is the m from the dipole component.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible m transitions.

The initial state is m=0. The dipole operator can cause transitions where m' = m + 0, +1, or -1. So the possible m' for the first transition are 0, +1, -1.

But the final state in the first transition has l=1, so m' can be -1, 0, +1. So each of those is a possibility.

Now, the probability for each of these transitions (to m'=+1, 0, or -1) is determined by the square of the matrix element for that m.

But wait, for the initial state l=0, m=0, and the dipole transition, the matrix element for each m' will be proportional to certain factors.

Wait, I think that when l=0 (s orbital), the only possible transition is to l'=1, and the m can change by 0, +1, or -1. But for l=0, the initial m is 0.

So, for the first transition, possible m' values are 0, +1, -1.

But what about the matrix elements for each m'? Since Y_{00} is isotropic, the transition probabilities for m' = +1 and m' = -1 might be the same, and perhaps m'=0 is different.

Wait, perhaps the matrix elements for m'=+1 and m'=-1 are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, but when squared, the probabilities are the same.

So, the first transition has three possible m' values, each contributing a certain probability.

Wait, but when you calculate the probability for each m', you need to compute the square of the matrix element for that m'.

So, the total probability for the first transition is the sum of the squares of all possible m' transitions.

Similarly, the second transition goes from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. So, in the second step, l goes from 1 to 0, so Δl = -1. So each of the m' states from the first transition can now transition to m=0.

But wait, from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, since the final state has m=0, the Δm for the second transition will be 0 - m.

So, for each m in the first transition, the second transition must have Δm = -m, because initial m is m, final m is 0. So Δm = -m.

But the dipole selection rules for Δm allow 0, ±1. So, for the second transition, -m must be 0, ±1. So m must be 0, ±1.

Wait, but in the first transition, m' can be 0, +1, -1. So for each of those m's, can they transition to m=0 in the second step?

Let me check:

If m'=0 in the first transition, then for the second transition, Δm=0-0=0 → allowed.

If m'=1, then Δm=0-1=-1 → allowed.

If m'=-1, then Δm=0-(-1)=+1 → allowed.

So all three possibilities from the first transition are allowed to transition to m=0 in the second step.

Wait, but does the second transition have the same selection rules? So for each of the first step's m', there's a possible transition to m=0.

So the overall process is a two-step transition, and the total probability is the sum over all possible paths.

So, the options suggest specific paths, each with a certain probability.

Looking back at the options:

A) 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0 and probability 1/3.

B) → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0, probability 1/4.

C) → 2,1,-1 → 1,0,0, probability 1/4.

D) → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0, probability 2/3.

Wait, but according to the possible paths, there are three possible first steps (m'=0, +1, -1), and each can lead to m=0 in the second step.

But the options only suggest single paths, not all possible paths. So perhaps each option represents a specific path, but the overall probability is the sum of the probabilities of each individual path.

Wait, so the problem says the transition happens via two dipole transitions. It's possible that the initial state decays through two steps, but the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability.

But the options are giving specific paths, each with a certain probability. So perhaps each option is considering a particular path, and we have to choose which path is possible with the given probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities in the options are the total probability for each path.

Wait, but for example, option A gives a path where both steps change m=0. So first transition m remains 0, then again m remains 0.

But let's think about the matrix elements in each step.

Let me think about the first transition: 3,0,0 → 2,1,m.

The matrix element for this transition is proportional to the integral of Y_{1m} Y_{00} Y_{2l’...} Wait, maybe I should think in terms of selection rules and possible m changes.

Wait, another approach: the total number of possible paths from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions is 3 possibilities because the first step can go to m=0, +1, -1, each of which can then go to 0 in the second step.

So each individual path's probability is the product of the probabilities of each step, and the total probability is the sum of all three path probabilities.

Alternatively, the given options are suggesting that each option is a possible path, but the probability is the total for that specific path.

Wait, perhaps each option's probability is the probability that the decay follows that exact two-step path.

So, for each path, the probability is the product of the first transition's probability and the second transition's probability.

So, let's consider each option:

Option A: Path is m=0 → m=0.

First transition: from m=0 to m=0. The matrix element for this is proportional to certain factors. The probability for this m=0 transition is (something), and then the second transition is from m=0 to m=0.

Similarly, for each option, compute the product.

But I'm not exactly sure about the exact probabilities for each m transition. But perhaps I can remember that for the dipole transitions, the m=0 component (z-axis) has a higher probability than the m=±1 components (x and y axes). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the dipole operator has components in x, y, and z directions. The z component (Y_{10}) is symmetric around the z-axis, while the x and y components (Y_{1, ±1}) are more directional. So, the matrix elements for transitions involving m=0 should be larger than those for m=±1. Because the integral of Y_{10} with Y_{00} is non-zero and possibly larger in magnitude.

Wait, but for the initial state |3,0,0⟩, which is Y_{00}, the dipole transition matrix elements are:

⟨2,1,m | e r |3,0,0⟩.

Which is proportional to ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{00} Y_{10} dΩ.

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing the operator.

The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1k}, where k is the component (like x, y, z). So for each component, the matrix element would involve integrating Y_{1k}^* Y_{00} Y_{l m}.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach is to use the selection rules and known transition probabilities.

In hydrogen, the transition probabilities are known, and for allowed transitions, the relative probabilities are determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, the transition from 3,0,0 → 2,1,m. The possible m's are -1, 0, +1. The probability for each m is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining m and m' to get m_final.

Wait, perhaps the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 (from dipole) to get l=1.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l1=0 and l2=1 to get l=1 and m.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, I remember that for the transition from l=0 to l=1, the allowed m_final are -1, 0, +1, and the relative probabilities for each m are in the ratio 1:2:1.

Wait, is that correct? Because the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the 0 and 1 to 1 state would determine the probabilities.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l1=0 and l2=1 to get l=1 and m:

For m=1: ⟨1,1 | 0,0⟩⟨1,1 | ...? Not exactly sure. Alternatively, the coefficients for the product Y_{00} Y_{1m} being expressed in terms of Y_{1m'}.

Wait, no, perhaps the product Y_{00} Y_{1m} can be expressed as a sum of Y_{l m} for l=0 and l=1, but since Y_{00} is a constant, multiplying by Y_{1m} gives Y_{1m} plus terms from l=0? No, because the product of Y_{l m} and Y_{l' m'} is a sum of Y_{l'' m''} where l'' can range from |l - l'| to l + l'.

So Y_{00} Y_{1m} = Y_{1m} (since Y_00 is 1/(sqrt(4π)) ), so when you multiply by Y_{1m}, you just get Y_{1m}.

But wait, when you compute the matrix element for transition from Y_{00} to Y_{1m}, it's the integral of Y_{1m}^* Y_{00} Y_{1m} (since the dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1m} part). Wait, perhaps that's not right. I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, I know that the transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which for the dipole operator is non-zero only for certain m changes. So for the first transition, the possible m's are 0, ±1, each contributing a certain probability.

If I assume that the probabilities for m=0, +1, -1 are 1, 2, 1 respectively, normalized to a total of 4 (sum 1+2+1=4), then the probabilities for each transition would be 1/4, 2/4=1/2, and 1/4.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, the transition probabilities for m=0, ±1 are equal because of symmetry. Wait, but that's not correct because the dipole operator's components are different.

Wait, another approach: the dipole operator has three components, each corresponding to m=0, +1, -1. The x and y components are similar, but the z component is different. So the matrix elements for m=0 would be different from those for m=±1.

But I'm not sure about the exact relative probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities for m=0, +1, -1 are equal, each 1/3. So the first transition's total probability is 1, and each m contributes 1/3.

Then, for the second transition, each of these m states would have a certain probability to transition to m=0.

For example, if the first transition's m=0 has a probability of 1/3, then in the second transition from m=0 to m=0, the probability would be 1, because from m=0, you can only transition to m=0 with Δm=0.

Wait, no. Because in the second step, the transition is from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, which requires m=0. So for the second step, the m must go from m=0 to 0, m=1 to -1, etc.

Wait, no, the second transition is from m to 0. So for each m in the first transition, the second transition's probability depends on m. For example, if the first step's m=1, then the second step's Δm= -1 (because final m=0), which is allowed.

But the probability for each second step would depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients again.

However, perhaps each second step has the same probability, regardless of the initial m. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities are the same for each possible path, leading to each path having an equal probability. So, there are three possible paths (m=0, m=1, m=-1), each with equal probability. So each has a 1/3 chance. But the options don't have any with 1/3 except option A and D.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option A: two-step path with m=0 each time, probability 1/3.

Option D: same path as A, but probability 2/3.

Wait, but if each path has a probability of 1/3, the total probability for all three paths would be 1. But the problem states that the decay occurs via two dipole transitions, so the total probability would be the sum of all possible paths. But the options are giving specific path probabilities, not total.

Wait, perhaps the given probabilities in the options are the total probabilities for each path, not considering others.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking which transition path is possible, and what is the probability of that specific path, not the total.

But the way the question is phrased is: "the transition route and the corresponding probability are".

Hmm, perhaps the correct transition path is the one that follows the selection rules, and the probability is determined by the product of the probabilities of each step.

So, let's say for each step, the transition from m=0 → m=0 has a certain probability, and then from m=0 → m=0 again. Or other m changes.

Alternatively, the first transition's probability for each m is known, and the second transition's probabilities depend on the first.

Let me try to think of it in terms of possible m transitions:

First transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩. The possible m are -1, 0, +1.

The probability for each m is proportional to (2l+1)δ_{l', l±1}, but I'm not sure about the exact factors.

Wait, perhaps the square of the matrix element for each m is given by:

|⟨2,1,m | e r |3,0,0⟩|² ∝ | ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{00} Y_{10} dΩ |².

Wait, Y_{00} is 1/(sqrt(4π)), and Y_{10} is sqrt(3/(4π)) * cosθ.

So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(4π)) * sqrt(3/(4π)) ∫ Y_{1m}^* cosθ dΩ.

But Y_{1m} are the spherical harmonics with l=1 and various m. Let's compute this integral for each m.

Wait, for m=0:

Y_{10} = sqrt(3/(4π)) cosθ.

So the integral becomes ∫ Y_{10}^* Y_{00} Y_{10} dΩ.

Which is ∫ Y_{10}^2 Y_{00} dΩ.

But Y_{10}^2 is proportional to cos²θ.

So ∫ Y_{10}^2 Y_{00} dΩ = ∫ (cos²θ) * (1/(4π)) * dΩ.

Which is (1/(4π)) ∫ cos²θ sinθ dθ dφ.

The integral over φ is from 0 to 2π, so gives 2π.

The integral over θ: ∫0^π cos²θ sinθ dθ.

Let u = cosθ, du = -sinθ dθ. The integral becomes ∫_{-1}^1 u² (-du) = ∫_{-1}^1 u² du = [u³/3] from -1 to 1 = (1/3 - (-1/3)) )= 2/3.

So total integral is (1/(4π)) * 2π * (2/3) )= (1/(4π)) * (4π/3) )= 1/3.

So the matrix element for m=0 is sqrt(1/3) times some constant.

For m=1 and m=-1, the integrals would be zero because Y_{1m} for m=1 or -1 involve sinθ terms which when multiplied by Y_{10} (cosθ) and Y_{00} (1) would integrate to zero.

Wait, wait, Y_{1m} for m=1 is proportional to sinθ e^{iφ}, and for m=-1, sinθ e^{-iφ}.

So when we take Y_{1m}^* Y_{10}, which is sinθ e^{-iφ} * cosθ.

The integral over φ would be ∫0^{2π} e^{-iφ} dφ = 0.

So for m=1 and m=-1, the integrals are zero. So the matrix elements for m=+1 and m=-1 are zero. Only m=0 contributes.

Wait, that can't be right because then the transition would only be possible for m=0, but that's not possible because dipole transitions should allow m changes of ±1 as well.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the selection of the dipole components.

Wait, the dipole operator has three components: x, y, z. Each corresponds to different spherical harmonic contributions.

- The z-component of the dipole is proportional to Y_{10}.

- The x and y components are proportional to Y_{11} and Y_{1,-1}.

So when considering the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the matrix elements involve each of these three components.

Wait, but the dipole operator is a vector, and each component can cause a transition with Δm = 0, +1, or -1.

So I think the correct approach is that each component of the dipole operator contributes to a specific Δm.

So, the transition amplitude for each m' is the sum of the contributions from each dipole component.

The matrix element for the dipole operator component Y_{1m_dip} would give a transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ where m = m_dip.

Because the initial m is 0, so the final m is m_dip.

So, the possible m_dip are -1, 0, +1.

Thus, the matrix element for each m' is proportional to the integral of Y_{2,1,m'}^* Y_{1,m_dip} Y_{3,0,0}.

Wait, perhaps it's simpler. The transition amplitude for each m' is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining the dipole component m_dip with the initial m=0 to get the final m'.

So the amplitude is proportional to CG coefficients.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l1=1 (dipole) and l2=0 (initial state) to get l=1 and m.

Wait, no, the initial state has l=0, m=0. The dipole operator has l=1, m=m_dip.

So the matrix element is proportional to the product of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨ l_final, m | l_dip, m_dip; l_initial, m_initial ⟩.

Since l_initial=0, m_initial=0, this simplifies to ⟨1, m | 1, m_dip; 0, 0⟩ = ⟨1, m | 1, m_dip⟩.

Which is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining (1, m_dip) and (0,0) to get (1, m).

But since (0,0) doesn't change the m, this coefficient is just ⟨1, m | 1, m_dip ⟩.

But wait, when combining two angular momenta, l1=1 and l2=0, the resulting l is 1, and m = m1 + m2.

So, for the initial state m=0, and dipole m_dip, the final m is m_dip.

Which implies that the transition will have m' = m_dip.

So, for each dipole component m_dip = -1, 0, +1, the transition will result in m' = m_dip.

Thus, the matrix element is non-zero only when m' is equal to m_dip.

So, the transition amplitude for m'=0 is proportional to the dipole's m_dip=0 component.

Similarly, for m'=+1, it's the dipole's m_dip=+1 component, and m'=-1 is dipole's m_dip=-1.

So, the matrix element for each m' is proportional to the corresponding dipole component.

The probability for each m' is the square of the amplitude.

Now, the dipole operator's components (x, y, z) have different normalization factors.

The z-component (Y_{10}) has a different normalization than the x and y components (Y_{1, ±1}).

In terms of their overlap with other states, the z-component might have a larger matrix element than the x and y components.

Wait, but let me think about the actual values. The spherical harmonic Y_{10} is sqrt(3/(4π)) cosθ.

Y_{1,1} is -sqrt(3/(8π)) e^{iφ} sinθ.

Y_{1,-1} is sqrt(3/(8π)) e^{-iφ} sinθ.

So when you compute the matrix element for the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the amplitude for each m is proportional to the integral of Y_{21m}^* Y_{1m_dip} Y_{300}.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the relative probabilities for m'=0, +1, -1 are 1:1:1, meaning each has a probability of 1/3.

But wait, earlier I thought that for m=1 and m=-1, the integrals were zero, but that can't be correct because that would imply only m=0 is allowed, which contradicts the selection rules.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial integral approach. Let me think again.

In the first transition, the transition occurs via the dipole operator, which has three components. Each component contributes to a specific m change.

The operator is r Y_{1m}, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the matrix element for each m' is proportional to the integral of Y_{1m'} Y_{00} Y_{1m}.

Wait, no, it's the integral of Y_{1m'}^* Y_{00} Y_{1m}.

Wait, Y_{00} is 1/sqrt(4π). Y_{1m} is as before.

So for the first transition:

When m_dip (the dipole component) is 0, the integral is ∫ Y_{10}^* Y_{00} Y_{10} dΩ.

Which is ∫ (sqrt(3/(4π)) cosθ )^* (1/sqrt(4π)) (sqrt(3/(4π)) cosθ ) dΩ.

Which simplifies to (3/(4π)) ∫ cos²θ sinθ dθ dφ.

As before, the φ integral gives 2π, θ integral gives 2/3. So the integral is (3/(4π)) * 2π * (2/3) )= (3/(4π)) * (4π/3) )= 1.

So the amplitude for m'=0 is 1 * some constant.

For m_dip=1, the integral is ∫ Y_{11}^* Y_{00} Y_{11} dΩ.

Which is ∫ [ -sqrt(3/(8π)) e^{-iφ} sinθ ]^* [1/sqrt(4π)] [ -sqrt(3/(8π)) e^{iφ} sinθ ] dΩ.

Simplifying, it's [3/(8π)] * ∫ sin²θ dΩ.

Because the exponentials cancel: e^{-iφ} * e^{iφ} =1.

The integral over φ is 2π, and the integral over θ is ∫0^π sin²θ sinθ dθ = ∫0^π sin^3θ dθ.

Let u = cosθ, du = -sinθ dθ.

The integral becomes ∫_{-1}^1 (1 - u²) (-du) )= ∫_{-1}^1 (1 - u²) du = [u - u³/3] from -1 to 1.

At 1: 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.

At -1: (-1) - (-1)^3/3 = (-1) - (-1/3) = (-2/3).

So difference is 2/3 - (-2/3) = 4/3.

So the integral becomes [3/(8π)] * (4/3) * 2π )= [3/(8π)] * (8π/3) )= 1.

So the amplitude for m'=1 is 1 * some constant.

Similarly, for m_dip=-1, the integral should be the same as for m_dip=1, because the complex conjugate would make it real and positive.

So the amplitude for m'=-1 is also 1 * some constant.

Wait, but that can't be correct because the dipole operator has different components, so the probabilities shouldn't be the same for all m'.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some factors. Let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps the normalization constants are different for Y_{1m}.

Y_{10} is sqrt(3/(4π)) cosθ.

Y_{11} is -sqrt(3/(8π)) e^{iφ} sinθ.

Y_{1-1} is sqrt(3/(8π)) e^{-iφ} sinθ.

So when I compute the integral for m_dip=1 (Y_{11}):

Amplitude = ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{00} Y_{11} dΩ.

Wait, but Y_{00} is 1/sqrt(4π), so:

Amplitude = (1/sqrt(4π)) * ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{11} dΩ.

Wait, no, that's not right. It should be:

Amplitude = ∫ Y_{1m'}^* (Y_{00}) (Y_{11}) dΩ.

Which is ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{00} Y_{11} dΩ.

But Y_{00} is 1/sqrt(4π), so:

Amplitude = (1/sqrt(4π)) ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{11} dΩ.

The integral ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{11} dΩ is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which is zero unless m' + 1 = 0 → m' = -1.

Wait, no, that's for combining angular momenta. Alternatively, the integral of Y_{l1 m1} Y_{l2 m2} Y_{l3 m3} is non-zero only when certain conditions are met, like m1 + m2 = m3, and |l1 - l2| ≤ l3 ≤ l1 + l2.

In this case, Y_{1m'}^* Y_{11} is being integrated, so l1=1, m1=m', and l2=1, m2=1.

The product Y_{1m'} Y_{11} can be expressed as a sum over Y_{l m}, where l can be 2 or 0. Because 1 +1 =2, and |1-1|=0.

So the integral ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{11} dΩ is non-zero only when l=0 or l=2.

But when you multiply Y_{1m'} and Y_{11}, the product includes terms with l=0 (only if m' +1 =0 → m' = -1).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the integral is non-zero only when m' = -1.

So for m'= -1, the integral is non-zero. For other m's, it's zero.

Wait, but earlier I thought for m_dip=1, the integral for m'=1 was non-zero, but according to this, it's only non-zero when m'= -1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the m's.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The dipole operator's x and y components (which correspond to m=±1) will cause transitions where the initial m=0 changes by ±1. So the first transition can go to m=+1 or m=-1.

But wait, according to the integral I did earlier for m_dip=1, the integral was non-zero because the product of Y_{11} and Y_{00} led to a non-zero result. But I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's best to refer to a standard result.

In hydrogen, the transition probability for a dipole transition from l=0 to l=1 is allowed for m changes of 0, ±1, and the relative probabilities are proportional to 1:2:1.

Wait, I think that the transition probabilities for m=0, +1, -1 are in the ratio 1:2:1. So the probabilities are 1/4, 2/4=1/2, and 1/4.

So the first transition would have probabilities:

m=0 → 1/4,

m=+1 → 1/2,

m=-1 → 1/4.

Wait, why?

Because when you have three possible m transitions, and the probabilities are proportional to the squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which for combining l=0 (m=0) and l=1 (m_dip) to get l=1 (m'):

The CG coefficients for m=0, m=+1, m=-1 are 1, sqrt(2), and 1 respectively, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, the CG coefficients for combining (l1=1, m1) and (l2=0, m2=0) to get (l=1, m').

The CG coefficients are:

⟨1, m' | 1, m1; 0, 0⟩.

Which is non-zero only when m' = m1.

So, m' can be -1, 0, +1.

The CG coefficients for these are:

For m'= -1: sqrt( (1 - 0)(1 + 1 + 1) )/(something) ) Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, the CG coefficients can be found from the formula.

The CG coefficient for adding two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get l and m is given by:

⟨ l, m | l1, m1; l2, m2 ⟩ 

Which is zero unless m = m1 + m2 and |l1 - l2| ≤ l ≤ l1 + l2.

In our case, l2=0, so m2=0. So m = m1.

And l must be |1-0|=1 ≤ l ≤ 1+0=1 → l=1.

So the CG coefficient is ⟨1, m | 1, m; 0, 0 ⟩.

Which is 1 for all m, because when l2=0, the state is just the same as l1.

Wait, that's probably correct. So the amplitude for each m' is 1. So the probability for each m' is 1^2 / (number of possible m's).

Wait, but that would give equal probability for each m', which would be 1/3 each.

But that contradicts earlier thoughts.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitudes are proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two angular momenta.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find a different approach.

If the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ has possible m values of -1, 0, +1, and the probabilities are proportional to (2l+1) for each m, then perhaps the probabilities are 1:2:1.

Wait, the selection rule for dipole transitions says that the transition is allowed when Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.

But the relative probabilities depend on the matrix element squared.

In hydrogen, the transition probability from n1, l1, m1 to n2, l2, m2 is proportional to (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) |⟨ l2 m2 | Y_{1 m_dip} | l1 m1⟩ |^2.

But I'm not sure about the exact expression.

Alternatively, for the first transition, the possible m are 0, ±1, and the probability for each is 1/3, leading to the second transition probabilities.

But given the confusion, perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the options and known physics.

From the options, the only possible correct path is one that goes through m=0 in both steps because that's the only way to get from m=0 → m=0 in two steps.

Wait, but in reality, the first transition could involve m=0 and the second transition must have m=0 as well. So the path in option A is possible.

But another thought: the initial state |3,0,0⟩ has m=0. For the first transition, it can go to m=0, +1, or -1.

But for the second transition to reach m=0 in the final state, the m must change by the opposite of the initial change.

So, for example, if the first step goes to m=+1, the second step must go to m= -1 to reach m=0. But wait, the final state is |1,0,0⟩, which has m=0.

So each step's m change must sum to zero.

So, for each possible first m, the second step's m change is -m.

Thus, for the first step m1, the second step must have m2 = 0 - m1.

But since the second step's dipole transition can only change m by 0, ±1, this requires that -m1 is 0, ±1.

Which is only possible if m1 is 0, ±1.

So, all three paths are possible.

But the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability.

Looking at the options, only options A, B, C, D have specific paths, but the correct answer must include the path that is possible.

Wait, but the correct answer is option A: |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Because, after the first transition to m=0, the second transition can only go to m=0, as this is required for the final state.

But earlier, I thought that the first transition's m=0 has a probability of 1/3, and the second step's m=0 has a probability of 1, leading to a total for this path of 1/3 * 1 = 1/3.

Alternatively, if the first transition's m=0 has a probability of 1/3, and the second transition's m=0 has a probability of 1, the path's total probability is 1/3.

So option A would have a probability of 1/3.

Similarly, the other paths would have their own probabilities.

But since the question is about the correct transition route and the corresponding probability, perhaps the correct answer is option A, with probability 1/3.

Wait, but wait: another thought. The first transition's m=0 may have a higher probability than the others. If the first transition's m=0 has a higher probability, say 1/2, then the second step would have a probability of 1, leading to a total for this path of 1/2.

But looking at the options, option D has the same path as option A but with probability 2/3.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two-step process's probability is the sum of the probabilities of all possible paths. But the options are giving only specific paths, so the correct path must be the one that's possible, with the given probability.

After considering all this, I think the correct answer is option A, which has the path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.


The problem involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The selection rules for dipole transitions dictate that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ has n=3, l=0, and m=0, while the final state |1,0,0⟩ has n=1, l=0, and m=0. Since the transition occurs in two steps, the intermediate state must have l=1 (Δl = -1 for the second transition).

### Key Analysis:
1. **First Transition**:  
   The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (l=0, m=0) transitions to an intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ (l=1, m=-1, 0, +1). The possible m values after the first transition are -1, 0, +1. The probabilities for these transitions are proportional to the square of the dipole matrix elements, which depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The relative probabilities for m=-1, 0, +1 are in the ratio **1:2:1**, corresponding to probabilities **1/4, 1/2, 1/4**, respectively.

2. **Second Transition**:  
   The intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ transitions to the final state |1,0,0⟩ (l=0, m=0). For this to occur, the m value of the intermediate state must change by Δm = -m to reach m=0 in the final state. This is allowed by the selection rules for dipole transitions.

3. **Path Probabilities**:  
   Each possible path corresponds to a specific sequence of m values in the two transitions. The total probability for a path is the product of the probabilities of each step. For example:
   - Path A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩  
     Probability = (1/3) × 1 = **1/3** (assuming equal probabilities for m=0 in the first step).
   - Path B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩  
     Probability = (1/4) × 1 = **1/4**.
   - Path C: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩  
     Probability = (1/4) × 1 = **1/4**.
   - Path D: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩  
     Probability = (2/3) × 1 = **2/3**.

4. **Correct Path and Probability**:  
   The correct path must satisfy the selection rules and have the correct probability. Among the options, **Path A** is valid and has a probability of **1/3**, consistent with the selection rules and the relative probabilities of the transitions.

### Conclusion:
The correct transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, with a probability of **1/3**.

ANSWER: A
