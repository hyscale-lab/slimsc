Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let's see, the reaction is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, right? And the pion is stationary. Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the products must share the energy and momentum in a certain way.

First, I need to recall some basic concepts. The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Wait, but neutrinos are neutral and super light, almost massless. So maybe the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the muon's. I think for this problem, I can approximate the neutrino's mass as zero. That should make things easier.

The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV/c², the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino's mass is probably negligible, so we can consider it as zero.

So, the total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. The muon will have some kinetic energy plus its rest energy, and the neutrino will have energy but no rest mass, so all its energy is kinetic.

Wait, but how are the energies divided between the muon and neutrino? Since momentum must be conserved, their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the energy of the muon as E_mu and the neutrino as E_nu. Let me also denote their momenta as p_mu and p_nu.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum must be zero. So, p_mu = -p_nu. But the neutrino is massless, so its energy E_nu is equal to its momentum times c, but I can just say E_nu = p_nu c.

For the muon, its energy is given by E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). Since the muon's mass is much larger than the neutrino's (which is zero), its energy will be a combination of rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

But wait, the problem is only asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles. So I need to find the kinetic energies K_mu and K_nu.

But the total energy of the system after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. That total must equal the pion's rest energy, 139.6 MeV. So E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Also, the momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Let me let p be the magnitude of the momentum of the muon (so the neutrino's momentum is also p, but opposite). So E_nu = p c.

For the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). Let's write this as E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 ).

But m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c². So m_mu c² is 105.7 MeV.

So, E_mu = sqrt( p² c^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

And E_mu + E_nu = 139.6. So substituting E_nu = p c and E_mu as above, we get:

sqrt( p² c^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6.

Hmm, this looks like a quadratic equation. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root.

Wait, but before that, maybe let me make it a bit simpler. Let me let x = p c. Then equation becomes:

sqrt( x^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6.

Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - x.

Now, square both sides:

x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.

So,

x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.

Subtract x^2 from both sides:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute the squares:

105.7^2 is approximately (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 (but exact value needed).

Wait, 105.7 * 105.7: 100 *100=10000, 100*5.7=570, 5.7*100=570, 5.7*5.7=32.49. So (105.7)^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49 MeV².

Similarly, (139.6)^2: Let's calculate 140^2=19600, so 139.6 is 140-0.4. So (140-0.4)^2 = 140² -2*140*0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x.

Rearranging:

2*139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let's subtract:

19488.16
-11172.49
= 8315.67.

So,

279.2 x = 8315.67.

Thus,

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me calculate that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 83.1567 / 2.792 ≈.

Calculating 83.1567 ÷ 2.792.

Well, 2.792 * 30 = 83.76. That's just a bit more than 30. So 83.1567 is about 30 - (0.6033 / 2.792) ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784.

Wait, let me compute 2.792 * 29.784 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 = 8376, minus 279.2 → 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

Hmm, 29 would give 8096.8, but we have 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So total x ≈29.783.

So x≈29.783 MeV.

Wait, but x is p c. So p c = x ≈29.783 MeV.

Wait, but earlier substitution was x = p c.

Wait, but wait, the units here: since m_mu is in MeV/c², and E is in MeV, the units for x will be MeV, because (p c) has units of MeV (since p is in MeV/c, c is in units where c=1 in these energy terms).

So, x is 29.783 MeV.

So E_nu = x ≈29.783 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( x^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Compute 29.783^2: approximately (30)^2 =900, but 29.783 is a bit less. Let's compute 29.783^2.

29.783 *29.783 ≈ (30 -0.217)^2 = 30^2 -2*30*0.217 + (0.217)^2 = 900 -13.02 + 0.047 ≈ 886.027.

105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.

So E_mu = sqrt(886.027 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12058.517) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, sqrt(12058.517) is approximately 109.8 because 109.8^2 = (110 -0.2)^2 = 12100 - 44 + 0.04 ≈ 12056.04. Hmm, close to 12058.5, so E_mu ≈109.8 MeV.

So E_mu is about 109.8 MeV, and E_nu is 29.783 MeV.

Now, the kinetic energy of each is their total energy minus their rest mass energy.

For the muon: K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV.

For the neutrino: K_nu = E_nu - 0 =29.783 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make any miscalculations?

Wait, when I calculated x =8315.67 /279.2, let's compute that more accurately.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 *29.78 = 279.2 *29 = 8096.8, 279.2 *0.78= approximately 279.2 *0.7=195.44, 279.2*0.08=22.336. So 195.44 +22.336=217.776. So 29.78 gives 8096.8 +217.776=8314.576. Close to 8315.67.

The difference is 8315.67 -8314.576=1.094.

So 279.2 per 1 unit x is 279.2. So 1.094/279.2 ≈0.00392.

So x≈29.78 +0.00392 ≈29.78392.

So x≈29.784.

Thus, E_nu =29.784 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt(887.03 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.52) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So K_mu =109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

K_nu=29.784 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close.

So the answer should be option D.

To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use the conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed to be massless (\(m_\nu \approx 0\)).

### Key Equations:
1. **Conservation of Energy**:  
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu
   \]
   The total energy of the pion is its rest energy:  
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Conservation of Momentum**:  
   Since the pion is stationary, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu.
   \]

3. **Energy of the Muon**:  
   The total energy of the muon is given by:  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(p_{\mu^+} c)^2 + (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2}.
   \]

4. **Energy of the Neutrino**:  
   Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is purely kinetic:  
   \[
   E_\nu = p_\nu c.
   \]

### Solving for \(p_{\mu^+}\) and \(p_\nu\):
Let \(x = p_\nu c\). Then \(p_{\mu^+} c = x\) as well (momenta are equal in magnitude). Substituting into the energy conservation equation:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x = 139.6.
\]

Rearranging and squaring both sides:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - x,
\]
\[
x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot x + x^2,
\]
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x,
\]
\[
279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49,
\]
\[
279.2x = 8315.67,
\]
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, \(p_\nu c = x \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}\), and \(p_{\mu^+} c = x \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Calculating Energies:
1. **Energy of the Neutrino**:  
   \[
   E_\nu = p_\nu c = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Energy of the Muon**:  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = \sqrt{(29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
   \]
   Compute \(x^2 = (29.784)^2 \approx 887.03\) and \((105.7)^2 = 11172.49\):  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{887.03 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.52} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Kinetic Energies:
1. **Kinetic Energy of the Muon**:  
   \[
   K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino**:  
   \[
   K_\nu = E_\nu - m_\nu c^2 = 29.784 - 0 = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. This matches **Option D**.

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let's see, the reaction is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, right?

So, the total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. The muon will have some kinetic energy plus its rest energy, and the neutrino will have energy but no rest mass, so all its energy is kinetic.

Wait, but how are the energies divided between the muon and neutrino? Since momentum must be conserved, their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the energy of the muon as E_mu and the neutrino as E_nu. Let me also denote their momenta as p_mu and p_nu.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum must be zero. So, p_mu = -p_nu. But the neutrino is massless, so its energy E_nu is equal to its momentum times c, but I can just say E_nu = p_nu c.

For the muon, its energy is given by E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). Since the muon's mass is much larger than the neutrino's (which is zero), its energy will be a combination of rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

But wait, the problem is only asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles. So I need to find the kinetic energies K_mu and K_nu.

But the total energy of the system after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. That total must equal the pion's rest energy, 139.6 MeV. So E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Also, the momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Let me let p be the magnitude of the momentum of the muon (so the neutrino's momentum is also p, but opposite). So E_nu = p c.

For the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). Let's write this as E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 ).

But m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c². So m_mu c² is 105.7 MeV.

So, E_mu = sqrt( p² c^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

And E_mu + E_nu = 139.6. So substituting E_nu = p c and E_mu as above, we get:

sqrt( p² c^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6.

Hmm, this looks like a quadratic equation. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root.

Wait, but before that, maybe let me make it a bit simpler. Let me let x = p c. Then equation becomes:

sqrt( x^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6.

Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - x.

Now, square both sides:

x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.

So,

x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.

Subtract x^2 from both sides:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute the squares:

105.7^2 is approximately (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 (but exact value needed).

Wait, 105.7 * 105.7: 100 *100=10000, 100*5.7=570, 5.7*100=570, 5.7*5.7=32.49. So (105.7)^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49 MeV².

Similarly, (139.6)^2: Let's calculate 140^2=19600, so 139.6 is 140-0.4. So (140-0.4)^2 = 140² -2*140*0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x.

Rearranging:

2*139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let's subtract:

19488.16
-11172.49
= 8315.67.

So,

279.2 x = 8315.67.

Thus,

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me calculate that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 83.1567 / 2.792 ≈.

Calculating 83.1567 ÷ 2.792.

Well, 2.792 * 30 = 83.76. That's just a bit more than 30. So 83.1567 is about 30 - (0.6033 / 2.792) ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784.

Wait, let me compute 2.792 * 29.784 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 = 8376, minus 279.2 → 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

Hmm, 29 would give 8096.8, but we have 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So total x ≈29.783.

So x≈29.783 MeV.

Wait, but x is p c. So p c = x ≈29.783 MeV.

Wait, but earlier substitution was x = p c.

Wait, but wait, the units here: since m_mu is in MeV/c², and E is in MeV, the units for x will be MeV, because (p c) has units of MeV (since p is in MeV/c, c is in units where c=1 in these energy terms).

So, x is 29.783 MeV.

So E_nu = x ≈29.783 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( x^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Compute 29.783^2: approximately (30)^2 =900, but 29.783 is a bit less. Let's compute 29.783^2.

29.783 *29.783 ≈ (30 -0.217)^2 = 30^2 -2*30*0.217 + (0.217)^2 = 900 -13.02 + 0.047 ≈ 886.027.

105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.

So E_mu = sqrt(886.027 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12058.517) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, sqrt(12058.517) is approximately 109.8 because 109.8^2 = (110 -0.2)^2 = 12100 - 44 + 0.04 ≈ 12056.04. Hmm, close to 12058.5, so E_mu ≈109.8 MeV.

So E_mu is about 109.8 MeV, and E_nu is 29.783 MeV.

Now, the kinetic energy of each is their total energy minus their rest mass energy.

For the muon: K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV.

For the neutrino: K_nu = E_nu - 0 =29.783 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make any miscalculations?

Wait, when I calculated x =8315.67 /279.2, let's compute that more accurately.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 *29.78 = 279.2 *29 = 8096.8, 279.2 *0.78= approximately 279.2 *0.7=195.44, 279.2*0.08=22.336. So 195.44 +22.336=217.776. So 29.78 gives 8096.8 +217.776=8314.576. Close to 8315.67.

The difference is 8315.67 -8314.576=1.094.

So 279.2 per 1 unit x is 279.2. So 1.094/279.2 ≈0.00392.

So x≈29.78 +0.00392 ≈29.78392.

So x≈29.784.

Thus, E_nu =29.784 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt(887.03 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.52) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So K_mu =109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

K_nu=29.784 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close.

So the answer should be option D.


To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use the conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed to be massless (\(m_\nu \approx 0\)).

### Key Equations:
1. **Conservation of Energy**:  
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu
   \]
   The total energy of the pion is its rest energy:  
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Conservation of Momentum**:  
   Since the pion is stationary, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu.
   \]

3. **Energy of the Muon**:  
   The total energy of the muon is given by:  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(p_{\mu^+} c)^2 + (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2}.
   \]

4. **Energy of the Neutrino**:  
   Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is purely kinetic:  
   \[
   E_\nu = p_\nu c.
   \]

### Solving for \(p_{\mu^+}\) and \(p_\nu\):
Let \(x = p_\nu c\). Then \(p_{\mu^+} c = x\) as well (momenta are equal in magnitude). Substituting into the energy conservation equation:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x = 139.6.
\]

Rearranging and squaring both sides:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - x,
\]
\[
x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot x + x^2,
\]
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x,
\]
\[
279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49,
\]
\[
279.2x = 8315.67,
\]
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, \(p_\nu c = x \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}\), and \(p_{\mu^+} c = x \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Calculating Energies:
1. **Energy of the Neutrino**:  
   \[
   E_\nu = p_\nu c = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Energy of the Muon**:  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = \sqrt{(29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
   \]
   Compute \(x^2 = (29.784)^2 \approx 887.03\) and \((105.7)^2 = 11172.49\):  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{887.03 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.52} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Kinetic Energies:
1. **Kinetic Energy of the Muon**:  
   \[
   K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino**:  
   \[
   K_\nu = E_\nu - m_\nu c^2 = 29.784 - 0 = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. This matches **Option D**.
