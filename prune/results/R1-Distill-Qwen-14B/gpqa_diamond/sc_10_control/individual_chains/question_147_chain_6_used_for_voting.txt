Okay, so I have this physics problem about annihilation processes. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the annihilation of a proton and an antiproton producing two particles, A+ and A-. The setup is that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, first, let's get the problem clear. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. So, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The products are two A+ and two A- particles.

I remember that in annihilation reactions, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe I should consider the initial momentum. Wait, the proton is a matter particle, and the antiproton is antimatter. So their rest masses are the same, right? The rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV, so m_p c² is around 938 MeV. But wait, the problem says m_A c² is 300 MeV. So each A particle is lighter than a proton.

The antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. Wait, but if it's moving slowly, its velocity is low, so maybe the initial momentum is dominated by the proton. Or wait, the proton is at rest? Or is it? The problem doesn't specify whether the proton is moving or at rest. Hmm, wait the antiproton is moving slowly, which implies that the proton is perhaps at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it. Or maybe the initial setup is that the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving with a low speed.

But wait, protons and antiprotons annihilate each other when they meet. So perhaps in the center-of-momentum frame, their combined momentum is zero, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe I can approximate something.

Wait, the initial momentum is the sum of the momentum of the proton and the antiproton. If the proton is at rest, then its momentum is zero. The antiproton is moving slowly, so its momentum is p_p̄ = gamma * m_p * v. Since v is small, gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2c²), but maybe we can approximate gamma as 1 for simplicity. So the initial total momentum is roughly m_p * v.

But wait, the antiproton is moving, but the proton is stationary, so the initial system has some momentum. After annihilation, the products are four particles: two A+ and two A-.

Wait no, looking back, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. So four particles in total. So each pair (A+ and A-) must have some momentum. Or perhaps, due to conservation laws, the products can't all be at rest because of momentum conservation.

Wait, but maybe the problem assumes that the products move with the same velocity, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the products are in a state where their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe I should think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

First, let's consider the rest frame where the total momentum is zero. But wait, in the initial frame, the antiproton is moving, so the total momentum isn't zero. So the initial frame isn't the center-of-mass frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the situation where the antiproton is moving, but at a low speed, meaning that the initial kinetic energy is small compared to the rest mass. So maybe the initial total energy is approximately the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton.

Wait, the rest energy of the proton is 938 MeV, same for the antiproton. So the total rest energy is 2*938 = 1876 MeV. But if the antiproton is moving, then the total energy is higher than 1876 MeV.

Hmm, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. That suggests that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe the initial total energy is approximately 2*938 MeV, and the initial momentum is (gamma*m_p*v) ≈ m_p*v, since v is small.

After the annihilation, the products are two A+ and two A-. Let's think about the total energy and momentum.

Energy conservation: initial energy equals the sum of the energies of the four A particles.

Momentum conservation: the initial momentum is the sum of the momenta of all four A particles.

But wait, this seems complicated because four particles have individual momenta. However, perhaps the problem is symmetric in some way, allowing for simplification.

Wait, the products are two A+ and two A-. Maybe they come in pairs. Perhaps the two A+ move in one direction and the two A- in the opposite, but that would make the total momentum zero, which would only be possible if the initial momentum is zero, which it isn't.

Alternatively, maybe they are emitted symmetrically, so that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps all four A particles move together with the same velocity. If that's the case, the total momentum would be 4 * (gamma_A m_A v_A ). But this would require the same velocity for all four, which might not be the case but perhaps it's an assumption we can make.

Wait, but that's a big assumption. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair (A+ and A-) has some momentum that adds up with another pair to give the total initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each A particle has the same velocity, making their momenta additive. Let me proceed with that assumption, even though I'm not entirely sure.

So, assuming that each A+ and A- has the same velocity, then the total momentum after annihilation is 4 * (gamma m_A v). But wait, no, because A+ and A- have opposite charges but same mass. Wait, actually, the problem states they are A+ and A-; perhaps they have the same mass but opposite charges. So their masses are the same, m_A.

So, if each A has the same speed v, then the momentum of each is gamma m_A v. But for four particles, the total momentum is 4 gamma m_A v. But if the initial momentum is p_initial = p_p + p_p̄. Wait, but earlier, if the proton is at rest, then p_p = 0, and p_p̄ = gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma_p̄ ≈1, so p_initial ≈ m_p v_p̄.

So, from momentum conservation:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v_p̄.

But the problem gives m_A c² = 300 MeV. So m_A = 300 MeV / c².

The proton's mass m_p is 938 MeV/c².

Now, considering that the antiproton is moving slowly, so v_p̄ is much less than c. So gamma_p̄ ≈1, and thus m_p v_p̄ is the initial momentum.

So, 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v_p̄.

But we also have energy conservation.

Initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy. The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton's energy is gamma_p̄ m_p c². Since v_p̄ is small, gamma_p̄ ≈1 + (v_p̄²)/(2c²), but perhaps for initial approximation, we can take gamma_p̄ ≈1, making the antiproton's energy approximately m_p c². So initial total energy is m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c² ≈ 1876 MeV.

After annihilation, the total energy is four times the energy of each A particle. Each A's energy is gamma_A m_A c².

So, 4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c².

Divide both sides by c²:

4 gamma_A m_A = 2 m_p.

Substituting m_A = 300 MeV/c², m_p = 938 MeV/c².

So,

4 gamma_A * 300 = 2 * 938

=> gamma_A = (2 *938) / (4 *300) ) = (1876) / (1200) ≈ 1.5633.

So gamma_A is approximately 1.5633.

Then, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1.5633.

Solving for v.

Let me compute 1.5633 squared: (1.5633)^2 ≈ 2.443.

So,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = 2.443 → 1 - v²/c² = 1/2.443 ≈ 0.4095 → v²/c² = 1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905 → v/c = sqrt(0.5905) ≈ 0.7685. So v ≈ 0.7685 c, which is about 0.77c.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c.

Wait, but wait a second. I made an assumption that all four A particles have the same velocity, which might not be correct. Also, perhaps the initial momentum isn't exactly m_p v_p̄, but higher because the antiproton's gamma is more than 1.

Wait, because I approximated gamma_p̄ as 1, but perhaps it's better to consider it more accurately.

Wait, let's re-examine the initial momentum.

The initial momentum is the sum of the proton's momentum and the antiproton's momentum. The proton is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The antiproton's momentum is gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄.

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p̄ is small, so gamma_p̄ ≈ 1 + (v_p̄²)/(2c²). But if v_p̄ is much less than c, then perhaps we can take gamma_p̄ ≈1, but maybe not. Let's see.

But wait, we can also relate the initial momentum from energy and mass.

The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p̄ m_p c².

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄.

But perhaps in the case where the antiproton's kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy, gamma_p̄ is approximately 1. So p_initial ≈ m_p v_p̄.

Now, from energy conservation, 4 gamma_A m_A c² = (m_p + gamma_p̄ m_p ) c².

So,

4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p̄ )

But without knowing the exact value of gamma_p̄, perhaps we can find a ratio.

Wait, let's think about the momentum equation.

From momentum conservation:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄.

But since v_p̄ is small, perhaps v_p̄ ≈ (gamma_p̄ m_p v_A)/(4 gamma_A m_A).

Wait, but this seems a bit tangled. Alternatively, perhaps we can relate the velocities.

Wait, let's think about the velocities. Let me denote v as the velocity of the A particles, and v_p̄ as the velocity of the antiproton.

From the momentum equation:

gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄ = 4 gamma_A m_A v.

From the energy equation:

(m_p + gamma_p̄ m_p ) c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Which simplifies to:

(1 + gamma_p̄ ) m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Divide both sides by c²:

(1 + gamma_p̄ ) m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

Then,

gamma_A = ( (1 + gamma_p̄ ) m_p ) / (4 m_A )

But from the momentum equation:

gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄ = 4 gamma_A m_A v.

So,

gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄ = 4 * [ ( (1 + gamma_p̄ ) m_p ) / (4 m_A) ) ] * m_A v.

Simplify the right side:

4 * [ ( (1 + gamma_p̄ ) m_p )/(4 m_A) ) ] * m_A v = (1 + gamma_p̄ ) m_p v.

So,

gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄ = (1 + gamma_p̄ ) m_p v.

Divide both sides by m_p:

gamma_p̄ v_p̄ = (1 + gamma_p̄ ) v.

Rearrange:

v = (gamma_p̄ v_p̄ ) / (1 + gamma_p̄ )

Hmm, that's an expression for v in terms of gamma_p̄ and v_p̄.

But I also have from the fact that gamma_p̄ = 1/sqrt(1 - (v_p̄^2/c^2) )

But this is getting complicated. Perhaps there's another approach.

Alternatively, since the antiproton is moving slowly, we can approximate v_p̄ << c.

In that case, gamma_p̄ ≈ 1 + (v_p̄^2)/(2c^2) ≈ 1. So 1 + gamma_p̄ ≈ 2.

So, from the momentum equation:

gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄ ≈ 4 gamma_A m_A v.

Using gamma_p̄ ≈1,

m_p v_p̄ ≈4 gamma_A m_A v.

From the energy equation, with gamma_p̄ ≈1,

(1 +1) m_p =4 gamma_A m_A → 2 m_p =4 gamma_A m_A → gamma_A = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) ) = m_p/(2 m_A ) = (938)/(2*300) ≈938/600≈1.5633, which is what I had earlier.

So gamma_A is about 1.5633, leading to v ≈0.77c.

But wait, the options include 0.77c as option A. So that's one of the choices.

But wait, I'm not sure if the assumption that the A particles all have the same velocity is valid. Because in reality, they could have different velocities, but the problem implies that we're to find the velocity of each A particle, perhaps assuming they all move together. Otherwise, the problem becomes more complicated.

So, perhaps the answer is option A) 0.77c.

But let me check the calculation again.

Compute gamma_A = 1.5633.

Compute v:

gamma = 1.5633 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So,

1.5633^2 = 1/(1 - v²/c²)

2.443 = 1/(1 - v²/c²)

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/2.443 ≈0.4095

v²/c² = 1 -0.4095 = 0.5905 → v/c = sqrt(0.5905) ≈0.7685 → approximately 0.77c.

So option A is correct.

Wait, but I just recalled that when particles are produced in annihilation, they usually share the momentum. So perhaps the initial momentum of the system is carried by all four particles.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is symmetric, leading each pair of A particles to have the same velocity but opposite directions, but that wouldn't contribute to the total momentum. So that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps two A+ and two A- are emitted in the same direction, but that would require other considerations.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is carried equally by all four A particles, each moving with velocity v, leading to a total momentum of 4 gamma m_A v. But that would require the initial momentum to be 4 gamma m_A v, as I did earlier.

So, if the initial momentum is m_p v_p̄, and v_p̄ is small, but I have to relate this to the velocity v of the A particles.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using the fact that the initial kinetic energy is small, so the total initial energy is about 2 m_p c². Then, the energy of each A is E_A = gamma_A m_A c².

So,

4 E_A = 2 m_p c² → E_A = (2 m_p c²) /4 = (m_p c²)/2.

So,

gamma_A m_A c² = (m_p c²)/2 → gamma_A = (m_p)/(2 m_A )

Which is the same as before, gamma_A = (938 MeV/c²) / (2*300 MeV/c²) ) = 938/(600) ≈1.5633.

So, same result as before.

Thus, the velocity is about 0.77c.

So the correct answer should be option A) 0.77c.

To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process:

**Reaction:** \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \)

### Key Information:
1. The antiproton is moving slowly, implying its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. Thus, its velocity \( v_{\bar{p}} \) is small, and we approximate \( \gamma_{\bar{p}} \approx 1 \).
2. The rest energy of the proton (and antiproton) is \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \), and the rest energy of each \( A \)-particle is \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Conservation Laws:
1. **Energy Conservation:**
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}
   \]
   The initial energy is the sum of the proton's and antiproton's rest energies:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + m_p c^2 = 2 m_p c^2
   \]
   The final energy is the total energy of the four \( A \)-particles:
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2
   \]
   Equating the two:
   \[
   4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 = 2 m_p c^2
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{2 m_p}{4 m_A} = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}
   \]
   Substituting \( m_p = 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} = \frac{938}{600} \approx 1.5633
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation:**
   The initial momentum is dominated by the antiproton, as the proton is at rest:
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_{\bar{p}} m_p v_{\bar{p}} \approx m_p v_{\bar{p}}
   \]
   The final momentum is the sum of the momenta of the four \( A \)-particles. Assuming all \( A \)-particles have the same velocity \( v_A \), the total momentum is:
   \[
   p_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A v_A
   \]
   Equating the two:
   \[
   4 \gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v_{\bar{p}}
   \]
   Since \( v_{\bar{p}} \) is small, we focus on solving for \( v_A \) using \( \gamma_A \).

### Solving for \( v_A \):
The relativistic relation between \( \gamma \) and velocity is:
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}}
\]
Rearranging:
\[
1 - v_A^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}
\]
\[
v_A^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}
\]
Substitute \( \gamma_A \approx 1.5633 \):
\[
v_A^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1.5633)^2} \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2.443} \approx 1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905
\]
\[
v_A/c = \sqrt{0.5905} \approx 0.7685
\]
Thus:
\[
v_A \approx 0.77c
\]

### Conclusion:
The velocity of each \( A \)-particle is approximately \( 0.77c \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

Okay, so I have this physics problem about annihilation processes. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the annihilation of a proton and an antiproton producing two particles, A+ and A-. The setup is that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, first, let's get the problem clear. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. So, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The products are two A+ and two A- particles.

I remember that in annihilation reactions, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe I should consider the initial momentum. Wait, the proton is a matter particle, and the antiproton is antimatter. So their rest masses are the same, right? The rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV, so m_p c² is around 938 MeV. But wait, the problem says m_A c² is 300 MeV. So each A particle is lighter than a proton.

The antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. Wait, but if it's moving slowly, its velocity is low, so maybe the initial momentum is dominated by the proton. Or wait, the proton is at rest? Or is it? The problem doesn't specify whether the proton is moving or at rest. Hmm, wait the antiproton is moving slowly, which implies that the proton is perhaps at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it. Or maybe the initial setup is that the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving with a low speed.

But wait, protons and antiprotons annihilate each other when they meet. So perhaps in the center-of-momentum frame, their combined momentum is zero, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe I can approximate something.

Wait, the initial momentum is the sum of the momentum of the proton and the antiproton. If the proton is at rest, then its momentum is zero. The antiproton is moving slowly, so its momentum is p_p̄ = gamma * m_p * v. Since v is small, gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2c²), but maybe we can approximate gamma as 1 for simplicity. So the initial total momentum is roughly m_p * v.

But wait, the antiproton is moving, but the proton is stationary, so the initial system has some momentum. After annihilation, the products are four particles: two A+ and two A-.

Wait no, looking back, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. So four particles in total. So each pair (A+ and A-) must have some momentum. Or perhaps, due to conservation laws, the products can't all be at rest because of momentum conservation.

Wait, but maybe the problem assumes that the products move with the same velocity, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the products are in a state where their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe I should think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

First, let's consider the rest frame where the total momentum is zero. But wait, in the initial frame, the antiproton is moving, so the total momentum isn't zero. So the initial frame isn't the center-of-mass frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the situation where the antiproton is moving, but at a low speed, meaning that the initial kinetic energy is small compared to the rest mass. So maybe the initial total energy is approximately the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton.

Wait, the rest energy of the proton is 938 MeV, same for the antiproton. So the total rest energy is 2*938 = 1876 MeV. But if the antiproton is moving, then the total energy is higher than 1876 MeV.

Hmm, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. That suggests that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe the initial total energy is approximately 2*938 MeV, and the initial momentum is (gamma*m_p*v) ≈ m_p*v, since v is small.

After the annihilation, the products are two A+ and two A-. Let's think about the total energy and momentum.

Energy conservation: initial energy equals the sum of the energies of the four A particles.

Momentum conservation: the initial momentum is the sum of the momenta of all four A particles.

But wait, this seems complicated because four particles have individual momenta. However, perhaps the problem is symmetric in some way, allowing for simplification.

Wait, the products are two A+ and two A-. Maybe they come in pairs. Perhaps the two A+ move in one direction and the two A- in the opposite, but that would make the total momentum zero, which would only be possible if the initial momentum is zero, which it isn't.

Alternatively, maybe they are emitted symmetrically, so that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps all four A particles move together with the same velocity. If that's the case, the total momentum would be 4 * (gamma_A m_A v_A ). But this would require the same velocity for all four, which might not be the case but perhaps it's an assumption we can make.

Wait, but that's a big assumption. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair (A+ and A-) has some momentum that adds up with another pair to give the total initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each A particle has the same velocity, making their momenta additive. Let me proceed with that assumption, even though I'm not entirely sure.

So, assuming that each A+ and A- has the same velocity, then the total momentum after annihilation is 4 * (gamma m_A v). But wait, no, because A+ and A- have opposite charges but same mass. Wait, actually, the problem states they are A+ and A-; perhaps they have the same mass but opposite charges. So their masses are the same, m_A.

So, if each A has the same speed v, then the momentum of each is gamma m_A v. But for four particles, the total momentum is 4 gamma m_A v. But if the initial momentum is p_initial = p_p + p_p̄. Wait, but earlier, if the proton is at rest, then p_p = 0, and p_p̄ = gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma_p̄ ≈1, so p_initial ≈ m_p v_p̄.

So, from momentum conservation:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v_p̄.

But the problem gives m_A c² = 300 MeV. So m_A = 300 MeV / c².

The proton's mass m_p is 938 MeV/c².

Now, considering that the antiproton is moving slowly, so v_p̄ is much less than c. So gamma_p̄ ≈1, and thus m_p v_p̄ is the initial momentum.

So, 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v_p̄.

But we also have energy conservation.

Initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy. The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton's energy is gamma_p̄ m_p c². Since v_p̄ is small, gamma_p̄ ≈1 + (v_p̄²)/(2c²), but perhaps for initial approximation, we can take gamma_p̄ ≈1, making the antiproton's energy approximately m_p c². So initial total energy is m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c² ≈ 1876 MeV.

After annihilation, the total energy is four times the energy of each A particle. Each A's energy is gamma_A m_A c².

So, 4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c².

Divide both sides by c²:

4 gamma_A m_A = 2 m_p.

Substituting m_A = 300 MeV/c², m_p = 938 MeV/c².

So,

4 gamma_A * 300 = 2 * 938

=> gamma_A = (2 *938) / (4 *300) ) = (1876) / (1200) ≈ 1.5633.

So gamma_A is approximately 1.5633.

Then, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1.5633.

Solving for v.

Let me compute 1.5633 squared: (1.5633)^2 ≈ 2.443.

So,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = 2.443 → 1 - v²/c² = 1/2.443 ≈ 0.4095 → v²/c² = 1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905 → v/c = sqrt(0.5905) ≈ 0.7685. So v ≈ 0.7685 c, which is about 0.77c.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c.

Wait, but wait a second. I made an assumption that all four A particles have the same velocity, which might not be correct. Also, perhaps the initial momentum isn't exactly m_p v_p̄, but higher because the antiproton's gamma is more than 1.

Wait, because I approximated gamma_p̄ as 1, but perhaps it's better to consider it more accurately.

Wait, let's re-examine the initial momentum.

The initial momentum is the sum of the proton's momentum and the antiproton's momentum. The proton is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The antiproton's momentum is gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄.

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p̄ is small, so gamma_p̄ ≈ 1 + (v_p̄²)/(2c²). But if v_p̄ is much less than c, then perhaps we can take gamma_p̄ ≈1, but maybe not. Let's see.

But wait, we can also relate the initial momentum from energy and mass.

The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p̄ m_p c².

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄.

But perhaps in the case where the antiproton's kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy, gamma_p̄ is approximately 1. So p_initial ≈ m_p v_p̄.

Now, from energy conservation, 4 gamma_A m_A c² = (m_p + gamma_p̄ m_p ) c².

So,

4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p̄ )

But without knowing the exact value of gamma_p̄, perhaps we can find a ratio.

Wait, let's think about the momentum equation.

From momentum conservation:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄.

But since v_p̄ is small, perhaps v_p̄ ≈ (gamma_p̄ m_p v_A)/(4 gamma_A m_A).

Wait, but this seems a bit tangled. Alternatively, perhaps we can relate the velocities.

Wait, let's think about the velocities. Let me denote v as the velocity of the A particles, and v_p̄ as the velocity of the antiproton.

From the momentum equation:

gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄ = 4 gamma_A m_A v.

From the energy equation:

(m_p + gamma_p̄ m_p ) c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Which simplifies to:

(1 + gamma_p̄ ) m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Divide both sides by c²:

(1 + gamma_p̄ ) m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

Then,

gamma_A = ( (1 + gamma_p̄ ) m_p ) / (4 m_A )

But from the momentum equation:

gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄ = 4 gamma_A m_A v.

So,

gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄ = 4 * [ ( (1 + gamma_p̄ ) m_p ) / (4 m_A) ) ] * m_A v.

Simplify the right side:

4 * [ ( (1 + gamma_p̄ ) m_p )/(4 m_A) ) ] * m_A v = (1 + gamma_p̄ ) m_p v.

So,

gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄ = (1 + gamma_p̄ ) m_p v.

Divide both sides by m_p:

gamma_p̄ v_p̄ = (1 + gamma_p̄ ) v.

Rearrange:

v = (gamma_p̄ v_p̄ ) / (1 + gamma_p̄ )

Hmm, that's an expression for v in terms of gamma_p̄ and v_p̄.

But I also have from the fact that gamma_p̄ = 1/sqrt(1 - (v_p̄^2/c^2) )

But this is getting complicated. Perhaps there's another approach.

Alternatively, since the antiproton is moving slowly, we can approximate v_p̄ << c.

In that case, gamma_p̄ ≈ 1 + (v_p̄^2)/(2c^2) ≈ 1. So 1 + gamma_p̄ ≈ 2.

So, from the momentum equation:

gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄ ≈ 4 gamma_A m_A v.

Using gamma_p̄ ≈1,

m_p v_p̄ ≈4 gamma_A m_A v.

From the energy equation, with gamma_p̄ ≈1,

(1 +1) m_p =4 gamma_A m_A → 2 m_p =4 gamma_A m_A → gamma_A = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) ) = m_p/(2 m_A ) = (938)/(2*300) ≈938/600≈1.5633, which is what I had earlier.

So gamma_A is about 1.5633, leading to v ≈0.77c.

But wait, the options include 0.77c as option A. So that's one of the choices.

But wait, I'm not sure if the assumption that the A particles all have the same velocity is valid. Because in reality, they could have different velocities, but the problem implies that we're to find the velocity of each A particle, perhaps assuming they all move together. Otherwise, the problem becomes more complicated.

So, perhaps the answer is option A) 0.77c.

But let me check the calculation again.

Compute gamma_A = 1.5633.

Compute v:

gamma = 1.5633 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So,

1.5633^2 = 1/(1 - v²/c²)

2.443 = 1/(1 - v²/c²)

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/2.443 ≈0.4095

v²/c² = 1 -0.4095 = 0.5905 → v/c = sqrt(0.5905) ≈0.7685 → approximately 0.77c.

So option A is correct.

Wait, but I just recalled that when particles are produced in annihilation, they usually share the momentum. So perhaps the initial momentum of the system is carried by all four particles.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is symmetric, leading each pair of A particles to have the same velocity but opposite directions, but that wouldn't contribute to the total momentum. So that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps two A+ and two A- are emitted in the same direction, but that would require other considerations.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is carried equally by all four A particles, each moving with velocity v, leading to a total momentum of 4 gamma m_A v. But that would require the initial momentum to be 4 gamma m_A v, as I did earlier.

So, if the initial momentum is m_p v_p̄, and v_p̄ is small, but I have to relate this to the velocity v of the A particles.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using the fact that the initial kinetic energy is small, so the total initial energy is about 2 m_p c². Then, the energy of each A is E_A = gamma_A m_A c².

So,

4 E_A = 2 m_p c² → E_A = (2 m_p c²) /4 = (m_p c²)/2.

So,

gamma_A m_A c² = (m_p c²)/2 → gamma_A = (m_p)/(2 m_A )

Which is the same as before, gamma_A = (938 MeV/c²) / (2*300 MeV/c²) ) = 938/(600) ≈1.5633.

So, same result as before.

Thus, the velocity is about 0.77c.

So the correct answer should be option A) 0.77c.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process:

**Reaction:** \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \)

### Key Information:
1. The antiproton is moving slowly, implying its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. Thus, its velocity \( v_{\bar{p}} \) is small, and we approximate \( \gamma_{\bar{p}} \approx 1 \).
2. The rest energy of the proton (and antiproton) is \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \), and the rest energy of each \( A \)-particle is \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Conservation Laws:
1. **Energy Conservation:**
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}
   \]
   The initial energy is the sum of the proton's and antiproton's rest energies:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + m_p c^2 = 2 m_p c^2
   \]
   The final energy is the total energy of the four \( A \)-particles:
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2
   \]
   Equating the two:
   \[
   4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 = 2 m_p c^2
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{2 m_p}{4 m_A} = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}
   \]
   Substituting \( m_p = 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} = \frac{938}{600} \approx 1.5633
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation:**
   The initial momentum is dominated by the antiproton, as the proton is at rest:
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_{\bar{p}} m_p v_{\bar{p}} \approx m_p v_{\bar{p}}
   \]
   The final momentum is the sum of the momenta of the four \( A \)-particles. Assuming all \( A \)-particles have the same velocity \( v_A \), the total momentum is:
   \[
   p_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A v_A
   \]
   Equating the two:
   \[
   4 \gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v_{\bar{p}}
   \]
   Since \( v_{\bar{p}} \) is small, we focus on solving for \( v_A \) using \( \gamma_A \).

### Solving for \( v_A \):
The relativistic relation between \( \gamma \) and velocity is:
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}}
\]
Rearranging:
\[
1 - v_A^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}
\]
\[
v_A^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}
\]
Substitute \( \gamma_A \approx 1.5633 \):
\[
v_A^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1.5633)^2} \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2.443} \approx 1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905
\]
\[
v_A/c = \sqrt{0.5905} \approx 0.7685
\]
Thus:
\[
v_A \approx 0.77c
\]

### Conclusion:
The velocity of each \( A \)-particle is approximately \( 0.77c \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
