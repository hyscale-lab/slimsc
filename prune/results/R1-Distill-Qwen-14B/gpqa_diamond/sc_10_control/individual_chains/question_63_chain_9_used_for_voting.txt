Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, I remember from my studies that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which probably combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. Now, it's asking what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, the next state after the fundamental would be the first excited state, right?

So, I guess I need to figure out the energy difference between these two states and then relate that to the photon's momentum. Because when a photon is absorbed, its energy goes into exciting the molecule to a higher energy state.

The molecule is made of atoms X and Y with masses 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency is given as 4e14 rad/s. 

First, I think I need to calculate the energy difference between the fundamental (v=0, J=0) state and the next higher state. But wait, what's the next state? Oh, right, the next possible state would be the first excited state. But wait, in these models, the states are quantized in both rotation and vibration. So the next state could be either a vibrational or rotational transition. But I think the problem is considering the transition to the next state in terms of energy, regardless of which mode it's in.

Wait, the question specifies the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps it's the next higher energy state, which would be the first excited state. But for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. The ground state is when both vibrational and rotational are in their lowest states (v=0, J=0). So the next state could be v=1 and J=0, or J=1 and v=0, whichever has a lower energy. But which transition has the lower energy? I think the vibrational energy levels are generally higher than the rotational ones. Let me think: the vibrational energy levels are given by (n + 1/2)ħω, and the rotational by (J + 1/2)ħc/(R² I), where I is the moment of inertia. 

So, the vibrational energy spacing is larger than the rotational, especially for higher J. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be when the rotational state increases, not the vibrational. But wait, the fundamental state has J=0 for the rotation part. So the first excited rotational state would be J=1. So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 would be the energy required for the photon. But wait, if the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state, the next possible state would either be (v=1, J=0) with higher energy, or (v=0, J=1) which is a lower energy increase. So which one is the lower energy jump? Let's compute both and see.

First, calculate the energy difference for a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1. The energy for vibration is given by ΔE_vibrational = (n + 1/2)ħω - (n' + 1/2)ħω, when n increases by 1. So for v=0 to v=1, it's (1 + 1/2 - 0 - 1/2)ħω = ħω. So that's ħ multiplied by ω.

For the rotational change from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is ΔE_rotational = [ (J + 1/2) - (J' + 1/2) ] * ħ c / (R² I) ), but wait, I think the rotational energy levels are given by E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J + 1). So the difference between J=1 and J=0 is E_1 - E_0 = (ħ²/(2I)) [2 - 0] = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I). Wait, that's correct?

Wait, E_J = (J (J+1) ) (ħ²/(2I) ). So E_0 = 0 (since 0*(1)*... is zero). E_1 = (1*2) (ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I). So the energy difference is E_1 - E_0 = ħ²/(I).

So to find out which transition (vibrational or rotational) is lower in energy, I need to compute both ΔE_vibrational and ΔE_rotational and compare.

So first, compute ΔE_vibrational = ħ ω. Let's compute that.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Angular frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. So ħ ω is 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 = approximately 4.218e-20 J.

Now, compute ΔE_rotational. For that, I need the moment of inertia I. I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass, and R is the bond length. Let's compute μ.

The masses are Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). 

Converting amu to kg: 1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So Mx = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 +3.321e-27 )

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator.

Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

So numerator μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) = ?

Wait, no: μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).

So Mx + My = 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

Mx * My = (3.321e-26 kg) * (3.321e-27 kg) = Let's compute that:

3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 ≈ 10.996 * 1e-53 ≈ 1.0996e-52 kg².

So μ = 1.0996e-52 / 3.6531e-26 = approximately 3.008e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 

3.008e-27 kg.

I = μ R². R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so R = 2e-10 m.

I = (3.008e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.008e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2032e-46 kg·m².

Now, the rotational energy difference ΔE_rotational is ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34 J·s)^2 / (1.2032e-46 kg·m²).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J²·s²).

Wait, no, (1.05457e-34)^2 is actually approx (1.05^2=1.10) * (1e-68) → 1.109e-68 J² s².

Wait, no, actually, (1e-34)^2 is 1e-68, so 1.05457^2 is approx 1.112. So 1.112e-68 J² s².

Wait, but I'm not sure, maybe better to compute it more accurately.

(1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * (1e-34)^2 → (1.1122) * 1e-68 → ~1.1122e-68 J² s².

So ΔE_rot = 1.1122e-68 / (1.2032e-46) → 1.1122e-68 / 1.2032e-46 = (1.1122 / 1.2032) * 1e-22 → approx 0.924 * 1e-22 = 9.24e-23 J.

Wait, that's a very small number compared to the vibrational energy. Wait, the vibrational energy was about 4.218e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires about 9e-23 J, which is way less. So the next lowest energy state after the fundamental is the rotational J=1 state, not the vibrational v=1 state.

So the photon should have energy equal to the difference between J=0 and J=1, which is 9.24e-23 J.

Wait, but wait: I think I might have made a mistake. The energy for rotational levels is E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1). So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is ( (1*2) - 0 ) * ħ²/(2I) ) = (2) * ħ²/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I). So I think my calculation is correct.

Wait, but wait, I think I messed up the calculation of I. Let me recheck that.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I=μ R².

μ is (20 * 2) / (20 +2) amu. Wait, 20 and 2, so μ = (40)/(22) amu = 40/22 = 1.818... amu. Wait, no! Wait, am I doing this right?

Wait, no. The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). So it's (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Previously, I converted Mx and My to kg and multiplied, but perhaps it's easier to compute μ in kg.

Let me compute μ again:

Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 )

Let me compute denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

Numerator: (3.321e-26) * (3.321e-27) = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 → (10.996) * 1e-53 = 1.0996e-52 kg².

So μ = 1.0996e-52 / 3.6531e-26 ≈ 3.008e-27 kg? Wait, 3.6531e-26 is 3.6531e-26 kg.

Wait, 1.0996e-52 / 3.6531e-26 = (1.0996 / 3.6531) ) * 1e-52 +26 → (0.3) * 1e-26 → 3e-27 kg.

Hmm, that seems right.

So I = μ R² = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 *4e-20 → 1.2e-46 kg m².

So I is correct.

Then, E_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.2e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68.

So E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2e-46 = 9.267e-23 J.

So that's the energy required for the rotational transition. Now, the energy of the photon should match this, because when the photon is absorbed, it provides the energy for the molecule to transition from J=0 to J=1.

The energy of a photon is given by E = p c, where p is the momentum and c is the speed of light. So p = E / c.

So E_photon should be 9.267e-23 J.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.267e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.089e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting 3e-31 kg·m/s, but the options are in 1e-27 or similar. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, E_rot is 9.267e-23 J. Let's compute p = E/c.

E = 9.267e-23 J.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p = (9.267e-23) / (3e8) = approximately 3.089e-31 kg·m/s.

But looking at the options, none of them are in the 1e-31 range. The options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Let me retrace.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me recheck that.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

μ is 3e-27 kg, as before.

I = μ R² = 3e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2e-46 kg·m².

E_rot is ħ²/(I) → ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 (J² s²).

So E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2e-46 = 9.267e-23 J. That part seems correct.

Hmm, so p = E/c → 9.267e-23 / 3e8 → 3.089e-31 kg m/s.

But looking at the options, the smallest is 1.4e-28 N·s. Wait, 1 N·s is kg·m/s. So 1e-28 Ns is 1e-28 kg m/s.

But my p is 3e-31 kg m/s which is 3e-31 Ns, which is 0.3e-30, which is 0.03e-29, so way smaller than the options given. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up rotational and vibrational transitions. But earlier I thought the rotational transition needed less energy than the vibrational one, but maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to a vibrational transition, not rotational. Let me reevaluate that.

Because maybe the question is not about the next state in terms of energy, but perhaps the next state in a different context. Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up the order of the energy jumps.

Wait, the vibrational energy for v=0 to v=1 is ħ ω.

ω is 4e14 rad/s, so ħ ω is 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

That's much larger than the 9.267e-23 J for rotational. So for the next state, the molecule would first transition to the next rotational state, which requires less energy than the vibrational transition.

So the correct photon energy is 9.267e-23 J, which requires a momentum p = E/c = 3.089e-31 kg m/s.

But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating I. Maybe I forgot to square R correctly.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. R squared is (2e-10)^2=4e-20 m². That part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating mu. Let me recheck.

Mx=20 amu =20 *1.6605e-27 kg →3.321e-26 kg.

My=2 amu=3.321e-27 kg.

mu = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) → (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 +3.321e-27 )

Denominator is 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 =3.6531e-26 kg.

Numerator: 3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-26-27 →10.996e-53 → 1.0996e-52 kg².

So mu is 1.0996e-52 / 3.6531e-26 → (1.0996 /3.6531) ) * 1e-52+26 → 0.3 *1e-26 → 3e-27 kg. So that's correct.

Wait a second, perhaps the problem is considering only the vibrational transition? But that would require a photon with higher energy, but according to the earlier calculation, the energy is higher than the rotational transition. So the molecule would preferentially transition to the lower energy state first, which is the rotational one.

But the options don't match the rotational p value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is in the context of the rigid rotor model, which ignores the centrifugal distortion. But I think my calculation was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually considering the vibration-rotation coupling, and the next state is a combination of both. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition and not the rotational. But why would that be? Because the question says 'next state with the lowest possible energy', which would be the one requiring the least energy, which is the rotational transition.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the energy difference for the rotational transition. Let me reevaluate that.

E_J = (J (J+1) ) * (ħ²/(2I)).

So E_0 = 0. E_1 = (1*2) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I).

So the difference is ħ²/(I).

Wait, why don't I compute ħ squared divided by I.

ħ^2 = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

I = 1.2e-46 kg m².

So ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2e-46 = 9.267e-23 J.

So that's correct.

Hmm. So according to this, the momentum should be p = E/c = 9.267e-23 / 3e8 = 3.089e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, these are all much larger than my calculation. I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I confused the moment of inertia I with the reduced mass, or perhaps the formula for the energy difference is incorrect.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the rotational energy formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). The one with the lower energy difference is the rotational transition. So the photon's energy is 9.267e-23 J.

Wait, but then the photon's momentum p is E/c = 3.089e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.089e-31 N s. None of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated I. Let me recompute I more accurately.

mu = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 +2) amu) → (40 amu²) /22 amu → 40/22 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Wait! Oh wait a second! I think I made a mistake here. Oh my gosh, I think I forgot that the formula for mu is (Mx My)/(Mx + My), but only in amu, and then I don't need to convert to kg when calculating I. Wait, no, because I is in kg m². Oh wait, no. Mu is in kg, because I is in kg m².

Wait, so perhaps I should compute mu in amu, then convert to kg. Let me recompute mu correctly.

mu = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so mu = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.008e-27 kg. Which matches the previous calculation.

So I think my previous calculations are correct. So why are the options so much larger?

Wait, perhaps the problem is not just about the rotational transition but about the transition from the ground state to the next vibrational state, or perhaps it's a combination of both. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the photon causing a transition to the next state, but I'm missing some factor.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the given options are using energy from the vibrational transition, but the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which might imply that the rotational states are considered, but perhaps the question is asking about the next vibrational state.

Wait, but the problem states it's the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor model), which includes both. So the next state after the fundamental would be the first excited state, which could be either higher vibrational or rotational.

But I think the rotational transition requires lower energy than the vibrational one, so that should be the correct path.

But I'm stuck because the calculated momentum isn't matching any of the options.

Wait, maybe the question is actually considering the transition to the next energy level, which is the first vibrational state (v=1), not the rotational. Because perhaps the rotational states are considered as part of the same energy level when considering the overall state of the molecule.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think again.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is (v=0, J=0). The next state would be the first energy level above that. Now, the vibrational energy levels are higher than the rotational ones. So the energy required to go to the next vibrational state (v=1) is higher than the rotational state (J=1). Therefore, the molecule would prefer to transition to the lower energy (rotational) state, requiring a photon with lower energy.

But the options don't have that value. So perhaps the question is considering the transition to a higher vibrational state, perhaps because that's the only way to get to a higher state.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the next state in terms of the energy level, not the next possible state. So perhaps the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=1, J=0), which requires a photon with higher energy.

Wait, but that would be a higher energy transition. So perhaps the problem is expecting the vibrational transition.

So let's recalculate the momentum for the vibrational transition.

ΔE_vibrational = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

Then, p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s, which is 1.406e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N·s. Close to that. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

But why is this the case if the rotational transition requires less energy?

Ah, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question says, when the molecule is in the fundamental state, what photon momentum is needed for it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the lowest possible energy, i.e., the minimal possible energy increase. Hence, the rotational transition.

But according to the calculation, the rotational transition requires about 9.27e-23 J, which would correspond to a momentum of around 3.08e-31 kg m/s, which is not among the options.

But the option D is 1.4e-28 kg m/s which is about the same as the vibrational transition's p.

So perhaps the question is actually asking about the next vibrational state, not considering the rotational. Or perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor, which would have a different moment of inertia.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Wait, I = μ R².

Wait, R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So R squared is 4e-20 m². So I = 3e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2e-46 kg m². That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the rotational energy formula as E_J = (J (J+1)) ħ c / (R² I), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me double-check the rotational energy formula. The correct formula is E_J = (ħ²)/(2I) * J (J+1). So that part is correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state in the model where both vibrational and rotational are accounted for. So the energy of the state is a combination of both.

Wait, but the energy levels are given by E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. So the next state would have the minimal increase in energy. So to find the minimal ΔE, we need to find the smallest possible increase.

So the possible next states after (v=0, J=0) are:

1. (v=0, J=1): ΔE = E_1 - E_0 = ħ²/(I).

2. (v=1, J=0): ΔE = ħ ω.

We need to find which is smaller. If ħ²/(I) < ħ ω, then the rotational transition is next. Otherwise, the vibrational.

Compute:

From earlier, ħ²/(I) = 9.267e-23 J.

ħ ω = 4.218e-20 J.

Since 9.267e-23 J < 4.218e-20 J, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the next state is (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon of 9.267e-23 J. But the options don't have this, so perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition.

Wait, but the options include option D, which is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is E = p c = 1.4e-28 *3e8 = 4.2e-20 J. That's exactly the vibrational energy.

So perhaps the question is considering the next state as the first vibrational state, which would require a photon with p=1.4e-28 Ns.

But why would the next state be the vibrational one when the rotational is lower in energy? Maybe the question is considering that the molecule cannot change its rotational state in this context, perhaps because it's in a rigid rotor model and the question is about vibration.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a harmonic oscillator, which only has vibrational states.

Wait, the question specifies the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both, so I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of rotational energy. Let me recompute I again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the bond length R is given in angstroms, and I forgot to convert it to meters correctly. Let me check.

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. Correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transition from the ground vibrational state to the first excited vibrational state, but it's the first allowed transition, regardless of energy. But that would not make sense because the energy required would be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I had a mistake in the calculation of the energy for the rotational transition. Let me recompute that.

E_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.2e-46 kg m²).

Wait, 1.05457e-34 squared is 1.112e-68 J² s².

Divided by 1.2e-46 gives 9.267e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So perhaps the options are wrong, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, let me think about the possible options again. The closest option to 3.08e-31 kg m/s is not present, but option D is 1.4e-28 kg m/s, which corresponds to E=4.2e-20 J.

Ah, wait a second. Did I mix up the angular frequency with the wavenumber or something else? Wait, no. w is given as 4e14 rad/s, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy in terms of wavenumbers or something else, but I don't think that's necessary here.

I think the problem is expecting the answer to be based on the vibrational transition, perhaps because the question says 'next state with the lowest possible energy' refers to the first possible transition, which in the rigid rotor model is the rotational, but perhaps the problem is considering a model where only vibrations are considered.

But the question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, so both are considered. Therefore, the correct approach should be the rotational transition, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the rotational energy difference in terms of angular frequency for rotation. The rotational energy difference can also be expressed as ΔE_rot = ħ ω_rot, where ω_rot is the rotational angular frequency.

So perhaps I can compute ω_rot from I and E_rot.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me recompute it.

mu = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu = 1.81818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so mu = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.008e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = mu R² = 3.008e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.008e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2032e-46 kg m².

So I is correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculations seem correct, but the options don't match. The only option close to the vibrational transition is D:1.4e-28 kg m/s.

So perhaps the intended answer is D, despite the confusion.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the fundamental state, meaning the lowest energy, which is (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=1, J=0), requiring a photon with energy E = ħ ω. So p = E/c = (ħ ω)/c.

Wait, let's compute that.

E = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c =4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s → 1.406e-28 Ns. Which is option D.

So perhaps the question is considering the next state as a vibrational transition, not a rotational one. But why would that be the case when the rotational transition is lower in energy?

Hmm. Maybe the problem is considering that the molecule is a rigid rotor, and only the rotational transitions are allowed, but that's not the case when you have the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly structured, but given the options, the only one that makes sense is D.

To determine the momentum of the photon required to excite the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy transitions in the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in the state $(v=0, J=0)$, and the next state could either be $(v=1, J=0)$ (vibrational transition) or $(v=0, J=1)$ (rotational transition). The energy differences for these transitions are calculated as follows:

---

### **1. Vibrational Transition**
The vibrational energy levels are given by:

\[
E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega
\]

The energy difference for a transition from $v=0$ to $v=1$ is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} = \hbar \omega
\]

Substituting the given values:
- $\hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$
- $\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}$

\[
\Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14}) = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
\]

The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:

\[
p = \frac{E}{c}
\]

where $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$. Substituting:

\[
p = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s} = 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
\]

---

### **2. Rotational Transition**
The rotational energy levels are given by:

\[
E_J = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} J (J + 1)
\]

The energy difference for a transition from $J=0$ to $J=1$ is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
\]

The moment of inertia $I$ is calculated using the reduced mass $\mu$ and bond length $R$:

\[
I = \mu R^2
\]

The reduced mass $\mu$ is:

\[
\mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y}
\]

Given:
- $M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} = 3.321 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg}$
- $M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} = 3.321 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}$
- $R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}$

\[
\mu = \frac{(3.321 \times 10^{-26}) (3.321 \times 10^{-27})}{3.321 \times 10^{-26} + 3.321 \times 10^{-27}} = 3.008 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
\]

\[
I = (3.008 \times 10^{-27}) (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2032 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
\]

Now, calculate $\Delta E_{\text{rotational}}$:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2032 \times 10^{-46}} = 9.267 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
\]

The corresponding momentum is:

\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rotational}}}{c} = \frac{9.267 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.089 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s} = 3.089 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
\]

---

### **Comparison of Transitions**
The vibrational transition requires $\Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}$, while the rotational transition requires $\Delta E_{\text{rotational}} = 9.267 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}$. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, it corresponds to the next state with the lowest possible energy. However, the calculated momentum for the rotational transition ($3.089 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}$) does not match any of the provided options.

The vibrational transition, on the other hand, corresponds to a momentum of $1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}$, which matches **Option D**. Given the options, it is likely that the question is asking for the vibrational transition rather than the rotational one.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, I remember from my studies that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which probably combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. Now, it's asking what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, the next state after the fundamental would be the first excited state, right?

So, I guess I need to figure out the energy difference between these two states and then relate that to the photon's momentum. Because when a photon is absorbed, its energy goes into exciting the molecule to a higher energy state.

The molecule is made of atoms X and Y with masses 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency is given as 4e14 rad/s. 

First, I think I need to calculate the energy difference between the fundamental (v=0, J=0) state and the next higher state. But wait, what's the next state? Oh, right, the next possible state would be the first excited state. But wait, in these models, the states are quantized in both rotation and vibration. So the next state could be either a vibrational or rotational transition. But I think the problem is considering the transition to the next state in terms of energy, regardless of which mode it's in.

Wait, the question specifies the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps it's the next higher energy state, which would be the first excited state. But for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. The ground state is when both vibrational and rotational are in their lowest states (v=0, J=0). So the next state could be v=1 and J=0, or J=1 and v=0, whichever has a lower energy. But which transition has the lower energy? I think the vibrational energy levels are generally higher than the rotational ones. Let me think: the vibrational energy levels are given by (n + 1/2)ħω, and the rotational by (J + 1/2)ħc/(R² I), where I is the moment of inertia. 

So, the vibrational energy spacing is larger than the rotational, especially for higher J. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be when the rotational state increases, not the vibrational. But wait, the fundamental state has J=0 for the rotation part. So the first excited rotational state would be J=1. So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 would be the energy required for the photon. But wait, if the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state, the next possible state would either be (v=1, J=0) with higher energy, or (v=0, J=1) which is a lower energy increase. So which one is the lower energy jump? Let's compute both and see.

First, calculate the energy difference for a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1. The energy for vibration is given by ΔE_vibrational = (n + 1/2)ħω - (n' + 1/2)ħω, when n increases by 1. So for v=0 to v=1, it's (1 + 1/2 - 0 - 1/2)ħω = ħω. So that's ħ multiplied by ω.

For the rotational change from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is ΔE_rotational = [ (J + 1/2) - (J' + 1/2) ] * ħ c / (R² I) ), but wait, I think the rotational energy levels are given by E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J + 1). So the difference between J=1 and J=0 is E_1 - E_0 = (ħ²/(2I)) [2 - 0] = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I). Wait, that's correct?

Wait, E_J = (J (J+1) ) (ħ²/(2I) ). So E_0 = 0 (since 0*(1)*... is zero). E_1 = (1*2) (ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I). So the energy difference is E_1 - E_0 = ħ²/(I).

So to find out which transition (vibrational or rotational) is lower in energy, I need to compute both ΔE_vibrational and ΔE_rotational and compare.

So first, compute ΔE_vibrational = ħ ω. Let's compute that.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Angular frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. So ħ ω is 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 = approximately 4.218e-20 J.

Now, compute ΔE_rotational. For that, I need the moment of inertia I. I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass, and R is the bond length. Let's compute μ.

The masses are Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). 

Converting amu to kg: 1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So Mx = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 +3.321e-27 )

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator.

Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

So numerator μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) = ?

Wait, no: μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).

So Mx + My = 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

Mx * My = (3.321e-26 kg) * (3.321e-27 kg) = Let's compute that:

3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 ≈ 10.996 * 1e-53 ≈ 1.0996e-52 kg².

So μ = 1.0996e-52 / 3.6531e-26 = approximately 3.008e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 

3.008e-27 kg.

I = μ R². R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so R = 2e-10 m.

I = (3.008e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.008e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2032e-46 kg·m².

Now, the rotational energy difference ΔE_rotational is ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34 J·s)^2 / (1.2032e-46 kg·m²).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J²·s²).

Wait, no, (1.05457e-34)^2 is actually approx (1.05^2=1.10) * (1e-68) → 1.109e-68 J² s².

Wait, no, actually, (1e-34)^2 is 1e-68, so 1.05457^2 is approx 1.112. So 1.112e-68 J² s².

Wait, but I'm not sure, maybe better to compute it more accurately.

(1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * (1e-34)^2 → (1.1122) * 1e-68 → ~1.1122e-68 J² s².

So ΔE_rot = 1.1122e-68 / (1.2032e-46) → 1.1122e-68 / 1.2032e-46 = (1.1122 / 1.2032) * 1e-22 → approx 0.924 * 1e-22 = 9.24e-23 J.

Wait, that's a very small number compared to the vibrational energy. Wait, the vibrational energy was about 4.218e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires about 9e-23 J, which is way less. So the next lowest energy state after the fundamental is the rotational J=1 state, not the vibrational v=1 state.

So the photon should have energy equal to the difference between J=0 and J=1, which is 9.24e-23 J.

Wait, but wait: I think I might have made a mistake. The energy for rotational levels is E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1). So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is ( (1*2) - 0 ) * ħ²/(2I) ) = (2) * ħ²/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I). So I think my calculation is correct.

Wait, but wait, I think I messed up the calculation of I. Let me recheck that.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I=μ R².

μ is (20 * 2) / (20 +2) amu. Wait, 20 and 2, so μ = (40)/(22) amu = 40/22 = 1.818... amu. Wait, no! Wait, am I doing this right?

Wait, no. The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). So it's (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Previously, I converted Mx and My to kg and multiplied, but perhaps it's easier to compute μ in kg.

Let me compute μ again:

Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 )

Let me compute denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

Numerator: (3.321e-26) * (3.321e-27) = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 → (10.996) * 1e-53 = 1.0996e-52 kg².

So μ = 1.0996e-52 / 3.6531e-26 ≈ 3.008e-27 kg? Wait, 3.6531e-26 is 3.6531e-26 kg.

Wait, 1.0996e-52 / 3.6531e-26 = (1.0996 / 3.6531) ) * 1e-52 +26 → (0.3) * 1e-26 → 3e-27 kg.

Hmm, that seems right.

So I = μ R² = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 *4e-20 → 1.2e-46 kg m².

So I is correct.

Then, E_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.2e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68.

So E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2e-46 = 9.267e-23 J.

So that's the energy required for the rotational transition. Now, the energy of the photon should match this, because when the photon is absorbed, it provides the energy for the molecule to transition from J=0 to J=1.

The energy of a photon is given by E = p c, where p is the momentum and c is the speed of light. So p = E / c.

So E_photon should be 9.267e-23 J.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.267e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.089e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting 3e-31 kg·m/s, but the options are in 1e-27 or similar. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, E_rot is 9.267e-23 J. Let's compute p = E/c.

E = 9.267e-23 J.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p = (9.267e-23) / (3e8) = approximately 3.089e-31 kg·m/s.

But looking at the options, none of them are in the 1e-31 range. The options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Let me retrace.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me recheck that.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

μ is 3e-27 kg, as before.

I = μ R² = 3e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2e-46 kg·m².

E_rot is ħ²/(I) → ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 (J² s²).

So E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2e-46 = 9.267e-23 J. That part seems correct.

Hmm, so p = E/c → 9.267e-23 / 3e8 → 3.089e-31 kg m/s.

But looking at the options, the smallest is 1.4e-28 N·s. Wait, 1 N·s is kg·m/s. So 1e-28 Ns is 1e-28 kg m/s.

But my p is 3e-31 kg m/s which is 3e-31 Ns, which is 0.3e-30, which is 0.03e-29, so way smaller than the options given. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up rotational and vibrational transitions. But earlier I thought the rotational transition needed less energy than the vibrational one, but maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to a vibrational transition, not rotational. Let me reevaluate that.

Because maybe the question is not about the next state in terms of energy, but perhaps the next state in a different context. Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up the order of the energy jumps.

Wait, the vibrational energy for v=0 to v=1 is ħ ω.

ω is 4e14 rad/s, so ħ ω is 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

That's much larger than the 9.267e-23 J for rotational. So for the next state, the molecule would first transition to the next rotational state, which requires less energy than the vibrational transition.

So the correct photon energy is 9.267e-23 J, which requires a momentum p = E/c = 3.089e-31 kg m/s.

But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating I. Maybe I forgot to square R correctly.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. R squared is (2e-10)^2=4e-20 m². That part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating mu. Let me recheck.

Mx=20 amu =20 *1.6605e-27 kg →3.321e-26 kg.

My=2 amu=3.321e-27 kg.

mu = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) → (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 +3.321e-27 )

Denominator is 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 =3.6531e-26 kg.

Numerator: 3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-26-27 →10.996e-53 → 1.0996e-52 kg².

So mu is 1.0996e-52 / 3.6531e-26 → (1.0996 /3.6531) ) * 1e-52+26 → 0.3 *1e-26 → 3e-27 kg. So that's correct.

Wait a second, perhaps the problem is considering only the vibrational transition? But that would require a photon with higher energy, but according to the earlier calculation, the energy is higher than the rotational transition. So the molecule would preferentially transition to the lower energy state first, which is the rotational one.

But the options don't match the rotational p value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is in the context of the rigid rotor model, which ignores the centrifugal distortion. But I think my calculation was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually considering the vibration-rotation coupling, and the next state is a combination of both. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition and not the rotational. But why would that be? Because the question says 'next state with the lowest possible energy', which would be the one requiring the least energy, which is the rotational transition.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the energy difference for the rotational transition. Let me reevaluate that.

E_J = (J (J+1) ) * (ħ²/(2I)).

So E_0 = 0. E_1 = (1*2) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I).

So the difference is ħ²/(I).

Wait, why don't I compute ħ squared divided by I.

ħ^2 = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

I = 1.2e-46 kg m².

So ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2e-46 = 9.267e-23 J.

So that's correct.

Hmm. So according to this, the momentum should be p = E/c = 9.267e-23 / 3e8 = 3.089e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, these are all much larger than my calculation. I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I confused the moment of inertia I with the reduced mass, or perhaps the formula for the energy difference is incorrect.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the rotational energy formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). The one with the lower energy difference is the rotational transition. So the photon's energy is 9.267e-23 J.

Wait, but then the photon's momentum p is E/c = 3.089e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.089e-31 N s. None of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated I. Let me recompute I more accurately.

mu = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 +2) amu) → (40 amu²) /22 amu → 40/22 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Wait! Oh wait a second! I think I made a mistake here. Oh my gosh, I think I forgot that the formula for mu is (Mx My)/(Mx + My), but only in amu, and then I don't need to convert to kg when calculating I. Wait, no, because I is in kg m². Oh wait, no. Mu is in kg, because I is in kg m².

Wait, so perhaps I should compute mu in amu, then convert to kg. Let me recompute mu correctly.

mu = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so mu = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.008e-27 kg. Which matches the previous calculation.

So I think my previous calculations are correct. So why are the options so much larger?

Wait, perhaps the problem is not just about the rotational transition but about the transition from the ground state to the next vibrational state, or perhaps it's a combination of both. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the photon causing a transition to the next state, but I'm missing some factor.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the given options are using energy from the vibrational transition, but the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which might imply that the rotational states are considered, but perhaps the question is asking about the next vibrational state.

Wait, but the problem states it's the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor model), which includes both. So the next state after the fundamental would be the first excited state, which could be either higher vibrational or rotational.

But I think the rotational transition requires lower energy than the vibrational one, so that should be the correct path.

But I'm stuck because the calculated momentum isn't matching any of the options.

Wait, maybe the question is actually considering the transition to the next energy level, which is the first vibrational state (v=1), not the rotational. Because perhaps the rotational states are considered as part of the same energy level when considering the overall state of the molecule.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think again.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is (v=0, J=0). The next state would be the first energy level above that. Now, the vibrational energy levels are higher than the rotational ones. So the energy required to go to the next vibrational state (v=1) is higher than the rotational state (J=1). Therefore, the molecule would prefer to transition to the lower energy (rotational) state, requiring a photon with lower energy.

But the options don't have that value. So perhaps the question is considering the transition to a higher vibrational state, perhaps because that's the only way to get to a higher state.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the next state in terms of the energy level, not the next possible state. So perhaps the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=1, J=0), which requires a photon with higher energy.

Wait, but that would be a higher energy transition. So perhaps the problem is expecting the vibrational transition.

So let's recalculate the momentum for the vibrational transition.

ΔE_vibrational = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

Then, p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s, which is 1.406e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N·s. Close to that. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

But why is this the case if the rotational transition requires less energy?

Ah, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question says, when the molecule is in the fundamental state, what photon momentum is needed for it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the lowest possible energy, i.e., the minimal possible energy increase. Hence, the rotational transition.

But according to the calculation, the rotational transition requires about 9.27e-23 J, which would correspond to a momentum of around 3.08e-31 kg m/s, which is not among the options.

But the option D is 1.4e-28 kg m/s which is about the same as the vibrational transition's p.

So perhaps the question is actually asking about the next vibrational state, not considering the rotational. Or perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor, which would have a different moment of inertia.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Wait, I = μ R².

Wait, R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So R squared is 4e-20 m². So I = 3e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2e-46 kg m². That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the rotational energy formula as E_J = (J (J+1)) ħ c / (R² I), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me double-check the rotational energy formula. The correct formula is E_J = (ħ²)/(2I) * J (J+1). So that part is correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state in the model where both vibrational and rotational are accounted for. So the energy of the state is a combination of both.

Wait, but the energy levels are given by E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. So the next state would have the minimal increase in energy. So to find the minimal ΔE, we need to find the smallest possible increase.

So the possible next states after (v=0, J=0) are:

1. (v=0, J=1): ΔE = E_1 - E_0 = ħ²/(I).

2. (v=1, J=0): ΔE = ħ ω.

We need to find which is smaller. If ħ²/(I) < ħ ω, then the rotational transition is next. Otherwise, the vibrational.

Compute:

From earlier, ħ²/(I) = 9.267e-23 J.

ħ ω = 4.218e-20 J.

Since 9.267e-23 J < 4.218e-20 J, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the next state is (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon of 9.267e-23 J. But the options don't have this, so perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition.

Wait, but the options include option D, which is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is E = p c = 1.4e-28 *3e8 = 4.2e-20 J. That's exactly the vibrational energy.

So perhaps the question is considering the next state as the first vibrational state, which would require a photon with p=1.4e-28 Ns.

But why would the next state be the vibrational one when the rotational is lower in energy? Maybe the question is considering that the molecule cannot change its rotational state in this context, perhaps because it's in a rigid rotor model and the question is about vibration.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a harmonic oscillator, which only has vibrational states.

Wait, the question specifies the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both, so I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of rotational energy. Let me recompute I again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the bond length R is given in angstroms, and I forgot to convert it to meters correctly. Let me check.

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. Correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transition from the ground vibrational state to the first excited vibrational state, but it's the first allowed transition, regardless of energy. But that would not make sense because the energy required would be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I had a mistake in the calculation of the energy for the rotational transition. Let me recompute that.

E_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.2e-46 kg m²).

Wait, 1.05457e-34 squared is 1.112e-68 J² s².

Divided by 1.2e-46 gives 9.267e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So perhaps the options are wrong, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, let me think about the possible options again. The closest option to 3.08e-31 kg m/s is not present, but option D is 1.4e-28 kg m/s, which corresponds to E=4.2e-20 J.

Ah, wait a second. Did I mix up the angular frequency with the wavenumber or something else? Wait, no. w is given as 4e14 rad/s, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy in terms of wavenumbers or something else, but I don't think that's necessary here.

I think the problem is expecting the answer to be based on the vibrational transition, perhaps because the question says 'next state with the lowest possible energy' refers to the first possible transition, which in the rigid rotor model is the rotational, but perhaps the problem is considering a model where only vibrations are considered.

But the question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, so both are considered. Therefore, the correct approach should be the rotational transition, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the rotational energy difference in terms of angular frequency for rotation. The rotational energy difference can also be expressed as ΔE_rot = ħ ω_rot, where ω_rot is the rotational angular frequency.

So perhaps I can compute ω_rot from I and E_rot.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me recompute it.

mu = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu = 1.81818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so mu = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.008e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = mu R² = 3.008e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.008e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2032e-46 kg m².

So I is correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculations seem correct, but the options don't match. The only option close to the vibrational transition is D:1.4e-28 kg m/s.

So perhaps the intended answer is D, despite the confusion.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the fundamental state, meaning the lowest energy, which is (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=1, J=0), requiring a photon with energy E = ħ ω. So p = E/c = (ħ ω)/c.

Wait, let's compute that.

E = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c =4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s → 1.406e-28 Ns. Which is option D.

So perhaps the question is considering the next state as a vibrational transition, not a rotational one. But why would that be the case when the rotational transition is lower in energy?

Hmm. Maybe the problem is considering that the molecule is a rigid rotor, and only the rotational transitions are allowed, but that's not the case when you have the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly structured, but given the options, the only one that makes sense is D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to excite the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy transitions in the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in the state $(v=0, J=0)$, and the next state could either be $(v=1, J=0)$ (vibrational transition) or $(v=0, J=1)$ (rotational transition). The energy differences for these transitions are calculated as follows:

---

### **1. Vibrational Transition**
The vibrational energy levels are given by:

\[
E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega
\]

The energy difference for a transition from $v=0$ to $v=1$ is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} = \hbar \omega
\]

Substituting the given values:
- $\hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$
- $\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}$

\[
\Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14}) = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
\]

The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:

\[
p = \frac{E}{c}
\]

where $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$. Substituting:

\[
p = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s} = 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
\]

---

### **2. Rotational Transition**
The rotational energy levels are given by:

\[
E_J = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} J (J + 1)
\]

The energy difference for a transition from $J=0$ to $J=1$ is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
\]

The moment of inertia $I$ is calculated using the reduced mass $\mu$ and bond length $R$:

\[
I = \mu R^2
\]

The reduced mass $\mu$ is:

\[
\mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y}
\]

Given:
- $M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} = 3.321 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg}$
- $M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} = 3.321 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}$
- $R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}$

\[
\mu = \frac{(3.321 \times 10^{-26}) (3.321 \times 10^{-27})}{3.321 \times 10^{-26} + 3.321 \times 10^{-27}} = 3.008 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
\]

\[
I = (3.008 \times 10^{-27}) (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2032 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
\]

Now, calculate $\Delta E_{\text{rotational}}$:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2032 \times 10^{-46}} = 9.267 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
\]

The corresponding momentum is:

\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rotational}}}{c} = \frac{9.267 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.089 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s} = 3.089 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
\]

---

### **Comparison of Transitions**
The vibrational transition requires $\Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}$, while the rotational transition requires $\Delta E_{\text{rotational}} = 9.267 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}$. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, it corresponds to the next state with the lowest possible energy. However, the calculated momentum for the rotational transition ($3.089 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}$) does not match any of the provided options.

The vibrational transition, on the other hand, corresponds to a momentum of $1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}$, which matches **Option D**. Given the options, it is likely that the question is asking for the vibrational transition rather than the rotational one.
