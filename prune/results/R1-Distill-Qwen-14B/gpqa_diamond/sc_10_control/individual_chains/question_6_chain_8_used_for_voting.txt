Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm. Let me read the problem again.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum from the options provided.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially for two-dimensional potentials, the approach often involves separating the problem into radial and angular parts. Since this potential depends on r and θ, I think that might help.

So, the potential has two terms: the first is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, wait, how do these terms combine?

Let me think about the form of the potential. The first term is proportional to r², so that's a radial part. The second term also depends on r² but has a θ dependence. So maybe I should express the potential in Cartesian coordinates or find a way to separate variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates to see if it resembles a known system. Because, sometimes, potentials can be expressed as sums of terms involving x and y, which might lead to separable equations.

Wait, cos²θ in polar coordinates. I remember that cos²θ can be expressed using double-angle identities. The identity is cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me substitute that into the potential.

So, V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me compute that.

Breaking it down: (3/2) * kr² * (1/2) = (3/4)kr², and (3/2) * kr² * cos2θ/2 = (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

So, V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Adding the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) = 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, that's V(r,θ) = kr² [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ ].

Wait, perhaps it's better to express this in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because in Cartesian, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So, cos2θ can be written as (x² - y²)/(x² + y²). But wait, the potential is in terms of r and cos2θ, so maybe it's easier to express it in terms of x² and y².

Alternatively, let's think about the potential as a sum of terms. Let me expand the cos2θ part. Cos2θ is (cosθ)^2 - (sinθ)^2. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, another approach: Since the potential is a function of r² and cos2θ, maybe I can separate the variables into radial and angular parts. But I'm not too sure about that.

Wait, another thought: The potential can be written as (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me factor out kr²: V(r,θ) = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Hmm, 1/2 plus (3/2) cos²θ. Let's compute that: 1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ = (1 + 3 cos²θ ) / 2.

Wait, perhaps I can express this as a combination of x and y terms. Because in Cartesian coordinates, cos²θ is (x²)/(x² + y²), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the angular part.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the potential can be written as a sum of terms that are functions of x² and y². Because in 2D, the Hamiltonian is H = p²/(2m) + V(x,y). If V can be expressed as a sum of x² and y² terms, then the Hamiltonian becomes separable into x and y parts.

Let me see: Let's expand the potential in terms of x and y. Remember that x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So, cosθ = x/r. So cos²θ = x²/(r²).

So, V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2) kr² (x²/r²) ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² (x²/r²).

Simplify that: (3/2) kr² (x²/r²) = (3/2) k x².

So, V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) k x².

Wait, wait, that's interesting. So V(x,y) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

But r² is x² + y². So V(x,y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Combine the terms:

(1/2 k x² + 3/2 k x² ) + 1/2 k y².

Which is (2k x²) + (1/2 k y²).

Wait, hold on:

(1/2 k x² + 3/2 k x²) = (1/2 + 3/2) k x² = 2k x².

And the y term is 1/2 k y².

So V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Hmm, so the potential is a combination of a harmonic oscillator in x and another in y, but with different frequencies.

Wait, but in 2D, each direction has a harmonic oscillator. So the total potential is V = (m ω_x² x²)/2 + (m ω_y² y²)/2.

Wait, in the general case, a 2D harmonic oscillator has potential (m ω^2 x² + m ω^2 y² ) / 2, but here, the x and y terms have different coefficients.

Wait, comparing our V to the standard form, let's see:

V(x,y) = (k/2) (x² + y²) + (3k/2) x² → which is V(x,y) = (k x²/2 + 3k x²/2 ) + k y²/2.

So that would be ( (1 +3 )k x² ) / 2 + (k y²)/2.

Which is (4k x²)/2 + (k y²)/2 → 2k x² + (k/2) y².

Wait, so in terms of harmonic oscillators, the x part has a frequency ω_x = sqrt( (2k)/m ), because the standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2) m ω^2 x².

Wait, let me think: The standard form is V(x) = (1/2) m ω² x².

In our case, the x-component is 2k x², which can be written as (1/2) m ω_x² x² = (2k) x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, the y-component is (k/2) y² = (1/2) m ω_y² y² → ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Wait, so the x direction has frequency ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m), and the y direction has ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

In a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + 1) (ħ ω), but wait, actually, the energy levels are E = (n_x + n_y + 1 ) (ħ ω_x + ħ ω_y )? No, wait, no. The energy for each direction is quantized separately.

Wait, no. For a two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, each dimension contributes (n_i + 1/2 ) ħ ω, so the total energy is E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ħ ω. But in our case, the frequencies are different in x and y directions.

So the energy would be E = (n_x + 1/2 ) ħ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2 ) ħ ω_y.

Substituting the frequencies:

E = (n_x +1/2 ) ħ (2 sqrt(k/m) ) + (n_y +1/2 ) ħ (sqrt(k/m) )

Factor out ħ sqrt(k/m):

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ (n_x + 1/2 ) 2 + (n_y +1/2 ) 1 ]

Simplify:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x +1/2 ) + (n_y +1/2) )

Which is:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 0.5 ]

Wait, 2*(n_x + 1/2) is 2n_x +1, and (n_y + 1/2) is as is.

Adding them together: 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 0.5 → 2n_x + n_y + 1.5.

Wait, that's 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So the energy is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) ħ sqrt(k/m).

Looking at the options:

Option C says E = (2n_x + n_y +3/2 ) ℏ sqrt(k/m ), which matches.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The problem involves finding the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). To solve this, the potential is analyzed and expressed in Cartesian coordinates. Using the identity \( \cos^2(\theta) = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \), the potential becomes:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \frac{x^2}{r^2} = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
\]

Since \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), the potential can be rewritten as:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This shows that the potential corresponds to two independent harmonic oscillators in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions, with different frequencies. The frequency in the \( x \)-direction is \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), and the frequency in the \( y \)-direction is \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

The energy spectrum for a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator is the sum of the energy levels in each direction. For the \( x \)-direction, the energy is \( E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x \), and for the \( y \)-direction, the energy is \( E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y \). Adding these gives the total energy:

\[
E = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y.
\]

Substituting \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) and \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), the energy becomes:

\[
E = \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[2\left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\right].
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
E = \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right].
\]

This matches the form given in option C. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Wait, cos²θ in polar coordinates. I remember that cos²θ can be expressed using double-angle identities. The identity is cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me substitute that into the potential.

So, V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me compute that.

Breaking it down: (3/2) * kr² * (1/2) = (3/4)kr², and (3/2) * kr² * cos2θ/2 = (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

So, V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Adding the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) = 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, that's V(r,θ) = kr² [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ ].

Wait, perhaps it's better to express this in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because in Cartesian, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So, cos2θ can be written as (x² - y²)/(x² + y²). But wait, the potential is in terms of r and cos2θ, so maybe it's easier to express it in terms of x² and y².

Alternatively, let's think about the potential as a sum of terms. Let me expand the cos2θ part. Cos2θ is (cosθ)^2 - (sinθ)^2. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, another approach: Since the potential is a function of r² and cos2θ, maybe I can separate the variables into radial and angular parts. But I'm not too sure about that.

Wait, another thought: The potential can be written as (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me factor out kr²: V(r,θ) = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Hmm, 1/2 plus (3/2) cos²θ. Let's compute that: 1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ = (1 + 3 cos²θ ) / 2.

Wait, perhaps I can express this as a combination of x and y terms. Because in Cartesian coordinates, cos²θ is (x²)/(x² + y²), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the angular part.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the potential can be written as a sum of terms that are functions of x² and y². Because in 2D, the Hamiltonian is H = p²/(2m) + V(x,y). If V can be expressed as a sum of x² and y² terms, then the Hamiltonian becomes separable into x and y parts.

Let me see: Let's expand the potential in terms of x and y. Remember that x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So, cosθ = x/r. So cos²θ = x²/(r²).

So, V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2) kr² (x²/r²) ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² (x²/r²).

Simplify that: (3/2) kr² (x²/r²) = (3/2) k x².

So, V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) k x².

Wait, wait, that's interesting. So V(x,y) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

But r² is x² + y². So V(x,y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Combine the terms:

(1/2 k x² + 3/2 k x² ) + 1/2 k y².

Which is (2k x²) + (1/2 k y²).

Wait, hold on:

(1/2 k x² + 3/2 k x²) = (1/2 + 3/2) k x² = 2k x².

And the y term is 1/2 k y².

So V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Hmm, so the potential is a combination of a harmonic oscillator in x and another in y, but with different frequencies.

Wait, but in 2D, each direction has a harmonic oscillator. So the total potential is V = (m ω_x² x²)/2 + (m ω_y² y²)/2.

Wait, in the general case, a 2D harmonic oscillator has potential (m ω^2 x² + m ω^2 y² ) / 2, but here, the x and y terms have different coefficients.

Wait, comparing our V to the standard form, let's see:

V(x,y) = (k/2) (x² + y²) + (3k/2) x² → which is V(x,y) = (k x²/2 + 3k x²/2 ) + k y²/2.

So that would be ( (1 +3 )k x² ) / 2 + (k y²)/2.

Which is (4k x²)/2 + (k y²)/2 → 2k x² + (k/2) y².

Wait, so in terms of harmonic oscillators, the x part has a frequency ω_x = sqrt( (2k)/m ), because the standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2) m ω^2 x².

Wait, let me think: The standard form is V(x) = (1/2) m ω² x².

In our case, the x-component is 2k x², which can be written as (1/2) m ω_x² x² = (2k) x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, the y-component is (k/2) y² = (1/2) m ω_y² y² → ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Wait, so the x direction has frequency ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m), and the y direction has ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

In a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + 1) (ħ ω), but wait, actually, the energy levels are E = (n_x + n_y + 1 ) (ħ ω_x + ħ ω_y )? No, wait, no. The energy for each direction is quantized separately.

Wait, no. For a two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, each dimension contributes (n_i + 1/2 ) ħ ω, so the total energy is E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ħ ω. But in our case, the frequencies are different in x and y directions.

So the energy would be E = (n_x + 1/2 ) ħ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2 ) ħ ω_y.

Substituting the frequencies:

E = (n_x +1/2 ) ħ (2 sqrt(k/m) ) + (n_y +1/2 ) ħ (sqrt(k/m) )

Factor out ħ sqrt(k/m):

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ (n_x + 1/2 ) 2 + (n_y +1/2 ) 1 ]

Simplify:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x +1/2 ) + (n_y +1/2) )

Which is:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 0.5 ]

Wait, 2*(n_x + 1/2) is 2n_x +1, and (n_y + 1/2) is as is.

Adding them together: 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 0.5 → 2n_x + n_y + 1.5.

Wait, that's 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So the energy is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) ħ sqrt(k/m).

Looking at the options:

Option C says E = (2n_x + n_y +3/2 ) ℏ sqrt(k/m ), which matches.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The problem involves finding the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). To solve this, the potential is analyzed and expressed in Cartesian coordinates. Using the identity \( \cos^2(\theta) = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \), the potential becomes:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \frac{x^2}{r^2} = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
\]

Since \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), the potential can be rewritten as:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This shows that the potential corresponds to two independent harmonic oscillators in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions, with different frequencies. The frequency in the \( x \)-direction is \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), and the frequency in the \( y \)-direction is \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

The energy spectrum for a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator is the sum of the energy levels in each direction. For the \( x \)-direction, the energy is \( E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x \), and for the \( y \)-direction, the energy is \( E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y \). Adding these gives the total energy:

\[
E = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y.
\]

Substituting \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) and \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), the energy becomes:

\[
E = \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[2\left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\right].
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
E = \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right].
\]

This matches the form given in option C. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
