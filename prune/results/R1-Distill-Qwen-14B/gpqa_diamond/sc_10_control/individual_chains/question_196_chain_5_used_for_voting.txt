Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed, v_max, of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The setup is that it has mass m and maximum amplitude A, and it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. The speed of light is c.

Wait, wait. Relativistic harmonic oscillator... I remember that in classical mechanics, the harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed that's derived from energy conservation. But in relativity, things are a bit different because of the effects of velocity approaching the speed of light. Oh right, in special relativity, as an object's speed approaches c, its relativistic mass increases, which affects the equations of motion.

So in the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA². Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That would be option C. But wait, this is the non-relativistic case. The problem is relativistic, so that's probably not the answer.

In the relativistic case, the energy equations change. The total energy of the oscillator would include relativistic kinetic energy. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, the system is a harmonic oscillator, so the potential energy and kinetic energy are still related. At maximum displacement (x = A), the potential energy is maximum, and kinetic energy is zero. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But I think in the relativistic case, the relationship between the energies isn't as straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the energy of the oscillator is quantized in a certain way, but the question is about the maximum speed in the classical scenario, so perhaps it's a matter of setting up the correct energy equation.

Wait, the problem says it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx, so it's not a quantum oscillator, but a classical relativistic one. So I'll model it as such.

In the relativistic case, the equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator would involve the relativistic momentum. The force is F = -kx, and F is the derivative of momentum with respect to time. But relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v.

So the equation of motion would be d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

But that's a bit complicated. Maybe it's easier to approach using energy.

The total energy E of the oscillator is the sum of rest mass energy (mc²) plus the kinetic energy. Wait, no—wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy from the spring. Or is it different?

Wait, in the classical relativistic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², just like in the non-relativistic case. But the kinetic energy is relativistic, so (gamma - 1)mc².

But wait, in the case of simple harmonic motion, the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved. So maybe the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and the maximum potential energy.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.

In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is the potential energy at maximum displacement. The kinetic energy is zero there. At the equilibrium point, all potential is converted to kinetic, which gives v = sqrt(kA²/m).

But in the relativistic case, since kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², maybe the total energy is (gamma_max) mc², where gamma_max is at the equilibrium point when all potential energy is converted to kinetic.

Wait, but the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy would be that potential energy plus the rest energy? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². But when the oscillator is at x=0, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy is E - mc² = (1/2)kA².

But wait, kinetic energy in special relativity is (gamma - 1) mc². So:

(gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

So gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2m c²).

Let me call (kA²)/(2m c²) = alpha for simplicity.

Then 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ) = 1 + alpha.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Then 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

That's [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding (1 + alpha)^2: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha².

So numerator becomes 2 alpha + alpha².

So v² = c² [ (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2 ]

But alpha is (kA²)/(2m c²), which is small if m is large and kA² isn't too big. But maybe for the purposes of this problem, we can keep it as is.

Alternatively, let me express in terms of v_max.

But the options don't look like they have this form. Let me look at the options.

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m))^2 )

Hmm, that seems more complicated.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)) )

Hmm, not sure.

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Wait, looking back, I have v² = c² [ (2 alpha + alpha²) ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ]

But alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me factor out alpha from numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator: 2 alpha + alpha² = alpha (2 + alpha)

Denominator: (1 + alpha)^2

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ]

Hmm, that seems messy. Let me plug back alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²)) ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator.

Numerator inside the brackets:

(k A²)/(2 m c²) * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]

= [k A² (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ] / (2 m c² )

Denominator:

(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ [k A² (2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) ] / (2 m c² (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²) ))^2 ) ]

Let me make substitution: let beta = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Then,

v^2 = c^2 * [ ( beta (2 + beta) ) / ( 2 m c² (1 + beta )^2 ) * c^2 )

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me re-express everything.

Wait, the denominator of the overall fraction is (2 m c²) times (1 + beta)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ (beta (2 + beta) ) / (2 m c^2 (1 + beta)^2) ) ]

Wait, but beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ), so beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Another way: perhaps using the virial theorem. The virial theorem relates the average kinetic and potential energies. For a harmonic oscillator, the average kinetic and potential energies are equal. But in the relativistic case, does this still hold?

Wait, classical virial theorem states that for a potential V(x) = (1/2)k x², the average kinetic energy <T> equals the average potential energy <V>. So in the non-relativistic case, that's true. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps using the energy equation at the maximum displacement.

At maximum displacement x = A, all energy is potential. Therefore, the total energy E is (1/2)k A². But wait, that's not correct in relativity because the rest mass energy is mc², which is separate. Or is the total energy E = mc² + (1/2)k A²?

Wait, no. Because in relativity, the rest mass energy is mc², and the potential energy is part of the total energy. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium point, x = 0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So,

gamma mc² - mc² = (1/2)k A².

Which brings us back to the same equation:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which I can rearrange to find v.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c² ) = alpha.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + alpha.

Then,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which simplifies to,

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding (1 + alpha)^2: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + 2 alpha + alpha²).

Hmm, that's again the same as before.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, none seem to match this directly. Let me look at option D:

D) v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let's compute 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

Which is [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Which is [ 1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Which is (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 (2 alpha + alpha^2)/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which can be written as,

v^2 = c^2 [ (alpha (2 + alpha)) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

But none of the options seem to match this. Let me look again.

Option B: v_max= c*sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, let me compute the expression inside the square root.

1 + 1/(1 - alpha'), where alpha' = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, but that doesn't look like what I have.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to consider the options and see which one can be transformed into my derived expression.

Wait, my expression for v_max is:

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2 )

Which is c * sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha )

Where alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Let me compute the denominator and numerator:

Numerator: sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) )

Denominator: 1 + alpha.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha )

Let me factor out alpha from the numerator inside the square root.

Wait, sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) = sqrt( alpha^2 (2/alpha + 1) )

Wait, no, perhaps factor alpha as alpha (1 + 2/ alpha )

Wait, not sure. Let me plug in alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) * ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] ) / ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2m))^2 )).

Wait, no, option A is v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2m))^2 ) )

Wait, no, actually option A is written as:

A) v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2m))^2 ) )

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in earlier steps. Alternatively, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, another approach: in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is sqrt(k A^2 / m ), which is option C. But in the relativistic case, this would be modified due to the gamma factor. So the maximum speed would be less than c.

Wait, but according to the energy approach, the maximum speed equation I got is v = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2)/(1 + alpha)^2 ), where alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Let me compute this expression.

Let me compute (2 alpha + alpha^2) over (1 + alpha)^2.

(2 alpha + alpha^2) = alpha (2 + alpha)

(1 + alpha)^2 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / ( (1 + alpha)^2 )

I can write this as [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, maybe there's a way to express this as [ (1 + alpha) - 1 ] * (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express (2 + alpha) as (1 + alpha) + 1.

So,

alpha [ (1 + alpha) + 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Which is alpha (1 + alpha + 1) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps expanding and factoring:

(2 alpha + alpha^2) = alpha (2 + alpha) = alpha (alpha + 2).

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Let me think about the answer options again.

Wait, looking at option D:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

So, inside the square root, it's 1 minus 1 over (1 + beta)^2, where beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)

Wait, 1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 = [ (1 + beta)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Which is (1 + 2 beta + beta^2 - 1 ) / (1 + beta)^2.

= (2 beta + beta^2) / (1 + beta)^2.

Which is the same as my earlier expression for v^2/c^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2 beta + beta^2)/(1 + beta)^2 = [beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Which matches with the expression I had earlier.

So, the formula would be:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which is c * sqrt( beta (2 + beta) ) / (1 + beta )

But wait, according to option D, it's sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 ), which is sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2) / (1 + beta )^2 ) ) = sqrt( [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta )^2 )

So, yes, the expression in option D is equivalent to my derived expression.

But wait, option D says:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is the same as what I have. So option D is correct?

Wait, but earlier when I computed the expression, I set E = mc^2 + (1/2)k A^2, and then set that equal to (gamma -1) mc^2 + mc^2 = gamma mc^2.

So, gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which led to v_max as given in option D.

So, the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me check the other options again.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2m))^2))

Wait, that would be 1 + something. But from my earlier calculation, the velocity was less than c, so the square root should be less than 1 if you have 1 - something.

Wait, no, the expression in option D is sqrt(1 - ... ), which makes sense because the velocity is less than c.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

But that would be 1 plus something, making the speed faster than c, which can't be right. So option B is incorrect.

Option C is the non-relativistic case, which would be applicable only if kA^2/(2 m c^2 ) is negligible, i.e., when velocities are much less than c. But the problem doesn't specify that, so the correct answer must account for relativity which is option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero. Thus, the total energy is:  
   \[
   E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]

   At the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \), all the potential energy is converted into relativistic kinetic energy. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:  
   \[
   K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Setting \( E = K + mc^2 \), we get:  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]
   Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \alpha}
   \]
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}
   \]
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}
   \]
   Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

3. **Verification of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{\left(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m}\right)^2}} \)  
     This is incorrect because it does not account for the relativistic energy correction involving \( c^2 \) in the denominator.

   - **Option B**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{\left(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)}} \)  
     This is incorrect because it incorrectly adds terms and does not match the derived expression.

   - **Option C**: \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \)  
     This is the non-relativistic result and does not account for relativistic effects.

   - **Option D**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}} \)  
     This matches the derived expression and is therefore correct.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**, as it accurately reflects the relativistic energy conservation and the resulting maximum speed of the oscillator.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed, v_max, of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The setup is that it has mass m and maximum amplitude A, and it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. The speed of light is c.

Wait, wait. Relativistic harmonic oscillator... I remember that in classical mechanics, the harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed that's derived from energy conservation. But in relativity, things are a bit different because of the effects of velocity approaching the speed of light. Oh right, in special relativity, as an object's speed approaches c, its relativistic mass increases, which affects the equations of motion.

So in the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA². Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That would be option C. But wait, this is the non-relativistic case. The problem is relativistic, so that's probably not the answer.

In the relativistic case, the energy equations change. The total energy of the oscillator would include relativistic kinetic energy. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, the system is a harmonic oscillator, so the potential energy and kinetic energy are still related. At maximum displacement (x = A), the potential energy is maximum, and kinetic energy is zero. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But I think in the relativistic case, the relationship between the energies isn't as straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the energy of the oscillator is quantized in a certain way, but the question is about the maximum speed in the classical scenario, so perhaps it's a matter of setting up the correct energy equation.

Wait, the problem says it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx, so it's not a quantum oscillator, but a classical relativistic one. So I'll model it as such.

In the relativistic case, the equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator would involve the relativistic momentum. The force is F = -kx, and F is the derivative of momentum with respect to time. But relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v.

So the equation of motion would be d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

But that's a bit complicated. Maybe it's easier to approach using energy.

The total energy E of the oscillator is the sum of rest mass energy (mc²) plus the kinetic energy. Wait, no—wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy from the spring. Or is it different?

Wait, in the classical relativistic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², just like in the non-relativistic case. But the kinetic energy is relativistic, so (gamma - 1)mc².

But wait, in the case of simple harmonic motion, the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved. So maybe the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and the maximum potential energy.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.

In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is the potential energy at maximum displacement. The kinetic energy is zero there. At the equilibrium point, all potential is converted to kinetic, which gives v = sqrt(kA²/m).

But in the relativistic case, since kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², maybe the total energy is (gamma_max) mc², where gamma_max is at the equilibrium point when all potential energy is converted to kinetic.

Wait, but the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy would be that potential energy plus the rest energy? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². But when the oscillator is at x=0, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy is E - mc² = (1/2)kA².

But wait, kinetic energy in special relativity is (gamma - 1) mc². So:

(gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

So gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2m c²).

Let me call (kA²)/(2m c²) = alpha for simplicity.

Then 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ) = 1 + alpha.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Then 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

That's [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding (1 + alpha)^2: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha².

So numerator becomes 2 alpha + alpha².

So v² = c² [ (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2 ]

But alpha is (kA²)/(2m c²), which is small if m is large and kA² isn't too big. But maybe for the purposes of this problem, we can keep it as is.

Alternatively, let me express in terms of v_max.

But the options don't look like they have this form. Let me look at the options.

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m))^2 )

Hmm, that seems more complicated.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)) )

Hmm, not sure.

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Wait, looking back, I have v² = c² [ (2 alpha + alpha²) ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ]

But alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me factor out alpha from numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator: 2 alpha + alpha² = alpha (2 + alpha)

Denominator: (1 + alpha)^2

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ]

Hmm, that seems messy. Let me plug back alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²)) ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator.

Numerator inside the brackets:

(k A²)/(2 m c²) * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]

= [k A² (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ] / (2 m c² )

Denominator:

(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ [k A² (2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) ] / (2 m c² (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²) ))^2 ) ]

Let me make substitution: let beta = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Then,

v^2 = c^2 * [ ( beta (2 + beta) ) / ( 2 m c² (1 + beta )^2 ) * c^2 )

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me re-express everything.

Wait, the denominator of the overall fraction is (2 m c²) times (1 + beta)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ (beta (2 + beta) ) / (2 m c^2 (1 + beta)^2) ) ]

Wait, but beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ), so beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Another way: perhaps using the virial theorem. The virial theorem relates the average kinetic and potential energies. For a harmonic oscillator, the average kinetic and potential energies are equal. But in the relativistic case, does this still hold?

Wait, classical virial theorem states that for a potential V(x) = (1/2)k x², the average kinetic energy <T> equals the average potential energy <V>. So in the non-relativistic case, that's true. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps using the energy equation at the maximum displacement.

At maximum displacement x = A, all energy is potential. Therefore, the total energy E is (1/2)k A². But wait, that's not correct in relativity because the rest mass energy is mc², which is separate. Or is the total energy E = mc² + (1/2)k A²?

Wait, no. Because in relativity, the rest mass energy is mc², and the potential energy is part of the total energy. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium point, x = 0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So,

gamma mc² - mc² = (1/2)k A².

Which brings us back to the same equation:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which I can rearrange to find v.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c² ) = alpha.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + alpha.

Then,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which simplifies to,

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding (1 + alpha)^2: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + 2 alpha + alpha²).

Hmm, that's again the same as before.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, none seem to match this directly. Let me look at option D:

D) v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let's compute 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

Which is [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Which is [ 1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Which is (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 (2 alpha + alpha^2)/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which can be written as,

v^2 = c^2 [ (alpha (2 + alpha)) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

But none of the options seem to match this. Let me look again.

Option B: v_max= c*sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, let me compute the expression inside the square root.

1 + 1/(1 - alpha'), where alpha' = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, but that doesn't look like what I have.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to consider the options and see which one can be transformed into my derived expression.

Wait, my expression for v_max is:

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2 )

Which is c * sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha )

Where alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Let me compute the denominator and numerator:

Numerator: sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) )

Denominator: 1 + alpha.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha )

Let me factor out alpha from the numerator inside the square root.

Wait, sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) = sqrt( alpha^2 (2/alpha + 1) )

Wait, no, perhaps factor alpha as alpha (1 + 2/ alpha )

Wait, not sure. Let me plug in alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) * ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] ) / ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2m))^2 )).

Wait, no, option A is v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2m))^2 ) )

Wait, no, actually option A is written as:

A) v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2m))^2 ) )

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in earlier steps. Alternatively, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, another approach: in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is sqrt(k A^2 / m ), which is option C. But in the relativistic case, this would be modified due to the gamma factor. So the maximum speed would be less than c.

Wait, but according to the energy approach, the maximum speed equation I got is v = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2)/(1 + alpha)^2 ), where alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Let me compute this expression.

Let me compute (2 alpha + alpha^2) over (1 + alpha)^2.

(2 alpha + alpha^2) = alpha (2 + alpha)

(1 + alpha)^2 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / ( (1 + alpha)^2 )

I can write this as [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, maybe there's a way to express this as [ (1 + alpha) - 1 ] * (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express (2 + alpha) as (1 + alpha) + 1.

So,

alpha [ (1 + alpha) + 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Which is alpha (1 + alpha + 1) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps expanding and factoring:

(2 alpha + alpha^2) = alpha (2 + alpha) = alpha (alpha + 2).

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Let me think about the answer options again.

Wait, looking at option D:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

So, inside the square root, it's 1 minus 1 over (1 + beta)^2, where beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)

Wait, 1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 = [ (1 + beta)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Which is (1 + 2 beta + beta^2 - 1 ) / (1 + beta)^2.

= (2 beta + beta^2) / (1 + beta)^2.

Which is the same as my earlier expression for v^2/c^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2 beta + beta^2)/(1 + beta)^2 = [beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Which matches with the expression I had earlier.

So, the formula would be:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which is c * sqrt( beta (2 + beta) ) / (1 + beta )

But wait, according to option D, it's sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 ), which is sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2) / (1 + beta )^2 ) ) = sqrt( [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta )^2 )

So, yes, the expression in option D is equivalent to my derived expression.

But wait, option D says:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is the same as what I have. So option D is correct?

Wait, but earlier when I computed the expression, I set E = mc^2 + (1/2)k A^2, and then set that equal to (gamma -1) mc^2 + mc^2 = gamma mc^2.

So, gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which led to v_max as given in option D.

So, the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me check the other options again.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2m))^2))

Wait, that would be 1 + something. But from my earlier calculation, the velocity was less than c, so the square root should be less than 1 if you have 1 - something.

Wait, no, the expression in option D is sqrt(1 - ... ), which makes sense because the velocity is less than c.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

But that would be 1 plus something, making the speed faster than c, which can't be right. So option B is incorrect.

Option C is the non-relativistic case, which would be applicable only if kA^2/(2 m c^2 ) is negligible, i.e., when velocities are much less than c. But the problem doesn't specify that, so the correct answer must account for relativity which is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero. Thus, the total energy is:  
   \[
   E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]

   At the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \), all the potential energy is converted into relativistic kinetic energy. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:  
   \[
   K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Setting \( E = K + mc^2 \), we get:  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]
   Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \alpha}
   \]
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}
   \]
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}
   \]
   Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

3. **Verification of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{\left(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m}\right)^2}} \)  
     This is incorrect because it does not account for the relativistic energy correction involving \( c^2 \) in the denominator.

   - **Option B**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{\left(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)}} \)  
     This is incorrect because it incorrectly adds terms and does not match the derived expression.

   - **Option C**: \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \)  
     This is the non-relativistic result and does not account for relativistic effects.

   - **Option D**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}} \)  
     This matches the derived expression and is therefore correct.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**, as it accurately reflects the relativistic energy conservation and the resulting maximum speed of the oscillator.
