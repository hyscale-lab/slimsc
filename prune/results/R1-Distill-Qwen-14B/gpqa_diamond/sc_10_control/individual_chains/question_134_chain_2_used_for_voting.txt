Okay, so I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, enthalpy of neutralization is usually about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. The typical reaction is H+ from the acid reacting with OH- from the base to form water. The standard enthalpy for this is about -57 kJ per mole, but wait, I'm not sure if that applies here directly because there are multiple acids and bases involved.

So, the problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I think I should find out how much H+ and OH- each contributes. 

Let's break down each solution:

1. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.
   Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M.
   Moles of HCl = Molarity * Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles.
   So, H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

2. H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. It's a strong acid, but it's diprotic. So in the first dissociation, it releases 2 H+ ions per molecule. Wait, actually, the first dissociation is complete, releasing 2 H+? No, wait, wait. Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation, but the second (HSO4- → SO4^2- + H+) is weaker, but I think for a 0.3 M solution, it's considered that it donates 2 H+ per mole. Wait, no, actually, in the case of H2SO4, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait. Wait, correction: Actually, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Wait, no, no. Hold on. No, that's incorrect. Wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no. That's not right. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me think. H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation. The first H+ comes off completely: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no. Actually, the first step is H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- (but this is a strong acid, so it's complete). The second step is HSO4^- ⇌ H+ + SO4^2-, which is only partially dissociated. But since the solution is in water, and for concentrated solutions, the HSO4^- might dissociate further. But for the purposes of neutralization, maybe we can ignore the second H+ if it's a weak acid? Wait, no, because when you mix with a base, the H+ will react. So perhaps for this problem, we can assume that H2SO4 contributes two H+ per mole. Because when mixed with a strong base, any available H+ will be neutralized.

Wait, but actually, H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation, which releases 2 H+? No, wait. No, no, no. Wait, correction: The correct dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, no. Wait, no, I'm wrong. H2SO4 is a strong acid but in the first dissociation, it completely dissociates into 2 H+ ions and SO4^2-? No, wait, no, no. Wait, no, wait: Wait, when H2SO4 is dissolved in water, the first H+ is completely released, but the second is not. So, H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- is not correct. Actually, it's H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- only in concentrated sulfuric acid, but I think in aqueous solution, the first dissociation is complete, but the second isn't. So, in a 0.3 M H2SO4 solution, each mole would give 2 moles of H+? Wait, no. Wait, no, no. Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, no: Sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-?) No, that's not correct. No, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- (which is complete because it's a strong acid). The second dissociation, HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2- is only about 1.5% for 0.1 M solution. So in 0.3 M H2SO4, not all HSO4^- will dissociate. But for neutralization, how much H+ is available?

Wait, the problem is when you mix H2SO4 (an acid) with Ba(OH)2 (a base), the H+ from H2SO4 and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react.

So, for H2SO4, how many moles of H+ can it contribute? Since the first dissociation is complete, each mole of H2SO4 gives 1 mole of H+ (as H+), and then the HSO4^- can donate another H+, but it's a weak acid. So in the case of neutralization, all the H+ (from the first dissociation) is available, but the second H+ may not be fully available unless the solution is strongly acidic.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that H2SO4 contributes 2 moles of H+ per mole. Because that's a common approach in stoichiometry for strong diacids. Alternatively, perhaps the problem ignores the second H+ because the base might be in excess, or because it's a neutralization reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the problem again.

The problem states that three solutions are mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So, all are being mixed together, so all H+ and OH- will come into play.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization. Neutralization is when acid and base react to form water and salt. But the presence of multiple acids and a base complicates things. So, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then find out which is in excess, and then calculate the heat based on the limiting reactant.

So, first, calculate moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Each provides 2 H+ (since it's a diprotic acid, and both H+ ions are available for neutralization?), so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Wait, but wait. If the first H+ is fully dissociated, but the second is weak, then the second H+ might not be fully available. But perhaps in this problem, we're supposed to assume that all H+ from H2SO4 is available. So 0.09 moles of H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2: it's a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, so total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles H+.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

So, in the reaction, H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change is per mole of H+ neutralized.

So, the limiting reactant here is OH-: 0.2 moles. Because H+ is 0.28, which is more than OH- (0.2).

So, all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, neutralizing 0.2 moles of H+.

The remaining H+ is 0.08 moles, which doesn't react because there's no more OH-.

So, the amount of H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles.

The standard enthalpy change for neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (since each H+ contributes to a water molecule).

So, the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but let's double-check the calculations.

Wait, HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ available: 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol → gives 0.2 mol OH-.

So, OH- is 0.2; H+ is 0.28.

So, OH- is limiting. So, 0.2 moles of H+ will react with OH-.

Each mole of H+ neutralized releases about 57 kJ (exothermic, so negative).

Wait, but wait. Wait, wait. No, wait, when H+ reacts with OH- to form water, that's one mole each. So for each mole of H+ neutralized, it's -57 kJ.

So, 0.2 moles → 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But wait, the options are given in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again.

Looking back at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm, so option B is in kcal. Wait, but wait, 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal. So, 11.4 kJ would be about 2.72 kcal. So, -11.4 kJ is -26.4 kcal. Wait, no, wait: No, 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So, to convert kJ to kcal, divide by 4.184.

So, 11.4 kJ is approximately 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So, -11.4 kJ is -2.72 kcal. So, option A is -2.72 kcal, which would correspond to 11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the initial calculation gives -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Am I considering the correct amount of H+ available from H2SO4? Because perhaps H2SO4 only contributes one H+ per mole in this scenario.

Wait, if H2SO4 only donates one H+ per mole, then the total H+ would be:

HCl: 0.1.

H2SO4: 0.09 * 1 = 0.09.

Total H+ = 0.19.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles OH-.

So, OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.19. Now, H+ is the limiting reactant. So 0.19 moles of H+ will react.

Enthalpy change would be 0.19 * (-57 kJ) = -10.83 kJ.

Hmm, but that's about -10.8 kJ, which doesn't match the options either.

Wait, but perhaps the H2SO4 contributes two H+? Because the first H+ is strong, so it's available, and perhaps the second one is not, but for neutralization, maybe it's considered as available.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the problem is asking for the total H+ from all sources, but the neutralization can only proceed as much as the limiting reagent allows.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Let me recalculate the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → gives 0.2 OH-.

So, H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2.

OH- is the limiting reagent. So, 0.2 moles of H+ will react.

Thus, enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options is exactly -11.4 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different enthalpy value. Like, maybe, for each mole of H2O formed, the enthalpy is -57.3 kJ. So, each mole of H+ gives -57.3 kJ.

So, 0.2 moles would give 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ, so -11.46 kJ.

But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, wait, because 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 kcal (11.46 / 4.184 ≈ 2.74), so it would be approximately -2.74 kcal. But option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate in kcal. Let me think.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given as -57.3 kJ/mol, which is approximately -13.7 kcal/mol (since 57.3 /4.184 ≈ 13.7).

Wait, 57.3 kJ is about 13.7 kcal. So, if 0.2 moles of H+ react, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ, which is about -11.46 / 4.184 ≈ -2.735 kcal. So, approximately -2.74 kcal. But option A is -2.72 kcal. Close enough.

Wait, but the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, if the problem expects the answer in kJ, then the answer is -11.4 kJ, but none of the options is that. Option D is -16 kJ, which is larger than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps I overlooked the fact that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole contributes 2 H+ ions. So, with 0.09 moles of H2SO4, that's 0.18 H+ as I calculated. HCl contributes 0.1 H+. So total H+ is 0.28.

But Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 OH-. So, both H+ and OH- combine 1:1. So 0.2 H+ will combine with 0.2 OH-.

But wait, the enthalpy per mole is for each mole of H+ neutralized. So 0.2 moles × 57.3 kJ/mol → -11.46 kJ.

But none of the options is exactly that. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the units of the options. Option D is in kJ, others in kcal. So maybe the correct answer is D, but the calculation is 0.2 ×57.3 = 11.46 ≈ 11.5, but option D is -16. So that's not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated the moles.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- correctly.

Wait, HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 OH-.

So, total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Total OH- = 0.2.

Since H+ is more, OH- is limiting. So neutralization is 0.2 H+ + 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O.

Each mole of H2O releases 57.3 kJ of heat. So, 0.2 moles → 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm. So none of the options match this.

Wait, what if the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy? Like -55 kJ/mol? Let's see: 0.2 *55=11 kJ → -11 kJ. Still doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem takes into account the concentration of the solutions and the dilution. Wait, but the question is about the enthalpy change upon mixing, not about the heat released due to dilution. Or is it?

Wait, no, the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat change when an acid and base react to form water. It's usually per mole of H+ neutralized. So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the volume and calculate the concentration. No, because we've already calculated the moles.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal. So, 11.46 kJ is approximately 2.74 kcal. So, -2.74 kcal. The closest option is A) -2.72 kcal.

But I thought in the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. So, if the problem had the answer in kcal based on the same 0.2 moles * 57.3 kJ/mol, but 57.3 kJ is 13.77 kcal. So 0.2 * 13.77 = 2.754 kcal, which is about -2.75 kcal. So the closest is option A.

So the answer should be option A? Or is there a mistake in the approach?

Alternatively, perhaps I have to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- correctly, considering that H2SO4 contributes only one H+ because the second is weak.

Wait, if H2SO4 contributes only one H+ per mole, then H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09. So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.09 = 0.19.

OH- is 0.2. So H+ is limiting. So 0.19 H+ reacts with 0.19 OH-, leaving 0.01 OH- unreacted.

Enthalpy change is 0.19 * 57.3 kJ = 10.89 kJ → -10.89 kJ.

Which is about -2.59 kcal (10.89 /4.184 ≈ 2.6).

But this doesn't match any options either.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the enthalpy per mole of H2SO4 or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the stoichiometry wrong. Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- per formula unit. So, perhaps the neutralization requires H+ from the acid to neutralize the OH-.

Wait, each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles OH-.

So, in H+ + OH- → H2O: 1:1 ratio.

So, moles of H+ available: 0.28.

Moles OH-: 0.2.

But how much H+ can OH- react with? 0.2 moles.

So, the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles.

So, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D: -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is mixing all three solutions, which could change the concentration, but the enthalpy change is per mole, so concentration shouldn't affect it.

Wait, unless the problem is considering the heat of solution as part of the neutralization, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires us to calculate moles of H+ and OH- correctly, but I think I've done that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the H2SO4 calculation. Let me recalculate.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol.

Each mole gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

HCl: 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 → 0.1 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

Thus, reaction consumes 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

Enthalpy: 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ; so -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

So, looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ. That's higher, implying more H+ neutralized. How?

Wait, maybe the H2SO4 is considered to contribute two H+ per mole, but the HCl is 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 OH-.

So, 0.2 H+ is neutralized, leading to -11.46 kJ.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the value -16.0 kJ as the standard enthalpy, perhaps taking into account other factors like the dilution. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each mole of H2SO4 contributes 2 moles of H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 contributes 2 moles of OH-, but perhaps I'm considering the stoichiometry correctly.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy in calories, not kilojoules. Oh, wait, the options include both kcal and kJ. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute in kJ, but the answer isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a different way of calculating the moles.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation. Let me check.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles → 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles → 0.2 OH-.

So, H+ is 0.28; OH- is 0.2.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of H2SO4 as a diprotic acid, so the reaction would be H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O. But in that case, the reaction would be 1 mole H2SO4 + 1 mole Ba(OH)2 → 1 mole BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So, the reaction for H2SO4 is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O. The stoichiometry here is 1:1 for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

So, moles of H2SO4 = 0.09 mol. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.1 mol.

So, H2SO4 is limiting here.

So, 0.09 moles of H2SO4 reacting with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2.

Each mole of H2SO4 would release 2 moles of H2O, but the enthalpy change per mole would be for 2 moles of H2O.

Wait, the standard neutralization enthalpy is per mole of H+ neutralized. So, for each mole of H2SO4 reacting, 2 moles of H+ are neutralized.

So, 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+ neutralized.

Then, the HCl would contribute 0.1 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2 has 0.1 moles, but after reacting with H2SO4, how much is left?

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol is needed to neutralize 0.09 mol H2SO4 (since 1:1). So, after that, Ba(OH)2 has 0.1 -0.09 = 0.01 mol left? No, because each Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

Wait, perhaps this approach is complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the heat released from each acid reacting with the base.

Wait, but this seems more involved. Let me think: the total H+ is 0.28 (from HCl and H2SO4), and the total OH- is 0.2.

So, the neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O, which is 0.2 moles.

So, the heat is 0.2 × 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ → -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have that. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I account for H2SO4. Let me think again. Maybe I should consider that H2SO4 contributes only one H+ for the neutralization because the second H+ is weak. So, in that case, the total H+ is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.09 (H2SO4) = 0.19.

Then, OH- is 0.2. So, 0.19 moles of H+ react, resulting in 0.19 ×57.3 = 10.89 kJ → -10.89 kJ.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H+ to be -13.7 kcal/mol (which is 57.3 kJ/mol).

So, 0.2 moles → 0.2 ×13.7 = 2.74 kcal. So, approximately -2.74 kcal. Closest option is A) -2.72 kcal.

But why would the problem give options in both kcal and kJ? It’s a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation in kJ, but the answer isn't present. But this seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the dilution. Maybe the temperature change is considered, but I don't think so because the question is about enthalpy of neutralization, which is a molar quantity.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial calculation of moles.

Wait, let me recheck:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol.

Calculations are correct.

So, after considering all possibilities, the correct enthalpy change is approximately -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.74 kcal. The closest option is A) -2.72 kcal, but it's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value, like -55.8 kJ/mol for the neutralization, which would give 0.2 ×55.8 = 11.16 kJ → -11.16 kJ, which is approximately -2.67 kcal, which is close to option A.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the value -57 kJ/mol for each mole of H+ neutralized, leading to 0.2 ×57 = -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal. So, option A.

So, the answer would be A) -2.72 kcal.

Alternatively, if the calculation is done using 57.3 kJ per mole, and the problem expects the answer in kJ, but that's not an option. Therefore, I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm a bit uncertain because the options are a mix of kcal and kJ.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely.  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete, releasing 2 moles of H⁺ per mole of H₂SO₄.  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Calculate total moles of H⁺**:  
   Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, (\text{from HCl}) + 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, (\text{from H₂SO₄}) = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

4. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and dissociates completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ releases 2 moles of OH⁻.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

5. **Determine the limiting reactant**:  
   The reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \), which occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio.  
   Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), and total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, as it is present in smaller quantity.

6. **Calculate the enthalpy change**:  
   The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ neutralized.  
   Since \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ reacts, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ is neutralized.  
   Enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   Converting to kcal: \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).

7. **Match with the options**:  
   The closest option to \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \) is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **A) -2.72 kcal**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, enthalpy of neutralization is usually about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. The typical reaction is H+ from the acid reacting with OH- from the base to form water. The standard enthalpy for this is about -57 kJ per mole, but wait, I'm not sure if that applies here directly because there are multiple acids and bases involved.

So, the problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I think I should find out how much H+ and OH- each contributes. 

Let's break down each solution:

1. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.
   Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M.
   Moles of HCl = Molarity * Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles.
   So, H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

2. H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. It's a strong acid, but it's diprotic. So in the first dissociation, it releases 2 H+ ions per molecule. Wait, actually, the first dissociation is complete, releasing 2 H+? No, wait, wait. Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation, but the second (HSO4- → SO4^2- + H+) is weaker, but I think for a 0.3 M solution, it's considered that it donates 2 H+ per mole. Wait, no, actually, in the case of H2SO4, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait. Wait, correction: Actually, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Wait, no, no. Hold on. No, that's incorrect. Wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no. That's not right. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me think. H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation. The first H+ comes off completely: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no. Actually, the first step is H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- (but this is a strong acid, so it's complete). The second step is HSO4^- ⇌ H+ + SO4^2-, which is only partially dissociated. But since the solution is in water, and for concentrated solutions, the HSO4^- might dissociate further. But for the purposes of neutralization, maybe we can ignore the second H+ if it's a weak acid? Wait, no, because when you mix with a base, the H+ will react. So perhaps for this problem, we can assume that H2SO4 contributes two H+ per mole. Because when mixed with a strong base, any available H+ will be neutralized.

Wait, but actually, H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation, which releases 2 H+? No, wait. No, no, no. Wait, correction: The correct dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, no. Wait, no, I'm wrong. H2SO4 is a strong acid but in the first dissociation, it completely dissociates into 2 H+ ions and SO4^2-? No, wait, no, no. Wait, no, wait: Wait, when H2SO4 is dissolved in water, the first H+ is completely released, but the second is not. So, H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- is not correct. Actually, it's H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- only in concentrated sulfuric acid, but I think in aqueous solution, the first dissociation is complete, but the second isn't. So, in a 0.3 M H2SO4 solution, each mole would give 2 moles of H+? Wait, no. Wait, no, no. Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, no: Sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-?) No, that's not correct. No, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- (which is complete because it's a strong acid). The second dissociation, HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2- is only about 1.5% for 0.1 M solution. So in 0.3 M H2SO4, not all HSO4^- will dissociate. But for neutralization, how much H+ is available?

Wait, the problem is when you mix H2SO4 (an acid) with Ba(OH)2 (a base), the H+ from H2SO4 and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react.

So, for H2SO4, how many moles of H+ can it contribute? Since the first dissociation is complete, each mole of H2SO4 gives 1 mole of H+ (as H+), and then the HSO4^- can donate another H+, but it's a weak acid. So in the case of neutralization, all the H+ (from the first dissociation) is available, but the second H+ may not be fully available unless the solution is strongly acidic.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that H2SO4 contributes 2 moles of H+ per mole. Because that's a common approach in stoichiometry for strong diacids. Alternatively, perhaps the problem ignores the second H+ because the base might be in excess, or because it's a neutralization reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the problem again.

The problem states that three solutions are mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So, all are being mixed together, so all H+ and OH- will come into play.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization. Neutralization is when acid and base react to form water and salt. But the presence of multiple acids and a base complicates things. So, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then find out which is in excess, and then calculate the heat based on the limiting reactant.

So, first, calculate moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Each provides 2 H+ (since it's a diprotic acid, and both H+ ions are available for neutralization?), so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Wait, but wait. If the first H+ is fully dissociated, but the second is weak, then the second H+ might not be fully available. But perhaps in this problem, we're supposed to assume that all H+ from H2SO4 is available. So 0.09 moles of H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2: it's a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, so total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles H+.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

So, in the reaction, H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change is per mole of H+ neutralized.

So, the limiting reactant here is OH-: 0.2 moles. Because H+ is 0.28, which is more than OH- (0.2).

So, all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, neutralizing 0.2 moles of H+.

The remaining H+ is 0.08 moles, which doesn't react because there's no more OH-.

So, the amount of H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles.

The standard enthalpy change for neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (since each H+ contributes to a water molecule).

So, the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but let's double-check the calculations.

Wait, HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ available: 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol → gives 0.2 mol OH-.

So, OH- is 0.2; H+ is 0.28.

So, OH- is limiting. So, 0.2 moles of H+ will react with OH-.

Each mole of H+ neutralized releases about 57 kJ (exothermic, so negative).

Wait, but wait. Wait, wait. No, wait, when H+ reacts with OH- to form water, that's one mole each. So for each mole of H+ neutralized, it's -57 kJ.

So, 0.2 moles → 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But wait, the options are given in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again.

Looking back at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm, so option B is in kcal. Wait, but wait, 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal. So, 11.4 kJ would be about 2.72 kcal. So, -11.4 kJ is -26.4 kcal. Wait, no, wait: No, 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So, to convert kJ to kcal, divide by 4.184.

So, 11.4 kJ is approximately 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So, -11.4 kJ is -2.72 kcal. So, option A is -2.72 kcal, which would correspond to 11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the initial calculation gives -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Am I considering the correct amount of H+ available from H2SO4? Because perhaps H2SO4 only contributes one H+ per mole in this scenario.

Wait, if H2SO4 only donates one H+ per mole, then the total H+ would be:

HCl: 0.1.

H2SO4: 0.09 * 1 = 0.09.

Total H+ = 0.19.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles OH-.

So, OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.19. Now, H+ is the limiting reactant. So 0.19 moles of H+ will react.

Enthalpy change would be 0.19 * (-57 kJ) = -10.83 kJ.

Hmm, but that's about -10.8 kJ, which doesn't match the options either.

Wait, but perhaps the H2SO4 contributes two H+? Because the first H+ is strong, so it's available, and perhaps the second one is not, but for neutralization, maybe it's considered as available.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the problem is asking for the total H+ from all sources, but the neutralization can only proceed as much as the limiting reagent allows.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Let me recalculate the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → gives 0.2 OH-.

So, H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2.

OH- is the limiting reagent. So, 0.2 moles of H+ will react.

Thus, enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options is exactly -11.4 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different enthalpy value. Like, maybe, for each mole of H2O formed, the enthalpy is -57.3 kJ. So, each mole of H+ gives -57.3 kJ.

So, 0.2 moles would give 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ, so -11.46 kJ.

But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, wait, because 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 kcal (11.46 / 4.184 ≈ 2.74), so it would be approximately -2.74 kcal. But option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate in kcal. Let me think.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given as -57.3 kJ/mol, which is approximately -13.7 kcal/mol (since 57.3 /4.184 ≈ 13.7).

Wait, 57.3 kJ is about 13.7 kcal. So, if 0.2 moles of H+ react, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ, which is about -11.46 / 4.184 ≈ -2.735 kcal. So, approximately -2.74 kcal. But option A is -2.72 kcal. Close enough.

Wait, but the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, if the problem expects the answer in kJ, then the answer is -11.4 kJ, but none of the options is that. Option D is -16 kJ, which is larger than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps I overlooked the fact that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole contributes 2 H+ ions. So, with 0.09 moles of H2SO4, that's 0.18 H+ as I calculated. HCl contributes 0.1 H+. So total H+ is 0.28.

But Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 OH-. So, both H+ and OH- combine 1:1. So 0.2 H+ will combine with 0.2 OH-.

But wait, the enthalpy per mole is for each mole of H+ neutralized. So 0.2 moles × 57.3 kJ/mol → -11.46 kJ.

But none of the options is exactly that. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the units of the options. Option D is in kJ, others in kcal. So maybe the correct answer is D, but the calculation is 0.2 ×57.3 = 11.46 ≈ 11.5, but option D is -16. So that's not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated the moles.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- correctly.

Wait, HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 OH-.

So, total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Total OH- = 0.2.

Since H+ is more, OH- is limiting. So neutralization is 0.2 H+ + 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O.

Each mole of H2O releases 57.3 kJ of heat. So, 0.2 moles → 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm. So none of the options match this.

Wait, what if the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy? Like -55 kJ/mol? Let's see: 0.2 *55=11 kJ → -11 kJ. Still doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem takes into account the concentration of the solutions and the dilution. Wait, but the question is about the enthalpy change upon mixing, not about the heat released due to dilution. Or is it?

Wait, no, the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat change when an acid and base react to form water. It's usually per mole of H+ neutralized. So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the volume and calculate the concentration. No, because we've already calculated the moles.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal. So, 11.46 kJ is approximately 2.74 kcal. So, -2.74 kcal. The closest option is A) -2.72 kcal.

But I thought in the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. So, if the problem had the answer in kcal based on the same 0.2 moles * 57.3 kJ/mol, but 57.3 kJ is 13.77 kcal. So 0.2 * 13.77 = 2.754 kcal, which is about -2.75 kcal. So the closest is option A.

So the answer should be option A? Or is there a mistake in the approach?

Alternatively, perhaps I have to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- correctly, considering that H2SO4 contributes only one H+ because the second is weak.

Wait, if H2SO4 contributes only one H+ per mole, then H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09. So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.09 = 0.19.

OH- is 0.2. So H+ is limiting. So 0.19 H+ reacts with 0.19 OH-, leaving 0.01 OH- unreacted.

Enthalpy change is 0.19 * 57.3 kJ = 10.89 kJ → -10.89 kJ.

Which is about -2.59 kcal (10.89 /4.184 ≈ 2.6).

But this doesn't match any options either.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the enthalpy per mole of H2SO4 or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the stoichiometry wrong. Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- per formula unit. So, perhaps the neutralization requires H+ from the acid to neutralize the OH-.

Wait, each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles OH-.

So, in H+ + OH- → H2O: 1:1 ratio.

So, moles of H+ available: 0.28.

Moles OH-: 0.2.

But how much H+ can OH- react with? 0.2 moles.

So, the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles.

So, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D: -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is mixing all three solutions, which could change the concentration, but the enthalpy change is per mole, so concentration shouldn't affect it.

Wait, unless the problem is considering the heat of solution as part of the neutralization, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires us to calculate moles of H+ and OH- correctly, but I think I've done that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the H2SO4 calculation. Let me recalculate.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol.

Each mole gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

HCl: 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 → 0.1 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

Thus, reaction consumes 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

Enthalpy: 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ; so -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

So, looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ. That's higher, implying more H+ neutralized. How?

Wait, maybe the H2SO4 is considered to contribute two H+ per mole, but the HCl is 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 OH-.

So, 0.2 H+ is neutralized, leading to -11.46 kJ.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the value -16.0 kJ as the standard enthalpy, perhaps taking into account other factors like the dilution. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each mole of H2SO4 contributes 2 moles of H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 contributes 2 moles of OH-, but perhaps I'm considering the stoichiometry correctly.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy in calories, not kilojoules. Oh, wait, the options include both kcal and kJ. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute in kJ, but the answer isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a different way of calculating the moles.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation. Let me check.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles → 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles → 0.2 OH-.

So, H+ is 0.28; OH- is 0.2.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of H2SO4 as a diprotic acid, so the reaction would be H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O. But in that case, the reaction would be 1 mole H2SO4 + 1 mole Ba(OH)2 → 1 mole BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So, the reaction for H2SO4 is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O. The stoichiometry here is 1:1 for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

So, moles of H2SO4 = 0.09 mol. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.1 mol.

So, H2SO4 is limiting here.

So, 0.09 moles of H2SO4 reacting with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2.

Each mole of H2SO4 would release 2 moles of H2O, but the enthalpy change per mole would be for 2 moles of H2O.

Wait, the standard neutralization enthalpy is per mole of H+ neutralized. So, for each mole of H2SO4 reacting, 2 moles of H+ are neutralized.

So, 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+ neutralized.

Then, the HCl would contribute 0.1 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2 has 0.1 moles, but after reacting with H2SO4, how much is left?

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol is needed to neutralize 0.09 mol H2SO4 (since 1:1). So, after that, Ba(OH)2 has 0.1 -0.09 = 0.01 mol left? No, because each Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

Wait, perhaps this approach is complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the heat released from each acid reacting with the base.

Wait, but this seems more involved. Let me think: the total H+ is 0.28 (from HCl and H2SO4), and the total OH- is 0.2.

So, the neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O, which is 0.2 moles.

So, the heat is 0.2 × 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ → -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have that. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I account for H2SO4. Let me think again. Maybe I should consider that H2SO4 contributes only one H+ for the neutralization because the second H+ is weak. So, in that case, the total H+ is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.09 (H2SO4) = 0.19.

Then, OH- is 0.2. So, 0.19 moles of H+ react, resulting in 0.19 ×57.3 = 10.89 kJ → -10.89 kJ.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H+ to be -13.7 kcal/mol (which is 57.3 kJ/mol).

So, 0.2 moles → 0.2 ×13.7 = 2.74 kcal. So, approximately -2.74 kcal. Closest option is A) -2.72 kcal.

But why would the problem give options in both kcal and kJ? It’s a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation in kJ, but the answer isn't present. But this seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the dilution. Maybe the temperature change is considered, but I don't think so because the question is about enthalpy of neutralization, which is a molar quantity.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial calculation of moles.

Wait, let me recheck:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol.

Calculations are correct.

So, after considering all possibilities, the correct enthalpy change is approximately -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.74 kcal. The closest option is A) -2.72 kcal, but it's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value, like -55.8 kJ/mol for the neutralization, which would give 0.2 ×55.8 = 11.16 kJ → -11.16 kJ, which is approximately -2.67 kcal, which is close to option A.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the value -57 kJ/mol for each mole of H+ neutralized, leading to 0.2 ×57 = -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal. So, option A.

So, the answer would be A) -2.72 kcal.

Alternatively, if the calculation is done using 57.3 kJ per mole, and the problem expects the answer in kJ, but that's not an option. Therefore, I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm a bit uncertain because the options are a mix of kcal and kJ.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely.  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete, releasing 2 moles of H⁺ per mole of H₂SO₄.  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Calculate total moles of H⁺**:  
   Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, (\text{from HCl}) + 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, (\text{from H₂SO₄}) = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

4. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and dissociates completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ releases 2 moles of OH⁻.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

5. **Determine the limiting reactant**:  
   The reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \), which occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio.  
   Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), and total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, as it is present in smaller quantity.

6. **Calculate the enthalpy change**:  
   The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ neutralized.  
   Since \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ reacts, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ is neutralized.  
   Enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   Converting to kcal: \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).

7. **Match with the options**:  
   The closest option to \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \) is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **A) -2.72 kcal**.

Answer: A
