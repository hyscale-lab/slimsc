Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the color of light it absorbs. Hmm, I remember that when something absorbs a certain wavelength of light, it emits the complementary color. Wait, no, actually, I think it's more about the energy of the absorbed light determining the color we see. Let me think.

The question says the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. So, I need to figure out which color that corresponds to. I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. So maybe I should calculate the wavelength first.

Let me jot down the numbers. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The energy given is 2.3393 eV. Oh wait, I need to convert that to joules because the units for h and c are in SI units.

1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So, 2.3393 eV multiplied by that. Let me calculate that: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.745e-19 J. So E is approximately 3.745e-19 J.

Now plug into E = hc/λ. Rearranging for λ gives λ = hc/E. Substituting the numbers: (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / 3.745e-19 J. Let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 3.745e-19 J: 1.9878e-25 / 3.745e-19 ≈ 5.31e-7 meters. Oh wait, 5.31e-7 meters is 531 nm. Because 1e-9 meters is a nanometer, so 531 nm.

Wait, what's the visible spectrum range? It's roughly 400-700 nm. So 531 nm is in the visible range. Now, what color is that? I remember the colors: red is about 700 nm, orange around 600, yellow around 570, green around 530, blue around 470, and violet around 400.

Wait, 531 is close to 530, which is green. So the dye emits green light? But the question is about the color absorbed. Wait, wait, no. The question says the dye emits light with that energy. So when something emits light, it's because it's releasing energy. The absorbed light must have higher energy because it's promoting an electron, right?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. If the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, that means that's the energy of the photon it emits. When a compound absorbs light, it's because it's absorbing a photon with energy corresponding to a transition. The energy of the emitted photon would be the difference between the higher and lower energy states. So the absorbed photon would have higher energy than the emitted one?

No, wait. The process is: when the compound absorbs a photon, it excites an electron to a higher energy level. Then, when the electron drops back down, it emits a photon with the energy difference. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the energy gap between the states. The emitted photon's energy is the same as the energy gap. So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, that's the energy of the absorbed photon too.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The initial state is lower energy, and the excited state is higher. The photon absorbed has energy equal to the gap. Then, when it emits, it could emit that same photon if it goes back to the ground state, but sometimes it might emit lower energy photons if it goes to an intermediate state. But in this case, the question says it emits at 2.3393 eV, so that's the energy of the emitted photon. So the absorbed photon would have the same energy, right? Because the energy difference is the same. So the color emitted is the same as the absorbed? No, wait no, that's where the confusion comes in.

Wait no, no. The color we see is the color that's not absorbed. So the compound absorbs a certain wavelength (energy) and emits another. Or wait, in this case, when the dye emits light, it's because it's releasing energy. So if it's emitting at 2.3393 eV, then the energy it absorbed must be higher than that, because it's going from a higher energy state to a lower one, emitting the photon.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently. The energy of the photon emitted is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be the same as or higher, but wait, if it's a conjugated system, maybe it's a lower energy transition. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the wavelength of the emitted light and then find the complementary color.

Wait, the emitted light is 531 nm, which is green. So if the compound emits green, it must have absorbed the complementary color. What's the complementary color of green? It's magenta, but that's not one of the options. Or wait, no, perhaps the color absorbed is in the green region, meaning the compound would transmit or emit other colors. Wait, no, because if something emits green, it absorbed some other color.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think about the color wheel. The visible spectrum is from violet (400 nm) to red (700 nm). The colors in order are violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, red.

The complementary color pairs are red and cyan, green and magenta, blue and orange. So if a substance emits green, it must have absorbed in the magenta region. But the options given are red, violet, blue, yellow. So perhaps the question is not about complementary colors but about the color of the absorbed photon.

Wait, perhaps the question is simpler. The question is about the color of the light absorbed. So we're to find which color corresponds to the photon energy of 2.3393 eV. Because that's the energy of the absorbed photon, which causes the electron transition.

Wait, but the question says the dye emits light with that energy. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the absorbed photon (the one that caused the excitation) must be higher, right? Because when an electron is excited, it absorbs a higher energy photon, then when it drops, it emits a lower energy photon.

So, for example, if it absorbs a higher energy (lower wavelength) photon, then emits a lower energy (higher wavelength) photon.

So the energy of the absorbed photon would be greater than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon has higher energy, which means shorter wavelength. Then, we need to find the color of that absorbed photon.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: "What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?" So the question is about the absorbed light's color, not the emitted. Because the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, which is green (531 nm). So the absorbed light would have higher energy, which is lower wavelength.

Let me compute the wavelength of the emitted photon, which is 531 nm as I calculated earlier.

So the absorbed photon would have a higher energy, hence a shorter wavelength. Let me think about what energy corresponds to the absorption. But wait, the question gives the emitted energy, not the absorbed. So perhaps the absorbed energy is higher than the emitted, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted energy is the energy of the photon that's being reemitted, which would have been absorbed but then perhaps scattered or something else.

But I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach from another angle.

The question gives the energy of the emitted light as 2.3393 eV. So the wavelength is 531 nm, which is green. Therefore, the compound emits green light. Therefore, it must have absorbed a different wavelength. But the question is asking about the color of the absorbed light.

Wait, but according to the way colors work, the color we see is the color that's not absorbed but reflected or transmitted. So if something emits green, it must have absorbed the complementary color. But the options don't include magenta, so perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is directly asking for the color of the light that was absorbed to cause the emission. In that case, the absorbed photon's energy would be higher than the emitted. So if the emitted is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed would be higher, say the next higher energy in the options.

Wait, the options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, but what are their corresponding energies?

Let me list the approximate wavelengths and corresponding energies.

Red: ~700 nm → E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34)(3e8)/(700e-9) ≈ 2.857 eV.

Violet: ~400 nm → E ≈ 6.626e-34 *3e8 /400e-9 = (1.9878e-25)/4e-7 → Let's compute: 1.9878e-25 / 4e-7 = 4.9695e-19 J. Then E in eV: 4.9695e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.10 eV.

Blue: ~470 nm → E ≈ 6.626e-34 *3e8 /470e-9 → 1.9878e-25 /4.7e-7 → 4.23e-19 J → E≈ 4.23e-19 /1.602e-19 → ~2.64 eV.

Yellow: ~570 nm → E= (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(570e-9) = 1.9878e-25 /5.7e-7 ≈ 3.487e-19 J → E≈3.487e-19 /1.602e-19 ≈ 2.176 eV.

Wait, wait. Let me compute these more accurately.

Red: 700 nm → 700e-9 m.

E = hc/(λ) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (700e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / 7e-7 = appx 2.8397e-19 J. Convert to eV: 2.8397e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 1.77 eV? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1.9878e-25 /7e-7 = 2.8397e-19 J. 2.8397e-19 /1.602e-19 = ~1.77 eV. Wait, but that's lower than the emitted energy of 2.3393 eV.

Hmm, that's confusing because if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed photon must have higher energy (since the electron transition requires more energy to get excited). Wait, but this suggests that red light (1.77 eV) has lower energy than the emitted photon, which doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, no, because 700 nm is 700e-9 m. Let me recalculate the red photon:

E (red) = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (700e-9 m) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (700e-9 m) → 1.9878e-25 / 7e-7 = 2.8397e-19 J. Then, 2.8397e-19 J /1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 1.77 eV. So red is about 1.77 eV.

Wait, but the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So a red photon has lower energy than that. If the compound emits a photon with higher energy than the absorbed one, that would be impossible because the emitted photon's energy can't be higher than the absorbed. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, the absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted. Because the electron is excited to a higher energy state, then when it drops, it emits a photon with the energy difference. So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must be higher in energy.

But looking at the options, the colors and their energies:

Red: ~1.77 eV
Violet: ~3.1 eV
Blue: ~2.64 eV
Yellow: ~2.176 eV.

Wait, the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than that. So from the options, violet is 3.1 eV, which is higher. Blue is 2.64, which is higher than 2.3393. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than emitted. So the absorbed light must be either violet or blue.

So which is it? Let me compute the exact energy for 2.3393 eV. Let me find the wavelength corresponding to 2.3393 eV.

E = hc/λ → λ = hc/(E)
h=6.626e-34, c=3e8, E=2.3393 eV = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J.

So E in J: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.745e-19 J.

λ = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (3.745e-19)
= (1.9878e-25) / (3.745e-19)
= approx 5.31e-7 m → 531 nm, which is green.

So the emitted light is green. The absorbed light must have a higher energy, so shorter wavelength.

Which of the options has higher energy than 2.3393 eV?

Looking back:

Violet is ~3.1 eV → higher.
Blue is ~2.64 eV → higher.
Yellow is ~2.176 eV → lower than emitted.
Red is ~1.77 eV → lower.

So the absorbed light is either violet or blue.

But which one is it? Because the question is about the color absorbed, which would correspond to the energy of the photon that caused the excitation.

Wait, but I'm being told that the dye emits 2.3393 eV. So perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is higher, so the color is either violet or blue.

So which of the options is higher than 2.3393 eV?

Violet (3.1 eV) is higher. Blue (2.64 eV) is higher, but 2.64 is less than 2.3393? Wait, no: 2.64 is higher than 2.3393.

Wait, 2.3393 is about 2.34 eV.

Blue is 2.64 eV → higher.

So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

But wait, according to the options, the possible answers are violet, blue, etc.

So the question is, which color is absorbed. So the compound absorbs light with energy higher than the emitted. So the color is either blue or violet.

But how do I choose between them?

Wait, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon relates to the HOMO-LUMO gap. The extensively conjugated pi-electrons would have a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap, leading to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. Wait, but that's the opposite. Wait, no: conjugation increases the extent of the pi system, which lowers the energy gap (because the energy gap is inversely proportional to the square of the length of the conjugated system, according to the particle in a box model).

So if the molecule is extensively conjugated, the energy gap (ΔE) is small. So the absorbed photon would have lower energy, longer wavelength.

Wait, but wait, the conjugation leads to lower energy transitions. So if the molecule is highly conjugated, it absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light. Such as red or near-infrared, but in the given options, the colors are violet, blue, etc.

Wait, but in the case of dyes, they usually absorb in the visible range and emit in another part. For example, many dyes absorb in the blue or violet and emit in the yellow or orange (like fluorescein). But some absorb in the UV and emit in the visible.

Wait, another approach: when a molecule absorbs light, it's usually the lower wavelength (higher energy) that's absorbed, and emits higher wavelength (lower energy). So the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed. So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher.

So, the absorbed photon could be violet (3.1 eV) or blue (2.64 eV). Are any of these options present?

Looking at the options, both B (Violet) and C (Blue) are possible.

Wait, but the problem states that the compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy. So the color is either blue or violet.

Which of these is more likely? Well, that depends on the wavelength of the absorbed photon.

Let me compute the wavelength for 2.3393 eV again. 531 nm is green. So the absorbed photon is higher energy, so its wavelength is shorter than 531 nm.

So, for example, if the absorbed photon is blue, which is around 470 nm, that's higher energy than green (531 nm). So blue would be absorbed.

Wait, but wait, the emitted photon is at 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than 2.3393 eV, which would correspond to a wavelength shorter than 531 nm.

So let's see:

Violet is 400 nm → E = 3.1 eV, which is higher than 2.3393.

Blue is 470 nm → E = 2.64 eV, which is higher than 2.3393.

So both are possible, but which is the right option?

The options are:

A) Red (1.77 eV)

B) Violet (3.1 eV)

C) Blue (2.64 eV)

D) Yellow (2.176 eV)

So the absorbed photon must be either B or C.

But the question is phrased as: 'What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?' So the compound must be absorbing either blue or violet.

But how do I choose between them?

I think I need to think about the typical colors absorbed by dyes. Most dyes absorb in the blue or violet region and emit in a different color. For example, many red dyes absorb in the blue/violet and emit in the red.

Wait, but in this case, the dye emits green. Hmm. Wait, that doesn't fit into my usual knowledge. Because green emission would suggest that the dye absorbed in a different region.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is 2.3393 eV. Then, when it emits, maybe it emits a lower energy photon, but that would not make sense. Wait, no, because the emission would be due to the electron dropping from a higher energy state (after absorption) to a lower one, emitting a photon with energy equal to the energy difference.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy of the absorbed photon. The energy of the emitted photon is the energy of the absorbed photon minus the energy gap between the excited state and the lower state. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the question is simply asking for the color of the emitted light, but I think the question is about the absorbed light.

Wait, no, the question is: the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. What color is absorbed? So the absorbed must be higher in energy.

So among the options, the possible colors are violet (B) and blue (C), as their energies are higher than 2.3393 eV.

Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps knowing that 2.3393 eV falls in the green region, the absorbed light would be blue. Because in the case of many dyes, the absorption is in the blue region to emit in the complementary color. Wait, but green's complementary is magenta, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the energy of the absorbed photon being equal to the energy of the emitted. But that can't be right because the energy of the photon emitted is the same as the energy absorbed minus any energy loss, but in many cases, the emitted photon is lower in energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is confusing. Maybe the energy given is the energy of the absorbed photon, not the emitted. But the question says it emits that energy. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is green. The compound emits green, which means it must have absorbed a photon of higher energy (since it can't emit more energy than it absorbed). So the absorbed photon has higher energy, which is either violet or blue.

But without more information, how to choose between B and C?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact wavelength for each option and see which one is correctly higher in energy.

But I already have their approximate energies.

Wait, the options:

Option B: Violet (400 nm) → E= 3.1 eV.

Option C: Blue (470 nm) → E=2.64 eV.

So both are higher than 2.3393 eV.

But which is more likely? Well, 2.3393 eV is approximately 531 nm, which is green.

Now, some dyes that emit green might absorb in the blue or violet regions.

Wait, I think that for many dyes, the absorption maximum is in the blue or near-UV region. For example, the classic dye fluorescein absorbs blue light and emits green.

If that's the case, then the absorbed color would be blue, so option C.

Alternatively, if it's something like a rhodamine dye, which absorbs in the blue and emits in the red. But in this case, the emission is green, not red.

Wait, but in any case, the question is about which option is the correct answer.

So, given that the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed must be higher energy (shorter wavelength). So, between violet and blue, blue is 470 nm and violet is 400 nm. Both are higher in energy, meaning their energies are higher than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 2.3393 eV is the energy of the emitted photon. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher, so its wavelength must be shorter.

So among the options, which color has a higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

Violet: 3.1 eV → higher.

Blue: 2.64 → higher.

So both are possible. But the options include both.

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed. So which one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more straightforward. The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the absorbed light would be in the opposite part of the spectrum. Wait, that's not correct. The absorbed light is the one that causes the emission.

Wait, perhaps the question is worded in a tricky way. It says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Therefore, the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so the color absorbed has higher energy than green. So the color absorbed would be blue or violet.

But without more data, perhaps the correct answer is blue, which is 2.64 eV. Or violet, which is higher.

Wait, let me think about the colors. Green is in the middle. The complementary color of green is magenta, but that's not an option. So perhaps the absorbed color is blue, which is adjacent.

Alternatively, I think perhaps when a molecule emits green light, it's because it absorbed blue light. Because blue and green are not complementary. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the question is actually about the color of the absorbed light. The emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green). So the absorbed photon must have higher energy. So the color is either blue or violet.

Wait, but the options don't have both as correct. So perhaps the question is implying that the compound absorbs in the green region, but that doesn't make sense because then the emitted photon would be lower in energy.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the inverse relationship: the color that's emitted is the color that's not absorbed. But that's not correct because the color we see is the color that's not absorbed. So if something emits green, it's reflecting or transmitting other colors. But that's not the case here; this is about fluorescence, where the compound absorbs light and then emits a different wavelength.

So, in fluorescence, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted. So, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So the possible options are B (violet, 3.1 eV) and C (blue, 2.64 eV).

But how do we choose between them?

Wait, maybe the energy of 2.3393 eV is precisely in the green region. So what's the energy of blue light? Let me compute the exact energy for blue at 470 nm.

E = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (470e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (4.7e-7) = 4.23e-19 J. To eV: 4.23e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.64 eV.

Which is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So the absorbed photon is blue.

Alternatively, violet is 400 nm → E= 6.626e-34 *3e8 /400e-9 = (1.9878e-25) / (4e-7) = 4.9695e-19 J → 4.9695e-19 /1.602e-19 ≈ 3.10 eV.

So the absorbed photon could be either, but which is more likely.

Wait, but in practice, most fluorescent dyes absorb in the UV or blue regions and emit in the visible. For example, GFP (green fluorescent protein) absorbs blue light (around 480 nm) and emits green (around 510 nm). So in that case, the absorbed photon is blue, and the emitted is green.

So in this case, the emitted photon is green (2.3393 eV), so the absorbed would be blue.

So the answer should be C) Blue.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light. The dye emits light with an energy of **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately **531 nm** (calculated using the equation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \)). This wavelength falls in the green region of the visible spectrum.

In fluorescence, the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the energy of the emitted photon because the absorbed photon excites an electron to a higher energy state, and the emitted photon corresponds to the energy difference when the electron returns to a lower energy state. Therefore, the absorbed photon must have a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted photon.

The options provided are:

- **A) Red (1.77 eV)**: Red light has a lower energy than the emitted photon (2.3393 eV), so it cannot be the absorbed photon.
- **B) Violet (3.10 eV)**: Violet light has a higher energy than the emitted photon, making it a possible candidate for the absorbed photon.
- **C) Blue (2.64 eV)**: Blue light also has a higher energy than the emitted photon, making it another possible candidate for the absorbed photon.
- **D) Yellow (2.18 eV)**: Yellow light has a lower energy than the emitted photon, so it cannot be the absorbed photon.

Between violet and blue, both have higher energy than the emitted photon. However, in practical terms, many fluorescent dyes absorb in the blue region and emit in the visible spectrum. For example, common fluorescent dyes like GFP absorb blue light (around 480 nm) and emit green light. Based on this reasoning, the absorbed photon is most likely blue.

Thus, the color of light absorbed by the organic compound is **blue**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the color of light it absorbs. Hmm, I remember that when something absorbs a certain wavelength of light, it emits the complementary color. Wait, no, actually, I think it's more about the energy of the absorbed light determining the color we see. Let me think.

The question says the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. So, I need to figure out which color that corresponds to. I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. So maybe I should calculate the wavelength first.

Let me jot down the numbers. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The energy given is 2.3393 eV. Oh wait, I need to convert that to joules because the units for h and c are in SI units.

1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So, 2.3393 eV multiplied by that. Let me calculate that: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.745e-19 J. So E is approximately 3.745e-19 J.

Now plug into E = hc/λ. Rearranging for λ gives λ = hc/E. Substituting the numbers: (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / 3.745e-19 J. Let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 3.745e-19 J: 1.9878e-25 / 3.745e-19 ≈ 5.31e-7 meters. Oh wait, 5.31e-7 meters is 531 nm. Because 1e-9 meters is a nanometer, so 531 nm.

Wait, what's the visible spectrum range? It's roughly 400-700 nm. So 531 nm is in the visible range. Now, what color is that? I remember the colors: red is about 700 nm, orange around 600, yellow around 570, green around 530, blue around 470, and violet around 400.

Wait, 531 is close to 530, which is green. So the dye emits green light? But the question is about the color absorbed. Wait, wait, no. The question says the dye emits light with that energy. So when something emits light, it's because it's releasing energy. The absorbed light must have higher energy because it's promoting an electron, right?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. If the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, that means that's the energy of the photon it emits. When a compound absorbs light, it's because it's absorbing a photon with energy corresponding to a transition. The energy of the emitted photon would be the difference between the higher and lower energy states. So the absorbed photon would have higher energy than the emitted one?

No, wait. The process is: when the compound absorbs a photon, it excites an electron to a higher energy level. Then, when the electron drops back down, it emits a photon with the energy difference. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the energy gap between the states. The emitted photon's energy is the same as the energy gap. So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, that's the energy of the absorbed photon too.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The initial state is lower energy, and the excited state is higher. The photon absorbed has energy equal to the gap. Then, when it emits, it could emit that same photon if it goes back to the ground state, but sometimes it might emit lower energy photons if it goes to an intermediate state. But in this case, the question says it emits at 2.3393 eV, so that's the energy of the emitted photon. So the absorbed photon would have the same energy, right? Because the energy difference is the same. So the color emitted is the same as the absorbed? No, wait no, that's where the confusion comes in.

Wait no, no. The color we see is the color that's not absorbed. So the compound absorbs a certain wavelength (energy) and emits another. Or wait, in this case, when the dye emits light, it's because it's releasing energy. So if it's emitting at 2.3393 eV, then the energy it absorbed must be higher than that, because it's going from a higher energy state to a lower one, emitting the photon.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently. The energy of the photon emitted is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be the same as or higher, but wait, if it's a conjugated system, maybe it's a lower energy transition. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the wavelength of the emitted light and then find the complementary color.

Wait, the emitted light is 531 nm, which is green. So if the compound emits green, it must have absorbed the complementary color. What's the complementary color of green? It's magenta, but that's not one of the options. Or wait, no, perhaps the color absorbed is in the green region, meaning the compound would transmit or emit other colors. Wait, no, because if something emits green, it absorbed some other color.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think about the color wheel. The visible spectrum is from violet (400 nm) to red (700 nm). The colors in order are violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, red.

The complementary color pairs are red and cyan, green and magenta, blue and orange. So if a substance emits green, it must have absorbed in the magenta region. But the options given are red, violet, blue, yellow. So perhaps the question is not about complementary colors but about the color of the absorbed photon.

Wait, perhaps the question is simpler. The question is about the color of the light absorbed. So we're to find which color corresponds to the photon energy of 2.3393 eV. Because that's the energy of the absorbed photon, which causes the electron transition.

Wait, but the question says the dye emits light with that energy. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the absorbed photon (the one that caused the excitation) must be higher, right? Because when an electron is excited, it absorbs a higher energy photon, then when it drops, it emits a lower energy photon.

So, for example, if it absorbs a higher energy (lower wavelength) photon, then emits a lower energy (higher wavelength) photon.

So the energy of the absorbed photon would be greater than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon has higher energy, which means shorter wavelength. Then, we need to find the color of that absorbed photon.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: "What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?" So the question is about the absorbed light's color, not the emitted. Because the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, which is green (531 nm). So the absorbed light would have higher energy, which is lower wavelength.

Let me compute the wavelength of the emitted photon, which is 531 nm as I calculated earlier.

So the absorbed photon would have a higher energy, hence a shorter wavelength. Let me think about what energy corresponds to the absorption. But wait, the question gives the emitted energy, not the absorbed. So perhaps the absorbed energy is higher than the emitted, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted energy is the energy of the photon that's being reemitted, which would have been absorbed but then perhaps scattered or something else.

But I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach from another angle.

The question gives the energy of the emitted light as 2.3393 eV. So the wavelength is 531 nm, which is green. Therefore, the compound emits green light. Therefore, it must have absorbed a different wavelength. But the question is asking about the color of the absorbed light.

Wait, but according to the way colors work, the color we see is the color that's not absorbed but reflected or transmitted. So if something emits green, it must have absorbed the complementary color. But the options don't include magenta, so perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is directly asking for the color of the light that was absorbed to cause the emission. In that case, the absorbed photon's energy would be higher than the emitted. So if the emitted is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed would be higher, say the next higher energy in the options.

Wait, the options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, but what are their corresponding energies?

Let me list the approximate wavelengths and corresponding energies.

Red: ~700 nm → E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34)(3e8)/(700e-9) ≈ 2.857 eV.

Violet: ~400 nm → E ≈ 6.626e-34 *3e8 /400e-9 = (1.9878e-25)/4e-7 → Let's compute: 1.9878e-25 / 4e-7 = 4.9695e-19 J. Then E in eV: 4.9695e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.10 eV.

Blue: ~470 nm → E ≈ 6.626e-34 *3e8 /470e-9 → 1.9878e-25 /4.7e-7 → 4.23e-19 J → E≈ 4.23e-19 /1.602e-19 → ~2.64 eV.

Yellow: ~570 nm → E= (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(570e-9) = 1.9878e-25 /5.7e-7 ≈ 3.487e-19 J → E≈3.487e-19 /1.602e-19 ≈ 2.176 eV.

Wait, wait. Let me compute these more accurately.

Red: 700 nm → 700e-9 m.

E = hc/(λ) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (700e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / 7e-7 = appx 2.8397e-19 J. Convert to eV: 2.8397e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 1.77 eV? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1.9878e-25 /7e-7 = 2.8397e-19 J. 2.8397e-19 /1.602e-19 = ~1.77 eV. Wait, but that's lower than the emitted energy of 2.3393 eV.

Hmm, that's confusing because if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed photon must have higher energy (since the electron transition requires more energy to get excited). Wait, but this suggests that red light (1.77 eV) has lower energy than the emitted photon, which doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, no, because 700 nm is 700e-9 m. Let me recalculate the red photon:

E (red) = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (700e-9 m) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (700e-9 m) → 1.9878e-25 / 7e-7 = 2.8397e-19 J. Then, 2.8397e-19 J /1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 1.77 eV. So red is about 1.77 eV.

Wait, but the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So a red photon has lower energy than that. If the compound emits a photon with higher energy than the absorbed one, that would be impossible because the emitted photon's energy can't be higher than the absorbed. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, the absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted. Because the electron is excited to a higher energy state, then when it drops, it emits a photon with the energy difference. So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must be higher in energy.

But looking at the options, the colors and their energies:

Red: ~1.77 eV
Violet: ~3.1 eV
Blue: ~2.64 eV
Yellow: ~2.176 eV.

Wait, the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than that. So from the options, violet is 3.1 eV, which is higher. Blue is 2.64, which is higher than 2.3393. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than emitted. So the absorbed light must be either violet or blue.

So which is it? Let me compute the exact energy for 2.3393 eV. Let me find the wavelength corresponding to 2.3393 eV.

E = hc/λ → λ = hc/(E)
h=6.626e-34, c=3e8, E=2.3393 eV = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J.

So E in J: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.745e-19 J.

λ = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (3.745e-19)
= (1.9878e-25) / (3.745e-19)
= approx 5.31e-7 m → 531 nm, which is green.

So the emitted light is green. The absorbed light must have a higher energy, so shorter wavelength.

Which of the options has higher energy than 2.3393 eV?

Looking back:

Violet is ~3.1 eV → higher.
Blue is ~2.64 eV → higher.
Yellow is ~2.176 eV → lower than emitted.
Red is ~1.77 eV → lower.

So the absorbed light is either violet or blue.

But which one is it? Because the question is about the color absorbed, which would correspond to the energy of the photon that caused the excitation.

Wait, but I'm being told that the dye emits 2.3393 eV. So perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is higher, so the color is either violet or blue.

So which of the options is higher than 2.3393 eV?

Violet (3.1 eV) is higher. Blue (2.64 eV) is higher, but 2.64 is less than 2.3393? Wait, no: 2.64 is higher than 2.3393.

Wait, 2.3393 is about 2.34 eV.

Blue is 2.64 eV → higher.

So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

But wait, according to the options, the possible answers are violet, blue, etc.

So the question is, which color is absorbed. So the compound absorbs light with energy higher than the emitted. So the color is either blue or violet.

But how do I choose between them?

Wait, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon relates to the HOMO-LUMO gap. The extensively conjugated pi-electrons would have a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap, leading to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. Wait, but that's the opposite. Wait, no: conjugation increases the extent of the pi system, which lowers the energy gap (because the energy gap is inversely proportional to the square of the length of the conjugated system, according to the particle in a box model).

So if the molecule is extensively conjugated, the energy gap (ΔE) is small. So the absorbed photon would have lower energy, longer wavelength.

Wait, but wait, the conjugation leads to lower energy transitions. So if the molecule is highly conjugated, it absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light. Such as red or near-infrared, but in the given options, the colors are violet, blue, etc.

Wait, but in the case of dyes, they usually absorb in the visible range and emit in another part. For example, many dyes absorb in the blue or violet and emit in the yellow or orange (like fluorescein). But some absorb in the UV and emit in the visible.

Wait, another approach: when a molecule absorbs light, it's usually the lower wavelength (higher energy) that's absorbed, and emits higher wavelength (lower energy). So the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed. So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher.

So, the absorbed photon could be violet (3.1 eV) or blue (2.64 eV). Are any of these options present?

Looking at the options, both B (Violet) and C (Blue) are possible.

Wait, but the problem states that the compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy. So the color is either blue or violet.

Which of these is more likely? Well, that depends on the wavelength of the absorbed photon.

Let me compute the wavelength for 2.3393 eV again. 531 nm is green. So the absorbed photon is higher energy, so its wavelength is shorter than 531 nm.

So, for example, if the absorbed photon is blue, which is around 470 nm, that's higher energy than green (531 nm). So blue would be absorbed.

Wait, but wait, the emitted photon is at 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than 2.3393 eV, which would correspond to a wavelength shorter than 531 nm.

So let's see:

Violet is 400 nm → E = 3.1 eV, which is higher than 2.3393.

Blue is 470 nm → E = 2.64 eV, which is higher than 2.3393.

So both are possible, but which is the right option?

The options are:

A) Red (1.77 eV)

B) Violet (3.1 eV)

C) Blue (2.64 eV)

D) Yellow (2.176 eV)

So the absorbed photon must be either B or C.

But the question is phrased as: 'What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?' So the compound must be absorbing either blue or violet.

But how do I choose between them?

I think I need to think about the typical colors absorbed by dyes. Most dyes absorb in the blue or violet region and emit in a different color. For example, many red dyes absorb in the blue/violet and emit in the red.

Wait, but in this case, the dye emits green. Hmm. Wait, that doesn't fit into my usual knowledge. Because green emission would suggest that the dye absorbed in a different region.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is 2.3393 eV. Then, when it emits, maybe it emits a lower energy photon, but that would not make sense. Wait, no, because the emission would be due to the electron dropping from a higher energy state (after absorption) to a lower one, emitting a photon with energy equal to the energy difference.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy of the absorbed photon. The energy of the emitted photon is the energy of the absorbed photon minus the energy gap between the excited state and the lower state. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the question is simply asking for the color of the emitted light, but I think the question is about the absorbed light.

Wait, no, the question is: the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. What color is absorbed? So the absorbed must be higher in energy.

So among the options, the possible colors are violet (B) and blue (C), as their energies are higher than 2.3393 eV.

Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps knowing that 2.3393 eV falls in the green region, the absorbed light would be blue. Because in the case of many dyes, the absorption is in the blue region to emit in the complementary color. Wait, but green's complementary is magenta, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the energy of the absorbed photon being equal to the energy of the emitted. But that can't be right because the energy of the photon emitted is the same as the energy absorbed minus any energy loss, but in many cases, the emitted photon is lower in energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is confusing. Maybe the energy given is the energy of the absorbed photon, not the emitted. But the question says it emits that energy. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is green. The compound emits green, which means it must have absorbed a photon of higher energy (since it can't emit more energy than it absorbed). So the absorbed photon has higher energy, which is either violet or blue.

But without more information, how to choose between B and C?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact wavelength for each option and see which one is correctly higher in energy.

But I already have their approximate energies.

Wait, the options:

Option B: Violet (400 nm) → E= 3.1 eV.

Option C: Blue (470 nm) → E=2.64 eV.

So both are higher than 2.3393 eV.

But which is more likely? Well, 2.3393 eV is approximately 531 nm, which is green.

Now, some dyes that emit green might absorb in the blue or violet regions.

Wait, I think that for many dyes, the absorption maximum is in the blue or near-UV region. For example, the classic dye fluorescein absorbs blue light and emits green.

If that's the case, then the absorbed color would be blue, so option C.

Alternatively, if it's something like a rhodamine dye, which absorbs in the blue and emits in the red. But in this case, the emission is green, not red.

Wait, but in any case, the question is about which option is the correct answer.

So, given that the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed must be higher energy (shorter wavelength). So, between violet and blue, blue is 470 nm and violet is 400 nm. Both are higher in energy, meaning their energies are higher than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 2.3393 eV is the energy of the emitted photon. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher, so its wavelength must be shorter.

So among the options, which color has a higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

Violet: 3.1 eV → higher.

Blue: 2.64 → higher.

So both are possible. But the options include both.

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed. So which one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more straightforward. The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the absorbed light would be in the opposite part of the spectrum. Wait, that's not correct. The absorbed light is the one that causes the emission.

Wait, perhaps the question is worded in a tricky way. It says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Therefore, the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so the color absorbed has higher energy than green. So the color absorbed would be blue or violet.

But without more data, perhaps the correct answer is blue, which is 2.64 eV. Or violet, which is higher.

Wait, let me think about the colors. Green is in the middle. The complementary color of green is magenta, but that's not an option. So perhaps the absorbed color is blue, which is adjacent.

Alternatively, I think perhaps when a molecule emits green light, it's because it absorbed blue light. Because blue and green are not complementary. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the question is actually about the color of the absorbed light. The emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green). So the absorbed photon must have higher energy. So the color is either blue or violet.

Wait, but the options don't have both as correct. So perhaps the question is implying that the compound absorbs in the green region, but that doesn't make sense because then the emitted photon would be lower in energy.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the inverse relationship: the color that's emitted is the color that's not absorbed. But that's not correct because the color we see is the color that's not absorbed. So if something emits green, it's reflecting or transmitting other colors. But that's not the case here; this is about fluorescence, where the compound absorbs light and then emits a different wavelength.

So, in fluorescence, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted. So, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So the possible options are B (violet, 3.1 eV) and C (blue, 2.64 eV).

But how do we choose between them?

Wait, maybe the energy of 2.3393 eV is precisely in the green region. So what's the energy of blue light? Let me compute the exact energy for blue at 470 nm.

E = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (470e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (4.7e-7) = 4.23e-19 J. To eV: 4.23e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.64 eV.

Which is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So the absorbed photon is blue.

Alternatively, violet is 400 nm → E= 6.626e-34 *3e8 /400e-9 = (1.9878e-25) / (4e-7) = 4.9695e-19 J → 4.9695e-19 /1.602e-19 ≈ 3.10 eV.

So the absorbed photon could be either, but which is more likely.

Wait, but in practice, most fluorescent dyes absorb in the UV or blue regions and emit in the visible. For example, GFP (green fluorescent protein) absorbs blue light (around 480 nm) and emits green (around 510 nm). So in that case, the absorbed photon is blue, and the emitted is green.

So in this case, the emitted photon is green (2.3393 eV), so the absorbed would be blue.

So the answer should be C) Blue.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light. The dye emits light with an energy of **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately **531 nm** (calculated using the equation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \)). This wavelength falls in the green region of the visible spectrum.

In fluorescence, the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the energy of the emitted photon because the absorbed photon excites an electron to a higher energy state, and the emitted photon corresponds to the energy difference when the electron returns to a lower energy state. Therefore, the absorbed photon must have a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted photon.

The options provided are:

- **A) Red (1.77 eV)**: Red light has a lower energy than the emitted photon (2.3393 eV), so it cannot be the absorbed photon.
- **B) Violet (3.10 eV)**: Violet light has a higher energy than the emitted photon, making it a possible candidate for the absorbed photon.
- **C) Blue (2.64 eV)**: Blue light also has a higher energy than the emitted photon, making it another possible candidate for the absorbed photon.
- **D) Yellow (2.18 eV)**: Yellow light has a lower energy than the emitted photon, so it cannot be the absorbed photon.

Between violet and blue, both have higher energy than the emitted photon. However, in practical terms, many fluorescent dyes absorb in the blue region and emit in the visible spectrum. For example, common fluorescent dyes like GFP absorb blue light (around 480 nm) and emit green light. Based on this reasoning, the absorbed photon is most likely blue.

Thus, the color of light absorbed by the organic compound is **blue**.

Answer: C
