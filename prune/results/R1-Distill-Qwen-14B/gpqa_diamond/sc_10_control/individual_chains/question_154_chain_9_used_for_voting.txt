Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are four different compounds, all chlorinated aromatic compounds, I think. Let's look at the data provided.

First, the mass spec. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% abundance. Hmm, that suggests some kind of isotopic peak. Chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35, but there's also a 37Cl isotope which is about 34% abundance. So maybe the molecular formula includes Cl. Let me calculate.

If the molecular ion is 156, and considering Cl, which has a mass of ~35.5, so maybe the formula includes one Cl. Let's think: 156 minus 35 (Cl) is 121. So what's a formula with Cl and a molecular weight of 156.

Wait, the options are A to D. Let me check their molecular weights.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate that: (12*7)+(5)+(35.5)+(16*2)= 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. Hmm, but the molecular ion is at 156. That's a bit off. Maybe Cl is 35, so 35.45 is more precise. So 156.45. The molecular ion is at 156, so that could be right. But wait, 35.5 is the average. So if the molecular ion is 156, that's 156.45, but the mass spec sometimes rounds or the actual mass is 156 for the Cl isotopic composition. Maybe, but let me think about the other option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: same as A, 156.45. So molecular ion would be 156.45, which matches the 156 given. The other peak at 158 is 32% which suggests the Cl is present because another peak would be from Cl-37. So 35.5 is the average, so 37Cl would add 2 mass units, making M+2 at 158. So that's 32%, which is about the natural abundance of Cl-37 (34%), so that fits. So B is a possible candidate.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. I think that's ClCOOPh. So the formula is C6H5O2Cl. Wait, let's compute the molecular weight. C6H5 is 77 (12*6 +5). O2Cl is 36 (O is 16*2=32) +35.5=67.5. So 77+67.5=144.5. But the molecular ion is 156. So wait, that can't be right. Hmm. Unless I'm wrong. Alternatively, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the molecular formula would be C8H7ClO2. Let me calculate that: 8*12=96, 7=7, 35.5=35.5, O=32. So total is 96+7+35.5+32= 170.5. That doesn't match the 156. So maybe not option C.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same formula as B, same molecular weight. So D's molecular weight is also around 156.45. So both B and D have same molecular weights. So how do I differentiate? Let's look at the other data.

The IR data shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks usually indicate O-H stretching. Benzoic acid has a carboxylic acid group, which has a broad O-H peak. Benzaldehyde would also have an aldehyde O-H, but wait, aldehydes have a peak around 2820 and 2720, which are the aldehyde C-H stretches, but the broad peak in IR is from 3500-2700, which is more like an -OH stretch. So that suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group, which is a broad O-H stretch, or maybe an alcohol or phenol. But the options: A is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a hydroxy group (phenol), so that would have a broad peak. B and D are benzoic acids, which have a strong and broad O-H. So B and D fit the IR here, as does A.

Wait, but the IR also has a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's indicative of a carbonyl group. So looking at the options:

- Benzoic acid (B, D) would have a carbonyl (COOH) around 1700 cm^-1. The peak is at 1720, which is a bit higher. Maybe if it's deprotonated or something else. Alternatively, an ester or aldehyde.

- A is a benzaldehyde with a hydroxyl group. The aldehyde carbonyl is around 1720, maybe? Because aldehyde carbonyl is usually around 1700-1720 cm^-1. So an aldehyde would have a peak around there. The IR also shows a broad peak, which would be the aldehyde's O-H? Wait, no. Aldehydes don't have O-H unless there's an adjacent -OH. Wait, in option A, it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So it's a benzaldehyde with a hydroxy group in the 2 position. So the aldehyde group would have a strong peak at 1720, and the alcohol (phenol) would have a broad peak.

So that fits. Similarly, benzoic acid (B, D) would have a carboxylic acid, which has a broad peak and a carbonyl at around 1700, but maybe the 1720 suggests an aldehyde or an ester.

Wait, another thought: the IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700. Aldehydes have a peak around 2820 and 2720 (the aldehyde C-H stretch), which are sharp. The broad peak suggests an O-H stretch. So perhaps the compound has a hydroxyl group. So looking at the options:

- A: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So that's a benzaldehyde with a hydroxyl group in the 2 position (ortho to the aldehyde). So the IR would have a broad O-H (from the phenol group) and a strong aldehyde C=O around 1720. That fits.

- B and D: 4-chlorobenzoic acid or 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H (from the -COOH group) and a strong C=O around 1700. So the 1720 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester.

Wait, the molecular ion is 156, which matches benzoic acid (like B and D) and the aldehyde + hydroxyl (A). Let me think about the NMR data.

The 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H).

An aromatic region. Let's think about each option.

Option A: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

The structure would have an aldehyde group (CHO), a hydroxyl (OH) in position 2, and Cl in position 3. Let's draw the benzene ring.

Positions: 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). Wait, or is it 2-hydroxy, 3-chloro, and 1 being the aldehyde? Wait, benzaldehyde has the CHO at position 1. So 3-chloro-2-hydroxy would mean Cl is at position 3, OH at 2, CHO at 1.

In such a case, the ring would have substituents at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). So the remaining positions 4,5,6. Wait, but in that case, the substituents are at adjacent positions. Hmm, perhaps that's possible.

Looking at the NMR: 11 ppm is a singlet (s), which could be the aldehyde proton. Wait, wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But in some cases, they can be deshielded more. Alternatively, the 11 ppm could be an exchangeable proton, like an -OH. But in DMSO or another solvent, the OH might show as a broad peak, but in the NMR given, it's a singlet at 11 ppm. So maybe it’s an aldehyde proton? Or perhaps a phenolic OH? Wait, but phenolic OHs usually are broader and appear around 5-10 ppm, but sometimes can be upfield or downfield depending on the situation.

Wait, another thought: the 11 ppm peak is a singlet, which is 1H. In benzoic acid derivatives, the carboxylic acid proton is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. So if the compound is a benzoic acid, the 11 ppm peak could be the COOH proton. But benzoic acid's COOH is a broad peak, but in the NMR, it's a singlet. Oh, but wait, in the NMR, the COOH might have exchanged and perhaps only shows up as a small peak. Alternatively, maybe the solvent is affecting it.

Alternatively, the 11 ppm could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually lower field, around 9-10 ppm. So 11 is a bit high, but possible. Let me think.

The other NMR signals are at 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic system with two doublets. So each doublet is integrating to 2H, which indicates a para-substituted structure. So maybe a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions, but wait, that would give two doublets. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two substituents, each in positions that cause two doublets.

Wait, but in option B and D, which are benzoic acids, the substituents would be Cl and COOH. Let's think about 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B). The structure is Cl at position 4, COOH at position 1. So the ring substituents would be at positions 1 and 4. That's para to each other.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The ring would have two sets of equivalent protons: the two protons adjacent to COOH (positions 2 and 6) and the two protons adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5). Wait, no. Let me think again. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the protons at 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH. The protons at 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl.

In the NMR, the two doublets would be due to the coupling between adjacent protons. So the H's at 2 and 6 would be deshielded due to the COOH group. They would couple with their adjacent H's, leading to a doublet. Similarly, the H's at 3 and 5 would couple with each other, perhaps. But wait, in a para-substituted ring, the H's are equivalent in pairs. So maybe the two doublets are from two sets of equivalent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the two doublets are due to substituents at positions 2 and 5 or something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the coupling.

The NMR shows a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another at 7.72 (2H). So each is a doublet. So each of these sets is split into a doublet, which suggests each proton is coupling with one neighboring proton. In a benzene ring, each proton has two neighbors, so if the coupling is only with one, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted ring with substituents that cause each set to have two equivalent protons, each coupling with the same substituent.

Wait, perhaps the ring has two substituents that are meta to each other, but that would lead to more complex splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions that create two doublets each integrating to two protons.

Wait, maybe considering the substituents. If the substituents are at positions 1 and 3, for example, that could lead to certain coupling patterns. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the NMR for option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

The structure is:

COOH at position 1, Cl at position 4.

So the ring has substituents opposite each other (para). The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6.

Protons 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Protons 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

In terms of chemical shifts, the protons next to the COOH group (2 and 6) would be more deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effect of COOH, so their chemical shifts would be upfield or downfield? Wait, electron-withdrawing groups de-shield the ring, so the neighboring protons would be at higher ppm.

Similarly, the Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, so the protons next to Cl would also be deshielded.

So for 4-chlorobenzoic acid:

Protons 2 and 6: next to COOH, deshielded → higher ppm.

Protons 3 and 5: next to Cl, deshielded → higher ppm.

But the COOH is a stronger electron-withdrawing group than Cl, perhaps. So protons 2 and 6 would be more deshielded than 3 and 5.

In the NMR, the two doublets are at 8.02 and 7.72. So perhaps the two more deshielded (higher ppm) are the ones adjacent to COOH (positions 2 and 6), each as a doublet.

Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene with substituents at 1 and 4, the protons 2 and 6 are equivalent, and protons 3 and 5 are equivalent. So their NMR signals would be as two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

So in the NMR, the 8.02 ppm is the more deshielded (downfield) set (positions 2 and 6), and 7.72 is the less deshielded set (positions 3 and 5), each as a doublet.

That seems to fit. So the NMR would have two doublets at around 8.0 and 7.7 ppm.

What about option A: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

The substituents are CHO at 1, OH at 2, Cl at 3. So the ring positions are 1-CHO, 2-OH, 3-Cl. The remaining protons are at 4,5,6.

Wait, but in this structure, the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. So the ring would have protons at 4,5,6, but each with different substituents nearby. Hmm, this might complicate the NMR.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in positions 4,5,6. Let me think about their shifts.

Position 4: adjacent to position 3 (Cl) → deshielded → higher ppm.

Position 5: adjacent to position 4 (Cl) and position 6 (which is adjacent to position 1 (CHO)).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the ring would have a para-substituted pattern, but with substituents in adjacent positions, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the aldehyde group would cause certain shifts.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the NMR for option A. The 11 ppm peak could be the aldehyde proton. But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. 11 is a bit high, but possible.

But then, the other peaks are 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That suggests four aromatic protons in two doublets. But in the case of option A, the substituents are in positions 1,2,3, leaving positions 4,5,6. If position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (CHO), perhaps it's more deshielded. So maybe the aromatic protons in positions 4 and 6 would be one set, and position 5 another. But that doesn't fit the NMR shown.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility of the NMR not showing all the protons. Wait, the NMR list includes 11.0 (1H), 8.02 (2H), 7.72 (2H). So that's 5H in total. But the molecular formula for option A is C7H5ClO2. So the molecule has 5 H's. So the NMR data adds up. So it's possible that the structure has only five protons—like a benzaldehyde with substituents that take away two Hs, but that's not the case. Wait, no. Wait, benzaldehyde is C6H5CHO, which has 5 H's on the benzene (since CHO is a substituent). But in option A, with substituents at 1,2,3, the remaining positions would have 3 H's, but the NMR shows 5 H's. Wait, perhaps I'm confused.

Wait, let me recount the Hs for each option.

Option A: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is:

Positions 1: CHO (no H), position 2: OH (no H), position 3: Cl (no H). So the benzene ring has Hs at positions 4,5,6. So three H's. But the NMR shows 1H (11 ppm), 2H, 2H → total 5 H's. So that doesn't fit. Unless there's another H elsewhere. Wait, the aldehyde has one H. So the total H's would be 1 (aldehyde) +3 (benzene) =4. But the NMR has 1+2+2=5. So option A can't be right because it would have 4 H's, but the NMR shows 5. So that would eliminate option A.

Wait, that's an important point. So if option A only has 4 H's (1 aldehyde + 3 on the ring), but the NMR shows 5, then A is not possible. So I can eliminate option A.

That leaves options B, C, D.

Wait, option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. So the structure is:

COOH at position 1, Cl at position 4. The benzene ring has 5 H's? No, because COOH is a substituent (no H), Cl is a substituent (no H). So the ring has 4 H's, correct? Positions 2,3,5,6. So each pair (2 and 6, 3 and 5) are equivalent. So their NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2 H's. That's 4 H's. Plus the COOH proton, which is the 11 ppm singlet. So total H's are 5, which matches the NMR data (1+2+2=5).

Similarly, option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure: COOH at 1, Cl at 2. The ring has H's at 3,4,5,6. So again, the ring has four H's. Let's think about their positions. H at 3 is adjacent to Cl (position 2) and H at 4. H at 6 is adjacent to H at 5 and the COOH group. Wait, this could lead to more complex splitting.

But in the NMR data, the two doublets are each for two H's. So perhaps in option D, the substituents are at 1 and 2, which are adjacent. This leads to the ring being ortho-substituted. Which would change the splitting. Let me think.

In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). The aromatic H's are at 3,4,5,6. The H's at 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl, and the H's at 4 and 6 are adjacent to COOH.

So the H's at 3 and 5 would be more deshielded due to Cl, and the H's at 4 and 6 would be more deshielded due to COOH.

In the NMR, the H's at 4 and 6 would be upfield or downfield? Wait, the COOH group is electron-withdrawing, so the adjacent H's (4 and 6) would be deshielded → higher ppm. Similarly, Cl is electron-withdrawing, so H's 3 and 5 would be deshielded → higher ppm.

So in the NMR, there would be two sets: one more deshielded (higher ppm) and one less so. For example, the H's adjacent to COOH would be at higher ppm (like 8.02), and those adjacent to Cl would be at lower ppm (like 7.72). But wait, Cl is stronger in electron-withdrawing than COOH? Or is it the other way around? COOH is a stronger EWG than Cl. So the H's adjacent to COOH would be more deshielded.

Wait, H's next to COOH (positions 4 and 6) would be more downfield. So their chemical shifts would be higher than those next to Cl.

So the NMR would show a doublet at higher ppm (8.02) for H's 4 and 6, and another at 7.72 for H's 3 and 5. That fits with the NMR data.

So for both options B and D, the NMR data could fit. But let's think about the IR.

The IR has a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. Benzoic acid has a carbonyl around 1700 cm^-1, but maybe the peak is a bit higher because of substitution.

Alternatively, the presence of Cl could influence the carbonyl peak. If the peak is at 1720, which is higher than the typical 1700 for COOH, perhaps it's an ester or aldehyde. But benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1700, perhaps a bit higher depending on substitution.

Another thought: 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B) would have the Cl in para position relative to COOH. The Cl is an EWG, which would increase the carbonyl's wavenumber. So the carbonyl peak would be upshifted, which could reach 1720. That could explain the IR peak.

Similarly, 2-chlorobenzoic acid (option D) would have Cl in the ortho position, which would have a stronger EWG effect than para. So the carbonyl peak would be higher, possibly at 1720. So both B and D could fit in the IR.

But looking at the mass spec, the molecular ion is 156. Both B and D have the same molecular weight, so that doesn't help. But the IR also has a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Benzoic acid's O-H is broad, which matches. The aldehyde's O-H (in option A) is phenol, which would also have a broad peak.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option A is eliminated because the NMR didn't fit. So back to options B and D.

The main difference between B and D is the position of Cl. Let's think about the NMR again.

For option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid):

The ring H's at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH, meta to Cl) would be more deshielded and appear at higher ppm (say, 8.02). The H's at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl, meta to COOH) would be less deshielded and appear at 7.72.

For option D (2-chlorobenzoic acid):

The ring H's at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl) would be more deshielded and appear at higher ppm (8.02), and the H's at 4 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be more deshielded than the others. Wait, but wait: in D, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So H's at 4 and 6 are meta to Cl and para to COOH. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting in the NMR would be different based on the substituents' positions. In the para-substituted case (B), the two doublets would each correspond to two equivalent H's, which is what the NMR shows. In the ortho-substituted case (D), the splitting might be more complex. For instance, in D, the H's at 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl, and H's at 4 and 6 are adjacent to COOH. So their shifts would be more downfield than the others. But in D, the ring protons would be in a different environment. Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets each integrating to 2H. So it's possible that in D, the H's at 3 and 5 are a doublet, and H's at 4 and 6 are another doublet, each of 2H.

But in that case, the shifts would have to be such that the H's adjacent to Cl are at 7.72 and those adjacent to COOH are at 8.02, which would fit.

Wait, but let's think about di substitution. For benzoic acid derivatives, the substitution pattern affects ring current and chemical shifts. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid (para substitution), the two sets of H's (ortho and meta) would each have their own shifts. Similarly, for 2-chlorobenzoic acid (ortho substitution), the H's would have different patterns.

But how to differentiate between B and D based on the NMR?

In option B, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl), so the H's at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. H's at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

In option D, substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the H's at 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. H's at 4 and 6 are meta to Cl and para to COOH.

The chemical shifts would be determined by the substituents' effects. COOH is a stronger EWG than Cl, so the H's adjacent to COOH would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than those adjacent to Cl.

So in B, the H's ortho to COOH (2 and 6) would be higher ppm (8.02), and H's ortho to Cl (3 and 5) would be at lower ppm (7.72).

In D, the H's ortho to Cl (3 and 5) would be more deshielded (higher ppm) because Cl is EWG, and H's adjacent to COOH (4 and 6) would be even more deshielded because COOH is a stronger EWG. So in D, the H's at 4 and 6 would be at higher ppm than H's at 3 and 5. So the doublet for 4 and 6 would be at higher ppm (8.02) and the doublet for 3 and 5 at 7.72.

Wait, but wait, in that case, the NMR for D would have the same pattern as B, but the substituents are in different positions. So how can I tell them apart?

Alternatively, maybe the coupling patterns would differ. In B, the substituents are para, leading to a certain coupling, while in D, substituents are ortho, leading to different coupling.

But I'm not sure about that. Let me think about the coupling in the NMR.

In a para-substituted benzene, each H is two bonds away from a substituent. Wait, perhaps the coupling is between vicinal (adjacent) H's. In a para-substituted benzene, the H's are arranged such that each H is coupled with two others. But in the NMR, each of the two doublets has two H's. So for each doublet, each H is coupled with one other H, leading to a doublet. Maybe that's the case when the substituents are in such a way that the protons are in a meta arrangement relative to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting isn't due to coupling between adjacent H's but due to coupling with substituents. Wait, substituents don't usually cause splitting; it's the adjacent H's that do.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: look at the options and see which one fits all the data.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Mass: 156 → matches.

IR: broad peak (carboxylic acid OH), strong peak at 1720 (carboxylic acid C=O, possibly upshifted by Cl).

NMR: 11 ppm (COOH proton), 8.02 (two H's ortho to COOH), 7.72 (two H's ortho to Cl). Fits.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

Mass: same.

IR: same.

NMR: 11 ppm (COOH), 8.02 (two H's ortho to COOH?), but wait, in D, the H's ortho to COOH would actually be the H's at positions 4 and 6, which are adjacent to COOH.

Wait, no, the H's ortho to COOH would be at positions 2 and 6, but position 2 is Cl in D. So in D, the H's adjacent to COOH are positions 6 and 4? Not sure.

Wait, in D, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the H's at 4 and 6 are next to substituents. How?

Wait, position 4 is adjacent to position 3 and 5. Position 6 is adjacent to position 5 and 1 (COOH). So H at 6 is adjacent to COOH.

So in D, H's at 6 and 4 would be ortho to substituents (Cl or COOH). Wait, perhaps the H's at 6 are ortho to COOH (position 1) and meta to Cl (position 2). So their shifts would be higher ppm because of the COOH group. H's at 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. So their shifts would be higher due to Cl but lower than those next to COOH.

So in D, the NMR would show the H's next to COOH (positions 6 and 4) at higher ppm (8.02), and H's next to Cl (positions 3 and 5) at lower ppm (7.72). That matches the NMR data.

So both B and D fit the NMR, but how to choose between them.

Wait, another thought: in option B, the substituents are para, leading to the aromatic ring being symmetric in a certain way. The substituents are at 1 and 4, so the ring is symmetric across the 1-4 axis. Therefore, the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to two H's, which matches the data.

In option D, substituents are at 1 and 2, which are adjacent. So the ring isn't symmetric in the same way, but it would still have two sets of equivalent H's, each in a doublet. So the NMR would still fit.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the splitting. In para substitution, each H is coupled with two others, but since they're equivalent, they appear as a doublet. In ortho substitution, each H may couple with more H's, leading to more splitting. But in the given NMR, it's only two doublets, each 2H. So perhaps in the para case, the splitting is simpler.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling constants can help. But the question doesn't provide that info.

Another approach: looking at the mass spec. The molecular ion is at 156 (100%), and a peak at 158 (32%). The 158 is M+2. Cl has a natural abundance of about 34% for M+2. So the 32% is close to that, which suggests one Cl atom in the molecule. So all options have one Cl except option C, which I think doesn't fit the mass spec. So options A, B, D have Cl.

Wait, option C: phenyl chloroformate. Its molecular formula would be C6H5O2Cl. Let's calculate: 6*12=72, 5=5, 32 (O2), 35.5=35.5. Total is 72+5+32+35.5=144.5. But the molecular ion is 156, so C is out. So option C is probably incorrect.

So going back to options B and D. How to choose between them.

Another thought: the 1H NMR of benzoic acid derivatives. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) are more deshielded and appear downfield. The H's ortho to Cl (3 and 5) are also deshielded but less so. So their shifts would be higher than typical, but perhaps the one adjacent to COOH would be higher.

In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the H's adjacent to Cl would be more deshielded. Let me look up some data. Wait, I'm supposed to think without external resources. Alternatively, perhaps the downfield shift is more influenced by the proximity to the COOH group.

Wait, another thought: in the 1H NMR of benzoic acids, the protons adjacent to the COOH group (ortho) are usually more deshielded and appear around 8.0-8.1 ppm, while the para and meta protons can be lower. So in option B, the H's ortho to COOH are at 8.02, which fits. In option D, the H's ortho to COOH would be at positions 6 and 4, but wait, in D, the substituents are at 1 and 2. So the H's at 4 and 6 are not ortho to COOH. Wait, no: position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (COOH), so it's ortho to COOH. So in D, the H's at 6 and 4 would be ortho to substituents. Wait, that's getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the order of substituents. In option B, substituents are para, leading to the two doublets being of the same type. In option D, substituents are ortho, leading to a different coupling.

Wait, perhaps the downfield shift is more influenced by the substituent's position. For example, in option D, the Cl is in the ortho position relative to COOH. That would cause the ring to have a stronger electron-withdrawing effect, which might cause the adjacent H's to be more deshielded. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 11 ppm peak is the COOH proton. Benzoic acid's COOH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. But in the NMR, it's a singlet, which suggests it's not exchanging or perhaps it's deuterated. Wait, the NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm, which would fit the COOH proton. But in benzoic acid, the COOH proton is usually broad, but in the question, it's given as a singlet. So that suggests that the proton is not splitting, perhaps because it's not coupled to any other H's or due to being in a different environment.

Wait, perhaps in the case of a benzoic acid, the COOH proton is a singlet because it's not split by any adjacent H's. But in reality, the COOH proton is usually split by the adjacent H's, but in the case of para substitution, perhaps the coupling is not observed due to symmetry or other factors. I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a deuterated compound, but the question doesn't mention that. So I'll proceed.

Another approach: looking at the substituents' effects on chemical shifts. The H's in the para position to Cl would be more deshielded than those meta or ortho. Wait, that's getting a bit tangled.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the options. Let me look at the options again:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The substituents are para, so the ring is symmetric.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Substituents are ortho, so the ring is less symmetric.

In the NMR, the two doublets are each integrating to 2H. In a para-substituted benzoic acid, the H's are symmetric and would split into two doublets. In an ortho-substituted benzoic acid, perhaps the H's are in a less symmetric environment, which could lead to more complex splitting, but the NMR shows two doublets, which suggests symmetry.

So perhaps option B is the correct one because the para substitution leads to equivalent H's and thus simpler splitting. Option D, being ortho, would cause the H's to be in a less symmetric environment, possibly leading to more complex splitting than two doublets. But the NMR shows two doublets, which suggests two sets of equivalent H's.

So I'm leaning towards option B.

Wait, but I thought option D could also fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of Cl in the para position would cause the carbonyl peak to be at a higher wavenumber due to stronger EWG effect compared to ortho substitution. Because in para substitution, the Cl is farther away, but in ortho, it's closer. Wait, in terms of resonance effects, the para substituent's EWG effect would be transmitted through resonance, which is more effective in para than in meta or ortho positions. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the resonance effect is stronger in para substitution because the substituent is directly across the ring, allowing for maximum conjugation. So the presence of Cl in para would have a stronger resonance effect, which would increase the carbonyl's wavenumber. So the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 could be explained better by Cl being para to COOH, as it would cause a higher shift.

Therefore, option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) would have a higher carbonyl peak than option D (2-chlorobenzoic acid) because the Cl is in the para position, enhancing the EWG effect on the carbonyl group.

So this would support option B being the correct answer.

Putting it all together:

- Mass spec: molecular ion at 156, with M+2 at 158 (32%), suggesting one Cl atom.

- IR: broad peak (OH) and strong peak at 1720 (carbonyl).

- NMR: 11 ppm (singlet, likely COOH proton), two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm, each integrating to 2H, suggesting para substitution with substituents causing two sets of equivalent H's.

So the correct structural suggestion is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** (100%) and a secondary peak at **m/z = 158** (32%) suggest the presence of one chlorine atom, as the natural abundance of the $^{37}$Cl isotope is approximately 34%. This aligns with the molecular formulas of the options, which all contain one chlorine atom.

### IR Analysis:
- The **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm$^-$** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or phenol.
- The **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm$^-$** suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). This wavenumber is consistent with a carboxylic acid or aldehyde.

### $^1$H NMR Analysis:
- The **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** peak corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH), which is typically deshielded and appears as a singlet.
- The **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** peaks indicate two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, where the substituents create two distinct environments for the protons.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - This compound contains a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aldehyde group (-CHO).  
   - The aldehyde proton would typically appear around 9-10 ppm, not 11 ppm. Additionally, the NMR data shows five protons (1H + 2H + 2H), but this compound only has four aromatic protons, making it inconsistent with the NMR data.  
   - **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - This compound has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a chlorine atom in the para position.  
   - The molecular ion at **m/z = 156** matches the molecular weight of this compound.  
   - The IR peak at 1720 cm$^-$ corresponds to the carboxylic acid carbonyl group, and the broad peak from 3500-2700 cm$^-$ matches the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid.  
   - The NMR data fits: the **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** is the carboxylic acid proton, and the two doublets at **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** correspond to the aromatic protons in a para-substituted ring.  
   - **Consistent with all data.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   - The molecular formula of phenyl chloroformate is **C$$_6$$H$$_5$$O$$_2$$Cl**, which has a molecular weight of approximately 144.5. This does not match the molecular ion at **m/z = 156**.  
   - **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - This compound has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a chlorine atom in the ortho position.  
   - While the molecular ion at **m/z = 156** matches, the NMR data does not fully align. In an ortho-substituted ring, the aromatic protons would not produce two distinct doublets with equal integration, as seen in the NMR data.  
   - **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular ion peak, IR peaks, and $^1$H NMR signals, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The para substitution pattern explains the two distinct aromatic proton environments observed in the NMR.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are four different compounds, all chlorinated aromatic compounds, I think. Let's look at the data provided.

First, the mass spec. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% abundance. Hmm, that suggests some kind of isotopic peak. Chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35, but there's also a 37Cl isotope which is about 34% abundance. So maybe the molecular formula includes Cl. Let me calculate.

If the molecular ion is 156, and considering Cl, which has a mass of ~35.5, so maybe the formula includes one Cl. Let's think: 156 minus 35 (Cl) is 121. So what's a formula with Cl and a molecular weight of 156.

Wait, the options are A to D. Let me check their molecular weights.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate that: (12*7)+(5)+(35.5)+(16*2)= 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. Hmm, but the molecular ion is at 156. That's a bit off. Maybe Cl is 35, so 35.45 is more precise. So 156.45. The molecular ion is at 156, so that could be right. But wait, 35.5 is the average. So if the molecular ion is 156, that's 156.45, but the mass spec sometimes rounds or the actual mass is 156 for the Cl isotopic composition. Maybe, but let me think about the other option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: same as A, 156.45. So molecular ion would be 156.45, which matches the 156 given. The other peak at 158 is 32% which suggests the Cl is present because another peak would be from Cl-37. So 35.5 is the average, so 37Cl would add 2 mass units, making M+2 at 158. So that's 32%, which is about the natural abundance of Cl-37 (34%), so that fits. So B is a possible candidate.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. I think that's ClCOOPh. So the formula is C6H5O2Cl. Wait, let's compute the molecular weight. C6H5 is 77 (12*6 +5). O2Cl is 36 (O is 16*2=32) +35.5=67.5. So 77+67.5=144.5. But the molecular ion is 156. So wait, that can't be right. Hmm. Unless I'm wrong. Alternatively, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the molecular formula would be C8H7ClO2. Let me calculate that: 8*12=96, 7=7, 35.5=35.5, O=32. So total is 96+7+35.5+32= 170.5. That doesn't match the 156. So maybe not option C.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same formula as B, same molecular weight. So D's molecular weight is also around 156.45. So both B and D have same molecular weights. So how do I differentiate? Let's look at the other data.

The IR data shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks usually indicate O-H stretching. Benzoic acid has a carboxylic acid group, which has a broad O-H peak. Benzaldehyde would also have an aldehyde O-H, but wait, aldehydes have a peak around 2820 and 2720, which are the aldehyde C-H stretches, but the broad peak in IR is from 3500-2700, which is more like an -OH stretch. So that suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group, which is a broad O-H stretch, or maybe an alcohol or phenol. But the options: A is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a hydroxy group (phenol), so that would have a broad peak. B and D are benzoic acids, which have a strong and broad O-H. So B and D fit the IR here, as does A.

Wait, but the IR also has a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's indicative of a carbonyl group. So looking at the options:

- Benzoic acid (B, D) would have a carbonyl (COOH) around 1700 cm^-1. The peak is at 1720, which is a bit higher. Maybe if it's deprotonated or something else. Alternatively, an ester or aldehyde.

- A is a benzaldehyde with a hydroxyl group. The aldehyde carbonyl is around 1720, maybe? Because aldehyde carbonyl is usually around 1700-1720 cm^-1. So an aldehyde would have a peak around there. The IR also shows a broad peak, which would be the aldehyde's O-H? Wait, no. Aldehydes don't have O-H unless there's an adjacent -OH. Wait, in option A, it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So it's a benzaldehyde with a hydroxy group in the 2 position. So the aldehyde group would have a strong peak at 1720, and the alcohol (phenol) would have a broad peak.

So that fits. Similarly, benzoic acid (B, D) would have a carboxylic acid, which has a broad peak and a carbonyl at around 1700, but maybe the 1720 suggests an aldehyde or an ester.

Wait, another thought: the IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700. Aldehydes have a peak around 2820 and 2720 (the aldehyde C-H stretch), which are sharp. The broad peak suggests an O-H stretch. So perhaps the compound has a hydroxyl group. So looking at the options:

- A: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So that's a benzaldehyde with a hydroxyl group in the 2 position (ortho to the aldehyde). So the IR would have a broad O-H (from the phenol group) and a strong aldehyde C=O around 1720. That fits.

- B and D: 4-chlorobenzoic acid or 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H (from the -COOH group) and a strong C=O around 1700. So the 1720 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester.

Wait, the molecular ion is 156, which matches benzoic acid (like B and D) and the aldehyde + hydroxyl (A). Let me think about the NMR data.

The 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H).

An aromatic region. Let's think about each option.

Option A: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

The structure would have an aldehyde group (CHO), a hydroxyl (OH) in position 2, and Cl in position 3. Let's draw the benzene ring.

Positions: 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). Wait, or is it 2-hydroxy, 3-chloro, and 1 being the aldehyde? Wait, benzaldehyde has the CHO at position 1. So 3-chloro-2-hydroxy would mean Cl is at position 3, OH at 2, CHO at 1.

In such a case, the ring would have substituents at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). So the remaining positions 4,5,6. Wait, but in that case, the substituents are at adjacent positions. Hmm, perhaps that's possible.

Looking at the NMR: 11 ppm is a singlet (s), which could be the aldehyde proton. Wait, wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But in some cases, they can be deshielded more. Alternatively, the 11 ppm could be an exchangeable proton, like an -OH. But in DMSO or another solvent, the OH might show as a broad peak, but in the NMR given, it's a singlet at 11 ppm. So maybe it’s an aldehyde proton? Or perhaps a phenolic OH? Wait, but phenolic OHs usually are broader and appear around 5-10 ppm, but sometimes can be upfield or downfield depending on the situation.

Wait, another thought: the 11 ppm peak is a singlet, which is 1H. In benzoic acid derivatives, the carboxylic acid proton is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. So if the compound is a benzoic acid, the 11 ppm peak could be the COOH proton. But benzoic acid's COOH is a broad peak, but in the NMR, it's a singlet. Oh, but wait, in the NMR, the COOH might have exchanged and perhaps only shows up as a small peak. Alternatively, maybe the solvent is affecting it.

Alternatively, the 11 ppm could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually lower field, around 9-10 ppm. So 11 is a bit high, but possible. Let me think.

The other NMR signals are at 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic system with two doublets. So each doublet is integrating to 2H, which indicates a para-substituted structure. So maybe a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions, but wait, that would give two doublets. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two substituents, each in positions that cause two doublets.

Wait, but in option B and D, which are benzoic acids, the substituents would be Cl and COOH. Let's think about 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B). The structure is Cl at position 4, COOH at position 1. So the ring substituents would be at positions 1 and 4. That's para to each other.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The ring would have two sets of equivalent protons: the two protons adjacent to COOH (positions 2 and 6) and the two protons adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5). Wait, no. Let me think again. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the protons at 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH. The protons at 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl.

In the NMR, the two doublets would be due to the coupling between adjacent protons. So the H's at 2 and 6 would be deshielded due to the COOH group. They would couple with their adjacent H's, leading to a doublet. Similarly, the H's at 3 and 5 would couple with each other, perhaps. But wait, in a para-substituted ring, the H's are equivalent in pairs. So maybe the two doublets are from two sets of equivalent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the two doublets are due to substituents at positions 2 and 5 or something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the coupling.

The NMR shows a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another at 7.72 (2H). So each is a doublet. So each of these sets is split into a doublet, which suggests each proton is coupling with one neighboring proton. In a benzene ring, each proton has two neighbors, so if the coupling is only with one, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted ring with substituents that cause each set to have two equivalent protons, each coupling with the same substituent.

Wait, perhaps the ring has two substituents that are meta to each other, but that would lead to more complex splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions that create two doublets each integrating to two protons.

Wait, maybe considering the substituents. If the substituents are at positions 1 and 3, for example, that could lead to certain coupling patterns. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the NMR for option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

The structure is:

COOH at position 1, Cl at position 4.

So the ring has substituents opposite each other (para). The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6.

Protons 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Protons 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

In terms of chemical shifts, the protons next to the COOH group (2 and 6) would be more deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effect of COOH, so their chemical shifts would be upfield or downfield? Wait, electron-withdrawing groups de-shield the ring, so the neighboring protons would be at higher ppm.

Similarly, the Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, so the protons next to Cl would also be deshielded.

So for 4-chlorobenzoic acid:

Protons 2 and 6: next to COOH, deshielded → higher ppm.

Protons 3 and 5: next to Cl, deshielded → higher ppm.

But the COOH is a stronger electron-withdrawing group than Cl, perhaps. So protons 2 and 6 would be more deshielded than 3 and 5.

In the NMR, the two doublets are at 8.02 and 7.72. So perhaps the two more deshielded (higher ppm) are the ones adjacent to COOH (positions 2 and 6), each as a doublet.

Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene with substituents at 1 and 4, the protons 2 and 6 are equivalent, and protons 3 and 5 are equivalent. So their NMR signals would be as two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

So in the NMR, the 8.02 ppm is the more deshielded (downfield) set (positions 2 and 6), and 7.72 is the less deshielded set (positions 3 and 5), each as a doublet.

That seems to fit. So the NMR would have two doublets at around 8.0 and 7.7 ppm.

What about option A: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

The substituents are CHO at 1, OH at 2, Cl at 3. So the ring positions are 1-CHO, 2-OH, 3-Cl. The remaining protons are at 4,5,6.

Wait, but in this structure, the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. So the ring would have protons at 4,5,6, but each with different substituents nearby. Hmm, this might complicate the NMR.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in positions 4,5,6. Let me think about their shifts.

Position 4: adjacent to position 3 (Cl) → deshielded → higher ppm.

Position 5: adjacent to position 4 (Cl) and position 6 (which is adjacent to position 1 (CHO)).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the ring would have a para-substituted pattern, but with substituents in adjacent positions, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the aldehyde group would cause certain shifts.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the NMR for option A. The 11 ppm peak could be the aldehyde proton. But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. 11 is a bit high, but possible.

But then, the other peaks are 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That suggests four aromatic protons in two doublets. But in the case of option A, the substituents are in positions 1,2,3, leaving positions 4,5,6. If position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (CHO), perhaps it's more deshielded. So maybe the aromatic protons in positions 4 and 6 would be one set, and position 5 another. But that doesn't fit the NMR shown.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility of the NMR not showing all the protons. Wait, the NMR list includes 11.0 (1H), 8.02 (2H), 7.72 (2H). So that's 5H in total. But the molecular formula for option A is C7H5ClO2. So the molecule has 5 H's. So the NMR data adds up. So it's possible that the structure has only five protons—like a benzaldehyde with substituents that take away two Hs, but that's not the case. Wait, no. Wait, benzaldehyde is C6H5CHO, which has 5 H's on the benzene (since CHO is a substituent). But in option A, with substituents at 1,2,3, the remaining positions would have 3 H's, but the NMR shows 5 H's. Wait, perhaps I'm confused.

Wait, let me recount the Hs for each option.

Option A: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is:

Positions 1: CHO (no H), position 2: OH (no H), position 3: Cl (no H). So the benzene ring has Hs at positions 4,5,6. So three H's. But the NMR shows 1H (11 ppm), 2H, 2H → total 5 H's. So that doesn't fit. Unless there's another H elsewhere. Wait, the aldehyde has one H. So the total H's would be 1 (aldehyde) +3 (benzene) =4. But the NMR has 1+2+2=5. So option A can't be right because it would have 4 H's, but the NMR shows 5. So that would eliminate option A.

Wait, that's an important point. So if option A only has 4 H's (1 aldehyde + 3 on the ring), but the NMR shows 5, then A is not possible. So I can eliminate option A.

That leaves options B, C, D.

Wait, option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. So the structure is:

COOH at position 1, Cl at position 4. The benzene ring has 5 H's? No, because COOH is a substituent (no H), Cl is a substituent (no H). So the ring has 4 H's, correct? Positions 2,3,5,6. So each pair (2 and 6, 3 and 5) are equivalent. So their NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2 H's. That's 4 H's. Plus the COOH proton, which is the 11 ppm singlet. So total H's are 5, which matches the NMR data (1+2+2=5).

Similarly, option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure: COOH at 1, Cl at 2. The ring has H's at 3,4,5,6. So again, the ring has four H's. Let's think about their positions. H at 3 is adjacent to Cl (position 2) and H at 4. H at 6 is adjacent to H at 5 and the COOH group. Wait, this could lead to more complex splitting.

But in the NMR data, the two doublets are each for two H's. So perhaps in option D, the substituents are at 1 and 2, which are adjacent. This leads to the ring being ortho-substituted. Which would change the splitting. Let me think.

In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). The aromatic H's are at 3,4,5,6. The H's at 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl, and the H's at 4 and 6 are adjacent to COOH.

So the H's at 3 and 5 would be more deshielded due to Cl, and the H's at 4 and 6 would be more deshielded due to COOH.

In the NMR, the H's at 4 and 6 would be upfield or downfield? Wait, the COOH group is electron-withdrawing, so the adjacent H's (4 and 6) would be deshielded → higher ppm. Similarly, Cl is electron-withdrawing, so H's 3 and 5 would be deshielded → higher ppm.

So in the NMR, there would be two sets: one more deshielded (higher ppm) and one less so. For example, the H's adjacent to COOH would be at higher ppm (like 8.02), and those adjacent to Cl would be at lower ppm (like 7.72). But wait, Cl is stronger in electron-withdrawing than COOH? Or is it the other way around? COOH is a stronger EWG than Cl. So the H's adjacent to COOH would be more deshielded.

Wait, H's next to COOH (positions 4 and 6) would be more downfield. So their chemical shifts would be higher than those next to Cl.

So the NMR would show a doublet at higher ppm (8.02) for H's 4 and 6, and another at 7.72 for H's 3 and 5. That fits with the NMR data.

So for both options B and D, the NMR data could fit. But let's think about the IR.

The IR has a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. Benzoic acid has a carbonyl around 1700 cm^-1, but maybe the peak is a bit higher because of substitution.

Alternatively, the presence of Cl could influence the carbonyl peak. If the peak is at 1720, which is higher than the typical 1700 for COOH, perhaps it's an ester or aldehyde. But benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1700, perhaps a bit higher depending on substitution.

Another thought: 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B) would have the Cl in para position relative to COOH. The Cl is an EWG, which would increase the carbonyl's wavenumber. So the carbonyl peak would be upshifted, which could reach 1720. That could explain the IR peak.

Similarly, 2-chlorobenzoic acid (option D) would have Cl in the ortho position, which would have a stronger EWG effect than para. So the carbonyl peak would be higher, possibly at 1720. So both B and D could fit in the IR.

But looking at the mass spec, the molecular ion is 156. Both B and D have the same molecular weight, so that doesn't help. But the IR also has a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Benzoic acid's O-H is broad, which matches. The aldehyde's O-H (in option A) is phenol, which would also have a broad peak.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option A is eliminated because the NMR didn't fit. So back to options B and D.

The main difference between B and D is the position of Cl. Let's think about the NMR again.

For option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid):

The ring H's at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH, meta to Cl) would be more deshielded and appear at higher ppm (say, 8.02). The H's at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl, meta to COOH) would be less deshielded and appear at 7.72.

For option D (2-chlorobenzoic acid):

The ring H's at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl) would be more deshielded and appear at higher ppm (8.02), and the H's at 4 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be more deshielded than the others. Wait, but wait: in D, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So H's at 4 and 6 are meta to Cl and para to COOH. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting in the NMR would be different based on the substituents' positions. In the para-substituted case (B), the two doublets would each correspond to two equivalent H's, which is what the NMR shows. In the ortho-substituted case (D), the splitting might be more complex. For instance, in D, the H's at 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl, and H's at 4 and 6 are adjacent to COOH. So their shifts would be more downfield than the others. But in D, the ring protons would be in a different environment. Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets each integrating to 2H. So it's possible that in D, the H's at 3 and 5 are a doublet, and H's at 4 and 6 are another doublet, each of 2H.

But in that case, the shifts would have to be such that the H's adjacent to Cl are at 7.72 and those adjacent to COOH are at 8.02, which would fit.

Wait, but let's think about di substitution. For benzoic acid derivatives, the substitution pattern affects ring current and chemical shifts. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid (para substitution), the two sets of H's (ortho and meta) would each have their own shifts. Similarly, for 2-chlorobenzoic acid (ortho substitution), the H's would have different patterns.

But how to differentiate between B and D based on the NMR?

In option B, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl), so the H's at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. H's at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

In option D, substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the H's at 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. H's at 4 and 6 are meta to Cl and para to COOH.

The chemical shifts would be determined by the substituents' effects. COOH is a stronger EWG than Cl, so the H's adjacent to COOH would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than those adjacent to Cl.

So in B, the H's ortho to COOH (2 and 6) would be higher ppm (8.02), and H's ortho to Cl (3 and 5) would be at lower ppm (7.72).

In D, the H's ortho to Cl (3 and 5) would be more deshielded (higher ppm) because Cl is EWG, and H's adjacent to COOH (4 and 6) would be even more deshielded because COOH is a stronger EWG. So in D, the H's at 4 and 6 would be at higher ppm than H's at 3 and 5. So the doublet for 4 and 6 would be at higher ppm (8.02) and the doublet for 3 and 5 at 7.72.

Wait, but wait, in that case, the NMR for D would have the same pattern as B, but the substituents are in different positions. So how can I tell them apart?

Alternatively, maybe the coupling patterns would differ. In B, the substituents are para, leading to a certain coupling, while in D, substituents are ortho, leading to different coupling.

But I'm not sure about that. Let me think about the coupling in the NMR.

In a para-substituted benzene, each H is two bonds away from a substituent. Wait, perhaps the coupling is between vicinal (adjacent) H's. In a para-substituted benzene, the H's are arranged such that each H is coupled with two others. But in the NMR, each of the two doublets has two H's. So for each doublet, each H is coupled with one other H, leading to a doublet. Maybe that's the case when the substituents are in such a way that the protons are in a meta arrangement relative to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting isn't due to coupling between adjacent H's but due to coupling with substituents. Wait, substituents don't usually cause splitting; it's the adjacent H's that do.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: look at the options and see which one fits all the data.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Mass: 156 → matches.

IR: broad peak (carboxylic acid OH), strong peak at 1720 (carboxylic acid C=O, possibly upshifted by Cl).

NMR: 11 ppm (COOH proton), 8.02 (two H's ortho to COOH), 7.72 (two H's ortho to Cl). Fits.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

Mass: same.

IR: same.

NMR: 11 ppm (COOH), 8.02 (two H's ortho to COOH?), but wait, in D, the H's ortho to COOH would actually be the H's at positions 4 and 6, which are adjacent to COOH.

Wait, no, the H's ortho to COOH would be at positions 2 and 6, but position 2 is Cl in D. So in D, the H's adjacent to COOH are positions 6 and 4? Not sure.

Wait, in D, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the H's at 4 and 6 are next to substituents. How?

Wait, position 4 is adjacent to position 3 and 5. Position 6 is adjacent to position 5 and 1 (COOH). So H at 6 is adjacent to COOH.

So in D, H's at 6 and 4 would be ortho to substituents (Cl or COOH). Wait, perhaps the H's at 6 are ortho to COOH (position 1) and meta to Cl (position 2). So their shifts would be higher ppm because of the COOH group. H's at 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. So their shifts would be higher due to Cl but lower than those next to COOH.

So in D, the NMR would show the H's next to COOH (positions 6 and 4) at higher ppm (8.02), and H's next to Cl (positions 3 and 5) at lower ppm (7.72). That matches the NMR data.

So both B and D fit the NMR, but how to choose between them.

Wait, another thought: in option B, the substituents are para, leading to the aromatic ring being symmetric in a certain way. The substituents are at 1 and 4, so the ring is symmetric across the 1-4 axis. Therefore, the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to two H's, which matches the data.

In option D, substituents are at 1 and 2, which are adjacent. So the ring isn't symmetric in the same way, but it would still have two sets of equivalent H's, each in a doublet. So the NMR would still fit.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the splitting. In para substitution, each H is coupled with two others, but since they're equivalent, they appear as a doublet. In ortho substitution, each H may couple with more H's, leading to more splitting. But in the given NMR, it's only two doublets, each 2H. So perhaps in the para case, the splitting is simpler.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling constants can help. But the question doesn't provide that info.

Another approach: looking at the mass spec. The molecular ion is at 156 (100%), and a peak at 158 (32%). The 158 is M+2. Cl has a natural abundance of about 34% for M+2. So the 32% is close to that, which suggests one Cl atom in the molecule. So all options have one Cl except option C, which I think doesn't fit the mass spec. So options A, B, D have Cl.

Wait, option C: phenyl chloroformate. Its molecular formula would be C6H5O2Cl. Let's calculate: 6*12=72, 5=5, 32 (O2), 35.5=35.5. Total is 72+5+32+35.5=144.5. But the molecular ion is 156, so C is out. So option C is probably incorrect.

So going back to options B and D. How to choose between them.

Another thought: the 1H NMR of benzoic acid derivatives. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) are more deshielded and appear downfield. The H's ortho to Cl (3 and 5) are also deshielded but less so. So their shifts would be higher than typical, but perhaps the one adjacent to COOH would be higher.

In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the H's adjacent to Cl would be more deshielded. Let me look up some data. Wait, I'm supposed to think without external resources. Alternatively, perhaps the downfield shift is more influenced by the proximity to the COOH group.

Wait, another thought: in the 1H NMR of benzoic acids, the protons adjacent to the COOH group (ortho) are usually more deshielded and appear around 8.0-8.1 ppm, while the para and meta protons can be lower. So in option B, the H's ortho to COOH are at 8.02, which fits. In option D, the H's ortho to COOH would be at positions 6 and 4, but wait, in D, the substituents are at 1 and 2. So the H's at 4 and 6 are not ortho to COOH. Wait, no: position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (COOH), so it's ortho to COOH. So in D, the H's at 6 and 4 would be ortho to substituents. Wait, that's getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the order of substituents. In option B, substituents are para, leading to the two doublets being of the same type. In option D, substituents are ortho, leading to a different coupling.

Wait, perhaps the downfield shift is more influenced by the substituent's position. For example, in option D, the Cl is in the ortho position relative to COOH. That would cause the ring to have a stronger electron-withdrawing effect, which might cause the adjacent H's to be more deshielded. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 11 ppm peak is the COOH proton. Benzoic acid's COOH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. But in the NMR, it's a singlet, which suggests it's not exchanging or perhaps it's deuterated. Wait, the NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm, which would fit the COOH proton. But in benzoic acid, the COOH proton is usually broad, but in the question, it's given as a singlet. So that suggests that the proton is not splitting, perhaps because it's not coupled to any other H's or due to being in a different environment.

Wait, perhaps in the case of a benzoic acid, the COOH proton is a singlet because it's not split by any adjacent H's. But in reality, the COOH proton is usually split by the adjacent H's, but in the case of para substitution, perhaps the coupling is not observed due to symmetry or other factors. I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a deuterated compound, but the question doesn't mention that. So I'll proceed.

Another approach: looking at the substituents' effects on chemical shifts. The H's in the para position to Cl would be more deshielded than those meta or ortho. Wait, that's getting a bit tangled.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the options. Let me look at the options again:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The substituents are para, so the ring is symmetric.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Substituents are ortho, so the ring is less symmetric.

In the NMR, the two doublets are each integrating to 2H. In a para-substituted benzoic acid, the H's are symmetric and would split into two doublets. In an ortho-substituted benzoic acid, perhaps the H's are in a less symmetric environment, which could lead to more complex splitting, but the NMR shows two doublets, which suggests symmetry.

So perhaps option B is the correct one because the para substitution leads to equivalent H's and thus simpler splitting. Option D, being ortho, would cause the H's to be in a less symmetric environment, possibly leading to more complex splitting than two doublets. But the NMR shows two doublets, which suggests two sets of equivalent H's.

So I'm leaning towards option B.

Wait, but I thought option D could also fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of Cl in the para position would cause the carbonyl peak to be at a higher wavenumber due to stronger EWG effect compared to ortho substitution. Because in para substitution, the Cl is farther away, but in ortho, it's closer. Wait, in terms of resonance effects, the para substituent's EWG effect would be transmitted through resonance, which is more effective in para than in meta or ortho positions. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the resonance effect is stronger in para substitution because the substituent is directly across the ring, allowing for maximum conjugation. So the presence of Cl in para would have a stronger resonance effect, which would increase the carbonyl's wavenumber. So the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 could be explained better by Cl being para to COOH, as it would cause a higher shift.

Therefore, option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) would have a higher carbonyl peak than option D (2-chlorobenzoic acid) because the Cl is in the para position, enhancing the EWG effect on the carbonyl group.

So this would support option B being the correct answer.

Putting it all together:

- Mass spec: molecular ion at 156, with M+2 at 158 (32%), suggesting one Cl atom.

- IR: broad peak (OH) and strong peak at 1720 (carbonyl).

- NMR: 11 ppm (singlet, likely COOH proton), two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm, each integrating to 2H, suggesting para substitution with substituents causing two sets of equivalent H's.

So the correct structural suggestion is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** (100%) and a secondary peak at **m/z = 158** (32%) suggest the presence of one chlorine atom, as the natural abundance of the $^{37}$Cl isotope is approximately 34%. This aligns with the molecular formulas of the options, which all contain one chlorine atom.

### IR Analysis:
- The **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm$^-$** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or phenol.
- The **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm$^-$** suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). This wavenumber is consistent with a carboxylic acid or aldehyde.

### $^1$H NMR Analysis:
- The **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** peak corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH), which is typically deshielded and appears as a singlet.
- The **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** peaks indicate two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, where the substituents create two distinct environments for the protons.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - This compound contains a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an aldehyde group (-CHO).  
   - The aldehyde proton would typically appear around 9-10 ppm, not 11 ppm. Additionally, the NMR data shows five protons (1H + 2H + 2H), but this compound only has four aromatic protons, making it inconsistent with the NMR data.  
   - **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - This compound has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a chlorine atom in the para position.  
   - The molecular ion at **m/z = 156** matches the molecular weight of this compound.  
   - The IR peak at 1720 cm$^-$ corresponds to the carboxylic acid carbonyl group, and the broad peak from 3500-2700 cm$^-$ matches the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid.  
   - The NMR data fits: the **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** is the carboxylic acid proton, and the two doublets at **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** correspond to the aromatic protons in a para-substituted ring.  
   - **Consistent with all data.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   - The molecular formula of phenyl chloroformate is **C$$_6$$H$$_5$$O$$_2$$Cl**, which has a molecular weight of approximately 144.5. This does not match the molecular ion at **m/z = 156**.  
   - **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - This compound has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a chlorine atom in the ortho position.  
   - While the molecular ion at **m/z = 156** matches, the NMR data does not fully align. In an ortho-substituted ring, the aromatic protons would not produce two distinct doublets with equal integration, as seen in the NMR data.  
   - **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular ion peak, IR peaks, and $^1$H NMR signals, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The para substitution pattern explains the two distinct aromatic proton environments observed in the NMR.

**Answer: B**
