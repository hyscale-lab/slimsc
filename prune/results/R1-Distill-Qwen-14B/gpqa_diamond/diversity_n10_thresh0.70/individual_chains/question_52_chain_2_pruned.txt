Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with some specific characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Now, when looking at the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Titanium (Ti) in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2), the ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes—specifically, the ratio when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which I think is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe visible range. And the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which is a common assumption in stellar spectroscopy.

Hmm. So, the key here is to figure out how the ratio of atoms in two energy levels changes with temperature. I remember that in LTE, the population of energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The formula I think is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T the temperature.

In this problem, the ratio observed is n1/n2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ratio is the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2. So, R = n1 / n2. According to the Boltzmann equation, this ratio is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T) ). 

But the question says that when there are spots, the ratio decreases. So when the spots are present, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K compared to 6000 K). So when the star is cooler (spots), the ratio is lower. So the ratio is higher when the star is hotter (no spots) than when it's cooler (spots). So the factor would be (R_no_spots) / (R_with_spots) = some number.

Wait, but the formula is R = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Let's think about the transition. The transition corresponds to a certain wavelength. I think the energy difference between the two levels is E2 - E1 = hc/λ, assuming that the transition emits a photon of that wavelength. Or wait, if the transition is from level 2 to level 1, then E2 > E1, and the photon has energy E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So E_i - E_j would be E1 - E2 = - (E2 - E1) = - hc/λ.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as E_i is the upper state, and E_j is lower. So the transition from i to j emits a photon of wavelength λ. So E_i - E_j = hc/λ.

So, in the Boltzmann factor, it's -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) = -(hc/(λ k T)). Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the sign. Let me write it correctly. The exponent is (E_i - E_j)/(k T), but wait no—because the formula is n_i /n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E_i > E_j, the exponent is negative, making the ratio n_i/n_j smaller than 1 if E_i > E_j, assuming same statistical weights.

Wait, but in this problem, they're considering the ratio n1/n2. Let me clarify: level 1 and level 2. Suppose level 2 is higher energy than level 1. So E2 > E1. The transition from level 2 to level 1 emits a photon of wavelength λ. So E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So when we compute n1/n2, it's (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2) / (k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( hc/(λ k T) )

Since hc/(λ) is positive, and with T being positive, the exponent is positive. So as T increases, the exponent increases, making exp(...) larger. So the ratio n1/n2 increases with higher T when E2>E1 (and assuming g1/g2 is fixed, which it is because they are statistical weights of the levels, which are constants).

But wait in the problem, when T decreases (from 6000K to 5500K), the ratio R (n1/n2) decreases. So that matches our expectation because when T is lower, the exponent hc/(lambda k T) is smaller, so the exp is smaller. So the ratio R is lower when the star is cooler, which is consistent with the problem statement.

But the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes. So the factor is (R_no_spots) / (R_with_spots) = [ (g1/g2) exp( hc/(lambda k T_no) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( hc/(lambda k T_with) ) ] 

The g1/g2 terms cancel out. So it becomes exp( (hc/(lambda k)) (1/T_no -
