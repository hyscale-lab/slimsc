Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)₂]²+ complex. Hmm, wait, but I might be mixing up the colors. I remember that the different complexes of Co(II) have different colors, and the blue one is the tetrahedral one, maybe [Co(SCN)₂]²+? Or wait, no, wait. I think the blue one is the +2 charge, [Co(SCN)₂]²+ is the dithiocyanato complex, right? Or maybe it's another one. Well, perhaps details about the colors aren't critical here, but the question refers to the blue dithiocyanato, so I'll proceed with that assumption.

So, the question is about the distribution of cobalt species in the solution. The stability constants (formation constants) are given for four complexes: β1 through β4. Wait, what do the subscripts mean here? Typically, βn is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 would be for [Co(SCN)]+ (monodentate?), β2 would be for [Co(SCN)₂]²+ (dithiocyanato), β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^0? Hmm, wait, because each SCN is -1 charge. So each SCN contributes a -1 charge. So let's see:

Co²+ + n SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_n]^(2 -n). So for n=1: [CoSCN]^+ → charge is 2+ -1 = +1. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → 2+ - 2*(1) = 0. So β2 is for the neutral complex.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- → 2+ -3 = -1. So β3 is for that.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2- → 2+ -4 = -2. So β4 is for that.

Wait, but the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, that's a bit odd because β3 is the largest, so the most stable is the [Co(SCN)_3]^- complex?

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]²+ (n=2). So we need to find the fraction of Co that is in the form [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

But wait, the problem states that the
