Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2-dimensional metric in some coordinates. So this is probably a 2-dimensional spacetime or maybe a surface embedded in higher dimensions? Oh wait, the question mentions a pseudosphere, which is a term from hyperbolic geometry, right? Pseudospheres are like surfaces of constant negative curvature.

But wait, in the context of metrics, a pseudosphere metric usually has a specific form. Let me think: the metric for a pseudosphere in 2D is often written in terms of Poincaré coordinates. The standard metric is something like ds² = (dr² + dz²) / (z²)^2 or something similar, but I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, maybe more accurately, the Poincaré disk model has a metric that you can write in terms of x and y coordinates where the line element is (dx² + dy²) / (1 - (x² + y²))^2. But wait, in that model, the radius is usually 1. 

Wait, the given metric here is [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me compare that to the standard Poincaré disk metric. So for the standard Poincaré disk with radius a, the metric is (dx² + dy²) / (a² - (x² + y²))^2. But wait, in this problem, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which is a² - (x² + y²) with a²=4, so a=2. So the metric would be (dx² + dy²) / (4 - x² - y²)^2 multiplied by a factor of 32. Wait, but in the standard case, it's divided by (a² - r²)^2, and in this case, the denominator is (4 - r²), where r is sqrt(x² + y²).

Wait, so the given metric is 32 times (dx² + dy²) divided by (4 - x² - y²). Let's write that as 32/(4 - r²) where r² is x² + y². The standard Poincaré disk metric is (dx² + dy²)/(a² - r²)^2. So in this case, our metric is 32/(4 - r²) (dx² + dy²). Let me compare the two.

Hmm, but wait, the standard metric is (1/(a² - r²)^2)) (dx² + dy²). Let me compute the ratio: 32/(4 - r²) = (32/4^2) * (1/(4 - r²)/4 )^{-something}... Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe I should consider the area element.

In the standard Poincaré disk model, the area element is (a²)/( (a² - r²)^2 ) dx dy. But wait, I might be mixing up some terms. Alternatively, the area of the pseudosphere (which is a 2D surface) in the Poincaré disk model with radius a is π a². But wait, no. Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface with infinite area. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the Poincaré disk model has finite area for the whole hyperbolic plane. Wait, no, the hyperbolic plane has infinite area. Or is the pseudosphere different?

Wait, wait, no. The Poincaré disk model is a representation of the hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. So any 'pseudosphere' as a manifold would have infinite area. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between the radius of the model and the actual radius of the pseudosphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is that of a 2-sphere, but in some conformally flat coordinates. Wait, but the question mentions pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, so more like a hyperboloid.

Wait, let me think again. The given metric is in 2D, so it's a 2-dimensional surface. When you have a metric, the area can be found by integrating the area element over the surface. The area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

Wait, so the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So in matrix form, the metric tensor g has components g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = same, and the off-diagonal terms are zero. So the determinant g is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2.

So the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy? Wait, no, in 2D, when the metric is diagonal, the area element is sqrt(|g|) dx dy, where |g| is the determinant. Since g is diagonal, the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2, where r² =x² + y². So sqrt(g) is 32/(4 - r²). So dA = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

Wait, but the area of the entire pseudosphere would require integrating this over all x and y where the metric is defined. So what's the domain of x and y? The denominator is 4 - x² - y², which must be positive, so x² + y² <4. So the domain is the disk of radius 2. So the integration would be over x² + y² <4.

So the area is the double integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

Wait, but that integral could be tricky. Let's switch to polar coordinates since the problem is symmetric.

In polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², dx dy = r dr dθ. So the integral becomes:

Area = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this. First, factor out the constants:

32 * ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Compute the θ integral first: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So Area = 32 * 2π ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Now, the remaining integral is ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2. Let me substitute u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r, so (-1/2) du = r dr.

Wait, let me compute the integral:

∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = ∫ [ (-1/2) du ] / u.

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du = (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

So substituting back, u =4 - r², so the integral from r=0 to r=2 is:

[ (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) ] evaluated from 0 to 2.

At r=2: ln(4 -4)= ln(0) → which is negative infinity. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, but wait, when r approaches 2 from below, 4 - r² approaches zero, so ln(0) is negative infinity. So evaluating from 0 to 2 would be (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this becomes (-1/2)( -infty - ln4 ) = positive infinity. So the integral diverges.

Wait, so the area is infinite? That can't be right because the options include D) +infty. So the area would be infinite, meaning option D.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check. The metric is given as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y^2)] (dx² + dy^2). So the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dθ. Integrate from r=0 to r=2, θ=0 to 2π.

So the integral is 32 * 2π ∫0^2 [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Wait, but when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand behaves like 2/(4 - (2)^2) = 2/0, which is a vertical asymptote. So near r=2, the function blows up. Therefore, the integral is improper and might diverge.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2. Let me compute it as a limit:

Integral from 0 to a, where a approaches 2 from below.

So the integral becomes [ (-1/2) ln(4 - a²) ) ] evaluated from 0 to a.

At a=2, 4 -a²=0, so ln(0) → -infty. So as a approaches 2, the integral becomes (-1/2)( -infty - ln4 ), which goes to positive infinity.

So the area is (32 * 2 π ) * (infinite) ) which is infinite. So the area is infinite.

But wait, the options include D) +infty, so the answer would be D. But wait, another thought: could the metric describe a pseudosphere with finite area?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the model with the actual geometric object. The Poincaré disk model has infinite area, but the pseudosphere (which is a finite surface) is usually represented as a tractricoid. Wait, no, the tractrix surface is a finite area. Or is that different?

Wait, no. The tractrix is the shape traced by a point on a line being pulled along a straight path. But the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, which in 3D space, has infinite area. Wait, I'm getting confused between the 2D hyperbolic plane and the 3D pseudosphere.

Wait, the 3D pseudosphere has finite area. Oh wait, no. Wait, the surface area of a pseudosphere (like a horn torus but with negative curvature) is finite. Or is it? I think I remember that the pseudosphere has finite surface area but infinite volume when it's embedded in 3D. But wait, that's in 3D. But in 2D, the hyperbolic plane has infinite area.

But in this question, the metric is given as a 2D metric, so it's a 2D surface. So if the area integral is divergent, then the area is infinite.

So the answer would be option D) +infty.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional surface. The task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). 

### Key Analysis:

1. **Metric and Area Element**:  
   The metric is diagonal, with components \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The determinant of the metric is \( |g| = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2 \). The area element in 2D is given by \( dA = \sqrt{|g|} \, dx \, dy \), which simplifies to:

   \[
   dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
   \]

2. **Domain of Integration**:  
   The metric is defined for \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), which corresponds to the disk \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \) or \( r^2 < 4 \), where \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Thus, the integration is over the region \( r \in [0, 2) \) and \( \theta \in [0, 2\pi) \).

3. **Switch to Polar Coordinates**:  
   Using polar coordinates \( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \), and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \), the area becomes:

   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

4. **Simplifying the Integral**:  
   Factor out constants:

   \[
   A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
   \]

   Let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), and \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

   \[
   \int \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \ln|u| + C.
   \]

   Evaluating from \( r = 0 \) to \( r = 2 \):

   \[
   \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \left[-\frac{1}{2} \ln(4 - r^2)\right]_0^2.
   \]

   At \( r = 2 \), \( 4 - r^2 = 0 \), so \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \). Thus, the integral diverges to \( +\infty \).

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The area integral diverges, meaning the area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.

### Final Answer:
The area of the pseudosphere is infinite.  
**Answer: D**
