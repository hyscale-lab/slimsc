Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key here is the radial velocity measurements.

Radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. When the star moves towards us, the spectral lines shift blue (shorter wavelength), and when it moves away, they shift red (longer wavelength). The periodic shift indicates the planet's presence because the star is orbiting the center of mass with the planet.

In this case, Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the planet and the parameters of the orbit. The formula, if I recall correctly, is K = (v) = (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 AU)^(1/3) * (1 year) ) )^(1/ something). Wait, maybe it's better to think of the formula in terms of the orbital period.

Another approach: The RV method's semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (but since both are circular, maybe inclination is the same? Or it's assumed edge-on?), the mass of the star, and the orbital period.

Wait, I think the formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (1) / ( (4π²/(G M_*))^(1/3) ) ) ) ) 

Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler version. Alternatively, I know that for circular orbits, the formula simplifies. Also, since the planet mass is much smaller than the star (Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_* >>
