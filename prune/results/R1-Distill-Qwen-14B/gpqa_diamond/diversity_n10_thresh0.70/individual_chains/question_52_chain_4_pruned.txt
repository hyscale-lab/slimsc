Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident about this topic. But let's take it step by step. The question is about stars and their effective temperature, and how spots on the star affect certain atomic ratios in the photosphere. Hmm, right, I remember that stars can have dark spots which are cooler regions, and these affect the overall observed temperature.

So the problem says that the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes between no spots and when it has spots.

Wait, the ratio decreases when there are spots. So when there are spots, the overall Teff is lower, which means the photosphere is cooler. How does temperature affect the ratio of populations in energy levels?

Oh, right! The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem states that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. Wait, no, the ratio is n1/n2. Because the question says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti in level 1 and level 2 (so n1/n2) decreases when spots are present. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower. That makes sense because lower temperature would lead to a lower ratio of higher energy state to lower. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1. So if E2 > E1, then the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So when T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller. So n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(kT)) would increase if T decreases, because the exponential term gets larger. Wait, no, because if n2/n1 decreases, then n1/n2 increases. So if the observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases when there are spots, that would imply that T has gone down? Wait, that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, let me clarify. Without spots, Teff is 6000 K. With spots, overall Teff is 5500 K. So when there are spots, the temperature is lower.

The ratio being discussed is n1/n2. If spots cause this ratio to decrease, that means n1/n2 is lower when T is lower. So when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases. How does that happen?
