Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about stars with dark spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Oh right, I remember that when stars have spots, their effective temperature changes, which in turn affects the ionization and excitation states of atoms in their photosphere. 

So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not spotted, its Teff is 6000K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, that's a significant drop. I wonder how that affects the photosphere.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is given as level 1 to level 2, I think. And when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so when there are no spots, the ratio is higher, and when spots are present, it's lower. So the factor is the ratio when no spots divided by the ratio when spots are present.

I remember the Boltzmann equation is used to find the ratio of populations in two energy levels. The equation is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Since the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), we can use this equation.

The energy difference between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Let me calculate the energy difference. I know that the energy E of a photon is given by E = hc / λ. 

Wait, but we might not need the exact energy difference because we can relate the ratios using the temperatures. Since the ratio depends on exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), and ΔE is proportional to 1/λ. Alternatively, since the energy difference is fixed, the exponent will change with temperature.

Let me denote the ratio as R = (n1 / n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). But since E1 > E2 (because higher level has more energy), the exponent becomes negative. Wait, no, actually E_i is the energy of level i. If the transition is from level 2 to level 1, then E2 > E1. Wait, no, if the photon emitted has wavelength 1448 Å, that would be E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So E2 is higher than E1. So the transition is from E2 to E1, emitting a photon of that wavelength.

So the Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because in the equation, it's exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where i is the upper level and j is lower. So in this case, if we're looking at n2 (upper) over n1 (lower), it's exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, no, wait. Let's think again: the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), because the formula is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ) * (g_i/g_j). Wait, no, let me correct that.

The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). If E_i > E_j, then the exponent is negative, so the ratio n_i/n_j is less than 1. So in our case, if level 1 is higher energy than level 2, then n2/n1 would be a certain value. But if the energy levels are such that level 1 is lower than level 2, then n2/n1 would be, say, higher.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio n1/n2 (I think) decreases when there are spots. So when Teff is lower (when spots are present), the ratio becomes smaller. Which would imply that the Boltzmann factor is lower, so the exponent makes the ratio decrease.

But let me clarify what the ratio is. The problem states: the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 and level 2. So that's n1/n2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So n1/n2 is higher when the star is without spots (Teff 6000K) than when it has spots (5500K).

So the ratio of (n1/n2) without spots to (n1/n2) with spots is what we need. Let's denote R1 as the ratio without spots, and R2 as the ratio with spots. So we're looking for R1/R2.

Using the Boltzmann equation, R = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ). But wait, E1 is the energy of level 1, E2 is level 2. If level 2 is higher than level 1, then E2 > E1. So (E1 - E2) is negative. So the exponent becomes positive. So exp( (E2 - E1) / (k T) ), because (E1-E2) is negative.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )^{-1} }.

Wait, let's just write the equation correctly. The ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ). So if E1 < E2, then E1 - E2 is negative, so the exponent is positive. So the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )^{-1}, which is the same as (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ).

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, the energy difference is E = hc/(lambda). Let me compute this energy.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. Lambda is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-7 meters.

So E = hc/(lambda) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7).

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Hmm, but that's in joules. To convert to eV, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that's a lot. 8.57 eV for a transition? That seems quite high because visible light is around 1-3 eV. Wait, 1448 Å is in the infrared range. Hmm, but wait, 1448 Å is 144.8 nm? No, wait, 1 Å is 0.1 nm. So 1448 Å is 144.8 nm. Oh wait, no: 1 nm is 10 Å. So 1448 Å is 144.8 nm. UV? Hmm, but 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, which is in the vacuum UV range. So the transition is emitting a UV photon. So that energy would be about 8.57 eV. That seems high, but perhaps for some ions that's possible.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do it again.

E = hc/(lambda). h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s, lambda = 1448e-10 m (since 1 Å is 1e-10 m).

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = ~8.57 eV. Wow, that's high. So the energy difference between the two levels is about 8.57 eV.

But then, when considering the Boltzmann factor, the exponential term will be significant because the energies are so much higher than kT. Wait, but the temperatures involved are 6000K and 5500K. Let me compute kT for both.

k is Boltzmann constant, 8.617e-5 eV/K. So for T=6000 K, k*T is 8.617e-5 * 6000 ≈ 0.517 eV. For T=5500 K, it's 8.617e-5 *5500 ≈ 0.4739 eV.

So the energy difference is 8.57 eV, which is much larger than kT (which is ~0.5 eV). So the exponential term will be exp( -8.57 / 0.5 ), which is exp(-17.14), a very small number. So the ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) multiplied by a very small number.

But wait, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K), so the kT is even smaller. So the exponent would be even more negative. So the ratio n1/n2 would be even smaller when the star has spots. Which matches the problem statement that the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

So, the factor by which the ratio changes is R1/R2 = [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] 

Because when without spots, T = 6000K (T1), and with spots, T =5500K (T2).

The g1/g2 terms cancel out, so we're left with exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T1 - 1/T2) ) )

Wait, let me see:

R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

= exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Wait, let's compute that.

ΔE is 8.57 eV. k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

Compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) [1/K]

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000 ≈1.666e-4. So difference is about 1.52e-5.

So:

(ΔE /k) * (1/T2 -1/T1) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * (1.52e-5 K^{-1})

Compute 8.57 /8.617e-5: 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99452.

Multiply by 1.52e-5: 99452 * 1.52e-5 ≈ (approx 99452 * 1.52) * 1e-5.

99452 * 1.52: Let's approximate. 100,000 *1.52=152,000, but it's 548 less. 548 *1.52≈832. So 152,000 -832 = 151,168. Multiply by 1e-5: 151,168e-5 = 1.51168.

So the exponent is exp(1.51168) ≈ e^1.51168.

What's e^1.5? e^1 is ~2.718, e^0.5 is ~1.648, so 2.718 * 1.648 ≈4.48. e^1.51 is a bit higher. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using calculator-like approach:

1.51168 is close to 1.5116.

We know that ln(4.5) is around 1.504 because e^1.504 ≈4.5. Hmm, let's compute ln(4.5): ln(4)=1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504077. So, 1.504077 is ln(4.5). So 1.51168 is a bit higher. So e^1.51168 is about 4.53, maybe?

Wait, let me compute 1.51168 - 1.504077 = 0.0076. So e^{1.504077 + 0.0076} = e^{1.504077} * e^{0.0076} ≈4.5 * (1 + 0.0076) ≈4.5 * 1.0076≈4.534.

So the exponent is around 4.534.

Therefore, the ratio R1/R2 is approximately 4.53. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the factor is about 4.5.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation of (1/T2 - 1/T1).

1/5500 = 0.000181818, 1/6000=0.00016666667. The difference is 0.000015152. So 1.5152e-5.

So (ΔE/k) * (1.5152e-5) = (8.57 /8.617e-5) * 1.5152e-5.

8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 / 0.00008617. Let me compute that.

8.57 ÷ 0.00008617: 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 * (1e5/8.617) = 8.57 * (approx 11603.317) ≈ 99,428. So, 99,428 * 1.5152e-5 = 99,428 * 0.000015152.

Compute 99,428 * 1.5152e-5 = 99,428 * 1.5152 * 1e-5.

Calculate 99,428 * 1.5152: let's approximate.

99,428 * 1.5 = 149,142. 99,428 * 0.0152 ≈ 1,510. So total is approximately 149,142 +1,510 =150,652.

Multiply by 1e-5: 150,652e-5 = 1.50652.

So exponent is 1.50652.

Now e^1.50652: as before, e^1.504077 is 4.5. e^1.50652 is a little more. Let me calculate how much more.

The difference is 1.50652 -1.504077 =0.002443.

e^0.002443 ≈ 1 + 0.002443 + (0.002443)^2/2 ≈1.002443 + 0.000003 ≈1.002446.

So 4.5 * 1.002446 ≈4.5109. So approximately 4.51.

So approximately 4.5, which is option C. So the answer should be C, ~4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots compared to when it does not, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are their statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. The energy difference corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Using \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), the energy difference is calculated as:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. The effective temperatures are \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (no spots) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (spots present). The Boltzmann constant is \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \).

3. The ratio of the populations when the star has no spots (\(R_1\)) to when it has spots (\(R_2\)) is given by:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
   \]

### Calculation:
1. Compute \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4}, \quad \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.667 \times 10^{-4}.
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \approx 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
   \]

2. Compute \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \):
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99452 \, \text{K}.
   \]

3. Multiply:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 99452 \times 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.506.
   \]

4. Compute the exponential:
   \[
   \exp(1.506) \approx 4.5.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which this ratio changes is approximately **4.5**.
