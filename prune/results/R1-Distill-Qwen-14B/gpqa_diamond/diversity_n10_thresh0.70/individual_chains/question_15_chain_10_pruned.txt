Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says that two Earth-like planets are being considered, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so if Planet_1's period is three times shorter, that means it's orbiting closer to its star, right? Because a shorter orbital period usually means the planet is closer in.

Oh, and both have circular orbits. So that simplifies things since the inclination would just be around 90 degrees for transits, but the probability is based on the geometry. The host stars have the same radii, but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting. I thought more massive stars are usually bigger, but maybe Planet_2's star is a subgiant or something, having the same radius despite being less massive.

The question is about the probability of a transit. So, the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment. Since the planets are Earth-like, their radii are similar, but the stars' sizes matter.

The formula for transit probability, as I recall, is roughly the ratio of the planet's orbital distance's perpendicular distance (the impact parameter) but the main factor is the size of the star. Wait, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else... Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital radius to the star's radius. No, wait, no—I think the transit probability is actually given by the ratio of the planet's orbital radius to the star's radius, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I think the transit probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (a (1 - e²)^0.5)) ), but since e is zero here (they're circular orbits), that part simplifies. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something else. Alternatively, isn't the transit probability inversely
