Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again and understand what's being asked.

The problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. Their masses are negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just electric potential energy, I think.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the setup is kind of like a central charge with twelve others arranged around it, each 2 meters away. Hmm, but wait—the problem says the 13th is fixed at P, so maybe the others are arranged symmetrically around it?

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, so I need to compute the potential energy and see which option matches.

Wait, but the system's energy would be the sum of all the electric potential energies between each pair of charges. So I need to calculate all the interactions and sum them up.

Let me break it down. First, the charges: each is 2e, so the charge of each particle is 2 times the elementary charge. The elementary charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs, so each charge is 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Now, the system has 13 charges. One is fixed at P, and the other twelve are at 2 meters from P. So each of these twelve is at a distance of 2 m from P, but what about their distances from each other? Oh, that's a good point. Since they're all at 2 m from P, but their arrangement isn't specified. Wait, but for minimum energy, I think it would depend on their mutual arrangement. But wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So maybe they are all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m around P, but the exact positions can vary. But since the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy between themselves. Wait, but wait a minute—electric potential energy depends on
