Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-like molecule with multiple rings. The 1 and 3 positions have bromine atoms attached. Then, when heated with excess KOH, product 1 is formed, which is a light yellow solid. 

Hmm, reaction of a dihalide with KOH. I think that's probably an elimination reaction. Like E2, where the base abstracts a proton and the leaving groups (Br-) leave. But wait, if there are two bromines, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. So, the product would likely be an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure. So, from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, eliminating two HBr molecules would form an allene or a diene? Wait, no, because each Br is on adjacent carbons? Or maybe not adjacent. Let me think about adamantane structure.

Wait, no. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected to three others, but the positions 1 and 3 are not adjacent. So when you have 1,3-dibromo, heating with KOH would likely lead to an elimination, forming a double bond. But wait, if you eliminate two Br atoms, would you form a triple bond? Because each elimination would form a double bond, but with two eliminations, maybe a triple bond? Or maybe each Br is on different positions, leading to two separate eliminations. Wait, maybe it's a double elimination.

Wait, another possibility: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH. Since KOH is a strong base, it could abstract a Î²-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of Br- and forming a double bond. But since there are two Br atoms, perhaps each can eliminate. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-elimination, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the product.

The product 1 has an IR spectrum with a peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, maybe the product is a ketone? How does that happen from a dibromide?

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by something else. Alternatively, could it be a nucleophilic substitution? But with KOH, and heating. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a double elimination, but I'm getting a bit confused. Another angle: looking at the NMR of product 1.

The 1H NMR of product 1 shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The peak at 4.79 ppm is probably an -OH or something deshielded. But wait, that's a singlet for 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's an -O- group, like an ether or a carbonyl group.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe product 1 is a diketone? Or an est
