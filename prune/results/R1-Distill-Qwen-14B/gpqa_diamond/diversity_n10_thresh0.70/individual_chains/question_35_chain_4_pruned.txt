Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a(φ), where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction.

The matrix operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, first, let me write down the matrix S. S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Then, Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), let me compute that. So each element of S is multiplied by h/(4π) to get Ay.

But before that, maybe I should remember that the angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics, like S, are related to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, and they have specific forms. Oh wait, the S matrix given here is similar to the Pauli Y matrix. Let me recall:

The Pauli Y matrix is:
Y = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

So S is exactly the Pauli Y matrix. So, S = Y.

So Ay = c * Y, where Y is the Pauli Y matrix and c = h/(4π).

Now, the problem is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let's think about the eigenvalues first.

The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0. Since S is Y, which is a Pauli matrix, and I know that the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So the eigenvalues of Y are ±1. But since Ay = c * Y, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by the eigenvalues of Y. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c*(+1) and c*(-1), which is c and -c.

Wait, but
