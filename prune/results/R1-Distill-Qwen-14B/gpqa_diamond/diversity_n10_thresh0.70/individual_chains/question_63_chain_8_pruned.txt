Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. So, I remember that diatomic molecules have two atoms, X and Y, connected by a bond. The problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. The question is about what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state.

The given data are:
- Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
- Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
- Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency (ω) = 4e14 rad/s

The options are four possible momenta in N*s.

Hmm, okay. So I need to find the photon's momentum that causes the molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. But wait, what's the next state? The 'fundamental state' is the ground state, the lowest energy. The next state would be the first excited state. But I need to clarify whether this is a rotation, vibration, or both transition.

Wait, the model is the rotation-vibration model. So I think it's a combination of rotational and vibrational energy states. But in the quantum mechanical model, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration.

Wait, for a diatomic molecule, the possible energy states are combinations of vibrational and rotational states. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state would be the next higher energy state, which could be either increasing the vibrational state (v=1) or the rotational state (J=1), but which of these requires lower energy?

Wait, the question states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. The next state with the lowest possible energy... Oh, but wait, the fundamental state is the lowest, so the next would be the first excited state, which is the next higher energy. So which transition gives the lowest possible energy increase? That depends on whether the energy gap is smaller for rotation or vibration.

Wait, but if the molecule is in the ground state, which is v=0 and J=0, then the next possible states could be:
1. v=0, J=1 (rotation)
2. v=1, J=0 (vibration)

Which of these requires less energy? Because the energy from rotation and vibration are quantized, but the vibrational energy gap is generally larger than the rotational one.

Wait, let's think about the energy levels. The vibrational energy levels have a spacing of ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. For rotation, the energy levels are given by E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

But wait, the rotational constant B is given by (ℏ²/(2I)), where I is the moment of inertia. For diatomic molecules, I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

So, let's compute the energies for the possible transitions.

In the fundamental state, v=0, J=0. The next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which of these has a lower energy?

The energy of the vibrational state is E_v = (v + 1/2) ħ ω. So for v=1, it's (3/2) ħ ω. But wait, that's the total energy, but the energy difference from v=0 to v=1 is ħ ω (since E_1 - E_0 = (3/2 - 1/2)ħω = ħω).

For rotation, the energy is E_J = B J (J+1). The ground state is J=0, so the next is J=1. The energy difference is E_1 - E_0 = B (1)(2) - 0 = 2B. So the energy difference is 2B.

So to find whether the rotational transition (J=0 → J=1) requires less energy than the vibrational (v=0 → v=1), I need to compare 2B and ħω.

If 2B is less than ħω, then the rotational transition is lower energy and hence more likely to be the next state.

So let's compute 2B and compare it to ħω.

First, let's find B. The rotational constant B is given by (ℏ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

The moment of inertia I is μ R². μ is the reduced mass, which is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).

Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So the total mass is 22 amu. The reduced mass μ is (20 * 2)/(2
