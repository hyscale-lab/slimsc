Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I remember that when something is uniformly distributed, it means they spread out evenly without any particular pattern. So, the number of stars in any given area would be the same, right?

Now, the main part of the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax, I think, is related to distance. Oh wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I remember is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So, a larger parallax means a closer star.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. So if I consider a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars would be in that range?

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number should depend on the volume of space at that distance. Because more stars are in a larger volume, but how does the volume relate to parallax?

I think the volume of a spherical shell at a distance 'd' with thickness 'dd' is something like 4πd² dd. Oh right, that's from calculus. The surface area of a sphere is 4πr², so the volume of a thin shell is surface area times thickness.

But wait, parallax plx is 1/d. So d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that into the volume formula. So d = 1/plx, and dd is the change in distance, which is related to dplx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, the negative just indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases. But I'm looking for the number of stars, so I'll focus on the magnitude.

So the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²). Wait, because dd = d (1/plx) = - (1/plx²) dplx. So replacing dd, it's (1/plx²) dplx as the thickness. So, putting it all together:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx
Wait, let me double-check that. Oh wait, no, wait. The shell's volume is 4πd² dd. Since dd is related to dplx, let's express everything in terms of plx.

We have d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/plx². And dd is the change in distance, which is how much d changes when plx changes by dplx. Let me compute that.

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Taking derivative, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Since we're dealing with absolute values, the negative can be ignored, so dd = (1/plx²) dplx.

So plugging back into dV:

dV = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx² dplx)
Which simplifies to 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the volume element in terms of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4 multiplied by dplx.

But wait, the number density of stars is uniform. So the number of stars in a volume dV would be n * dV, where n is the number per unit volume. But since stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is a constant. So the number of stars per unit of dplx is proportional to dV, which is 1/plx^4 dplx.

Wait, but the question is asking for the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, like, how does the count change as plx increases. So for a small change dplx, the number of stars is proportional to dV, which is proportional to 1/plx^4 * dplx.
