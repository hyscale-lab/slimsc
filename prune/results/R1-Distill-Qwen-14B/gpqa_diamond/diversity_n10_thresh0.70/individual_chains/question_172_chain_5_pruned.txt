Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar atmospheres, but let's think this through.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so I guess we can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in different energy states. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference ΔE is E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. The problem says the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for each star, the ratio n_i/n_j would be different.

Wait, but the question says in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So I think the ratio for star_1 is 2, and for star_2 it's 1. So for star_1, n_i/n_j = 2, and for star_2, n_i/n_j = 1. Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Because if star_1's atoms are more excited, that means more are in the higher energy level. So for star_1, n_i (higher level) is twice n_j (lower level), so 2 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) ), assuming g_i/g_j is the same for both stars since we're comparing same atoms in same energy levels.

Wait, but wait, if the energy levels are the same for both stars, but their temperatures are different, then the ratio would depend on their temperatures. So for each star, the ratio of n_i/n_j is given by (g_i/g_j) multiplied by exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

But the problem states that in star_1, the number is twice that of star_2. Oh wait, no: the problem says, "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited" as
