Okay, so I need to figure out which compound E is based on the reaction scheme and the given hints. Let me start by breaking down each step and seeing what each compound might be.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D, upon elimination of an inert gas, forms compound E.

And the hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) IR of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

Let me think about each step. 

First, the IR peaks. A peak around 1750 usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. But since A is reacting with HCN (which is nucleophilic), maybe A is a ketone. HCN adds to ketones to form cyanohydrins. So compound B would be a cyanohydrin.

Wait, HCN adds to a carbonyl to form a cyanohydrin. That's right. So A is a ketone, and B is a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached.

Next, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation. Since B has a nitrile group from HCN addition, I'm not sure. Wait, no, the cyanohydrin would have an -OH and -CN group attached to the same carbon. So if B is a cyanohydrin, then when you reduce it with H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation, what would happen?

Wait, nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines, but under certain conditions. But if B is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile, then perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, in the cyanohydrin formation, the product is a vicinal diol with an -CN group? No, wait. No, wait. When HCN adds to a ketone, it forms a compound where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by an -OH and -CN group on adjacent carbons. So the structure would be R-C(OH)-CH2-CN? No, wait, the ketone is R2C=O. HCN adds to that, so the product would be R2C(OH)-CN. Wait, no, more accurately, it would be R2C(OH)-CN? Or perhaps R2C(OH)-CH2-CN? I'm a bit confused. Let me visualize.

Let's say compound A is cyclohexanone. Then adding HCN would give (cyclohexyl)methyl cyanohydrin. So structure would be something like a cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH)CN group attached. So when we reduce that, perhaps the nitrile group would be hydrogenated to an amine? No, wait, hydrogenation of nitriles typically gives amines, but under catalytic hydrogenation, maybe it's a different condition.

Wait, Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So if B has a nitrile group, hydrogenation would convert it into an amine. But then, when you have an amine and an alcohol, what would happen next?

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction is more about the alcohol. If B is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group, maybe the reduction is of the nitrile to an amine. So compound C would have an amine instead of the nitrile.

But then, moving to the next step: compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D. HNO2 is nitrous acid, which is typically involved in diazotization reactions, but that's usually with aromatic amines. Alternatively, for aliphatic amines, nitrous acid can lead
