Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this carefully.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these.

Wait, first, what is SMEFT? I remember it's a framework where you take the Standard Model and write down all possible higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the particles they involve. But for these operators to make sense, they have to respect certain symmetries.

Symmetries in physics are crucial because they constrain the possible interactions. So, the SMEFT must respect some fundamental symmetries, right? But which ones? 

Let me break down each symmetry.

1. Lorentz symmetry: This is the symmetry of special relativity, which includes rotations and boosts. All physical laws should look the same to any observer, regardless of their constant velocity. So, any theory respecting relativity must have Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT, being an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model, which itself respects Lorentz symmetry, must also respect it. So all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant.

2. Poincaré symmetry: Wait, isn't Poincaré symmetry a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations (like in space and time)? So Poincaré includes Lorentz plus momentum and energy conservation. If the theory already respects Lorentz symmetry, does it automatically respect Poincaré? Or does the SMEFT need to separately ensure Poincaré? Because SMEFT is built from local terms, operators that are local would respect Poincaré. But wait, the question is about all operators. I think that the SMEFT does respect Poincaré because it's part of the framework. But I might be mixing this up. Let me think again. The Standard Model respects Poincaré symmetry, so the SMEFT, which is an extension, should too. So operators in SMEFT should preserve Poincaré symmetry. So options that include both 1 and 2 would be correct if both are required.

Wait, but wait a minute. All operators are constructed from the Standard Model fields, which already undergo the symmetry transformations. So when you build operators, you have to make sure they transform correctly under the symmetries. So
