Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me think about what that could mean. The molecular formula can sometimes give hints about the structure. Let's break it down: 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. 

The NMR data is provided. I should analyze that first. The 1H-NMR shows several peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Let me think about each of these signals.

Starting with the 9.72 ppm triplet. That's a high ppm, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. Being a triplet suggests it's adjacent to a CH2 group, maybe? Or perhaps some coupling with two protons.

Looking at the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm doublets. Those look like aromatic protons. The 6.98 is more downfield, which might suggest substituents on the benzene rings. Each is a doublet, so maybe para-substituted benzene rings. Because in a para-substituted ring, the protons are equivalent and each has one neighboring proton. Wait, no, in para substitution, each proton has two neighboring protons actually, but maybe in a more complex coupling scenario. Alternatively, maybe they are part of a di-substituted ring, perhaps with substituents in the ortho or meta positions.

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad usually suggests exchange with something else, like an -OH proton, but it's a singlet, so maybe those two protons are adjacent to an electronegative group or something that causes broadening. Alternatively, maybe they're part of a conjugated system, like allylic protons. Wait, if it's a singlet, perhaps they're not split because they're equivalent and not splitting each other, but maybe some other reason for the broadness.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet integrating for two protons. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe it's part of an ether or an ester, but wait, the molecular formula has an oxygen, so perhaps it's an OCH2 group. Or maybe a methylene next to a carbonyl or something like that.

Putting this together, the molecule might have an aldehyde group (from 9.72 ppm), two aromatic rings (since the protons are in the aromatic region), a CH2 group next to something (like O), and perhaps an -OH group that's causing the broad peak.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation to get an idea of rings and double bonds. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, X is 0, N is 1, C=8, H=9.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2= (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, one ring (like benzene) and a double bond, but wait:

Wait, benzene has three double bonds, so that's three degrees. Then another double bond (maybe an aldehyde or an enal) and a ring or another double bond. Or perhaps a ring and a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe two aromatic rings? Let me see: if there are two benzene rings, each ring contributes 4 degrees (each has three double bonds and a ring). Wait, no, each benzene is three degrees (one ring and three double bonds). So two benzene rings would contribute 6 degrees, but our total is 5. So that's not possible. So maybe a single benzene ring and other structures.

Wait, maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents. Let's think about substituents that include an aldehyde and an oxygen-containing group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If there's a benzene ring (C6), then the remaining is C2H9NO. But wait, that's not adding up. Let me recount the formula: C8H9NO.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Let me think of the substituents.

Looking back at the NMR:
