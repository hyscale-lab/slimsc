Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, it's about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me think through this step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide, which is a nucleophile.

Oh wait, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. The cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon. But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. It's (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the ketone has been converted into a cyanohydrin. Oh right, that's the cyanohydrin formation reaction.

So how do you form cyanohydrins? The general reaction is ketone + CN- in presence of acid. The acid protonates the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, then the CN- attacks. Then water comes in and does a backside attack to form the alcohol group. So for the first step, reagent A must be an acid. Because NaCN is a weak base, so to get the reaction going, acid is needed.

Looking at the options, the possible A reagents are H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a
