Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The problem states that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options provided are A to D, and I need to find out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed through a ligand exchange reaction. So, the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or some other charge, maybe). 

I think the formation constant, K, for a complex is given by the equation K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh wait, wait, maybe I should write it down more clearly. Let me think: the formation of the complex is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2- (I'm not sure about the charge, but I'll go with that for now). So the formation constant K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

The problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. Let’s denote that as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. And the K value is 5x10^10, which is a very large number, indicating that the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. 

Since K is large, I can assume that the concentration of free Ca²+ ions is very small compared to the concentration of the complex. So, the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- is minimal. 

Let me set up the equation using the K expression. K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). I can rearrange this to find [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2-]/(K * [EDTA^4-]). 

Wait, but I don't know the concentration of free EDTA^4- ions. Hmm, that's a problem. Let me think about the stoichiometry here. The stoichiometric ratio between Ca and EDTA in the complex is 1:1. So, when the complex dissociates, each mole of CaEDTA^2- would release one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

But wait, in solution, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me model the dissociation. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So, the dissociation can be represented as:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

Initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are zero. After some dissociation (x), the concentrations become:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.
