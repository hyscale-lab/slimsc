Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let me think about this.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance to a star. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, wait—parallax is inversely related to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer because parallax is calculated as 1 over distance (in parsecs). So if a star is really far away, the parallax is tiny. Got it.

The question says the stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Oh, I think it means that their spatial density is uniform. So the number of stars in a given volume doesn't depend on where you are in that volume. So if I consider a spherical shell with radius r and thickness dr, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume, which is 4πr² dr. Because volume of a shell is surface area times thickness.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So parallax plx is related to distance. Parallax plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 / distance (in parsecs). So distance d = 1 / plx. Oh right, because plx = 1/d in parsecs.

So if we're looking at a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, what volume does that correspond to? Well, since d = 1/plx,
