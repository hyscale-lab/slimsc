Okay, I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule transitioning between states. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the molecule is diatomic, made of elements X and Y. The model used is the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Hmm, the fundamental stateâ€”wait, what does that mean? Oh right, the fundamental state is the state of lowest energy. So the molecule is in its ground state. It's absorbing a photon, so the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the current state and the next possible state.

Wait, but which transition are we talking about? The question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, I think it's the next higher state. Because the fundamental state is the lowest, so the next would be the first excited state.

But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and depend on both rotational and vibrational states. So each state is characterized by quantum numbers v and J, where v is the vibrational state (v=0 is ground) and J is the rotational state (J=0,1,2,...).

The molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think refers to the ground state of vibration, v=0. So the next state with the lowest energy would probably be the next vibrational state, v=1. Because increasing v would contribute more energy than increasing J for the same quantum number
