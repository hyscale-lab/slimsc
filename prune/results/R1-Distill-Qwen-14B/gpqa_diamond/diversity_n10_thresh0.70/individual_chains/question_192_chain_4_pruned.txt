Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I remember that when dealing with conductors, charges redistribute themselves in specific ways. 

The problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R, and inside it there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's radius is r, and its center is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So, the conductor isn't just a solid sphere; it has a hollow part inside. 

Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, right? So when they put a positive charge +q inside the cavity, what happens? I remember that in electrostatics, charges in a conductor redistribute themselves to the surface. But this is a conductor with a cavity. Oh right! The charges inside a cavity of a conductor induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. 

Since the conductor was neutral, the charge +q in the cavity would induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. So, the inner surface would have -q, and since the whole conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance out. 

But wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the net charge on it is zero. So the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the total conductor's charge is zero, the sum of inner and outer surface charges must be zero. So, yes: inner is -q, outer is +q.

Now the question is about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from the center of the cavity is l. The angle between l and s is theta. So, the setup is a bit complex because the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor.

I think I should recall Gauss's Law here. For a point outside the conductor, the electric field only depends on the total enclosed charge inside the Gaussian surface. Since the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q, any Gaussian surface outside the conductor (radius > R) would enclose this +q. 

Wait, but the conductor is uncharged, right? So the total charge on the conductor is zero. Hmm, wait a second. The conductor was uncharged, and then the charge +q is placed inside the
