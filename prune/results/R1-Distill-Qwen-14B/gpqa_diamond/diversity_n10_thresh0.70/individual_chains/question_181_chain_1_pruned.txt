Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun, specifically about the flux in two different energy bands. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and the question is about stopping one of them, the pp-III branch. Let me think about what I know.

The Sun's core produces energy through the proton-proton chain, which has a few branches. The main branches are the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Wait, I think the pp-III branch is one of the later steps... Oh right, in the pp-I, two protons fuse to form deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. Then in pp-II, deuterium fuses with a proton to form tritium. And in pp-III, the tritium fuses with a proton to make helium-4, releasing a neutron, but wait, noâ€”maybe that's the CN cycle? Wait, I'm getting confused. Oh no, the pp-III branch is when a tritium nucleus (T) and a proton combine to produce helium-4, a positron, and a neutrino. Or was it a neutron? Wait, no, the pp-III branch is actually the last step in the dominant proton-proton chain. So it's the fusion of two tritium nuclei? No, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the steps.

Wait, let me get this straight. The main proton-proton chain is:

1. Two protons (p) fuse to form deuterium (D), emitting a positron and a neutrino. This is the pp-I branch.
2. Then, deuterium fuses with another proton to form tritium (T), which is the pp-II branch.
3. Finally, the tritium fuses with another proton to make helium-3 (He-3), but wait, no, that's another branch. Oh no, wait, in the main branch, two He-3 nuclei fuse to make He-4, but that's not part of the pp chain. Wait, maybe the pp-III branch is when a He-3 nucleus captures two protons to form something else, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the steps.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall. The proton-proton chain has two main branches. The first is the pp-I, which produces deuterium. The second is when the de
