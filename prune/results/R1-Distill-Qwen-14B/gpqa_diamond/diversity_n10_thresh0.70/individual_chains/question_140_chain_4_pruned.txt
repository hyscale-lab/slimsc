Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W and forms a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. There's also some info about a reaction involving a keto acid with X producing a product with two oxygen atoms. Additionally, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's start by dissecting each part.

First, the reaction between X and Y. X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The reaction is violent and releases gas W, which has a molecule with equal protons and neutrons. Oh wait, so the molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. That's interesting. What gases have that property?

Well, let's think. For example, water (H2O) has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). The molecule's total protons are 2+8=10, and total neutrons are 0 (from H) + 8 =8. That's not equal. How about O2? O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons each. O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So each molecule of O2 has 16 of each. That fits. Another possibility is something like CH4? No, 5 H's, 6 C's. Wait, but the molecule's total protons and neutrons should be equal. Wait, wait, the molecule as a whole: so for each molecule, sum of protons in all atoms equals sum of neutrons in all atoms.

Wait, let's think: for example, CO2. C has 6 protons, each O has 8. So CO2 has 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons (since carbon-12 is common), each O has 8. So 6 + 2*8 = 22. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons.
