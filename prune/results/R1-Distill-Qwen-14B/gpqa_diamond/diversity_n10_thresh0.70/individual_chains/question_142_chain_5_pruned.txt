Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think this through.

The question gives me a specific density matrix:

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)

I need to find its position in the qubit space. The options are points in 3D space, with coordinates either (1,1,0), (0,0,1), (0,0,0), or (1,1,1). Wait, why are we mapping the density matrix to a point in 3D space? Oh right, I think this has to do with the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the state can be represented as a point on a unit sphere, known as the Bloch sphere. But wait, density matrices can represent mixed states too. How does that work?

A pure state is a vector on the surface of the Bloch sphere, while a mixed state would be represented somewhere inside the sphere. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. For a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture, so the density matrix is a convex combination of pure states.

In the given problem, the density matrix is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) multiplied by 1/2. So it's an equal mixture of the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states. That makes sense because each term is a pure state, and they're averaged with equal weights. So this is a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, how does this translate into coordinates? The Bloch sphere uses a vector (x, y, z) where the components correspond to the real parts of the density matrix elements. The standard parametrization for a density matrix is:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where I is the identity matrix, r is a vector (x, y, z), and σ are the Pauli matrices. The vector r determines the point in space, and since the state is a density matrix, the vector should be within the unit sphere (|r| ≤ 1).

So, let's break down the given ρ. Let's compute each element. The given ρ is ( |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) /2.

Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in (1,1). So adding them together and dividing by 2 gives:

ρ = [ [0.5, 0], [0, 0.5] ]

Because (|0><0| + |1><1|) is [[1,0],[0,1]], so dividing by 2 gives the 0.5s on the diagonal.

Now, according to the parametrization ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, we can solve for r. Let's expand the right side.

I is the
