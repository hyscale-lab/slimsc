Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, right, red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in some kind of substitution or elimination reaction. Oh wait, I think that's for the hydrolysis of certain groups, maybe something like a nitrile or an ester? Or wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, like in the formation of alcohols from alkyl halides via the H3O+ H2O route, but maybe that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the transformation of certain functional groups. Wait, let me think again. Oh yeah, red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. No, wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, when treating with HI and red phosphorus, maybe it's for the elimination of certain groups. Hmm.

But first, let's figure out what compound X is. The question gives IR and NMR data for compound X, and the options are about its structure. So the first step is to determine the structure of compound X.

Let's look at the IR data. The peaks are: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region that could indicate O-H or N-H stretching. But looking at the options, the possible functional groups are either a car
