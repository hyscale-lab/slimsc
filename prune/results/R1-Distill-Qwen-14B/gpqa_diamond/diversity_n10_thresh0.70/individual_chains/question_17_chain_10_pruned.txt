Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. So the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, I remember that from my studies. The pH is ideal, so I guess that means other factors like hydrolysis or protonation aren't complicating things. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so maybe some constants are given or standard values apply.

The given dissociation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Wait, wait, I think I need to clarify what this K represents. Oh, right! It's the formation constant (Kf) for the Ca-EDTA complex. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA (Y^4-) form the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY²-.

Wait, but in this case, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

Oh, right! So the formula for the formation constant Kf is Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]). But in this problem, the complex is the only species present initially. So the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4-.

Given that the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, let's denote this as C = 0.02 M. So when the complex dissociates, the concentrations of Ca²+ and Y^4- will each be x, assuming the dissociation is x. But wait, because each complex releases one Ca²+ and one Y^4-, so the concentrations are both x.

Wait, but is x going to be small compared to C? Since Kf is a large number (5x10^10), which suggests that the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is very little. Therefore, x should be very small, so we can approximate that [CaY²-] ≈ C, and [Ca²+] ≈ x, [Y^4-] ≈ x.

So the formation
