Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about calculating the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. I remember that stability constants (β) are involved here, which tell us about the stability of the complexes formed.

Let me read the problem again. The solution has Co(II) and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, the β values are for different complexes. I think for each complex, β represents how much the complex forms. Like, β1 is for the first complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for the second, etc. But wait, the options mention dithiocyanato complexes, so that's two SCN- ligands. So I'm looking for the species with two SCN- attached.

Wait, the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I remember that for Co(II) complexes, the different colors correspond to different ligand environments. For example, [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ can form various complexes with different n.

So the possible complexes are:

- Co²+ (aq)
- [Co(SCN)]^+ (monothiocyanato)
- [Co(SCN)₂]^0 (dithiocyanato)
- [Co(SCN)₃]^–
- [Co(SCN)₄]^2– 

But the stability constants given are β1, β2, β3, β4. So probably β1 is the first complex, β2 the second, etc. So the complexes are ordered as Co²+ + SCN- → [Co(SCN)]^+ (β1=9), then [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN- → [Co(SCN)₂]^0 (β2=40), and so on. Wait no, the stability constant for each step is cumulative. Oh wait, wait, no, I think each β is for the overall formation. Or maybe each β is the stepwise constant. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, stability constants are typically given as stepwise formation constants. So β1 is the formation constant for the first complex: Co²+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)]^+, K1=β1=9.

Then β2 would be the formation of the second complex: [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)₂]^0, K2=β2=40.

Similarly, β3 is the third step: [Co(SCN)₂]^0 + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)₃]^–, K3=63.

And β4 is the fourth step: [Co(SCN)₃]^– + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)₄]^2–, K4=16.

Wait, but wait, the stability constants (β) for a complex are often given in a stepwise manner. So each β represents the equilibrium for adding one more ligand.

So the overall formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2–n) would be the product of the stepwise β's up to n.

But in this problem, they give four β values, so the possible complexes are n=1 to n=4.

So the species present are Co²+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, [Co(SCN)₃]^–, and [Co(SCN)₄]^2–.

The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]^0, right? Because dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands attached.

So to find the percentage, I need to find the fraction of the total cobalt that is in the [Co(SCN)₂]^0 complex.

But wait, the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. Hmm, but the concentration includes all the species and the free Co²+ as well.

Wait, the total concentration is the sum of all the species: [Co²+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]^- + [Co(SCN)₄]^2– = 1e-2 M.

But the problem is to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]^0 in this total.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model this using the formation constants and the given concentrations.

But I remember that when dealing with such equilibria, especially with multiple formation steps, it's useful to use the method of successive approximations or consider the distribution of species based on the formation constants.

Alternatively, I can think of the distribution of the species as a function of the ligand concentration and the stability constants.

Wait, what's the formula for the fraction of each species? For each complex, the fraction is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN]^n / (1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + ... + β1β2β3...βn [SCN]^n )

Wait, no. Wait, the general approach is to model the fraction of each species as the product of the previous β's multiplied by the ligand concentration to the appropriate power, divided by the sum of all such terms.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the fraction for the nth complex is (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n ) / (Total), where Total is the sum for each species.

Wait, but I think the total is 1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4[SCN]^4.

Because each term in the denominator represents the contribution of each species. For example:

- The first term is 1, which represents the free Co²+ (no ligands bound).
- The second term is β1 [SCN], which is for [CoSCN]^+.
- The third term is β1 β2 [SCN]^2, for [Co(SCN)₂]^0.
- And so on.

So, the denominator is the sum of all these terms.

Each fraction f_n is (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n ) / denominator.

So, in this problem, [SCN] is 0.1 M. We have four β values: β1=9, β2
