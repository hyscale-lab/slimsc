Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each suggesting a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. But wait, I think the exact formula is plx (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

So if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So if we have N proportional to 1/plx^5, that would mean N ∝ d^5 because plx is inversely proportional to d. Because if plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So for a given change in distance, how does N change? Or maybe it's about the number of stars per unit volume as a function of distance? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the differential number of stars. Like, how many stars are there in a thin shell at distance r? So, the number of stars in a shell dr thick at distance r would be the number density (stars per volume) multiplied by the volume of the shell.

Wait, number density. Let me think. The number of stars per unit volume at a distance r might depend on r. But how?

Wait, I think the number of stars in a given region depends on how much volume is there. So if you have a region of volume V, the number of stars N is proportional to V multiplied by some density function. But in this case, the density function (number per unit volume) might depend on distance in a specific way.

Wait, the question says N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, that would mean 1/plx is proportional to distance. So N ∝ (distance)^5.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance. So perhaps it's about the number of stars per distance interval. Like, the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r + dr. Because if you have a shell, its volume is 4π r² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be the number density multiplied by the volume.

But I'm not sure if the number density is constant. Let's see. The problem says N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is the total number of stars in the region. Wait, but parallax varies with distance. So when the
