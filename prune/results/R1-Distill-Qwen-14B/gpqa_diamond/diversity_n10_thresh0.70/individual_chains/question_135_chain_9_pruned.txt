Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, the Lagrangian determines the interactions, so this term suggests that the boson X is interacting with fermions. 

Wait, the term looks like a Yukawa coupling. Typically, Yukawa interactions involve a scalar field coupling to fermions, like in the Higgs mechanism. So in this case, X is a boson (maybe a scalar) coupling to fermions with some coupling constant λ. 

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. I need to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, decay means X will transform into other particles. Since it's a boson, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs because bosons are force carriers and often mediate the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs.

Wait, for a boson to decay into fermions, the energy has to be sufficient. The rest mass of X is 6 GeV, so the decay products must each have a rest mass less than 3 GeV each because the total energy available is the mass of X. Because each fermion and its antiparticle would take some of the energy, their rest masses must be less than half of 6 GeV, which is 3 GeV.

So let me list the possible fermion pairs. Fermions include quarks and leptons. Let's see:

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). But wait, top quarks are really heavy—like about 173 GeV. So if X is 6 GeV, that's way less than the top quark mass, so X can't decay into top quarks. So top is out.

Leptons: electron (e), muon (μ), tau (τ), and their antiparticles. The masses are: e is about 0.0005 GeV, muon
