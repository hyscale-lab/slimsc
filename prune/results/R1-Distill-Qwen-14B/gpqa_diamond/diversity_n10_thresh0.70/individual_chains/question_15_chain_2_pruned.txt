Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let's see. The question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability, so I need to calculate the transit probability for each and compare.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the planet's orbital distance. The formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_planet + R_star) / a, but wait, no, I think it's more like the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (a) to the star's radius (R_star). Hmm, maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, the transit probability P is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else. Or wait, no. Let me think again. Oh right, the probability that a planet transits its star is given by the formula:

P = (R_planet / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, that's not right. I think I'm confusing some terms. Let me try to recall. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The formula is P â‰ˆ (R_planet / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's P = (R_planet / a) * something else.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is the ratio of the size of the star to the distance of the planet's orbit, multiplied by the planet's size relative to the star. Wait, no. I think the formula for the probability is P = (r_planet / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3)) ), where r_planet is the planet's orbital radius... No, wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the Hill sphere or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula. Oh, right, I can't look it up, but I remember that the transit probability depends on the inclination. For a random inclination, the probability is roughly (R_planet / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_star
