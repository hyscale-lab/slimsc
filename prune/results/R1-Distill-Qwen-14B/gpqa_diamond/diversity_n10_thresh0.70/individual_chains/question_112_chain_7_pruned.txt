Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let me try to understand what it's asking. 

The problem says we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. And |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, that's the standard basis for spin-½ particles, right? So I can probably represent |alpha> as a vector in the z-basis.

The first part is to calculate the probability of measuring the electron in each eigenstate of another operator. The operator's matrix representation has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait, what does that matrix look like? Let me think. For a 2x2 matrix, if i≠j, so the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2, and the diagonal elements are zero. So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Oh, right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices are [[0,1],[1,0]] for X, [[0,-i],[i,0]] for Y, and [[1,0],[0,-1]] for Z. So yeah, this operator A is (ħ/2) * σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

So, the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>, specifically (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2. Wait, no, actually, let me get that right. The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2, right? Because σ_x |+x> = +1 |+x>, and similarly for the other.

So, the question is asking for the probability of measuring the state |alpha> in each of these eigenstates |+x> and |−x>, and then the average value of the operator A.

But wait, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up>
