Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to break it down.

The metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I think this is a 2-dimensional metric because it's only got dx² and dy² terms. So, it's probably a 2D spacetime or maybe a surface embedded in higher dimensions.

I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor tells us about the geometry of spacetime. The area of a surface in such a metric would depend on the line element and any symmetries. Oh right, for a 2D metric like this, the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

So, first step: write the metric in matrix form. The given metric is diagonal, right? So the matrix would be diag[g_xx, g_yy], where g_xx and g_yy are the coefficients of dx² and dy². Looking at the equation, both coefficients are 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the metric tensor components are g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

The determinant of a diagonal matrix is just the product of the diagonal elements. So determinant g = g_xx * g_yy = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, no, for a 2x2 diagonal matrix, the determinant is (g_xx)(g_yy) - (g_xy)^2, but since it's diagonal, g_xy is zero. So determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Hmm, but wait, I might get confused: actually, for a 2D metric, the line element is ds² = g_11 dx² + 2 g_12 dx dy + g_22 dy². In this case, g_12 is zero and g_11 = g_22 = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So determinant g = (32/(4 - r²))², where r² is x² + y². Wait, but in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy. So sqrt(g) would be 32/(4 - r²), right? Because sqrt of [ (32/(4 - r²))² ] is 32/(4 - r²).

So, the area element dA = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy. But wait, I should change variables to polar coordinates because the problem is symmetric in x and y, so r and θ would be better. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ, right?

So substituting, dA = [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ. Now, I need to integrate this over the entire surface to find the total area. Wait, but what are the limits of integration for r and θ?

The metric's denominator is 4 - x² - y², which becomes 4 - r². The denominator must be positive because the metric coefficients can't be negative (otherwise, the spacetime would be Lorentzian, but here it's given as a metric, probably Riemannian). So 4 - r² > 0 → r² <4 → r <2. So r goes from 0 to 2. θ goes from 0 to 2π.

So the area A is the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2, of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute this. First, separate the integrals: A = ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Compute the θ integral first: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

Now the radial integral: ∫
