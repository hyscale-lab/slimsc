Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that both observatories have different magnitude limits for the stars they can observe. The question says ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than 17 V mag, and HIRES can handle brighter than 16 V mag. So, any star that's brighter (lower magnitude number) than these limits can be detected by each instrument.

Wait, actually, I think I got that backwards. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So, if a telescope can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, that means it can see stars with V < 17. And the same with HIRES: V < 16.

So a star needs to have an apparent magnitude (V) less than 17 to be visible to ESPRESSO and less than 16 to be visible to HIRES. So the star must meet both conditions to be detected by both spectrographs.

Wait no, the question is asking which stars can be detected by both. So each star must be bright enough for both instruments. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 (since ESPRESSO can handle up to 17) and less than 16 (since HIRES requires brighter than 16). So the stricter condition is V < 16. So any star with V < 16 can be seen by both.

Wait, no. Wait, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17, which is V <17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, which is V <16. So to be detectable by both, the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 16, because that's the stricter limit. Because, if a star is V=15, it's within both limits (since 15 <16 and <17). But if a star is V=16.5, it's brighter than 16? Wait, no, wait. The magnitude scale is inverted. So V=16 is brighter than V=17. So, if a star's apparent magnitude is 16.5, that's dimmer than 16. So it can't be seen by HIRES, but ESPRESSO can, since 16.5 <17.

Wait, no, wait, apparent magnitude scale: as the number increases, the star is dimmer. So a star with V=15 is brighter than V=16, which is brighter than V=17, etc.

So, for a star to be detected by both instruments, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 16. Because HIRES can't go to 17. ESPRESSO can go to 17, but HIRES has a tighter limit.

So, now I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude of each star and see which ones are below 16. Because only those can be detected by both.

Let's look at each star:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15
