Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P that's outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. Also, l and L are both greater than R, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm. So, I remember that conductors have some properties regarding electric fields and charges. For a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor is zero. Also, any excess charge resides on the surface. But in this case, the conductor is initially uncharged. Then, a charge is placed inside the cavity. What happens then?

Wait, I think when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's electrons redistribute. Since the conductor is neutral, the induced charges would be such that the interior cavity's charge is canceled in terms of the conductor's exterior. Or wait, maybe the conductor's inner surface has an induced charge equal and opposite to the cavity's charge, and the outer surface remains neutral? Or does the conductor's outer surface have a charge equal to the cavity's charge?

Wait, no. Let me think. For an uncharged conductor with a cavity, if you put a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the cavity's charge would attract the opposite charge on the conductor's inner surface. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance it out. So the conductor's total charge is zero, so the net charge on the conductor is zero. The inner surface has -q, so the outer surface has +q.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me get that straight. The conductor is neutral. So when you place a charge +q
