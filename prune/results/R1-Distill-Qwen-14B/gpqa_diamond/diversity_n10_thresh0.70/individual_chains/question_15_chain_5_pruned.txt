Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a go.

Alright, the scenario is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. So the question is about which planet has a higher transit probability based on the given parameters.

Let me jot down what I know from the question:

- Both planets were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. So we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

- The planets have the same mass.

- Orbital periods: Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since shorter period means closer orbit.

- Both have circular orbits, which might simplify calculations because eccentricity isn't a factor here.

- The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting, so even though Planet_1's star is more massive, it's not larger in radius. That probably means it's hotter, but maybe more relevantly, the radius affects the transit depth and probability.

Wait, transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. But I think the probability is given by the formula involving the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance. Oh right, the probability is roughly proportional to R_star / a, where a is the orbital semi-major axis. Because the transit happens when the planet passes directly in front of the star, so the chance depends on how likely the orbital plane is aligned edge-on relative to us.

But wait, more precisely, the probability P of a transit is given by (R_star / a) * (something else). Or wait, I think the formula is P = (R*/a) * (something else?), or maybe it's (R*/a) multiplied by some factor based on the inclination distribution.

Wait, no, I think the formula is P â‰ˆ (R*/a) * (1/(something)), but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The transit probability is actually the probability that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it crosses the line of sight. The formula for the probability is (R*/a) * (1 / (sin
