Okay, so I have this question about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the crystal structure and the unit cell parameters. Let me think about what I know.

A rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal, right? So the lattice parameters a, b, c are all the same. But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the angles between the edges can be different. Oh, wait no, wait. I think in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are equal length, but the angles can be different. Or wait, sometimes it's called a trigonal crystal system, where a = b = c, but angles can vary. But in this question, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron with a = b = c, and all angles 30 degrees.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms, but in a crystal, that's the edge length a. So here, a = 10 Angstrom.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * (cos(theta)) )) ) or something like that. Wait, maybe I'm
