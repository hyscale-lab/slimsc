Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this has something to do with the Boltzmann distribution and maybe the Saha equation, but wait, the question says they're in LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. 

Alright, the problem states that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think that energy difference is delta E or ΔE. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor is involved here because it relates the population of different energy levels to temperature.

The Boltzmann distribution formula is something like the ratio of populations between two energy levels. The formula is n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights, but I think in this case, the problem might be assuming that the statistical weights are the same for both levels, so they cancel out. So the ratio of excitation would just be exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

Wait, no, wait. Because if the higher energy level is more excited, the ratio would be n_upper / n_lower. But in this case, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2 for a specific energy level. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the problem again.

Oh it says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think that refers to the ratio of the number of atoms in that specific excited state compared to the ground state (or another state). Or maybe it's the ratio between the two stars for the same energy level. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

But let's proceed. Let's denote the ratio of the excited state to the ground state as R. For star 1, R1 = 2 * R2, where R2 is the ratio for star 2. Or wait, maybe it's that in star_1, the fraction is twice that of star_2. But I think the actual situation is that the excitation is higher when the temperature is higher because higher temperatures allow more atoms to be in higher energy states.

So the ratio of the populations is given by the Boltzmann factor. So, for star_1, let's say the ratio is R1 = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), and for star_2, R2 = same g's * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)). 

But wait, the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps R1 = 2 * R2. Because in star_1, the ratio is higher, meaning more atoms are in the excited state relative to the ground state. So R1 = 2 R2.

Substituting the expressions for R1 and R2:

(g_upper/g_lower) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) = 2 (g_upper/g_lower) exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

The g's cancel out, so
