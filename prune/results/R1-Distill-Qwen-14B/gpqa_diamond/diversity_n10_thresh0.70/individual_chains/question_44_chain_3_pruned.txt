Okay, so I've got this question about a drug's effect on mitochondria and which experiment wouldn't help determine that. Let me think step by step.

The question says that the drug is supposed to affect mitochondria, which are the cell's energy factories. So the experiments listed need to assess mitochondrial function or presence. The question is which experiment doesn't help find the mitochondrial role.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Differential centrifugation to extract mitochondria followed by a glucose uptake assay. Wait, differential centrifugation is a method to isolate mitochondria because they're heavy and pellet. So if they extract mitochondria and then do a glucose uptake assay, that's looking at how well the mitochondria take in glucose. But wait, don't mitochondria primarily use fatty acids and other substrates, not glucose directly? Or maybe the assay is about glycolysis? No, glycolysis happens in the cytoplasm. But maybe the assay measures glucose uptake into the cell, not the mitochondria. Hmm, but the question says the extraction is of mitochondria, so maybe they're testing if the mitochondria can take up glucose. Not sure yet, but maybe this isn't the right test for mitochondrial function. Or perhaps, if the drug affects mitochondrial function, it could affect glucose uptake in the cell, but the assay would measure overall glucose uptake, not specifically mitochondrial. So A might not be helpful for directly assessing mitochondria.

Option B: Transformation with recombinant luciferase and adding luciferin. Wait, luciferase is used in assays like the firefly luciferase assay which measures ATP levels.
