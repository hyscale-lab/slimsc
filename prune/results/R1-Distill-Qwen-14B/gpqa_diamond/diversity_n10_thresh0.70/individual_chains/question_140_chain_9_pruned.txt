Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll take it slowly.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with a liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. Interesting.

The product from a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Oh, and X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Alright, let's tackle each part.

First, I need to figure out what Substance X is. The clues about the reaction with Y, the gas W, and the precipitate G being heated to release B might give me some hints.

Let me think about the properties mentioned:

1. Gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So the molecule's composition must have equal protons and neutrons. Let's think of possible gases. For example, CO2 doesn't fit, but maybe something like H2O? Wait, H2O's molecule is H2O. Protons: 2 (H) + 8 (O) = 10. Neutrons: 10 (since O has 8 protons and usually 8 neutrons in H2O). Wait, so H2O has 10 protons and 10 neutrons? No wait, each O has 8 neutrons normally. So H2O has (2 * 1 H) + (8 O) protons: 10. Neutrons: 1*2 (H has 1 neutron each) + 8 (O) = 10. Oh, so H2O fits, because the molecule has 10 protons and 10 neutrons. So W is H2O? Or maybe another gas.

Wait, another possibility is CO. CO has 1 C (6 protons) and 1 O (8 protons), so total 14 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons, O has 8, so 14.
