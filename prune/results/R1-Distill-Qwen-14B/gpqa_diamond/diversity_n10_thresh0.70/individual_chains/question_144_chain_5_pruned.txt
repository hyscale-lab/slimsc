Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's see what I can figure out.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. Decay distance comes from how long the particle lives and how fast it's moving. So the formula should involve lifetime, velocity, and maybe some constants.

First, I think the mean lifetime τ of a particle is related to its width Γ. Oh right! The uncertainty principle says that Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and τ is the uncertainty in time. The relation is Γ * τ = ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, because Γ is the decay width, which is the total energy uncertainty, so yes, that's correct. So I can compute τ using that.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Since the meson is produced with energy E_X, which is higher than its rest mass, it's moving relativistically. The rest mass energy is m_X c², right? So m_X is 1.2 GeV, E_X is 8 GeV. So the total energy is much higher than the rest mass.

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E_X / (m_X c²). Hmm, but wait units are a bit tricky. Let me make sure I'm handling them correctly.

But perhaps a better approach is to find the velocity beta (β) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. Oh, right! The relation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So p is the momentum.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way since beta is v/c. I can find beta from the energy. Let me think: E = γ m c², and p = γ β m v. Wait, maybe I can express beta in terms of E and m.

Wait, another approach: since E = γ m c², and the momentum p = γ β m v.
