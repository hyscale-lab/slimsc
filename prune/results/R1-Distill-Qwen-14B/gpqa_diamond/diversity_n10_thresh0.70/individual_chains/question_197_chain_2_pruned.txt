Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. 

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably due to O-H or N-H stretches. But then there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be very broad and strong around 2500-3000 cm-1. But in the IR given, the 3400–2500 region is broad, which could include O-H. But wait, 3400–2500 is a large range. I remember that aldehydes have a peak around 2820 and 2720 for the C-H stretch, but that's in the lower end. Alternatively, the broadness could be from an acidic O-H, like a carboxylic acid. But wait, another peak is at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are around the C=C stretching regions, so probably there's a benzene ring as well.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first is 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, integrating to 1H. That's a really high chemical shift. I'm thinking maybe an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but wait—carboxylic acids have O-H protons around 10-12 ppm, but they tend to be broad. So 10.5 ppm could be an O-H of a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton can also appear around there, but it's usually sharp. The broadness suggests it's more likely a carboxylic acid.

But then, another peak at 8.0 ppm, doublet integrating for 2H. The next peak is at 7.2 ppm, also a doublet for 2H. That's typical for a substituted benzene, maybe para-substituted. Like, two protons as doublets in a para arrangement. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

Then, 2.9 ppm, a multiplet for 1H. That could be a CH group adjacent to something else, maybe a branching point or near an electronegative atom. Then 1.7 ppm, multiplet for 2H—maybe a CH2 next to something. 1.4 ppm, a doublet for 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 or a CH. And 0.9 ppm, triplet for 3H, which is likely a terminal methyl group, perhaps part of an ethyl chain.

Putting the NMR together: The benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions
