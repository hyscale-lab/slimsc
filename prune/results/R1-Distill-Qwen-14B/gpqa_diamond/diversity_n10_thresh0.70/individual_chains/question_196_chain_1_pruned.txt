Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass oscillates around an equilibrium point due to a restoring force proportional to displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so things must be a bit different because of special relativity.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of the oscillator. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think about the relativistic harmonic oscillator. Oh right, in relativity, the equations of motion change because mass increases with velocity, so the usual Newtonian approach doesn't directly apply.

In a classical harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's option C. But this is the relativistic case, so we can't use Newtonian mechanics directly.

Relativistic mechanics introduces factors involving the speed of light c. The energy in relativity isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. The total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest mass energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy. But wait, in a harmonic oscillator, energy oscillates between kinetic and potential. So maybe in the relativistic case, the total energy is more than just the sum.

Wait, no. Wait, the maximum speed would occur when the oscillator is passing through the equilibrium point, so all the energy is kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy E of the oscillator is probably the sum of the rest mass energy and the maximum kinetic energy. But wait, no, because in the Newtonian case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is the sum of KE and PE. But in relativity, it's more complicated because energy can't be treated the same way.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's total energy is given by the sum of the rest energy and the maximum kinetic energy, which at the
