Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) are involved here. 

Alright, the problem states that the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I think each β corresponds to the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands. So, β1 is probably for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), and so on.

Wait, no wait. I'm a bit confused. The stability constant β is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. For example, β1 would be for the first complex, maybe CoSCN^+. So the general form is Co^{n+} + n SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_n^{m+} with βn being the formation constant.

But wait, the problem is asking about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think that refers specifically to the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) complex, which is blue. So we're looking for the percentage of Co in the form [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+).

To find this, I think we need to calculate the fraction of Co that is in each complex and then sum the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+). But how do we approach this when there are multiple possible complexes?

I remember that when dealing with multiple complexes, the fraction of each can be found using the formation constants and the concentrations of the ions. The general approach is to calculate the cumulative formation constants, which are the product of the stepwise constants up to that complex.

Wait, no. The stability constants given are stepwise, meaning each βn is the constant for adding one SCN- to the (n-1)th complex. So, β1 is for Co²+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+, β2 would be [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, and so on. So the overall
