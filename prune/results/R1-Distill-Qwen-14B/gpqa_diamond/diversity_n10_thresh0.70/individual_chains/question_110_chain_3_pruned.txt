Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let me understand the question. The key point is that each spectrograph can observe stars up to a certain brightness in the V magnitude. ESPRESSO can handle stars brighter than 17 V mag, while HIRES handles up to 16 V mag. So the stars must be bright enough (apparent magnitude ≤ 17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES) to be detected by both.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says: which stars can be detected with both. So a star must be observable by both instruments. Because ESPRESSO goes up to 17 mag, and HIRES up to 16, that means the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 for HIRES, because if it's brighter than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. But if the star is dimmer than 16 mag, HIRES can't see it. So the star must have apparent V mag ≤16.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Wait, no. Because the question is about which stars can be detected with both. So for a star to be detected by both, it must be observable by each. So for ESPRESSO, it must have apparent V ≤17, and for HIRES, apparent V ≤16. So the star's apparent V must be ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. So any star with apparent V ≤16 can be seen by both.

Wait, but let me think again. Let me clarify: the brightness for each instrument. Suppose a star's apparent V is 15: then it's below 16 and 17, so both can see it. But if a star is, say, 16.5 mag, then HIRES can't see it (since it's brighter than 16), but ESPRESSO can (since ≤17). So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V must be ≤16.

So the key is to compute the apparent V magnitude for each star and see which ones are ≤16.

Wait, but wait, some of the stars give us their absolute magnitude and distance, so we'll have to compute their apparent magnitude.

Let me go through each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. The formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d=10, so log(10/10)=0. So m =15.5 + 0 =15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. Which is ≤16. So it's observable by both? Wait, HIRES can see up to 16, so 15.5 is okay, yes. So Star1 can be seen by both. Wait, but wait, no: wait, the question says, can be detected with both. So if a star is detectable by both instruments, then it's a candidate.

Star2: apparent V mag is 16.5. So for HIRES,
