Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet, similar in mass to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The key part is about the spectral line shifts. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star move. The shift depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period or the velocity of the star.

Wait, but the formula I think I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by a formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital distance. Or maybe it's about the relation between the velocity and the period.

Oh right! The RV method measures the star's velocity toward and away from us. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * (P * (1 day))^(-1/3) ) )^(1/3) * sin i

But wait, since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_p << M_star, so we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So, K simplifies a bit. 

Alternatively, another approach: the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit is inversely proportional to the orbital period. Wait, no. Let me think about the relationship between the Doppler shift and the orbital period.

Wait, the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )

But since sin i is close to 1 (edge-on orbit, which is typical for RV detection), it can be approximated as 1. So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(-1/3).

Wait, but let me think again. The formula I remember is K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / P )^(1/3) ) * ( 2π )^(1/3) / c ?

Wait, I might be mixing some terms. Alternatively, the formula for K is often written as:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) * ( (1) / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 ) / ( (2π) )^(1/3) ) )

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about proportionality. Since the two stars have the same mass and the two planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), the only varying factors are the orbital periods and the velocity semi-amplitudes (K).

Given that K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(-1/3). Wait, no, let me get that right.

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = (27 * pi * G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * ( (P/(24*3600 seconds))^(-1/3) )) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the Doppler shift being proportional to the star's velocity. The star's velocity is K, which depends on the planet's mass
