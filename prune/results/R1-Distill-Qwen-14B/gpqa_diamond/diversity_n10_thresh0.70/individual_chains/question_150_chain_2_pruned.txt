Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that formula... Let me think. The molecular formula can help determine the structure. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could be one ring and two double bonds, or maybe a ring and a double bond plus a triple bond, but more likely, it's a benzene ring (which is three degrees) plus maybe a double bond and a carbonyl group (each adds one, so 3+2=5). So the compound probably has a benzene ring and maybe an aldehyde or ketone group.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a strong upfield shift, probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, so that makes sense. But wait, a triplet? Aldehyde protons are typically singlets unless there's coupling. Hmm. Maybe the aldehyde is near another proton. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like an -OH, but that's more in the 1-5 ppm range, so probably not. Wait, maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde, or perhaps it's adjacent to a CH2 group.

The next peak is 6.98 ppm, a doublet with two H's. Then 6.51 ppm, another doublet with two H's. Those look like aromatic protons. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring, because the two doublets suggest coupling between two adjacent protons but in a para arrangement? Wait, if it's a para-substituted ring, each set of protons would be equivalent, but here the two doublets are different. Or perhaps it's a substituted benzene with substituents in the ortho position, but that would lead to more complex splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents at the para positions. Wait, but the integration for each is 2H, so maybe each is a pair of protons, like a di-substituted benzene. So perhaps the benzene ring is substituted with two groups, each at the para positions, making the two sets of doublets?

Wait, but the substituents would affect the chemical shifts. Let me think: the 6.98 ppm is a downfield shift, which suggests it's near an electron-withdrawing group. The 6.51 ppm is less downfield, maybe attached to something else. Or perhaps the benzene is part of a larger structure, like a phenyl group attached to another part of the molecule.

Looking further, 6.27 is a broad singlet for two H's. Broad suggests perhaps an -OH group, but in a different environment. Or maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton attached to an oxygen. Or perhaps it's a conjugated system where the protons are deshielded. Wait, but a broad signal could be from an -OH, but in that case, it's usually a singlet. But wait, the integration is 2H for this peak. That's two hydrogens, so maybe it's a CH2 group with some coupling.

Then there's a 3.66 ppm, a doublet integrating for 2H. That's in the range of a CH2 group attached to something electronegative, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group. So could this be an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester?

Putting this all together. Let me think about the structure. The aldehyde proton at 9.72 could be part of a butanal or similar chain. The two aromatic rings (C6H5 groups) would account for the 6.98 and 6.51 peaks. Wait, but each is integrating for 2H, which suggests each is a pair of protons on a benzene ring. Wait, that would mean the molecule has two benzene rings? Because a single benzene ring has six H's, but the integration for each is 2H, so that would imply two separate aromatic groups. Hmm, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms. Two benzene rings would contribute 12 C, but our
