Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's heated to 240°C with KOH in excess to give a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR, ignoring any exchange with deuterated solvent.

Alright, let's break this down.

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with such bases, it's often an elimination reaction. So probably forming an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. But since it's a dibromide, maybe a double elimination happens. Admantine rings are pretty rigid, so where would the elimination occur?

1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the bromines are on adjacent positions in the adamantane structure. Heating with KOH would lead to elimination to form an alkene. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the dihalide would likely form a diene, but wait, or maybe a single double bond.

Wait, elimination usually forms one double bond. But with two bromines, perhaps two eliminations can happen, but I think in this case, it's more likely a single elimination between the two adjacent bromines. Wait, no, in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the positions are 1 and 3, which are across a bridge. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should think about the structure.

Adamantane is a diamondoid structure. The 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on opposite sides of the structure. So when KOH is added, maybe each bromine leaves, and a double bond forms between the adjacent carbons. Wait, but if they're 1 and 3, maybe it's a bridge structure. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on adjacent bridge
