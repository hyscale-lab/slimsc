Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, let me try to think through it. So the question is about the flux ratio of two neutrino energy bands after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I need to find the ratio flux1/flux2.

Wait, first, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is a major source of energy in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, then in pp-II, it fuses into helium-3, and pp-III is another part. Oh right, I think the pp-III branch involves the fusion of two helium-3 nuclei into helium-4, producing more energy. So if the pp-III branch stops, that would affect the production of certain particles, particularly high-energy neutrinos.

Neutrinos are produced in various steps. I recall that in the proton-proton chain, the main neutrinos are produced in the pep (proton-electron-proton) branch and the pp-I and pp-III branches. But wait, the pep branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, right? And the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of high-energy neutrinos would drop. But what about the lower-energy ones? The other branches, like pp-I and pep, would continue, right? Because the question says all other reactions remain as they were.

Wait, the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands. So band 1 is 700-800 keV, band 2 is 800-900. I think that the higher energy neutrinos come from the pp-III branch. Because when two helium-3 nuclei fuse, they emit a couple of high-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, the higher energy neutrinos (like in band 2) would decrease.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The main neutrino emission sources in the Sun are the pep and the pp chains. The pep branch produces neutrinos around 1.4 MeV. The pp chain has two branches: pp-I and pp-III. The pp-I produces lower-energy neutrinos, and the pp
