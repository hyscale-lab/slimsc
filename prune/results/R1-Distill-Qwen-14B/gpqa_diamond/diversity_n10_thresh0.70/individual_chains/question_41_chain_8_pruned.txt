Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, the glass is moving, so does that affect the speed of the light beam as observed?

Wait, no. In the rest frame of the glass, the light speed is c/n. But because the glass is moving, do we need to apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity?

I think so. Because when the medium itself is moving, the observer in the lab would see the light's speed differently. But wait, light always travels at c in a vacuum, but in a medium, the speed is lower, right?

Wait, the problem states that the speed of light in the glass is to be found relative to the lab. So the light is inside the moving glass. So maybe I should consider the velocity of the light in the glass's frame and then transform it to the lab frame.

Let me think. In the glass's rest frame (S'), the light is moving at v' = c/n, right? And the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame (S). So I need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

Oh right! Using the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/cÂ²), but wait, because c is 1 here as per the problem statement. So the formula simplifies to u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' * v).

Wait, but what's u' here? Because in the glass frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n, right? Since the index of refraction is n, and c is 1, u' = 1/n.

So substituting into the formula: u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v )

Hmm, that looks like the numerator is (1 + n v) / n, and the denominator is (n + v)/n. So when you divide them, the n
