Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me see what it says. Oh right, it's about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in solution, and I need to find the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species. Hmm, dithiocyanato would be the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, right? Because dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands attached.

The problem gives me the concentrations: [Co] total is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. Also, the stability constants β1 to β4 are given as 9, 40, 63, and 16. I'm a bit confused about what these β values represent. Oh, right! Stability constants, or formation constants, are the equilibrium constants for the formation of a complex from its ions. So for each complex, βn would be the equilibrium constant for Co^(II) plus n SCN^- forming the complex.

Wait, but I think the notation is that each β corresponds to the step-wise formation. So β1 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, right? Because it's Co^2+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)]^+ with K = β1. Then β2 is the next step, adding another SCN^- to make [Co(SCN)_2]^0, and so on. So β2 is the step from [Co(SCN)]^+ to [Co(SCN)_2]^0, and the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2] would be β1 * β2. Similarly, β3 is for adding a third SCN, making [Co(SCN)_3]^–, and β4 is for adding a fourth, making [Co(SCN)_4]^2–.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is the step-wise constant, and to get the overall formation constant for a complex with n ligands, I multiply all the β's up to that n. So for the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the overall β would be β1 * β2. Let me calculate that: 9 * 40 = 360.

But
