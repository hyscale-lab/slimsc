Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem gives a reaction scheme where compound A goes through several reactions to form compounds B, C, D, and finally E. My task is to identify compound E from the given options. There are also two hints provided, which I should definitely consider.

Let's break down the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

I also have two hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and compound E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

Looking at the IR data first. A strong peak around 1750 cm^-1 suggests that compound A has a carbonyl group (C=O). But wait, that's a pretty high wavenumber. Typically, ketones have peaks around 1700-1750 cm^-1. So maybe A is a ketone. Alternatively, esters or aldehydes could have higher peaks, but for this reaction, since A is reacting with HCN, it's probably a ketone.

The second IR peak is for E at 1715 cm^-1. That's also a carbonyl, but maybe a slightly less strong one. Could E be another ketone, or perhaps an aldehyde? Or maybe an ester?

Looking at the reaction steps:

1. A + HCN → B. If A is a ketone, reacting with HCN might form a cyanohydrin. But wait, another possibility is that A is an aldehyde or ketone. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So for example, if A is a ketone, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin (compound B, which would have an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent).

2. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Hydrogenation of what? If B is a cyanohydrin, it has an alcohol and a nitrile group. But H2 with Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Would the nitrile group be hydrogenated first? Nitriles (R-C≡N) when hydrogenated with H2 and a catalyst like palladium typically become amines (R-CH2-NH2), but wait, I think under certain conditions, like with high pressure, they might form amines. Alternatively, I might be mixing this up with other catalysts. Oh wait, nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines using H2 and a catalyst like Raney Ni or Pt, but perhaps in this case, the conditions are different. Alternatively, maybe B's nitrile is converted to an amine, but that doesn't fit with step 3.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the product of the H2/Pd reaction is a ketone again. Or perhaps the alcohol in B is being reduced. Let's think again.

Wait, if A is a ketone, reaction with HCN would add a cyanide group to the carbonyl. So the product B would be a cyanohydrin. So for example, cyclohexanone reacting with HCN would give (cyclohexylidene)propanenitrile or something similar. Then, when B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, the nitrile group (CN) might be reduced. What happens when a nitrile is hydrogenated? Nitriles on hydrogenation (with H2 and a catalyst like palladium or nickel) typically form amines. Wait, no, wait: actually, nitr
