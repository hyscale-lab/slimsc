Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions yet. But I'll take it step by step.

The question involves a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let me break that down. The molecular formula... C8H9NO. So, the molecular weight would be 8*12 + 9*1 +14 +16 = 96 +9 +14 +16 = 135 g/mol. Hmm, but maybe I don't need the molecular weight right now.

Looking at the NMR data: 
1H-NMR (ppm): 
- 9.72 (t, 1H)
- 6.98 (d, 2H)
- 6.51 (d, 2H)
- 6.27 (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 (d, 2H)

I need to figure out what this structure looks like first. The NMR tells me about the functional groups and substituents.

The first peak is at 9.72 ppm, a triplet (t, 1H). That's a high shift, which suggests an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the molecule.

Next, the 6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H) suggest two sets of aromatic protons, each with two H. So perhaps two aromatic rings, each with two substituents, and each giving a doublet. Wait, or maybe each ring is para-substituted, so each has two adjacent protons? Or maybe it's a coupling between two doublets.

Wait, let me think. If a benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions, it would have two sets of protons. Like, for example, if each ring has a substituent in the para position, the protons would split into two doublets. Alternatively, if the substituents are adjacent or meta, the splitting would be different.

Wait, the 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) could be a pair of doublets that are coupled to each other. That's typical of a para-substituted benzene with another substituent that's also para. For example, something like two phenyl groups attached to the same carbon. Or maybe each ring has a substituent, and each is connected via a chain.

Then looking at the 6.27 (bs, 2H), broad singlet. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, perhaps an -OH group. But wait, it's a singlet, so two protons not split. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated double bond, like in an enol or something. Or maybe it's a vinyl proton that's not split due to symmetry or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic ring that's part of a di-substituted group, but I'm not sure yet.

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2
