Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The key points are:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2.
- Star_1's mass is also 1.5 times larger.
- The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same.
- The radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.
- We're told to assume they radiate as black bodies.
- The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, okay. So I need to find the ratio of their luminosities, L1/L2.

Wait, but the problem mentions radial velocities. Oh right, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh, wait, but the peak wavelengths are the same, so maybe the Doppler shift comes into play here.

Let me think. The peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K) and T is the effective temperature.

But the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So λ1 = λ2. So from Wien's law, T1 / T2 = λ2 / λ1. Wait, no, because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ1 = λ2, then T1 = T2. But wait, the stars have different velocities. Oh, wait, no. The observed wavelength from each star might be different because of their velocities, but the problem says the λ at which they appear brightest is the same. Wait, no, the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same.

Wait, so λ1_observed = λ2_observed? Or are they emitting at the same λ_max, but our observation says they appear at the same λ?

Wait, the problem says: "they are the same." Hmm, the way it's phrased, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest," meaning the observed wavelengths are the same. So the observed λ_max for both is the same.

Wait, but the actual emission λ_max depends on their temperatures. So if the observed λ_max is same, then their temperatures must be same when accounting for their velocities.

So, the Doppler effect must adjust the observed temperature.

Hmm, right, because if a star is moving towards or away from us, it causes a shift in the observed wavelength. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ), assuming v_r is much smaller than the speed of light. But wait, the problem gives velocities of 0 and 700 km/s. 700 km/s is about 0.7% the speed of light (since c is ~3e5 km/s). So 0.007 times c. So perhaps we can use the approximation for small velocities.

Wait, but let me think again. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer. If the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shifted). If moving away, it's longer (red shifted).

The formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, no, that's only the case for non-relativistic speeds. Wait, the exact formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), but when v_r is much smaller than c, we can approximate this as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v_r/(c)) )^(1/2) ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v_r/(2c)) ). Because for small x, sqrt(1+x) ≈ 1 + x/2.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

But when v_r is much smaller than c, we can approximate this as:

λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v_r/(2c) )

Wait, no, because if v_r is positive (moving away), then (1 + v_r/c) is bigger than (1 - v_r/c). So sqrt( (1+a)/(1-a) ) ≈ 1 + a, where a = v_r/c. Because for small a, (1+a) ≈ (1+a), and (1-a) ≈ 1, so sqrt( (1+ a)/(1 - a) ) ≈ sqrt( (1+ a) ) ≈ 1 +a/2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me just write the approximate formula.

If v_r << c, then the Doppler shift can be approximated as:

Δλ/λ = v_r / c

But since λ_obs = λ_rest + Δλ, for v_r positive (moving away), Δλ is positive, so λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/(c) )

Wait, but that's the linear approximation. So for small velocities, λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r/c )

Wait no, wait. For a source moving away (v_r positive), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so the factor should be (1 + v_r/c).

But wait, another approach: for a source moving away, the observed wavelength increases (λ_obs = λ_rest (1 + v_r/c) ).

So in this problem, Star_1 has v_r = 0, Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s away. So Star_2 is moving away, so its observed wavelength is longer. But in the problem, the observed wavelengths are the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

Wait, but according to the problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c )

Wait no, actually, the correct Doppler shift formula for the observed wavelength when the source is moving with velocity v (v positive for moving away) is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c )

But wait, actually, no: the exact Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) )

Wait, but when v_r is small, we can approximate this as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v_r/(c) )

But wait, let me think again. The relativistic Doppler shift for redshift (when the source is moving away) is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )

But when v_r is small, say much less than c, then sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ) ) is approximately (1 + x) ), where x = v_r/c.

Wait, because (1 + x)/(1 - x) ≈ (1 + 2x) using a Taylor expansion for small x. Because 1/(1−x) ≈ 1 +x for small x.

So (1 + x)/(1 - x) ≈ (1 + x)(1 + x) ) = 1 + 2x + x² ≈ 1 + 2x. So the square root of that is sqrt(1 + 2x) ≈ 1 + x.

So λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + x/ ) where x is v_r/c.

Wait, sqrt(1 + 2x) ≈ 1 + x (since x is small). So overall, λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + x) ) = λ_rest (1 + v_r/c )

So, okay. Now, given that, because Star_1's v_r is 0, and Star_2's v_r is 700 km/s, let's compute the observed λ for each.

But the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same for both. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

Let me denote the rest wavelength for Star_1 as λ1_rest, and Star_2 as λ2_rest.

Then:

λ1_obs = λ1_rest * (1 + v1_r / c ) 
λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r / c )

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1_rest * (1 + 0) = λ2_rest * (1 + 700e3 / (3e5) )

Wait, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. Hmm, no, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s, and c is approximately 3e5 km/s, which is 3e8 m/s. So 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333...

Wait, let me compute 700,000 m/s divided by 3e8 m/s: 700000 / 300000000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.0023333...

So, v_r for Star_2 is 700 km/s, so v_r/c ≈ 0.0023333.

So, (1 + v_r/c) = 1 + 0.002333 ≈ 1.002333.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 1.002333

Hmm, but I'm not sure if I'm approaching this correctly. Wait, alternatively, perhaps the temperature is adjusted based on the Doppler shift.

Because the peak wavelength observed is the same for both stars, but each star has a different temperature because of their velocities.

Wait, let me think in terms of the effective temperatures. The effective temperature T is the temperature of the star's surface. The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift. So, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r/c ), where v_r is the radial velocity (assuming non-relativistic speeds).

So, the emitted wavelength (λ_emit) is determined by the star's temperature via Wien's law. So, λ_emit = b / T.

So, for Star_1:

λ1_obs = λ1_emit * (1 + v1_r/c )

Similarly, for Star_2:

λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v2_r/c )

But in the problem, λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So,

λ1_emit * (1 + v1_r/c ) = λ2_emit * (1 + v2_r/c )

We know v1_r is 0, so (1 + 0) =1.

v2_r is 700 km/s. So,

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5 )

Compute 700e3 /3e5: 700,000 / 300,000 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333... wait, no, wait: 700,000 is 7e5. 3e5 is 300,000. So 7e5 /3e5 = 7/3 = 2.333...? Wait, no, wait: 700,000 is 7e5, 3e5 is 300,000. So 7e5/3e5 is 7/3? No, 7e5 /3e5 = 7/3? No, 7e5 is 700,000, 3e5 is 300,000. 700,000 / 300,000 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333...? Wait, no. 700,000 divided by 300,000 is 7/3? Because 300,000 * 2.3333 is 700,000. Oh, right, 700,000 is 300,000 * (7/3) ≈ 2.3333.

Wait, so 700,000 / 3e5 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333... So (1 + 700e3/(3e5)) = 1 + 7/3 = 10/3 ≈ 3.3333.

Wait, but that can't be right because Star_2 is moving away, so its λ_obs would be longer. Wait, but according to the problem, both stars have same observed λ_max, so λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, its λ2_emit would be shorter than λ1_emit, because λ_obs is the same. But this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the temperatures in terms of their observed λ.

Wait, from the observed λ, the star's effective temperature would be lower if it's moving away because λ_obs is longer. But since they have the same observed λ, their effective temperatures adjusted for Doppler shift must be the same.

Wait, perhaps the key is to find the ratio of their actual temperatures, considering their velocities.

Let me think again.

Each star's effective temperature, T, emits a peak wavelength λ_emit = b / T.

But when the star is moving, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r/c ), where v_r is the radial velocity (positive for moving away).

Given that λ1_obs = λ2_obs = λ_obs.

So,

λ1_emit * (1 + v1_r / c ) = λ2_emit * (1 + v2_r / c )

But v1_r is 0, so:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v2_r / c )

But λ1_emit = b / T1, λ2_emit = b / T2.

So,

b/(T1) = (b/(T2)) * (1 + (v2_r/c) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2_r/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2_r/c )

Wait, because 1/(T1) = [1/(T2)] [1 + v2_r/c ] → T1 = T2 / [1 + v2_r/c ]

Wait, no. Let me write it step by step.

We have:

λ1_emit = (b) / T1

λ2_emit = (b) / T2

And,

λ1_emit * 1 = λ2_emit * (1 + v2_r/c )

So,

(b/T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v2_r/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v2_r/c )

Take reciprocal,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2_r/c )

But wait, v2_r is 700 km/s, so in terms of c, v2_r/c = 700e3 m/s / 3e8 m/s ≈ 0.0023333.

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + 0.0023333 ) ≈ T2 / 1.0023333 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.00233 ) (using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1-x for small x)

So approximately, T1 ≈ T2 * (0.997667 )

Wait, but let me compute it accurately. 1.0023333 inverse is approximately 0.99766 (since 1/1.002333 ≈ 0.99766 )

So T1 ≈ 0.99766 * T2.

So the ratio T1/T2 is approximately 0.99766.

But let me compute this more accurately. Let's compute 1 / 1.0023333 exactly.

1.0023333 is approximately 1.002333333333.

So 1 / 1.002333333333 = ?

Well, 1.0023333 is 1 + 0.0023333.

We can compute this as 1/(1 + x) ≈ 1 - x + x² - x³ ... for small x. Let's take x=0.0023333.

So,

1/(1 + x) ≈ 1 - x + x².

x = 0.0023333.

x² = (0.0023333)^2 = approx 5.444e-6.

So,

1 - x + x² = 1 - 0.0023333 + 0.000005444 ≈ 0.9976667 + 0.000005444 ≈ 0.997672144.

Wait, but maybe more accurately, 1/1.0023333 is 0.997667.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator would be better, but since I can't, I'll proceed with this approximation.

So T1 ≈ 0.997667 * T2.

Now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 ) * (4π σ /4π sigma) → R1² / R2² * (T1 / T2 )^4.

We have R1 = 1.5 R₂. So R1/R2 = 1.5.

T1 / T2 ≈ 0.997667.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.997667)^4.

Compute this:

First, 1.5 squared is 2.25.

Next, (0.997667)^4 ≈ ?

Compute 0.997667^2 first:

0.997667 * 0.997667 ≈ let's compute it.

Let me compute (1 - 0.002333)^2 = 1 - 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.004666 + 0.000005444 ≈ 0.9953388.

Then, (0.9953388)^2 ≈ (0.9953388)^2.

Wait, 0.9953388 is approximately 0.995339.

So (0.995339)^2 = ?

Let me compute (1 - 0.004661)^2 = 1 - 2*0.004661 + (0.004661)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.009322 + 0.0000217 ≈ 0.9906987.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the first step: 0.997667^2 is approximately (1-0.002333)^2 = 1 - 0.004666 + 0.000005444 ≈ 0.9953388.

Then, (0.9953388)^2 = [0.9953388]^2.

Let me compute that as (0.9953388) * (0.9953388):

Approximate it as (1 - 0.0046612)^2.

Which is 1 - 2*(0.0046612) + (0.0046612)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0093224 + 0.0000217 ≈ 0.9906993.

So (0.997667)^4 ≈ 0.9906993.

So putting it all together:

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9906993 ≈ ?

2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * (1 - 0.0093) = 2.25 - (2.25 * 0.0093) ≈ 2.25 - 0.020925 ≈ 2.229075.

So approximately 2.229.

Wait, but let's see the options given.

The options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm, 2.229 is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, I approximated (0.997667)^4 as 0.9907, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using the exact value of T1/T2.

Wait, let's re-calculate T1/T2 more accurately.

We have v2_r = 700 km/s.

v2_r in m/s is 700,000 m/s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So v_r/c = 700000 / 3e8 = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.023333...?

Wait, no, wait: 7e5/3e8 = (7e5)/(3e5 *1e3) ) = (7/300) * (1e5 /1e3) ) Hmmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation earlier.

Wait no, 7e5 is 700,000; 3e8 is 300,000,000.

So 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7 / 300 = 0.0233333... So I think I made a mistake earlier. Oh no! I thought v_r = 700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s, but 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s? No, wait, no, 1 km = 1e3 m, so 700 km/s =700,000 m/s =7e5 m/s. Yes, correct.

So v_r/c = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.0233333.

Wait, oh, I see! So earlier I thought it was 0.0023333, but no, it's actually 0.0233333.

Ah, I see. That's where I went wrong earlier. Because 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s, and c is 3e8 m/s. So 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(3e3) )= 7/(3,000) )= 0.0023333. Wait, no, 7e5 is 700,000. 3e8 is 300,000,000. So 700,000 /300,000,000 = 7/300 ≈ 0.0233333.

Wait, wait. 700,000 is 7e5, and 300 million is 3e8, so 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(3e3) )= 7/3000 ≈ 0.0023333. Oh! So I was correct the first time. Wait no, no, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s, which is 7e5 m/s. Divided by c which is 3e8 m/s. So 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(3e3) )= 0.0023333333.

So v_r/c is 0.00233333, not 0.0233333.

Ah, I see. So in the earlier calculations, I used the correct 0.00233333, but then in the middle of my thinking, I thought I made a mistake and recalculated, but that was incorrect. So the correct v_r/c is 0.00233333.

So, going back.

For Star_2, v_r is 700 km/s away, so v_r = +700 km/s. The observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c )

So,

λ1_obs = λ1_rest * (1 + 0) = λ1_rest.

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + (700 km/s)/c ) = λ2_rest * (1 + 0.00233333 )

Since λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 1.00233333

But λ_rest = b / T, so:

λ1_rest = b/T1

λ2_rest = b/T2

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * 1.00233333

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * 1.00233333

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.00233333 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.00233 )

Because 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x for small x.

So T1 ≈ 0.997667 * T2.

Now, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

R1/R2 = 1.5.

So,

(1.5)^2 = 2.25.

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.997667)^4.

Compute (0.997667)^4.

First, compute (0.997667)^2.

0.997667^2 = ?

Let me compute it as (1 - 0.002333)^2 = 1 - 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.004666 + 0.000005444 ≈ 0.9953388.

Now, square that:

0.9953388^2 = ?

Again, write it as (1 - 0.0046612)^2.

Which is 1 - 2*0.0046612 + (0.0046612)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0093224 + 0.0000217 ≈ 0.9906993.

So,

(0.997667)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ ?

2.25 * 0.9907.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.9907 = 2.25*(0.99 + 0.0007) = 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

So approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the given data and apply the relevant formulas.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
   - Mass: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \)
   - Radial velocities: \( v_{r1} = 0 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Observed peak wavelengths: \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)

2. **Assumptions**:
   - The stars radiate as blackbodies.
   - The observed peak wavelength depends on the star's temperature and radial velocity due to the Doppler effect.

### Step 1: Relating Observed Wavelengths and Temperatures
The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the Doppler shift formula:
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
\]
For small velocities (\( v_r \ll c \)), this can be approximated as:
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} \approx \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{2c}\right)
\]
Since the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)), we equate their emitted wavelengths:
\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_{r1}}{2c}\right) = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_{r2}}{2c}\right)
\]
Substituting \( v_{r1} = 0 \) and \( v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \):
\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{700}{2 \cdot 300,000}\right)
\]
\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot 1.002333
\]

Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = b / T \)), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant:
\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot 1.002333
\]
Simplifying:
\[
T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1.002333} \approx T_2 \cdot 0.997667
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
\[
L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]
The ratio of the luminosities is:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]
Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_1 = 0.997667 T_2 \):
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.997667)^4
\]

### Step 3: Numerical Calculation
1. Compute \( (1.5)^2 \):
\[
(1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

2. Compute \( (0.997667)^4 \):
   - First, \( (0.997667)^2 \approx 0.995339 \).
   - Then, \( (0.995339)^2 \approx 0.9907 \).

Thus:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.229
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.
