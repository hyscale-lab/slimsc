Hmm, okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle these infinities, then removing the regularization in the end after the divergences cancel out or are renormalized away.

So the question is about which theory doesn't need this regularization. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a theory of quantum gravity. Since it's a theory that unites quantum mechanics with general relativity, it's supposed to avoid some of the problems that come with point particles, like infinite charges or other divergences. Strings are one-dimensional objects, and maybe their interactions don't lead to the same kind of divergences as in other quantum field theories. Oh wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Do string theories require regularization? I think string theory is supposed to be finite, meaning it doesn't have the same divergences as other QFTs, so maybe it doesn't need regularization. But I'm not 100% certain.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).
