Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are different chemical formulas, so I need to match the spectral data to these.

First, the FTIR spectrum. They mentioned a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester or something. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, so maybe another carbonyl or perhaps conjugated carbonyl groups. Wait, another thought: maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds? But 1650 could also be an amide or something else. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone enol or something.

Now the NMR part. Several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means there's a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond. So structures with double bonds, maybe something like an ester with a double bond, or a ketone with a double bond nearby.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a familiar mass. Let me think: 45 could be CH3COOH (30?), wait, no, 45 is maybe C3H7O+. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight. Let's think: 45 is 45 g/mol. The molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. Let's see what the possible molecular weights are.

Calculating molar masses:

C6H12O: 6*12 + 12*1 + 16 = 72 +12 +16=100 g/mol.

C6H10O: 6*12=72, 10*1=10
