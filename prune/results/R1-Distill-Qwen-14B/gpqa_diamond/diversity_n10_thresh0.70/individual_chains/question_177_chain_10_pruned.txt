Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a star's emission is related to its temperature. I remember something about Wien's law here, which says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, but wait, the problem says they found the same wavelengths as their brightest points, so T1 equals T2? That's important because the luminosity of a star depends on both its radius and temperature.

Wait, but wait a second. Did the problem say that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same? So λ1 = λ2. So using Wien's law, since λ_max is proportional to 1/T, T1 must equal T2. So T1 = T2.

Now, the next part is about radial velocities. Star_1's radial velocity is 0 km/s, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity usually refers to the velocity along the line of sight, right? But does that affect the temperature or luminosity? Wait, perhaps when considering the Doppler effect, the observed wavelength may shift, but the intrinsic (rest) wavelength would still be the same. Because the question states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, so maybe their rest wavelengths are the same; the observed wavelengths would be different due to Doppler shifting, but the problem says the brightest wavelengths are same. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

But I think the Doppler effect might affect the observed temperature. Wait, the radial velocity affects the observed temperature. Because if a star is moving towards us, the light would be blueshifted, making it appear hotter. But wait, the problem says the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same, so perhaps the observed λ_max is the same. But that might mean that the
