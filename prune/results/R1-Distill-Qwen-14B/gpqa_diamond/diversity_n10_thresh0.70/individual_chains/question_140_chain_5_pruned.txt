Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down step by step. I'll take it slow and think through each part.

The question starts by talking about Substance X. It says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm, isotopes have the same number of protons but different neutrons. So, one of X's elements has a heavier isotope. That probably means that element is something with common isotopes, maybe like chlorine or something else.

Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of neutrons and protons? So, for a molecule, each atom contributes. So if W is a molecule made of atoms where each has equal protons and neutrons, then each atom must be something like carbon-12 (6 protons, 6 neutrons). Or maybe another element where the isotopes have equal protons and neutrons.

Wait, but the molecule as a whole. So, for example, if W is CO2, each C has 6 protons, 8 neutrons (assuming C-14?), but that's not equal. Or maybe H2O, each H has 1,1, and O has 8,8? No, that's 8 vs 8, but H has 1. Wait, maybe W is something like O2. Oxygen has 8 protons. If it's O-16, then 8
