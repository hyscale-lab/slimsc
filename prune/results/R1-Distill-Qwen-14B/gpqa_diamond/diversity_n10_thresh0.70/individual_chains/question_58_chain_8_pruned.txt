Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum theories, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Classical Electrodynamics (CED).

I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are infinities that pop up in calculations. Without regularization, these infinities would make the calculations meaningless. Regularization introduces a temporary "cutoff" to make the integrals finite, and then you renormalize by subtracting the divergent parts.

So, I need to figure out which of these theories doesn't have these divergences and hence doesn't require regularization. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Strings are tiny, and I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity. It's a candidate for a theory that unites quantum mechanics and general relativity. In string theory, particles are not point-like but extended, which might change how divergences occur. I've heard that string theories are finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories. So maybe superstring theory doesn't need regularization because it doesn't have those infinities. That could be the answer.

Option B: QCD. Quantum Chromodynamics is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Yang-Mills. Wait, and I remember that in the 1970s, Gross, Wilczek, and Politzer found that QCD is asymptotically free. Asymptotic freedom means that at high energies (or equivalently, short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, allowing perturbative methods. But I also recall that QCD has issues with things like confinement and the existence of things like quark-gluon plasmas. But what about regularization? Well, QCD is a non-renormalizable theory? No wait, no, QCD is renormalizable. All the Standard Model theories are renormalizable. So they do have divergences that require regularization. So B requires regularization because it's a quantum field theory with divergences.

Option C: QED. Quantum Electrodynamics is the theory of electromagnetism. I know QED is a renormalizable theory and that it does require regularization. The process of renormalization was developed for QED. So yes, you have to regularize the calculations because of divergent loop integrals. For example, the electron's self-energy has divergent terms which are handled by renormalization. So QED requires regularization. So option C is out.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, classical theories don't deal with quantum effects. So regularization is a quantum field theory concept. In classical E&M, you don't have these divergences because the theory is classical. But wait, in classical E&M, there are some problems, like the infinite self-energy of a point charge. But those are handled differently—like using the concept of a charge distribution or regularization in a different sense. But the question is about whether regularization is needed. In quantum theories, you must regularize. In classical theories, perhaps you don't need the same kind of regularization because it's not a quantum field theory. So for D, classical ED might not require regularization because it's not a quantum theory, but I'm a bit confused because classical theories can have their own infinities, but they handle them differently.

Wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So which theories don't have the kind of divergences that necessitate regularization in the quantum field theory sense.

So looking again: Superstring Theory (A) is supposed to be a theory that doesn't have the same divergences as QED or QCD. So it doesn't need regularization. QCD (B) is a renormalizable theory, so it does require regularization. QED (C) definitely requires it. Classical Electrodynamics (D) isn't a quantum theory, so regularization (as in QFT) isn't needed. But wait, the question is
