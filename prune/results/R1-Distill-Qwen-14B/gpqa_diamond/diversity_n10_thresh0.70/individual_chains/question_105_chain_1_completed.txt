Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about a star with dark spots and how it relates to the brightness changes we observe when a planet transits in front of it. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

So, the star has a radius equal to the Sun, Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the star's surface that's covered by spots, right? So 20% means 0.2 of the star's surface is covered in spots.

The effective temperature of the star (Teff) is 6000 K. The spots are cooler? Wait, starspots are usually cooler than the surrounding photosphere because they're regions of magnetic activity with lower temperatures. So if the star's Teff is 6000 K, the spots must be at a lower temperature. The problem says there's a temperature difference of 1000 K. I'm not sure if the spots are 1000 K cooler or hotter. Wait, no, starspots are cooler. So if the star is 6000 K, the spots are 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K?

But wait, the question is about the brightness variation due to rotational modulation. So as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our line of sight. Since only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the spots will be visible for a certain period. The variation in brightness is due to the spots changing the overall flux as they rotate into and out of view.

Now, the setup says that this situation can resemble an exoplanet transit. So when we observe the star, the dip in brightness when a planet transits (blocks some light) is similar to the dip when a spot moves into view. But wait, actually, when a spot comes into view, the brightness would decrease because the spot is cooler and thus emits less light. But when a planet transits, it blocks the starlight, also causing a dip. So perhaps the question is saying that the brightness variation due to spots (the dip when a spot is observed) would mimic a planet transit if they produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

But the problem is phrased as: To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star?

Wait, the wording is a bit tricky. So, the question is, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what would be the radius of a planet that would cause the same brightness variation (amplitude) as the spots do when observed.

So, when the spots are present, the star's brightness decreases because part of its surface (with lower temperature spots) is rotating into our view. But if the star was unspotted, the same brightness dip would be caused by a planet blocking part of the star's disk.

Wait, let me clarify: the observed brightness variation is due to spots, and that variation is similar to what a planet would produce. So the question is, to get the same light curve amplitude, what planet radius would be needed.

Wait no, the problem says: if the star was not covered by spots, what would be the planet's radius needed to produce the same amplitude. So, the scenario is comparing two cases: one where the star has spots (and we observe a certain brightness variation), and the other where a planet transits, which would also cause a variation. The question is, what planet radius would yield the same amplitude as the spot-induced variation.

Wait, the spot variation is because each spot is cooler, so when it's facing us, it reduces the overall brightness compared to an unspotted star. So the amplitude of the dip would be different than a planet's transit, which blocks light.

So, perhaps I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness (delta F / F) caused by the spots when the star is rotating, and set that equal to the fractional change caused by a planet transiting.

Wait, but the star's spots are on only one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, 20% of the surface is covered with spots that are cooler. But the spotted hemisphere is what's facing us as it rotates. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the star is rotating, and as it does, the spotted hemisphere comes into and out of view. But since the star is a sphere, when it's viewed from Earth, the amount of spotted area visible depends on the star's rotation. But in any case, the situation is that because of the spots' lower temperature, the total emitted flux from the star varies as the spots rotate into and out of view.

But I think the way to model this is to find the average brightness change when the spots are on the visible side.

Wait, let's think about the total flux. The star's unspotted flux is F = σ*Teff^4 * 4π Rstar^2 / (4d^2), where d is distance, but for flux ratio, d cancels.

But when spots are present, each spot has a lower temperature, T_spot. The flux from the spots is F_spot = σ*T_spot^4 * A_spot, where A_spot is the area of the spots. The unspotted flux is F_unspotted = σ*Teff^4 * (4π Rstar^2 - A_spot).

Wait, but the filling factor is 20%, so A_spot = 0.2 * 4π Rstar^2. Wait, no, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. So, the area of the spots is 0.2 * 4π Rstar^2.

When the star is viewed, the spots are either on the front (visible) or the back. Since the star is rotating, the spots on the front hemisphere will contribute less flux.

But wait, the star is rotating, so the spots are on one hemisphere. When the star's rotation brings the spotty hemisphere into view, the spots are visible, and the flux from those spots is lower. But wait, the other hemisphere (which is unspotted) is also visible, but if the star is rotating, perhaps the total area of the spots visible depends on the rotational phase.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should model the situation as the star's brightness varying between when the spots are on the far side (not visible) and when they are on the front. Wait, no, because the star is a sphere, the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere becomes visible, and then the unspotty becomes visible as it continues to rotate.

Alternatively, perhaps when the star is viewed, the spots are on one side, but because of rotation, their contribution to the total flux varies.

Wait, perhaps I should model the maximum and minimum flux.

Wait, the star's total flux without any spots is F0 = σ T^4 * 4π R^2.

With spots, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux would be F_spotted = F0 - (F0 * filling factor) + (filling factor * σ (T_spot)^4 * (A_spot / A_star)) )?

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to compute the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, and when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, the star has two hemispheres: one with spots (covering 20% of the surface), and the other without. So each hemisphere has an area of 2π R^2. The spotted hemisphere has 0.2 * 4π R^2 spots, but wait, no, the filling factor is 0.2, so the spotted region is 0.2 of the entire surface. So each hemisphere, when the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres, each has an area of 2π R^2. But the spots are all on one hemisphere, so that hemisphere has 0.2 * 4π R^2 = 0.8 π R^2 of spots.

Wait, 4π R^2 is the total surface. So each hemisphere is 2π R^2. The total spotted area is 0.2 * 4π R^2 = 0.8 π R^2. So the spotted hemisphere has all of these 0.8 π R^2 spots, and when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view.

Wait, no. If the filling factor is 20%, and the spots are all on one hemisphere, then the area of the spots is 0.2 * 4π R^2 = 0.8π R^2. But each hemisphere is 2π R^2. So the spotted hemisphere has 0.8 π R^2 of spots, and the other hemisphere has none.

So when the star is viewed with the spotted hemisphere facing us, the flux we receive is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part of that hemisphere and the spotted part. The unspotted part of the hemisphere is 2π R^2 - 0.8π R^2 = 1.2 π R^2, which emits at Teff, and the spotted part (0.8 π R^2) emits at T_spot.

Wait, no. Wait, when the star's spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire hemisphere is the one we see. So the flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part of that hemisphere and the spotted part. The unspotted part is 2π R^2 - 0.8π R^2 = 1.2π R^2. The spotted part is 0.8π R^2.

So the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spotted_hemisphere = (1.2π R^2) * σ Teff^4 + (0.8π R^2) * σ T_spot^4.

When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_unspotted_hemisphere = (2π R^2) * σ Teff^4, because all the surface we see is at Teff.

Wait, but when the star is viewed from Earth, what's the situation? Wait, perhaps the star is rotating such that the spotted hemisphere is sometimes visible and sometimes hidden. So the brightness variation is between F_unspotted_hemisphere and F_spotted_hemisphere.

Wait, no. Because when the star is viewed from Earth, we see a certain part of the star. When the star rotates, the visible part changes. If the spots are on one hemisphere, then when that hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots, and when it's not, we don't.

So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us (F_max), and the minimum flux is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us (F_min).

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so when they are on the near side, the flux would be lower than when the unspotted hemisphere is on the near side.

But wait, if the star is rotating, perhaps the spots are not all on the far side when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. Hmm, maybe I should model the brightness variation as a sinusoidal function due to the star's rotation, with the spots causing a dip in brightness as they come into view.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness change is more about the area covered by spots when the star's surface is viewed. Let me think.

Wait, the star emits a certain amount of flux when it's unspotted, which is F0 = σ Teff^4 * 4π R^2 / (4d²), but when part of the surface is cooler (spots), the total flux is less.

But the situation is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star is viewed, the visible area is varying. When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is lower; when the other hemisphere is visible, the flux is higher.

Wait, perhaps the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible, and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible.

Wait, but that's only true when the star is viewed edge-on, but in reality, the star is a sphere, and when it's rotating, the visible area changes. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach.

The brightness variation due to the spots would be periodic as the star rotates. The amplitude of the variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux, divided by the average flux.

The problem is comparing this to the brightness variation caused by a planet transiting the star. The planet blocks a part of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness.

The question is, what planet radius would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

So, first, I need to compute the amplitude caused by the spots. Then, compute what planet radius would cause the same amplitude.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, compute the flux from the star when spots are and are not visible.

But wait, the star's brightness is a combination of its normal emission and the spots. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the near side, the total flux is lower.

Assuming the star is rotating such that the spotted hemisphere comes into view and the unspotted goes away, and vice versa.

Let me model the star's flux as a function of time. Let’s say that when the spotted hemisphere is entirely visible, the flux is F_spotted. When the unspotted is visible, it's F_unspotted.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, so perhaps the brightness variation is a sine-like curve, but the question is about the peak-to-peak amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps the change in brightness is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

Wait, let's compute the maximum and minimum flux.

Maximum flux (F_max) is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. So F_max = flux from the unspotted hemisphere.

Unspotted hemisphere: area 2π R², temperature Teff. So F_max = 2π R² σ Teff^4.

Wait, but wait, the total flux from the star is the sum of all surfaces. When the star is viewed, you see a hemisphere. So the flux is F = 2π R² σ T^4.

Wait, no, because each point on the hemisphere emits. So the flux is the integral over the hemisphere of the flux per unit area.

Wait, the flux from a star is (σ T^4) * (4π R^2)/(4π d^2) ), but in this case, we can consider the flux as F = (σ T^4) * (A_visible) / (4π d^2), where A_visible is the area of the star's surface visible from Earth.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of the star's total flux and the fractional change.

Let me think in terms of fractional change in flux.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = σ Teff^4 * (4π Rstar^2) / (4π d²) ) = σ Teff^4 Rstar^2 / d².

When the star is viewed with a certain area A spotted, the flux becomes F = (A_unspotted * σ Teff^4 + A_spotted * σ T_spot^4) / (4π d^2).

But I'm not sure about the exact configuration. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the maximum and minimum fluxes and find the amplitude.

Wait, considering that the spots are on one hemisphere, the maximum flux occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, and the minimum when the spotted is visible.

So, when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, F_max = σ Teff^4 * (2π Rstar^2) / (4π d^2) ) = (σ Teff^4 Rstar^2) * (2π) / (4π d^2) ) = (σ Teff^4 Rstar^2) * (1/2) / d^2.

Similarly, when the spotted hemisphere is visible, F_min = [ (unspotted area of hemisphere * σ Teff^4) + (spotted area * σ T_spot^4) ] / (4π d^2).

The unspotted area on the hemisphere is (2π R^2) - (0.2 * 4π R^2) ) ?

Wait, no. The spotted area on the hemisphere is 0.2 * 4π R^2 = 0.8 π R^2. Because the spots are all on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is visible, the area of spots is 0.8 π R^2.

So the unspotted area on the hemisphere is 2π R^2 - 0.8π R^2 = 1.2 π R^2.

Thus, F_min = [ (1.2 π R² * σ Teff^4) + (0.8 π R² * σ T_spot^4) ] / (4π d^2).

Simplify F_min:

F_min = [ 1.2 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.8 π R² σ (5000)^4 ] / (4π d² )

The σ and R² and π terms can be factored:

F_min = (1.2 * 6000^4 + 0.8 *5000^4 ) * (σ R²) / (4 d^2 )

Similarly, F_max is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. So F_max = 2π R² * σ Teff^4 / (4π d^2) ) = [2 *6000^4 ] * (σ R²)/(4 d^2 ) = (6000^4 * σ R² )/(2 d^2 )

Wait, because F_max is:

F_max = (2π R²) * σ (6000)^4 / (4π d^2 ) = [ 2 π R^2 σ 6000^4 ] / (4 π d^2 ) = [ R^2 σ 6000^4 ] * (2/(4)) ) / d^2 = [ R^2 σ 6000^4 ] * (1/2) / d^2.

So F_max is ( (6000^4) * σ R^2 ) / (2 d^2 )

Similarly, F_min is [ (1.2 *6000^4 + 0.8*5000^4) * σ R² ] / (4 d^2 )

Now, the amplitude of the variation (the peak-to-peak change) is ΔF = F_max - F_min.

But wait, actually, the amplitude in the light curve is often expressed as (F_max - F_min)/F_avg, where F_avg is the average flux.

Wait, because the star's brightness oscillates between F_min and F_max as it rotates, the amplitude is the difference between F_max and F_min. But since the star is continuously rotating, the average flux is (F_max + F_min)/2.

So the amplitude (A) would be (F_max - F_min) / ( (F_max + F_min)/2 ) ) = 2 (F_max - F_min) / (F_max + F_min )

But maybe it's easier to compute the fractional change as (F_max - F_min)/F_avg, where F_avg is the average of F_max and F_min. Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude is (F_max - F_min), but I think when considering the dip caused by a planet, the fractional change is (F_planet) / F_avg, where F_planet is the dip.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractional change in flux.

The fractional change ΔF when the planet transits is (F_planet / F_avg), where F_planet = F_avg - (Area_planet / A_star) * F_avg.

Wait, no. The planet blocks a part of the star's light. The flux during transit is F_transit = F_avg - ( (R_planet^2 / R_star^2) ) * F_avg.

Wait, F_avg is the average flux, which without any spots or transits is F0. When a planet transits, the flux drops by (R_planet / R_star)^2 * F0.

So the fractional drop is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

In the case of the star with spots, the flux varies between F_min and F_max. The amplitude would be the peak-to-peak variation, but I'm not sure if the question is referring to the peak-to-peak or the dip relative to the average.

Wait, the problem says the brightness variations are due to rotational modulation. So perhaps the amplitude is the difference between F_max and F_avg.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The star's brightness without any spots is F0.

With spots, the brightness varies between F_max and F_min, where F_max is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, and F_min when the spotted is.

The average flux F_avg_spots is (F_max + F_min)/2.

The variation in brightness is F_max - F_avg_spots = (F_max - F_min)/2, and similarly F_avg_spots - F_min = (F_max - F_min)/2.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_max - F_min)/2.

Now, the problem states that the observed variation due to spots is similar to the variation caused by an exoplanet transit. So the amplitude of the spot variation is equal to the amplitude of the planet transit variation.

The planet transit causes a dip in brightness by (R_planet/R_star)^2.

Wait, no. When a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light. The fractional change in flux is ( (Area_planet) / (Area_star) ) = (R_planet^2 / R_star^2).

So the amplitude (dip) is (R_planet/R_star)^2.

Wait, but in the case of spots, the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/2, which is half the peak-to-peak variation.

So to equate the two amplitudes:

(R_planet/R_star)^2 = (F_max - F_min)/2 / F_avg_spots.

Wait, no. Because the dip due to the planet is (R_planet/R_star)^2 * F0, where F0 is the unspotted star's flux.

In the case of the spotted star, the average flux is F_avg_spots = (F_max + F_min)/2.

So the amplitude of the variation is (F_max - F_min)/2, and the relative variation is (F_max - F_min)/(2 * F_avg_spots).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractional change in flux for both cases.

For the planet:

Fractional change (planet) = (R_planet^2 / R_star^2) * F0 / F0 = R_planet^2 / R_star^2.

For the spots:

Fractional change (spots) = (F_max - F_min) / (F_avg_spots) = (F_max - F_min) / ( (F_max + F_min)/2 )

So (F_max - F_min) / ( (F_max + F_min)/2 ) ) = 2 (F_max - F_min)/(F_max + F_min).

We need this to be equal to (R_planet/R_star)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute these values numerically.

Let me compute F_max and F_min.

Given:

Teff = 6000 K.

T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

F_max is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. The unspotted hemisphere has an area of 2π R^2 and is at Teff.

F_max = (2π R^2) * σ (6000)^4 / (4π d^2 )

Wait, 2π R^2 is the area of a hemisphere.

But wait, the total flux from the star is when the entire surface is visible. Wait, but when the star is viewed from Earth, you can only see a hemisphere. So F_max is the flux when the entire hemisphere you see is unspotted and at Teff.

Wait, no. When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the entire visible area is at Teff. So F_max = (2π R^2) * σ (6000)^4 / (4π d^2 ) = (2 R^2) * σ (6000)^4 / (4 d^2 ) ) = ( R^2 σ (6000)^4 )/(2 d^2 )

Similarly, F_min is when the spotted hemisphere is visible. The visible area is 2π R^2, but part of it is at Teff and part at T_spot.

As earlier, the unspotted part on that hemisphere is 1.2 π R^2, and the spotted part is 0.8 π R^2.

So F_min = [1.2 π R^2 * σ (6000)^4 + 0.8 π R^2 * σ (5000)^4 ] / (4π d^2 )

Simplify:

F_min = [ (1.2 *6000^4 + 0.8 *5000^4 ) * π R^2 σ ] / (4 π d^2 )

The π cancels:

F_min = (1.2 *6000^4 + 0.8 *5000^4 ) * R^2 σ / (4 d^2 )

Now compute F_max and F_min numerically.

Let's compute the terms:

6000^4 = (6x10^3)^4 = 6^4 x10^12 = 1296 x10^12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5x10^3)^4 = 625 x10^12 = 6.25e14.

So 1.2 * 6000^4 = 1.2 * 1.296e15 = 1.5552e15.

0.8 *5000^4 = 0.8 *6.25e14 =5e14.

So F_min numerator: 1.5552e15 +5e14 = 1.5552e15 +0.5e15 =2.0552e15.

F_max = (6000^4 ) * R^2 σ / (2 d^2 ) = 1.296e15 * R^2 σ/(2 d^2 )

F_min = (2.0552e15) * R^2 σ / (4 d^2 )

So F_max = (1.296e15) / 2 = 6.48e14 * (R² σ)/(d² )

F_min = (2.0552e15) /4 =5.138e14 * (R² σ)/(d² )

Wait, let me compute F_max and F_min.

Wait, F_max = [2π R^2 * σ * 6000^4 ] / (4π d^2 )

Simplify: F_max = (2 * (6000^4 )) * σ R^2 / (4 d^2 ) = (6000^4 * σ R^2) / (2 d^2 )

Similarly, F_min = [1.2 *6000^4 + 0.8 *5000^4 ] * σ R^2 / (4 d^2 )

So let me compute F_max and F_min in terms of (σ R^2 / d^2 )

Compute F_max = (6000^4) * (σ R^2 / d^2) ) / 2.

Compute F_min = (1.2*6000^4 +0.8*5000^4 ) * (σ R^2 /d^2 ) / 4.

Let me compute F_max and F_min in terms of (σ R^2/d^2 )

Compute F_max = (6000^4) / 2 = (1.296e15) / 2 = 6.48e14.

F_min = (1.2 *1.296e15 + 0.8 *6.25e14 ) /4

= (1.5552e15 +5e14 ) /4

= (1.5552e15 +0.5e15) /4

= 2.0552e15 /4 =5.138e14.

So F_max =6.48e14, F_min=5.138e14.

Average flux F_avg = (6.48e14 +5.138e14)/2 = (11.618e14)/2 =5.809e14.

So amplitude (peak-to-peak) is 6.48e14 -5.138e14 =1.342e14.

But the question is about the amplitude of the variation, which is the peak-to-peak change divided by the average.

Wait, the amplitude is often expressed as the maximum deviation from the mean. So the maximum flux is F_max, the minimum is F_min.

The mean is (F_max + F_min)/2 = F_avg.

So the amplitude (A) would be (F_max - F_avg) or (F_avg - F_min).

But F_max-F_avg = (6.48e14 -5.809e14 )=6.71e13.

F_avg - F_min =5.809e14 -5.138e14 =6.71e13.

So the amplitude is 6.71e13 (σ R²/d²).

The fractional amplitude (A/F_avg) is (6.71e13 ) /5.809e14 ≈0.1155, or about 11.55% of the average flux.

Wait, but in the planet case, the fractional dip is (R_planet/R_star)^2.

So if the planet's dip is (R_planet^2/R_star^2 ), and the spot-induced dip is 0.1155, then:

(R_planet^2 / R_star^2 ) =0.1155 → R_planet/R_star = sqrt(0.1155 ) ≈ 0.34.

Wait, wait, because the planet transiting causes a dip of (R_planet/R_star)^2, which is the fractional change in flux.

But wait, in the spot case, the amplitude is a dip of about 0.1155 when the star's flux is lower, but wait, the spot-induced variation is a dip when the spots are visible, but when the star is unspotted, the flux is higher. So the amplitude as a dip is about 0.1155.

So to get the same amplitude, the planet's dip (R_planet^2/R_star^2 ) should be equal to 0.1155.

So R_planet/R_star = sqrt(0.1155 ) ≈ 0.34.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, option A is ~0.39, C is ~0.11.

Wait, 0.34 is closest to option D (0.32) or perhaps option A (0.39). Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of F_min.

Wait, let me recalculate F_min.

1.2 *6000^4 =1.2 * (6e3)^4 =1.2 * 1296e12 =1.5552e15.

0.8 *5000^4 =0.8 * (5e3)^4 =0.8 *625e12=5e14.

So sum is 1.5552e15 +5e14 =1.5552e15 +0.5e15 = 2.0552e15.

Divide by 4: 2.0552e15 /4 =5.138e14.

So F_min =5.138e14.

F_max is 6.48e14.

Average flux is (6.48e14 +5.138e14)/2 = (11.618e14)/2 =5.809e14.

F_max - F_avg =6.48e14 -5.809e14=6.71e13.

F_avg - F_min=5.809e14 -5.138e14=6.71e13.

So the amplitude is 6.71e13, which is about 6.71e13 /5.809e14 ≈ 0.1155.

So the amplitude is 11.55% of the average flux.

So the planet's dip should be 11.55% as well, which would mean (R_planet /R_star )^2 =0.1155 → R_planet/R_star = sqrt(0.1155 )= approx 0.3398, roughly 0.34.

Looking at the options: option D is ~0.32, option A is ~0.39, option C is ~0.11.

So 0.34 is closest to option D (~0.32).

Wait, but why is the answer not 0.34? Let me check my steps again.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the filling factor differently. The filling factor (f) is 0.2, which is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots.

Earlier, I assumed that the spots are covering 0.2 of the entire star's surface, but since the spots are on one hemisphere, the area of the spots on that hemisphere is 0.2 * 4π R^2 = 0.8 π R^2.

Wait, but let me double-check. If the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered, not the entire star.

Wait, the question says 'the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000 K.' So the filling factor of 20% refers to the hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered by spots. So the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere.

So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R^2) =0.4 π R^2.

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the unspotted part on that hemisphere is 2π R^2 -0.4 π R^2 =1.6 π R^2.

Then F_min would be [1.6 π R^2 * Teff^4 σ + 0.4 π R^2 * T_spot^4 σ ] / (4π d^2 )

Which is [1.6 *6000^4 +0.4 *5000^4 ] * π R^2 σ / (4π d^2 )

Simplify:

[1.6 *1.296e15 +0.4 *6.25e14 ] * (R^2 σ)/(4 d^2 )

Compute:

1.6 *1.296e15 =2.0736e15.

0.4 *6.25e14 =2.5e14.

Sum: 2.0736e15 +0.25e15 =2.3236e15.

Divide by 4: 2.3236e15 /4 =5.809e14.

So F_min=5.809e14.

F_max remains 6.48e14.

So average flux F_avg = (6.48e14 +5.809e14)/2 = (12.289e14)/2=6.1445e14.

Amplitude is (6.48e14 -5.809e14 )=6.71e13.

Relative amplitude is 6.71e13 /6.1445e14 = approx 0.1092, or ~10.9%.

So the amplitude is about 10.9% of the average flux.

So the planet's radius would need to be R_planet/R_star = sqrt(0.1092 )≈0.3305.

Which is approximately 0.33.

Looking at the options, the closest is D) ~0.32.

Wait, but earlier when I assumed the filling factor was for the entire star, I got ~0.34, and now with correct hemisphere filling, I get ~0.33.

So the correct answer should be around 0.33, which is option D: ~0.32.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-calculate with the correct filling factor.

So the correct approach is:

Filling factor f=0.2 refers to the hemisphere. So the area of spots on the hemisphere is 0.2 * (2π R^2 )=0.4 π R^2.

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_min = [ (2π R^2 -0.4 π R^2 ) * σ Teff^4 + 0.4 π R^2 * σ T_spot^4 ] / (4π d^2 )

= [1.6 π R^2 * σ 6000^4 + 0.4 π R^2 * σ 5000^4 ] / (4π d^2 )

= [ (1.6 *6000^4 +0.4 *5000^4 ) * σ R^2 ] / (4 d^2 )

Compute 1.6 *6000^4 =1.6 * 1.296e15 =2.0736e15.

0.4 *5000^4=0.4*6.25e14=2.5e14.

Sum:2.0736e15 +0.25e15=2.3236e15.

F_min= (2.3236e15 * σ R^2 ) / (4 d^2 )=5.809e14 * (σ R^2/d^2 )

F_max when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is:

F_max= (2π R^2 * σ 6000^4 ) / (4π d^2 )= (2 *1.296e15 * σ R^2 )/(4 d^2 )= (2.592e15 )/(4 d^2 ) * σ R^2 = 6.48e14 * (σ R^2/d^2 )

So F_max=6.48e14, F_min=5.809e14.

Average flux F_avg=(6.48e14 +5.809e14 )/2= (12.289e14)/2=6.1445e14.

Amplitude is F_max -F_min=6.71e13.

The amplitude as a fraction of F_avg is 6.71e13 /6.1445e14 ≈0.1092, or ~10.92%.

So the planet's dip should be equal to this, which is (R_planet/R_star)^2 =0.1092 → R_planet/R_star= sqrt(0.1092 )≈0.3305.

So approximately 0.33, which is closest to option D) 0.32.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculations.

Wait, 0.1092^0.5 = ?

0.1092 → sqrt(0.1092 ) ≈ 0.3304.

So 0.3304 is approximately 0.33, but the options are A: 0.39, B:0.07, C:0.11, D:0.32.

So the closest is D) ~0.32.

Wait, but is there a possibility that I made a mistake in considering the filling factor?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation caused by the spots as a dip from F_avg_spots, which is (F_max + F_min)/2.

But the planet's dip is (R_planet/R_star)^2 * F0, where F0 is the star's unspotted flux.

Wait, F0 is the flux when the star is unspotted, which would be F when all areas are at Teff.

But in this problem, the star has spots, so the average flux is F_avg_spots = (F_max + F_min )/2.

Wait, but the question says, "if the star was not covered by spots!", so F0 = F when star is unspotted.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the observed variation from spots (which is a dip) is being mistaken for a planet transit, which is also a dip. So the amplitude of the dip caused by the spots equals the amplitude caused by the planet.

So the amplitude due to spots is (F_max - F_min )/2 because the dip is F_avg - F_min = (F_max + F_min)/2 - F_min = (F_max - F_min )/2.

So the dip amplitude is (F_max - F_min )/2.

But (F_max - F_min )/2 = (6.48e14 -5.809e14 ) /2 = (6.71e13) /2 =3.355e13.

F0 is the flux without spots: which is when the entire star is at Teff.

F0 = (4π R^2 ) * σ Teff^4 / (4π d^2 )= (R^2 σ Teff^4 )/d^2.

So F0 = (6e3)^4 * σ R^2 /d^2 =1.296e15 (σ R^2 /d^2 )

So the dip amplitude as a fraction of F0 is:

(3.355e13 ) / (1.296e15 )= 0.02586, or ~2.586%.

Wait, but that's a much smaller amplitude.

Wait, this is conflicting with earlier calculations.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the fluxes.

Let me re-approach this.

The star's flux when unspotted is F0 = (4π R^2) * σ Teff^4 / (4π d^2 )= (R^2 σ Teff^4 ) / d^2.

When the star is spotted, the flux varies between F_min and F_max, where:

F_min = [ (2π R^2 - A_spots ) * Teff^4 + A_spots * T_spot^4 ] * σ / (4π d^2 )

F_max = [ 2π R^2 * Teff^4 ] * σ / (4π d^2 )

But A_spots is the area of the spots on the hemisphere, which is f * (2π R^2 ), with f=0.2.

So A_spots =0.2 * 2π R^2 =0.4 π R^2.

So F_min = [ (2π R^2 -0.4 π R^2 ) * Teff^4 + 0.4 π R^2 * T_spot^4 ] * σ / (4π d^2 )

Simplify:

= [ 1.6 π R^2 * Teff^4 +0.4 π R^2 * T_spot^4 ] * σ / (4π d^2 )

= [ π R^2 (1.6 Teff^4 +0.4 T_spot^4 ) ] * σ / (4π d^2 )

= R^2 σ / (4 d^2 ) * (1.6 Teff^4 +0.4 T_spot^4 )

Similarly, F_max = [ 2π R^2 Teff^4 ] * σ / (4π d^2 )= R^2 σ Teff^4 / (2 d^2 )

So F_max = (Teff^4 R^2 σ )/(2 d^2 )

F_min = [ (1.6 Teff^4 +0.4 T_spot^4 ) * R^2 σ ] / (4 d^2 )

Compute the numbers:

Teff=6000, T_spot=5000.

Compute 1.6 *6000^4 =1.6 *1.296e15=2.0736e15.

0.4 *5000^4=0.4 *6.25e14=2.5e14.

Sum is 2.0736e15 +0.25e15=2.3236e15.

F_min = (2.3236e15 ) * R^2 σ / (4 d^2 )=5.809e14 * (R^2 σ/d^2 )

F_max= 1.296e15 * (R^2 σ/d^2 ) / 2=6.48e14 * (R^2 σ/d^2 )

So F_avg_spots = (6.48e14 +5.809e14 )/2 =6.1445e14 (R²σ/d² )

Amplitude due to spots is (F_max - F_min )/2 = (6.48e14 -5.809e14 )/2 =6.71e13/2=3.355e13 (R²σ/d² )

F0 =1.296e15 (R²σ/d² )

So the dip amplitude from spots is 3.355e13 / F0 = 3.355e13 /1.296e15 ≈0.02587, or ~2.587%.

Wait, but the planet's dip is (R_planet^2/R_star^2 )= (R_planet /R_star )^2.

So for the amplitudes to be equal, (R_planet / R_star )^2 = 0.02587 → R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.02587 )≈0.1608, which is ~0.16.

But none of the options are around 0.16. The options are A:0.39, B:0.07, C:0.11, D:0.32.

Hmm, that suggests I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation isn't due to the dip but the peak-to-peak amplitude. Let me think differently.

The star's brightness varies between F_min and F_max.

The amplitude is (F_max - F_min )/2.

The planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_planet^2 / R_star^2 ) * F0.

Wait, but when the star is unspotted, F0 is higher than F_avg_spots.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the average fluxes.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed variation from the spots is being compared to a planet's variation in the same star (unspotted).

So the star's brightness without spots is F0 =1.296e15 (R²σ/d² )

The brightness variation due to spots is between F_min and F_max.

The amplitude is (F_max - F_min )/2 =3.355e13 (R²σ/d² )

This amplitude is the same as the dip caused by a planet, which is (R_planet^2 / R_star^2 ) * F0.

So set 3.355e13 = (R_planet^2 / R_star^2 ) * 1.296e15.

Solve for R_planet^2 / R_star^2 =3.355e13 /1.296e15 ≈2.587e-2.

So R_planet/R_star = sqrt(0.02587 )≈0.1608, which is ~0.16.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Alternative approach: calculate the relative change in flux when the spots rotate into view. The brightness variation is due to the spots, and the same variation would be caused by a planet.

The relative change in flux (ΔF/F) when the spots are visible is:

( F_unspotted - F_spotted ) / F_unspotted.

Wait, no. When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted_hemi. The unspotted flux is F_unspotted_hemi.

The average flux without any spots is F0 = F_unspotted_hemi.

Wait, perhaps the average flux with spots is (F_unspotted_hemi + F_spotted_hemi )/2.

But when the star is rotating, the flux oscillates between these two.

So the amplitude of the variation is (F_unspotted_hemi - F_spotted_hemi )/2, which is the peak-to-peak variation divided by two.

The planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_planet^2/R_star^2 ) * F0.

So, setting the amplitude of the spot variation equal to the planet dip:

(F_unspotted_hemi - F_spotted_hemi )/2 = (R_planet^2/R_star^2 ) * F0.

Let me compute F_unspotted_hemi and F_spotted_hemi.

F_unspotted_hemi is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible:

F_unspotted_hemi = (2π R^2) * σ Teff^4 / (4π d^2 ) = (2 R^2 σ Teff^4 )/(4 d^2 ) = (R^2 σ Teff^4 )/(2 d^2 )

F_spotted_hemi when the spotted hemisphere is visible:

F_spotted_hemi = [ (2π R^2 - A_spots ) * σ Teff^4 + A_spots σ T_spot^4 ]/(4π d^2 )

A_spots is f * 2π R^2, f=0.2 → A_spots=0.4 π R^2.

So F_spotted_hemi = [ (2π R^2 -0.4 π R^2 ) * σ Teff^4 +0.4 π R^2 σ T_spot^4 ]/(4π d^2 )

= [ (1.6 π R^2 σ Teff^4 ) + (0.4 π R^2 σ T_spot^4 ) ]/(4π d^2 )

= [ π R^2 σ (1.6 Teff^4 +0.4 T_spot^4 ) ]/(4 π d^2 )

= [ R^2 σ (1.6 Teff^4 +0.4 T_spot^4 ) ]/(4 d^2 )

Compute the values:

Teff =6000, T_spot=5000.

1.6 *6000^4 =1.6 *1.296e15=2.0736e15.

0.4 *5000^4=0.4 *6.25e14=2.5e14.

Sum: 2.0736e15 +2.5e14=2.3236e15.

So F_spotted_hemi = ( R^2 σ 2.3236e15 )/(4 d^2 )=5.809e14 (R²σ/d² )

F_unspotted_hemi = (R^2 σ (6e3)^4 )/(2 d^2 )= (1.296e15 R² σ )/(2 d^2 )=6.48e14 (R²σ/d² )

So the amplitude is (6.48e14 -5.809e14 )/2 =6.71e13/2=3.355e13 (R²σ/d² )

The planet's dip is (R_planet^2/R_star^2 ) * F0.

F0 is when the star is unspotted, so F0=F_unspotted_hemi=6.48e14 (R²σ/d² )

So planet dip: (R_p^2/R_s^2 ) *6.48e14.

Set equal to amplitude:3.355e13 (R²σ/d² ) = (R_p^2/R_s^2 ) *6.48e14 (R²σ/d² )

Cancel R²σ/d² from both sides: 3.355e13 = (R_p^2/R_s^2 ) *6.48e14.

R_p^2/R_s^2 =3.355e13 /6.48e14 ≈0.0518.

R_p/R_s =sqrt(0.0518 )≈0.2276, ~0.23.

But none of the options are close to 0.23. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternative approach: perhaps the question is considering the peak-to-peak variation as the same as the planet-induced dip.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently.

The brightness variation due to spots is a dip when the spots are visible, and a rise when the unspotted hemisphere is visible.

But the planet's effect is a dip when it transits, but no corresponding rise because it's only a dip.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the maximum dip compared to the average.

So the dip when spots are visible is F_avg - F_spotted_hemi.

F_avg = (F_unspotted_hemi + F_spotted_hemi )/2 = (6.48e14 +5.809e14 )/2 =6.1445e14.

So dip is 6.1445e14 -5.809e14 =3.356e13.

This dip is the same as the planet's dip, which is (R_p^2/R_s^2 ) * F0.

F0 =6.48e14.

So 3.356e13 = (R_p^2/R_s^2 ) *6.48e14 → R_p^2/R_s^2 =3.356e13 /6.48e14 ≈5.18e-2 → R_p/R_s≈0.2276.

Still, approximately 0.23. No option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the question is asking for the same amplitude as the spot's contribution to the light curve would be if it were a planet. Maybe the spot's contribution is a dip of 20% of the star's surface, but at a lower brightness.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. The assumption is that the total change in flux is due to the area of the spots, and the same would be caused by a planet.

So the area of the spots is 20% of the star's surface, so the dip would be 20% of the star's flux.

But that's not correct because spots are cooler, not black. So their contribution is less than the unspotted areas.

But if the problem assumes that the spots are completely dark (T=0, which is not the case), then the dip would be 20% of the star's flux. But starspots are not black; they emit at a lower temperature.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies things. Let me think.

The question says that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the observed light curve from the star with spots (modulated by rotation) would have a dip in brightness similar to a planet transit.

The amplitude of the dip due to the planet would be (R_p/R_s )^2. The dip due to spots would be the area of the spots times the difference in brightness per spot.

Wait, perhaps the dip is the area of the spots times (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

So the total dip is A_spots * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) / A_total.

Where A_spots is 0.2 *A_total.

Wait, perhaps:

Amplitude = (f * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) )

Where f is the filling factor.

So f =0.2.

T_spot= Teff -1000=5000 K.

Compute 1 - (5000^4 /6000^4 )=1 - (6.25e14 /1.296e15 )=1 - (6.25/12.96 )=1 -0.48225≈0.51775.

So amplitude =0.2 *0.51775=0.10355.

So the amplitude is ~10.355%.

So (R_p/R_s )^2=0.10355 → R_p/R_s≈sqrt(0.10355 )≈0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, option D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the brightness variation caused by the star's dark spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - Spots cover **20%** of one hemisphere (\( f = 0.2 \)).
   - Temperature of spots: \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's brightness varies due to the rotational modulation of the spotted hemisphere.
   - The amplitude of this variation is determined by the difference in flux between the unspotted and spotted hemispheres.

3. **Comparison to Exoplanet Transit**:
   - A planet transiting the star blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \).
   - The goal is to find the planet radius \( R_{\text{planet}} \) such that the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the planet equals that caused by the spots.

---

### Analysis:
1. **Flux from the Star**:
   - The total flux from the star without spots is:
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotted}} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 / (4 \pi d^2) = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 R_{\text{star}}^2 / d^2.
     \]
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The flux from the spotted hemisphere is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = \frac{1}{4 \pi d^2} \left[ (1 - f) \cdot \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 + f \cdot \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \right].
     \]

2. **Amplitude of Brightness Variation**:
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is the difference between the flux from the unspotted and spotted hemispheres:
     \[
     \Delta F = F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}.
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for \( F_{\text{unspotted}} \) and \( F_{\text{spotted}} \), the amplitude simplifies to:
     \[
     \Delta F = \sigma R_{\text{star}}^2 / d^2 \cdot \left[ T_{\text{eff}}^4 - f \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4 - (1 - f) \cdot T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right].
     \]

3. **Fractional Brightness Variation**:
   - The fractional change in brightness is:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_{\text{unspotted}} = 1 - f \cdot \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4}.
     \]
   - Substituting \( f = 0.2 \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \Delta F / F_{\text{unspotted}} = 1 - 0.2 \cdot \frac{5000^4}{6000^4}.
     \]
   - Compute \( 5000^4 / 6000^4 \):
     \[
     \frac{5000^4}{6000^4} = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = 0.48225.
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_{\text{unspotted}} = 1 - 0.2 \cdot 0.48225 = 1 - 0.09645 = 0.90355.
     \]

4. **Exoplanet Transit Amplitude**:
   - The fractional brightness variation caused by a planet is:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
     \]
   - Setting this equal to the spot-induced amplitude (\( \Delta F / F_{\text{unspotted}} = 0.90355 \)):
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.90355.
     \]
   - Solve for \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} = \sqrt{0.90355} \approx 0.95.
     \]

---

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately **0.32**. This matches option **D**.

ANSWER: D
