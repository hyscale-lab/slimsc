Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should prioritize observing that one.

Wait, transiting probability. Oh right, the probability that a planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of its star from our point of view. So a higher probability means it's more likely to transit, making it easier to detect.

The two planets are Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which probably doesn't matter here since we're talking about transit probability. They have circular orbits, so eccentricity isn't a factor.

Let me jot down the given info:

- Planet_1's period is 3 times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3.

Wait, no. Correction: the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter. Oh, so if Planet_2's period is, say, 30 days, Planet_1's is 10 days. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right?

Both stars have the same radius. Interesting. But their masses are different. The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. So M1 = 2*M2.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is influenced by the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. Specifically, the formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis (since it's circular, just a). But wait, maybe more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, the transit probability is given by (R*/a) * (1 / (1 + (M_planet/M_star)^(1/3)) )? Wait, no, that's the condition for a planet to be in a transiting orbit, but the probability is different. I think the probability is actually (R*/a) * (1/(1 + (M_p/M*)^(1/3)) )? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait. The probability of a randomly oriented orbit causing a transit is approximately (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital radius. Because the planet's orbit must be edge-on, and the probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's size to the planet's orbital distance. So when the planet is closer (smaller a), the probability increases.

But wait, another way to think about it: the transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the star's diameter (the size of the region where the transit would occur) to the planet's orbital distance. So P_transit â‰ˆ (R* / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

So to compute P_transit for each planet, I need to find R*/a for each.

But wait, the problem says that both host stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2 = R.

So, for P_transit, we can compute (R/a) for each planet.

Now, a is the semi-major axis. But how do we find a in terms
