Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs, ESPRESSO and HIRES. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me a list of five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different characteristics. I need to figure out which of them can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. The key here is understanding the brightness requirements of each spectrograph.

From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, any star that's V mag ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, for HIRES, the V mag should be ≤16.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Let me think. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, no. Wait, is it brighter than 17, meaning magnitude less than 17? Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. Oh right, yes. So, a star with V magnitude of 17 is brighter than 17, so it can be observed. Wait, no. Wait, the magnitude scale is a bit tricky. The lower the magnitude, the brighter the object. So, when the question says "brighter than 17 mag", that means apparent V magnitude less than 17. Because, for example, a magnitude of 16 is brighter than 17.

So, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag ≤17. HIRES can observe stars with V mag ≤16. So a star must have V mag ≤16 to be detected by both, because HIRES can't see beyond 16, whereas ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So for a star to be detected by both, it's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16.

Wait, but looking at the stars, some of them have absolute magnitudes, and some have apparent, and some have other factors like extinction (E(B-V)). So I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star that doesn't have it provided.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1: RA=15, DEC=-75, absolute V=15.5 mag, distance=10 pc. So, absolute magnitude is Mv=15.5. Apparent magnitude (mv) can be calculated using the distance modulus: mv = Mv + 5 log10 (d / 10), where d is distance in parsecs.

So for Star1, d=10 pc, so log(10/10)=log(1)=0. So mv = 15.5 + 0 =15.5. So apparent V is 15.5 mag. Since 15.5 is less than 17 and less than 16, so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it? Wait, but let me think. Wait, no: HIRES can only go down to 16. So Star1's mv is 15.5 <
