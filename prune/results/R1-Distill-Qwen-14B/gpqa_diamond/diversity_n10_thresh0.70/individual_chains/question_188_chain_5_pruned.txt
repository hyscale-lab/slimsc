Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystal structures, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along one lattice parameter, right? Oh wait, no, in a crystal, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter if it's a simple cubic structure. But rhombohedral is a bit different.

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal but with angles that aren't 90 degrees. Oh right, so it's like a cube that's been squeezed along the diagonals. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees here. So each of the angles between the edges is 30 degrees.

The problem is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ), but wait, wait. Another formula I'm recalling is d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + (h k + h l + k l) * (cos θ) ), but I'm not exactly sure. Or was it modified for non-orthogonal systems?

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + (h k + h l + k l)(cos γ) ) ), but wait, no, because in a general rhombohedral system, the formula might be more involved. Oh wait, maybe I should think in terms of the unit cell vectors.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula d = (a)/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(h k cos α + h l cos β + k l cos γ) ) ), where a is the lattice parameter, and h, k, l are the Miller indices. Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, alpha = beta = gamma. So maybe that simplifies things.
