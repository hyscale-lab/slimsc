Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the correct answer is. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubit space. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states.

Wait, what's a density matrix again? I think it's a way to represent the statistical state of a system, especially when it's in a mixed state, which means it's a statistical mixture of different pure states. For a pure state, the density matrix is just the outer product of the state vector with itself. But for a mixed state, it's more complicated.

Looking at the given ρ, it's (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I think this is a diagonal matrix because |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthogonal basis states. Let me write it out in matrix form. The standard basis for a qubit is |0⟩ = [1, 0]^T and |1⟩ = [0, 1]^T. So |0⟩⟨0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 in the bottom-right corner. Adding these two gives a matrix with 1's on the diagonal and 0's off-diagonal. Then multiplying by 1/2, we get ρ as [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

Wait, but how does this relate to the Bloch sphere representation? I remember that single qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. For a density matrix, the state is a point in this space. For a pure state, it's on the surface of the sphere, and for a mixed state, it's inside.

The general form of a qubit density matrix is:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where I is the identity matrix, r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z), and σ are the Pauli matrices. When you expand this, the diagonal elements are (1 + r_z)/2 and (1 - r_z)/2. The off-diagonal elements are (r_x - i r_y)/2 and (r_x + i r_y)/2.

But wait, in our case, the given ρ is diagonal with both diagonal entries equal to 1/2. So let's compare it to the general form. The diagonal elements must be (1 + r_z)/2 and (1 - r_z)/2. But in our ρ, both are 1/2. So setting them equal:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Similarly, (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 → same result. So r_z must be zero.

What about the other components, r_x and r_y? The off-diagonal elements of ρ are zero. Looking at the general form, the off-diagonal (top
