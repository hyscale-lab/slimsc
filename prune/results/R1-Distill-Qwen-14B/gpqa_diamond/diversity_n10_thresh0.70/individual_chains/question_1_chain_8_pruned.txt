Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The task is to find out what their energy difference should be so that we can clearly distinguish between the two energy levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically, the energy-time uncertainty relation. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to Planck's constant over 2π. Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but I think for this purpose, it's the order of magnitude that matters.

So the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. But wait, the energy-time uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So if I have a certain uncertainty in time, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional. But in this case, the lifetimes of the states are given. So the lifetimes would relate to the uncertainty in time, right? Because the lifetime is the time during which the system is in that state, and the uncertainty in energy would be the minimum resolution needed to distinguish the two states.

Wait, so the problem is about being able to clearly distinguish two energy levels. That means the energy difference between them must be greater than the uncertainty in energy. Otherwise, the two states might appear the same due to the uncertainty.

So each state has its own lifetime. Which one do I use? The lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. Oh, wait, I think the lifetime relates to the uncertainty in energy for each state. But wait, no, the energy difference depends on the uncertainty in the measurement. So perhaps the key is to find the uncertainty in energy for each state due to their lifetimes, and then find the energy difference that's larger than that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. I think the approach is that for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ħ/(2Δt). Because the lifetime is Δt, which is the time over which the system is in the state, so the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, but if the two states have different lifetimes, does that affect how we calculate the required energy difference? Or is it about the minimum required ΔE
