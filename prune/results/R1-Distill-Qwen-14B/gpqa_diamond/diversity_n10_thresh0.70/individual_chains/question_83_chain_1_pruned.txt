Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with titration and pH calculations. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. What's the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, the concentration decreases, which should affect the pH. Then, when you titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will neutralize the acid. At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acid has been neutralized, and at equivalence, all of it has been neutralized.

First, let me think about the initial dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration of acetic acid after dilution would be half, right? Because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when moles are constant.

Wait, moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so the new concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, during titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.025 mol (wait no, wait: wait, wait, the initial moles were 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then after dilution, same moles, so 0.001 mol in 0.04 L, which is 0.025 M). So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume needed is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 25% of the equivalence point. So if the equivalence is 10 cm³, then 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So at that point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added, which is a quarter of the total needed.

So, let's break it down into two parts: the pH at 25% titration and the pH at the equivalence point.

First, the 25% point.

At 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Let's calculate the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid.

So, initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol. Moles reacted: 0.0002
