Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with coordination complexes and stability constants. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The concentrations given are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. They’re asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it requires more ligand to form. So each β corresponds to a different complex, probably with different numbers of SCN- ligands.

Wait, the complexes... I think they are Co(SCN)_n^2+n. So β1 would be for the monomeric complex, β2 for the next, and so on. But wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So maybe the complexes are Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, and Co(SCN)4? Or wait, maybe the numbering is different? I think each β is for the nth complex, so β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)₃]^- , and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2-? Because each time you add a SCN⁻, the charge changes.

But wait, in any case, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is the hexaaquapink cobalt or... Wait, no. Wait, cobalt complexes can have different colors. For example, [Co(SCN)6]^3- is usually a blue color, I believe. Or was it [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, the question says 'dithiocyanato' which is two SCN- ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, I think
