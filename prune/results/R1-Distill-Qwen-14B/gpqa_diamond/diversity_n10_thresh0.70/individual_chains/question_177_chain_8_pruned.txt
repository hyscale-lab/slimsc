Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. Star 1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star 2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star 1 is greater than Star 2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Wait, but in this problem, the stars have the same wavelength of maximum brightness. Oh right, that's from blackbody radiation. The wavelength where a blackbody emits most strongly is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same, right? Because λ1 = b/T1 and λ2 = b/T2. If λ1=λ2, then T1 must equal T2.

Wait, but wait! Because radial velocity comes into play here. Oh, wait no, the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the problem says that the stars' spectra show the same λ_max. So that would imply same temperature, but wait, considering Doppler shift due to radial velocity? Oh, maybe I'm missing that part.

Wait, let's think. The star emits at a certain wavelength, but if it's moving towards or away from us (radial velocity), that would cause a Doppler shift in the observed wavelength. So the actual emission maximum is different from the observed maximum.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same. So the Doppler effect would affect the observed λ. But for the calculation of temperature, we might need to correct for that.

Let me break it down:

Star 1's observed λ_max is equal to Star 2's observed λ_max.

But the stars themselves have different velocities. Star 1 has radial velocity 0, so its observed λ is the same as its emitted λ. Star 2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Hmm, but wait, which direction? Because if it's moving towards us, the observed λ would be shorter (blue shift), and if moving away, longer (red shift).

Wait, the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star 1 and Star 2 respectively. So Star 1 is stationary, and Star 2 is moving away at 700 km/s, because radial velocity positive here would mean moving away (assuming the convention that positive radial velocity is moving away from us, but I'm not 100% sure, but let's proceed with that assumption).

Wait, actually, the sign depends on the convention. But for the purpose of calculating the Doppler shift, the sign matters. Let me think.

So, let me model this. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, I think it's λ_obs = λ_emitted * ( (1 + v_r / c) / sqrt(1 - (v_r^2/c^2)) )) or something like that. Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic Doppler shift formula.

Wait, the relativistic Doppler effect formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) 

Wait, no, I think the non-relativistic approximation is more appropriate here, because 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me check. The speed of light is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 km/s is about 0.23% of the speed of light. Hmm, that's small, so maybe the non-relativistic approximation is okay. But given that, let's think.

Wait, the Doppler formula in non-relativistic terms can be approximated as:

λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c )

But wait, when the source is moving away, v_r is positive, so λ_obs is longer than λ_emitted. That would be a redshift.

Alternatively, the exact formula for Doppler shift when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. And the redshift z is approximately v_r / c for small velocities. So, for Star 2, moving away at 700 km/s, its observed wavelength would be longer than its emitted wavelength.

But wait, both stars have the same observed λ_max. So Star 1's emitted λ_max is λ1_emit, and Star 2's emitted λ_max is λ2_emit. The observed λ_max for Star 1 is λ1_emit, because v_r is 0. The observed λ_max for Star 2 is λ2_emit * (1 + v_r / c).

Since the observed λ_max are the same, we have:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r / c )

But from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ1_emit = b / T1, and λ2_emit = b / T2.

So substituting, we get:

b
