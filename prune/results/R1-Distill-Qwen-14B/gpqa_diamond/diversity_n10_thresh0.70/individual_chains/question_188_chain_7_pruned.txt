Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the unit cell parameters. The crystal is rhombohedral, right? So all the edges are equal, and all the angles are the same. The given angles are all 30 degrees, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a? Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the edge length a, but in a rhombohedral structure, I think it's the same. So a is 10 Angstroms.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by the reciprocal of the square root of (h² + k² + l²) times some terms involving the cosine of the angles. The formula when the lattice is not cubic is a bit more complicated.

Wait, the general formula for d_hkl in a rhombohedral system is d = (a)/(√(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cosθ)), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. But wait, no, wait. I might be mixing it with another formula. Alternatively, I think the formula is d² = (a² (h² + k² + l² + 2hk cosγ + 2hl cosβ + 2kl cosα)) )^{-1}.

Wait, no, let me think again. Oh right, the general formula is:

d_{hkl}^2 = (a^2)/(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ)

But wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, all angles are equal, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees. So the formula simplifies a bit. So for (111) plane, h, k, l are all 1.

So plugging in h=1, k=1, l=1, and each cos of the angles is cos(30°), which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So let's compute the denominator.

Denominator = 1^2 +1^2 +1^2 + 2*(1*1)*cos30 + 2*(1*1
