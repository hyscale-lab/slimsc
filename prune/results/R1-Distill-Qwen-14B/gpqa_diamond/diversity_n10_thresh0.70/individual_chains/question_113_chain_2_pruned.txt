Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. I've prepared an unknown compound and used FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry to identify it. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to pick the right one based on the given data.

Alright, let's break down each piece of data one by one.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak around 2500-3300 cm^-1. Alternatively, alcohols also have O-H, but sometimes those can be broader. So maybe the compound has an -OH group. But wait, the FTIR also shows two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1.

Hmm, what's that about. I know that a peak around 1700 is often a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution. Let me think. For example, conjugated carbonyls might have lower wavenumbers. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents. Wait, another possibility: if there's a carbonyl and another group, like an ester, which has two carbonyls maybe? No, wait, esters have one carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, but what about a conjugated system? The 1650 might be an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching around 1600), but that's more like 1450-1600 typically. Wait, but if there's a carbonyl nearby, maybe the C=C in the ring is at a higher wavenumber. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Oh right, those can have lower wavenumbers than regular carbonyls. Wait, no, I think that the conjugated system might lower the wavenumber. So if the carbonyl is at 1700, maybe the 1650 is something else. Or perhaps the 1650 is a C=C stretching from a double bond, like a vinyl group. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR part says that there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl groups are CH2=CH- or similar, so that suggests the presence of a double bond, like in an alkene. So the molecule has a double bond. So maybe the 1650 is from the C=C in the vinyl group. But wait, usually alkenes have C=C around 1640-1680 cm^-1. So 1650 would fit that. So maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 is an alkene.

So putting that together, the molecule has both a carbonyl group (like ketone, ester, acid) and an alkene (vinyl group). Also, the broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 is probably an O-H group. So if the molecule has an O-H, then maybe it's an acid or an alcohol. But which one?

Wait, let's think about the possible formulas. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each to see if that helps.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or N here.

Option A: C6H12O2. C=6, H=1
