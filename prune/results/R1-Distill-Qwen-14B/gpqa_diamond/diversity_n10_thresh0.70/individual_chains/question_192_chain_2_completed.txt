Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this physics problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's smaller than R. Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and it's l distance from the center of the cavity. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember that when charges are inside a conductor, the conductor's charges rearrange. But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So when we add a charge +q inside the cavity, what happens?

I think that for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor material (the bulk) is zero. Also, the charges on the conductor's surfaces will adjust accordingly. But in this case, the conductor is neutral, so any induced charges must balance the added charge.

Wait, the cavity is not at the center, so the setup is asymmetric. That's interesting. In the case where the cavity is centered, the induced charges would be symmetric, but here since the charge is off-center, the induced charges would cause some dipole or other fields.

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor. What determines the electric field outside a conductor? Oh right, for a conductor, the electric field outside is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. But wait, does that apply here?

Wait, the conductor is uncharged. So the only charges are the induced charges on its inner and outer surfaces. The charge inside the cavity is +q. Since the conductor is neutral, the total induced charge must be -q. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, the sum of the inner and outer surface charges must be zero. Wait, no. The conductor was initially neutral, so when +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor must have an induced charge of -q. But where?

I think that the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) must have an induced charge of -q, because the charge +q inside the cavity induces -q on the inner surface. Then, the outer surface would have a charge of +q to balance, because the conductor as a whole is neutral. Wait no, the conductor was neutral. So the total induced charge on the conductor is zero. Wait, initial conductor is uncharged. Then, when +q is added inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, the outer surface must have +q to make the total charge of the conductor remain neutral (since conductor is initially neutral). Wait, no, no. Wait, the conductor itself is neutral, so the total charge on it is zero. The cavity has +q. So the inner surface (cavity wall) must have -q to cancel the field within the conductor material. Then, the outer surface must have +q to balance. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, inner surface is -q, so outer is +q. Because -q (inner) + outer = 0 → outer is +q.

Wait, but that's for a cavity centered inside the conductor. In this problem, the cavity is not centered. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the induced charges might not be symmetrically distributed. But when considering the external electric field, is that affected by the position of the cavity?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The conductor's outer surface must have a charge of +q (because inner is -q, conductor is neutral, so outer is +q). Now, the question is about the electric field outside the conductor at point P.

Wait, the outer surface charge is +q. So the electric field outside depends on the distribution of that charge. If the conductor were a perfect sphere, the outer surface would be uniformly charged, and the electric field outside would be as if all the charge were at the center, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²).

But in this case, the outer surface's charge distribution is not uniform because the cavity is off-center. Does this affect the external field?

Wait, I remember that for a conductor with a cavity, the external field only depends on the net charge on the outer surface, regardless of the distribution of the inner charges. Because the external field is due to the outer charges, and if the conductor is neutral, the outer charges would arrange to produce an external field that's the same as if the charge were concentrated at the center.

Wait, but in this problem, the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the external field should be the same as that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. Because the conductor shields the internal charges, except for the charges on the outer surface.

Wait, but the point P is outside, so the electric field at P would be as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B is that. Option B says E = (1/(4πεo)) q/(L²).

Wait, but the other options have more complicated expressions. Like option A has (l - s cosθ) squared in the denominator, which suggests perhaps treating the outer charge as a point at some offset. But I thought the outer charge would be considered as a point at the center.

But wait, why would the outer surface's charge be a point at the center? Because in the case where the cavity is not centered, the outer surface might not be symmetric. Would that change the external field?

Wait, no. Wait, the external field only depends on the total charge on the outer surface, regardless of where the inner charge is. Because the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the charge on the outer surface, and the distribution may vary but the monopole term (the leading term) is the same as if all the charge were at the center.

Wait, but if the outer surface charge is not uniformly distributed, perhaps the higher multipole terms are significant. But for points far away, the monopole term dominates. But in this question, point P is at a distance L from the center, which is larger than R, but the position depends on l and the angle. Hmm.

Wait, but the setup is such that the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So regardless of how it's arranged, the monopole term would give E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²). Because the electric field outside a charged conductor is due to the monopole, dipole, and higher moments, but the dipole term and beyond would only contribute if the charge distribution is non-symmetric. But for a conductor, the outer surface charge distribution is such that it cancels the internal field. So, if the inner charge is off-center, the outer surface charge would have a dipole distribution perhaps. But wait, does that affect the external field at a point outside?

Wait, perhaps in this specific case, the external field is purely due to the monopole term since the conductor's outer surface has a net charge +q. Because the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the conductor is neutral, the outer must have +q. So the external field would be as if a point charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but wait, the cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the charge inside the cavity is at a point s away from the conductor's center. The inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) will have an induced charge of -q, but perhaps distributed in such a way that the conductor's material remains neutral. But the outer surface's charge is +q, but where is it located?

Wait, maybe the outer surface's charge isn't at the center because the inner charge distribution is asymmetric. But for the external field, the dipole terms and beyond would matter, but for a point outside, the monopole term is the dominant one.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck, perhaps I should think about the method of images or the shell theorem.

Wait, the shell theorem says that a spherical shell of charge behaves as if all the charge is at the center. So for a conductor with a shell of charge Q, the electric field outside is (1/(4πε₀)) Q/(r²), regardless of the distribution of Q on the shell (as long as it's a spherical shell). But in this problem, the outer surface isn't a spherical shell with uniform charge because the inner charge is off-center. So the outer surface's charge distribution is non-uniform.

But wait, the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface must be a spherical shell. Wait, no. If the cavity is not centered, but the conductor is a sphere, then the inner wall is a sphere, but the outer wall is also a sphere because the conductor is spherical. So the outer surface is a spherical shell.

But the charge on the outer shell would be uniformly distributed only if the charge inside is symmetrically placed. Since the cavity is shifted, the charge on the inner surface is not uniform. But the outer surface is a spherical shell, so the charge on it must be uniform because it's a conducting sphere. Wait no, because the inner surface is a sphere, but the charge on it is non-uniform due to the off-center charge. But the outer surface is a spherical shell, so the charge on the outer surface would be uniformly distributed because the conductor is a sphere.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try again. The conductor is a sphere, radius R. The cavity is a sphere of radius r, center at distance s from the conductor's center. A charge +q is placed inside the cavity. So, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) must have a charge of -q, because the conductor's material must have no internal field. But since the cavity is off-center, the charge distribution on the inner surface won't be uniform. However, the outer surface of the conductor is a spherical shell, right? Because the conductor itself is a sphere. So despite the inner surface being non-uniform, the outer surface must have a uniform distribution of +q to make the conductor neutral overall.

Wait, no. The conductor's total charge is zero. The inner surface has -q, so the outer must have +q. But if the inner surface is non-uniform, does that cause the outer surface to be non-uniform? I thought that for a conducting shell, if the inner charge is asymmetric, the outer surface remains symmetric because the shell as a whole is spherical.

Wait, I think that's correct. So the outer surface of the conductor is a spherical shell, and the charge on it would distribute uniformly because the conductor is a sphere. So the outer surface charge is uniformly distributed, hence the electric field outside would be the same as a point charge at the center.

So, the electric field at point P, which is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

Looking back at the options, option B is that.

But wait, let me double-check the setup. The point P is a distance l from the cavity's center, and the angle between l and s is theta. Wait, but if the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed on a sphere of radius R, then the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center, regardless of where point P is located relative to the cavity's center.

So regardless of the position or the angle theta, the field at P would only depend on the distance L from the conductor's center and the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the $-q$ on the inner surface.

The electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge on its outer surface, regardless of the distribution of the inner charges. For a spherical conductor, the outer surface charge is uniformly distributed due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor. Thus, the electric field outside the conductor at a point $P$ is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

The magnitude of the electric field at point $P$ is therefore given by:

\[
E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \dfrac{q}{L^2}
\]

This matches option **B**. The other options are incorrect because they involve more complex expressions that do not account for the fact that the outer surface charge of a spherical conductor distributes uniformly, making the external field depend only on the total charge and the distance from the center.

Answer: B
