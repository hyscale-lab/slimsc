Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's the structure here? I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form.

Cobalt can form different complexes with thiocyanate. The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^m+. So, the possible species are Co²+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^−, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, right? Because each SCN- is monodentate, each adds one to the charge and one to the coordination number.

Wait, the stability constants: β1 is the constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, and so on. So, the formation steps are:

Co²+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1 = [ [CoSCN^+] ] / ( [Co²+][SCN-] )
Then, [CoSCN^+] + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2 ] ] / ( [CoSCN^+][SCN-] )
And so on for the third and fourth steps.

But wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β represents the stepwise formation constant for each additional ligand.

Wait, but usually, the overall stability constant for a complex with n ligands is the product of the stepwise constants up to n. So, for [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, the overall β would be β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 = 9 *40*63*16. But wait, the question gives four βs, which probably correspond to the first four complexes.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, I think, because di- means two. So that's the second complex. So I need the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 compared to all the other cobalt species.

So, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species: [Co²+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^− + [Co(SCN)_4]^2− = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But perhaps it's easier to calculate the fraction of each species and then find the fraction
