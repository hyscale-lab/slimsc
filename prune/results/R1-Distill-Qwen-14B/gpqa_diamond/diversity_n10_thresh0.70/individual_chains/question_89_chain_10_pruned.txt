Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

The question starts with the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So, adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon with a pretty complex structure, but I remember it's a cage-like molecule. Dibromo means there are two bromine atoms attached.

Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. When dibromides react with a strong base, like KOH, it's likely an elimination reaction. But wait, in some cases, especially with vicinal dihalides, it's E2 elimination to form alkenes. Since adamantane is a diamondoid, maybe the bromines are on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form an alkene. But wait, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Hmm, are they vicinal? Like, are they on adjacent carbons? I'm not entirely sure about the structure. But if they are, then elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2, or 2 and 3? Maybe. Alternatively, it might form a cyclopropane if it's a 1,2-dihalide, but since it's 1,3, perhaps elimination isn't the main pathway.

Wait, another possibility: when a dihalide reacts with a strong base, sometimes if the two halogens are on the same carbon (like 1,1-dibromide), you get an epoxide via an SN2 mechanism, but that's not the case here. Wait, no, if it's 1,3-dibromo, maybe it's a dielimination. But wait, KOH can also lead to a substitution reaction. But substitution would typically need a good leaving group and a possible base. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. I think that hints towards an epoxide. Because epoxides are often formed when dihalides are treated with a strong base like KOH. Wait, if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and treated with KOH, perhaps it's an elimination reaction that forms an epoxide bridge. Because, for example, when 1,2-dibromoethane is treated with KOH, it forms ethylene. But in more complex structures, it can form epoxides.

Alternatively, let me think about the NMR spectrum. The product 1 has 1H NMR signals: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is usually a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but if product 1 is an epoxide, then where would the carbonyl come from? Oh, wait, maybe I got the product wrong. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone or ester.

Wait, another possibility: When a dihalide is treated with KOH, especially in a high-temperature condition, maybe it undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation to form a diene. But then, how does that lead to a carbonyl group? Hmm.

Alternatively, let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm is probably an oxygenated proton. Maybe an epoxide. Epoxide protons typically show up around 3.5-4.5 ppm, but it can vary. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol or an ether.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 indicates a carbonyl group. So maybe the product is a ketone or an ester. How would that form from a dihalide?

Oh, wait, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide. No, the starting material is a dihalide, not an epoxide. Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is the formation of an epoxide. Let me think. Ok, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH.

Wait,
