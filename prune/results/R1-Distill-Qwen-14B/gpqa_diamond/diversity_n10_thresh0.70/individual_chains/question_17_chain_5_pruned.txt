Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They've given the formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex as 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (K) tells us how stable the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

So the problem is essentially about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex is [CaEDTA]^2-, right? When it dissociates, it releases Ca²+ ions into the solution.

The formation constant K is given as 5x10^10. Wait, formation constant... I think that's the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ [CaEDTA]^2-, and K is 5e10.

But wait, when the complex dissociates, it will go the reverse direction. So the dissociation constant K_d would be 1/K. That makes sense because K for dissociation would be the inverse of the formation constant.

So, K_d = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote that as C. So [CaEDTA]^2- is 0.02 M.

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex will stay mostly the same because K is very large (so the complex is stable), but a tiny amount will dissociate. Let's let x be the concentration of calcium ions that dissociate.

So, the dissociation reaction is [CaEDTA]^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA]^2- = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small because K_d is so small)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

So, the expression for K_d is [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA]^2- = K_d.

Substituting the values:
(x)(x) / 0.02 = 2e-11.

So x² = (2e-11)*(0.02) = 4e-13.

Taking the square root of both sides: x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13, so square root is sqrt(4) = 2, sqrt(10^-13) is 1e-6.5, because 10^-13 is (1e-6.5)^2 because 6.5 * 2 =13.

Wait, 10^-6.5 is 3.16e-7, because 10^-7 is 1e-7, and 10^0.5 is about 3.16. So 10^-6.5 = 3.16e-7.

So sqrt(4e-13) is 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That matches.

Wait, let me double-check. The initial concentration is 0.02 M. The K is 5e10, which is very large, so the dissociation is minimal. So the approximation that [CaEDTA] is approximately 0.02 is valid.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is x, which is around 6.3e-7
