Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the starting compound X is. The given data includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. Then, it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in theHell-Volhard-Zelinskyl reaction, which is for the halogenation of carboxylic acids. But wait, if the starting material isn't a carboxylic acid, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction to produce an acid from another functional group.

Wait, let me think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are also used in the preparation of iodides from alcohols, maybe in the presence of a carboxylic acid group. Oh wait, another thought: the reaction of an acid chloride with H2O would give a carboxylic acid, but that's not using red phosphorus. Alternatively, maybe it's about the hydrolysis of an ester or nitrile? Not sure yet. Let me first analyze the data to figure out what compound X is.

Looking at the IR data: strong absorption between 3400â€“2500 cm-1 suggests O-H stretching, which could be from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is indicative of a carbonyl group. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound likely has an aromatic ring.

Now, the 1H NMR data. Let's list the peaks:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10, but more upfield, and a triplet or something else. But since it's broad, more like a carboxylic acid.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons. If this is a para-substituted benzene, the two protons would be as doublets, each integrating to 2H. So maybe a
