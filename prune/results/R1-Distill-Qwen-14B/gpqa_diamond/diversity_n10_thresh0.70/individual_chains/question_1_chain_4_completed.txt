Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question to tackle. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, each having different lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh right, so the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval is inversely related. 

But wait, how does that apply here? The lifetimes of the states are given. I think the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime of the state. Because a shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 seconds) would mean a larger uncertainty in energy. So, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), right?

So, each state has an uncertainty in its energy due to its lifetime. The energy difference between E1 and E2 would need to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be clearly resolved. Otherwise, the energy difference might be too small and the states would be hard to distinguish.

So let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. 

First, for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. 

Wait, but the answer is in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So converting ΔE1:
1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-7 eV. 

Hmm, that's 6.59e-7 eV. Approximately 7e-7 eV. 

Now for the second state, Δt2 =1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ / Δt2 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-8 s) = 1.055e-26 J. 

Converting to eV: 1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.59e-8 eV. 

So the uncertainty for E1 is about 7e-7 eV, and for E2 about 7e-8 eV. 

The energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of these uncertainties, right? Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, you can't clearly tell them apart. So ΔE should be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2) ≈ (7e-7 + 7e-8) eV ≈ 7.7e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 eV is way smaller than 7.7e-7 eV. Not enough.

B) 1e-11 eV → Even smaller. No good.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's much larger than 7.7e-7 eV. So this would work.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. Also smaller than 7.7e-7 eV. No.

So the only option that gives ΔE larger than the sum of uncertainties is option C, 1e-4 eV. So that's the answer.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) such that they can be clearly resolved, we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy uncertainty, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The energy uncertainty for each state is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate uncertainties for each state
For the first state with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_1} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_2} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Energy difference requirement
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 6.59 \times 10^{-7} + 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is much smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Final Answer
The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.

Answer: C
