Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. The method used is the radial velocity (RV) method, which I remember detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble.

The key data points are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I think the RV method relates the velocity of the star (caused by the planet's orbit) to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (1 / (2π)) )

Wait, maybe I should write it more accurately. I recall that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( (M_p / M_*) ) * (1 / sqrt(P)) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think there's a more precise formula.

Wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = ( ( (G * M_p^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 AU)^0.5 ) ) * (1 / ( (P/yr)^0.5 * (M_* + M_p) ) )

No, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the relation between the velocity amplitude and the orbital period.

Wait, the RV method relies on the star's velocity changing due to the planet's orbit. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( (G * P ) / (2π) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since the planet's
