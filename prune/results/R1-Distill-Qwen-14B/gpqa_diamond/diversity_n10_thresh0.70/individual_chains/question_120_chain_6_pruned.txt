Okay, so I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, let's start by recalling what parallax means. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance in terms of parallax is distance d = 1/plx, where plx is in parsecs.

Wait, so if a star has a parallax plx, its distance is 1/plx parsecs. Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit change in plx. I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the distribution of stars in the universe.

Assuming stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars (let's say n) is constant in space. So n is the same everywhere. Now, how do we relate this to the parallax?

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. If I think about a range of parallax values, say from plx to plx + dplx, what does that correspond to in terms of distance?

Parallax is small for distant stars. So a small change in plx (dplx) at a small value of plx (like nearby stars) would correspond to a larger change in distance. Wait, let me get this right. If dplx is a small change, then the corresponding change in distance dd is approximately - (dplx)/(plx^2), since d=1/plx, so dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2). So dd = - dplx/(
