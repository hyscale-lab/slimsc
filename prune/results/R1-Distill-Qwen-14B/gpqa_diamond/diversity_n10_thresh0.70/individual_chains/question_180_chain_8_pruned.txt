Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I guess we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A, B, C, D in scientific notation.

Wait, so the setup is that there's this point P where one charge is fixed, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. But wait, each of the 12 is at 2 m from P, so their positions are constrained there. But wait, how are they arranged? Are they all placed at the same point 2 meters away from P, or are they distributed around it? Oh, wait, the problem says they're each at 2 m from P. So each of these 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P. But that could mean they're all located at the same point 2 m away, but wait, that would mean they are very close to each other, but the problem says they are identical charges. So if they're all at the same point, the potential energy would be different than if they are spread out, but maybe in this scenario, the arrangement is such that each is at 2 m from P, but their mutual arrangement isn't specified. Hmm, but for the purpose of calculating potential energy, perhaps we can assume that the 12 charges are all at a fixed distance from P, and their positions relative to each other don't matter. Or maybe the problem is considering each pair between the fixed charge and the moving ones, but not the pairs among the moving ones.

Wait, potential energy in an electric system is calculated based on the interactions between each pair of charges. So the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair. So in this case, there are two kinds of pairs: between the fixed charge at P and each of the 12 charges, and between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but the question asks for the minimum energy of the system. So maybe I need to find the potential energy of the entire system. But wait, the potential energy for a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for each pair of charges, you calculate the potential energy and then add them all up.

So let's break it down. The fixed charge is at P, and each of the 12 is at 2 meters away from P. So the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 is the same. Let's compute that first.

Each particle has a charge of 2e. So the fixed charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is also 2e. The distance between each of them is 2 meters. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r.

So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy with the fixed charge is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m). Since there are 12 such interactions, the total potential energy from the fixed charge and the moving charges is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2). Let me compute that.

Wait, let me get the constants right. The Coulomb constant k is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². And e is the elementary charge, about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs.

So substituting the values, each interaction contributes (8.988e9) * (2e)^2 / 2 m.

Wait, (2e)^2 is 4e². So each U is (8.988e9 *
