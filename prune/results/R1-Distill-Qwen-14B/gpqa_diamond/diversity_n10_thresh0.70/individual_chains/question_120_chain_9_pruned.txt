Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power laws.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? I remember that parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/distance, which means as the parallax decreases, the distance increases.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Since stars are uniformly distributed, that should mean the same number of stars per volume in space, but how does that translate when we look at them in terms of parallax?

Let me think about the volume. In a universe where stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a given volume would be proportional to the volume. But when we observe them, their parallax depends on their distance from us.

So, for a given range of distances, how does the volume change? The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr would be 4πd² dr. But wait, since the parallax is 1/d, maybe I should express this in terms of parallax instead of distance.

Let me define plx p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. The volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4π (d)^2 dr. Let's substitute d in terms of p. Since d = 1/p, dr = - (1/p²) dp. Oh, negative because as p increases, d decreases. But since we're considering ranges, maybe I can ignore the sign and just work with absolute values.

So the volume for a change in p is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp. Wait, that's not right. Let's see: dr = - (1/p²) dp. So the volume in terms of p is 4π (1/p)^2 * (dr). Substituting dr, that becomes 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. Wait, that gives 4π (1/p^4) dp. Hmm, but that seems a bit off.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think about the number of stars per unit volume in space. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant, say n stars per cubic parsec.

So, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dr is n * 4π d² dr. Now, since each star's parallax p = 1/d, let's express this in terms of p.

d = 1/p, so dr = - (1/p²) dp. The volume in terms of p is 4π (1/p)^2 * (dr). Substituting dr, it becomes 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p² dp), but again, considering absolute values, it's 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp) = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, the number of stars in a shell is n * volume. So the number of stars per unit dp (change in parallax) would be proportional to (1/p^4) * dp. Since the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, the number is proportional to 1/p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be A. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, think about it in terms of distance. For a given parallax p, the distance is d=1/p. The volume of a sphere with radius d is (4/3) π d^3. The number of stars within that distance would be proportional to d^3. But that's cumulative, not per unit parallax.

Wait, no, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax (dp). So for a small change in p, how many stars are there. Alternatively, for a given p, the number of stars in a thin shell dp is proportional to
