--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta values) for the different cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D.

Hmm, stability constants. I remember that the stability constant (β) indicates how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it means the reaction goes more towards the complex formation.

Wait, but wait. The complexes here are Co(II) with thiocyanate. I think the complexes would be something like Co(SCN)_n, where n is the number of thiocyanate ligands. So the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-. Because each SCN- is -1 charge. So for Co^2+:

- For n=1: Co(SCN) → Co^2+ + SCN^− → complex charge is 2+ -1 = +1? Wait, no, wait. Each SCN- is -1. So each SCN contributes -1.

So the complexes would have charges:

n=1: Co(SCN) → Co^2+ + SCN^- → but wait, that would be [Co(SCN)]^+ → charge is 2+ + (-1) = +1. Yeah, because Co is +2, each SCN is -1. So one SCN makes the complex +1.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2] → charge is 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So neutral.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- → 2+ + 3*(-1) = -1.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2- → 2+ +4*(-1)= -2.

But the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So which complex corresponds to which β?

I think stability constant β is for the formation of the complex from the ions. The general formula is βn = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co^{2+}][SCN^-]^n).

Wait, so higher β means more stable complex. So the complexes form in the order of increasing n, but the β varies.

Wait, but looking at the β values given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the third complex has the highest β (β3=63), which is [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

The question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands. So that would be the n=2 complex, [Co(SCN)_2], which is neutral. So the stability constant β2 is 40.

Wait, but wait. The question specifies the blue dithiocyanato. I've heard that [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is the one that's blue. Or maybe another complex. Hmm. Wait, the color can depend on the number of ligands. For example, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue, and [Co(SCN)_3]^− is pink or something else. Or wait, maybe [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is the famous one that's blue. But wait, the problem says 'dithiocyanato' which I think means two SCN groups. Oh wait, no, 'dithiocyanato' probably refers to two SCN ligands, so n=2, the neutral complex. So I'm a bit confused about which complex is blue.

Wait, but maybe the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, which would be tetrathiocyanatocobaltate(II) dianion. That's the one I think is blue, but the problem says 'dithiocyanato', which I thought was two SCN, so maybe I got that wrong. Hmm, perhaps the question is referring to the tetra as the dithiocyanato? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe 'dithiocyanato' refers to two SCN groups, but in any case, I need to figure out which complex is the blue one.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the terms. Let me think: [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is the one that's blue and is sometimes called the 'cobalt blue' or something similar. So that's the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex. So that would be the n=4 case, with four SCN ligands. But the question says 'dithiocyanato' which implies two SCN, but maybe the term is being used differently. Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is the n=2 case? I'm a bit confused, but perhaps I should proceed with the given stability constants and see.

Wait, the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So if 'dithiocyanato' is two SCN ligands, then it's n=2, which is β2=40. But if the blue complex is n=4, then it's β4=16. So I need to clarify that.

Alternatively, perhaps 'dithiocyanato' refers to two SCN ligands, but the blue complex is the one with four. Hmm. Well, perhaps the question is referring to the n=2 complex as dithiocyanato, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe 'dithiocyanato' is a term that can be applied to any complex with two or more SCN ligands, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex as the blue one. So the blue complex would be the n=4 case. But the problem specifies 'dithiocyanato', which suggests two SCN groups. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the term 'dithiocyanato' refers to the presence of two SCN ligands, but in any case, perhaps I should proceed with the given β values and see.

Wait, regardless, the approach would be to determine the distribution of all possible cobalt species, and then find the percentage of the desired species. So the first step is to consider all possible complexes: n=0 (free Co^2+), n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species. So [Co(total)] = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-].

But wait, the solution may have other ions, but the problem says it's in a solution with Co(II) and thiocyanate, so maybe the other ions are negligible.

The approach to find the distribution is to calculate the fraction of each complex based on their stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

But wait, the stability constants (β) are given, and the formula for each β is βn = [Co(SCN)_n]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So for each n, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

But calculating this directly might get complicated because [Co^2+] is part of all the expressions. Alternatively, perhaps we can use an iterative approach or assume that [Co^2+] is determined by the total concentration.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to model the fraction of each species.

Let me think: Let x be the fraction of Co^2+ that is in the form of the n=0 species (free Co^2+), y be the fraction in n=1, z in n=2, etc. But since the total is 100%, x + y + z + ... = 1.

But calculating these fractions requires knowing the β values and the concentration of SCN^-.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the formation of each complex step by step.

Let me think: The overall approach is to compute the concentrations of each complex and free Co^2+.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as free, and [SCN^-] as given (0.1 M). But wait, wait. If the solution has Co^2+ and SCN^-, when they form complexes, the concentration of SCN^- will change because each complex uses up SCN^- ions. But wait, the initial [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. However, considering that the amount of Co^2+ is 0.01 M, and each complex can use multiple SCN^- ions, we might need to check if the SCN^- is in excess or not.

But wait, in a typical stability constant problem, when the ligand is in large excess, we can approximate [L] as constant. But in this case, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and the total Co is 0.01 M. Let's see:

Each Co^2+ can form complexes with up to four SCN^-. So the maximum amount of SCN^- that would be consumed is 4 * 0.01 M = 0.04 M. But the initial [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is much higher than 0.04 M. So it's safe to assume that [SCN^-] remains approximately 0.1 M throughout. Therefore, we can approximate [SCN^-] as 0.1 M for each step.

So, with that assumption, the concentration of each complex [Co(SCN)_n] is βn * [Co^2+] * (0.1)^n.

The total cobalt is the sum of all these complexes plus the free Co^2+.

So:

Total Co = [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+] (0.1) + β2 [Co^2+] (0.1)^2 + β3 [Co^2+] (0.1)^3 + β4 [Co^2+] (0.1)^4.

But wait, no. Because for each n, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So the total concentration is:

c_total = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} [Co(SCN)_n] 

= [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^1 + β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4.

We can factor out [Co^2+]:

c_total = [Co^2+] [ 1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 ]

But c_total is given as 0.01 M.

Wait, no, the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So that includes all species, including free Co^2+ and all complexes.

So:

[Co^2+] [1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 ] = c_total.

So we can plug in [SCN] =0.1 M, and solve for [Co^2+].

Let me compute each term step by step.

Compute each term inside the brackets:

Term0 = 1.

Term1 = β1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

Term2 = β2 * [SCN]^2 =40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

Term3 = β3 * (0.1)^3 =63 * 0.001 = 0.063.

Term4 = β4 * (0.1)^4 =16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016.

So sum all terms:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 =2.3646.

So the sum is approximately 2.3646.

So:

[Co^2+] * 2.3646 = 0.01 M.

So [Co^2+] = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004224 M.

So [Co^2+] ≈ 4.224e-3 M.

Now, let's compute the concentration of each complex.

[CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+] [SCN] =9 * 4.224e-3 * 0.1.

Wait, 4.224e-3 *0.1 is 4.224e-4.

9 *4.224e-4 = 3.8016e-3 M.

Next, [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co^2+] (0.1)^2.

(0.1)^2 is 0.01.

β2=40. So 40 *4.224e-3 * 0.01.

Wait, 4.224e-3 *0.01 =4.224e-5.

40 *4.224e-5 = 1.6896e-3 M.

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, [SCN] is 0.1, so [SCN]^2 is 0.01.

So [Co(SCN)_2] = 40 * [Co^2+] * 0.01.

Which is 40 *4.224e-3 * 0.01.

Compute 40 * 4.224e-3 = 0.16896.

Then multiply by 0.01: 0.0016896 M.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculations.

[Co^2+] is 0.004224 M.

[CoSCN^+] =9 * 0.004224 * 0.1 =9 * 0.0004224 = 0.0038016 M.

[Co(SCN)_2] =40 * 0.004224 * (0.1)^2=40 * 0.004224 *0.01.

0.004224 *0.01 =4.224e-5.

40 *4.224e-5= 0.0016896 M.

[Co(SCN)_3^-]=63 * [Co^2+] * (0.1)^3.

Which is 63 *0.004224 *0.001.

0.004224 *0.001 =4.224e-6.

63 *4.224e-6 = 2.66112e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] =16 *0.004224 * (0.1)^4.

(0.1)^4 is 0.0001.

So 16 *0.004224 *0.0001.

0.004224 *0.0001=4.224e-7.

16*4.224e-7=6.7584e-6 M.

Now, let's sum all these concentrations to confirm that they add up to 0.01 M.

Compute each:

[Co^2+] = 0.004224

[CoSCN^+] =0.0038016

[Co(SCN)_2]=0.0016896

[Co(SCN)_3^-]=0.000266112

[Co(SCN)_4^2-]=0.0000067584

Adding them up:

0.004224 +0.0038016 =0.0080256

+0.0016896 → 0.0097152

+0.000266112 →0.009981312

+0.0000067584 →0.0099880704.

Hmm, but the total should be 0.01 M. So there's a slight discrepancy. Maybe due to rounding errors in the calculations. Probably acceptable for the purpose of this problem.

Now, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. So I need to find which complex is blue and which is dithiocyanato.

Wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN ligands, so [Co(SCN)_2], which is the n=2 complex. But if the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, which has four SCN ligands, then that's the n=4 case.

But the problem states it's the blue dithiocyanato. Hmm. So perhaps the blue dithiocyanato is the n=2 complex, which would be the [Co(SCN)_2], which is neutral.

But I'm a bit unsure because I thought [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is the blue one. Alternatively, perhaps the blue color is for another complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'dithiocyanato' refers to the presence of two SCN groups, so it's [Co(SCN)_2], and the question is about its percentage.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's say we compute the percentage for each possible case.

So first, let's assume that the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2], which is the n=2 case. Then the percentage would be ([Co(SCN)_2]) / c_total *100.

[Co(SCN)_2] is 0.0016896 M.

c_total is 0.01 M.

So 0.0016896 /0.01 = 0.16896 → 16.896%, which is about 16.9%. Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

Alternatively, if the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, which is 6.7584e-6 M, then (6.7584e-6)/0.01 = 6.7584e-4, which is 0.067584%, which is much lower than any of the options. So that can't be right.

Wait, but maybe the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^- or [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the complexes and their colors. Cobalt complexes with thiocyanate can exhibit different colors based on the number of ligands. [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is usually a blue color, and it's the tetra-substituted complex. Dithiocyanato would imply two, so maybe the n=2 complex is not blue, but the n=4 is.

So perhaps the problem is referring to the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- as the blue complex, regardless of the term 'dithiocyanato'. But that term doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in understanding the term 'dithiocyanato'. Maybe 'dithiocyanato' refers to the presence of two SCN groups in the complex. So the [Co(SCN)_2] would be the dithiocyanato complex, but that's not the blue one. So perhaps the question is mixing terms. Or perhaps I'm mistaken about which complex is blue.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the dithiocyanato as the n=2 complex, regardless of color, but the correct approach would be to compute the percentage for the n=2 complex, which is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the given β values, the β3 is 63, which is the largest, so [Co(SCN)_3]^- would be the most stable, so it would have the highest concentration. But wait, the calculations showed [Co(SCN)_3]^- is about 0.000266 M, which is 0.0266% of the total. That seems low. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the [Co(SCN)_3^-] calculation.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * (0.1)^3.

β3=63, [Co^2+]=0.004224, (0.1)^3=0.001.

So 63 * 0.004224 * 0.001.

63 * 0.004224 = 0.265632.

0.265632 * 0.001 = 0.000265632 M.

Which is 0.000265632 M, so about 0.02656% of the total. That's much smaller than other species.

Wait, but according to the calculation, [Co^2+] is the largest species, followed by [CoSCN^+], then [Co(SCN)_2], then [Co(SCN)_3^-], and [Co(SCN)_4^2-] is very small.

Wait, the sum of all these is less than 0.01 M, but perhaps due to rounding. So the percentages would be:

[Co^2+] → 4.224e-3 /0.01 → 42.24%.

[CoSCN^+] →3.8016e-3 /0.01 →38.016%.

[Co(SCN)_2] →1.6896e-3 →16.896%.

[Co(SCN)_3^-]→2.656e-4 →0.2656%.

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] →6.758e-6 →0.006758%.

So the percentages are approximately:

Co^2+ →42.24%

CoSCN^+ →38.016%

Co(SCN)_2 →16.896%

The rest are negligible.

So the largest species are Co^2+ and CoSCN^+, followed by Co(SCN)_2.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. If the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, which is the n=4 case, that's the smallest (0.006758%). But the options don't include that. Alternatively, if the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2], that's 16.896%, which is option D:16.9%.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^−, but that’s 0.2656%, which is small.

Hmm, but wait in the options, option C is 38.1%, which is close to 38.016%. So that's [CoSCN^+], which is n=1.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me read the question again.

The question says: the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

If 'dithiocyanato' refers to two SCN ligands, then it's the n=2 case, which is 16.896%, so option D:16.9%.

Alternatively, if the blue complex is the tetra case (n=4), but that's [Co(SCN)_4]^2- which is not dithiocyanato.

Wait, but perhaps the "blue dithiocyanato" refers to a different complex. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the formation of each complex step by step, considering that each step affects the availability of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the conditional formation constant, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another way to approach this is to compute the fraction of each complex.

The fraction f_n of complex n is given by:

f_n = (βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} βk [SCN]^k )

Because the total is sum of f_n for n=0 to 4.

Wait, [Co^2+] = [Co^2+]_free, and [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN]^n.

So the fraction of each species is:

f0 = [Co^2+] / c_total.

fn = [Co(SCN)_n] / c_total = (βn [Co^2+] [SCN]^n ) / c_total.

But since [Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + sum_{n=1 to4} βn [SCN]^n ), 

fn = (βn [SCN]^n ) / (1 + sum_{n=1 to4} βn [SCN]^n )

So the fraction for each n is (βn [SCN]^n) / K_total, where K_total is the sum (1 + sum terms) from earlier.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, the denominator was 2.3646, which is sum_{n=0} (1) + sum_{n=1} (βn [SCN]^n ). Wait, no, because 1 is term0, and the sum starts from n=1.

Wait, in the expression for [Co^2+], the denominator was 1 + sum_{n=1}^4 βn [SCN]^n.

So K_total = 1 + sum_{n=1}^4 βn [SCN]^n.

Which is 1 + 0.9 +0.4 + 0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646.

So the fraction f_n for each n >=1 is (βn [SCN]^n ) / K_total.

So for n=2,

f2 = (β2 [SCN]^2 ) / K_total = (40*(0.1)^2 ) / 2.3646 = (40 *0.01 )/ 2.3646 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16896 or 16.896%.

Which is about 16.9%, which is option D.

But the problem asks for the blue dithiocyanato complex. If the dithiocyanato is n=2, then the percentage is 16.9%.

But earlier, I thought the blue complex is n=4. So perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex, which would be n=4, and the question is about the percentage of that complex.

But according to the fractions, the n=4 fraction is (β4 [SCN]^4 ) / K_total.

β4=16, [SCN]^4=0.1^4=0.0001.

So 16 * 0.0001 =0.0016.

0.0016 /2.3646 ≈ 0.000676 → 0.0676%, which is negligible, about 0.07%.

So that can't be the correct answer. Therefore, the blue must be another complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue is the n=3 complex. Let's compute the fraction for n=3.

f3 = (β3 [SCN]^3 ) / K_total = (63 * 0.001 ) / 2.3646 = 0.063 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.0266 → 2.66%.

Which is about 2.66%, which isn't any of the options.

So, considering all that, the only option that matches one of the computed fractions is option D (16.9%), which corresponds to the n=2 complex, [Co(SCN)_2], which is the dithiocyanato complex.

So the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species in the solution. The total cobalt concentration is given as \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), and the thiocyanate (\( \text{SCN}^- \)) concentration is \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The stability constants (\( \beta_n \)) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), and \( \beta_4 = 16 \).

### Step 1: Expression for total cobalt concentration
The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:
\[
c(\text{Co}) = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + \sum_{n=1}^4 [\text{Co}(\text{SCN})_n]
\]
Using the stability constant expressions for each complex, \( [\text{Co}(\text{SCN})_n] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n \), the total cobalt concentration becomes:
\[
c(\text{Co}) = [\text{Co}^{2+}] \left( 1 + \sum_{n=1}^4 \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n \right)
\]
Substituting \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \), we calculate the terms:
\[
\begin{align*}
\beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 &= 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9, \\
\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 &= 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4, \\
\beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 &= 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063, \\
\beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 &= 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016.
\end{align*}
\]
Summing these terms:
\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]
Thus:
\[
[\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{c(\text{Co})}{2.3646} = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.004224 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 2: Concentration of each cobalt species
Using \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \approx 0.004224 \, \text{M} \), the concentration of each complex is:
\[
\begin{align*}
[\text{Co}(\text{SCN})_1] &= \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.004224 \cdot 0.1 = 0.0038016 \, \text{M}, \\
[\text{Co}(\text{SCN})_2] &= \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.004224 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.0016896 \, \text{M}, \\
[\text{Co}(\text{SCN})_3^-] &= \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot 0.004224 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.0002656 \, \text{M}, \\
[\text{Co}(\text{SCN})_4^{2-}] &= \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot 0.004224 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.000006758 \, \text{M}.

### Step 3: Percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex
The problem specifies the "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." The term "dithiocyanato" implies two \( \text{SCN}^- \) ligands, corresponding to the \( [\text{Co}(\text{SCN})_2] \) complex. Assuming this is the blue species, its percentage is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co}(\text{SCN})_2]}{c(\text{Co})} \cdot 100 = \frac{0.0016896}{0.01} \cdot 100 \approx 16.9\%.
\]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is **16.9%**, corresponding to option D.
