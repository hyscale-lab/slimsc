Okay, so I need to figure out what Compound X is and then determine what it becomes after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Oh right, another reaction! They might be involved in the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Or wait, could it be for eliminating a leaving group, like in dehydration?

Let me look at the spectroscopic data. The IR shows a strong peak around 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl, maybe a ketone or ester or maybe a nitrile. Oh, wait, nitriles have a peak around 2200, so maybe it's a carbonyl group from a ketone or ester. Wait, 1720 is more like a carbonyl in an ester or possibly a ketone. Oh, but wait, another peak: 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So probably an aromatic ring with substituents.

The NMR data: Let's go through it. The 1H NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating to 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton. Oh wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But could it be an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid? No, because the IR doesn't show a broad O-H stretch around 3000 cm-1. Wait, the IR does have a broad region from 3400–2500 cm-1. That's a broad peak which could be an O-H stretch, maybe from an acid or an alcohol. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad around 2500-3300. But here the IR's 3400–2500 is a big region, maybe a broad peak. So maybe the compound has an -OH group.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet. Could that be an aldehyde? Because aldehydes are around 9-10, but sometimes they can be upfield or downfield. Alternatively, maybe it
