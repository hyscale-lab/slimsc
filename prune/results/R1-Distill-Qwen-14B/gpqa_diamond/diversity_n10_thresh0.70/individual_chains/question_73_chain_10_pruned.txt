Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The second is 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The options give different relative speeds and energies. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally because of the speed limit c, and energies include rest mass energy plus kinetic parts.

First, I need to find the relative speed between them. Since they're moving in the same direction, I think I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh wait, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, wait—no, that's when you're changing frames. Wait, actually, if one object is moving at u and another at v in the same direction, from the perspective of the first object, the second is moving at (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Or is it the other way around? Let me think: in the rest frame of the first astronaut, the second is moving at a speed relative to them. So if astronaut A is moving at u and astronaut B at v (same direction), then the relative speed is (v - u)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, no, because if u is the speed of A in the lab frame, and we're considering the speed of B in A's frame, then it's (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). But wait, if both are moving in the same direction, then in A's frame, B is moving slower. So for example, if A is moving at 0.6c, and B is at 0.5c, then from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ). Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.5c minus 0.6c is -0.1c. So the numerator is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity is
