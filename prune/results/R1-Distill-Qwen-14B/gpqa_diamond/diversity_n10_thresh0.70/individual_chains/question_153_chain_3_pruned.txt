Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it step by step.

The question gives three different reactions, all of which are Michael additions. My task is to determine the major products of each and then match them with the options provided. Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

First, Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking a beta position in an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile in this case would be the enolate from the malonate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. It has two ester groups, which makes it a strong electron-withdrawing group, stabilizing the enolate. When it reacts, the enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate. The acrylate here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, wait. The structure is actually CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)CO-OCH3. Because it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: so the double bond is between C1 and C2, and on C3 is the p-tolyl group. Wait, maybe I should think of it as CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, I think the structure is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Hmm, no, wait, I'm getting confused. Let's see, acrylate is CH2=CHCO-O-R. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl), that would be at the gamma position? No, wait, wait. The numbering: for acrylate, the carbonyl is at position 1, the double bond between 1 and 2, and position 3 is the next carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. So the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is at carbon 3.

So when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks, it will attack the beta carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl, which is C2 in the acrylate). So it would add to the C2, the double bond would shift, and the product would have the malonate group attached there.

Wait, but wait, the malonate is the nucleophile. So dimethyl malonate is (CH3O)2C-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3O)2C-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait, malonate is CH2(COO-)2. So dimethyl malonate would be (CH3O)COCH2COOCH3, so two ester groups on each end. When it forms the enolate, one of the ester oxygens deprotonates, making a conjugate base which attacks the acrylate.

So the attack would be on the beta carbon of the acrylate. The acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. The enolate from malonate would attack the CH2 part (the beta position) of the acrylate, forming a new bond. Then, the double bond would shift to between the new carbon and the adjacent one.

Wait, maybe I should think of the acrylate as CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the CH2. Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-
