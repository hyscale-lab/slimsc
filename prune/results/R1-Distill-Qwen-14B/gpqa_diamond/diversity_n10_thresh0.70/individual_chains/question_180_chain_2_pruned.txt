Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

So the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at P. Oh, so I imagine point P is like the origin, and the other twelve are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 meters around it. But since their exact positions aren't specified, maybe they're symmetrically placed, which might simplify things.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Wait, energy in an electric system usually refers to electric potential energy. So I remember that the potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula, but for a system, it's the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges.

The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. Since all the charges are identical, each pair will contribute the same amount.

So in this case, each charge is 2e, so q1 and q2 are each 2e. The distance between the fixed charge at P and each of the other charges is 2 meters. But wait, what about the potential energy between the charges that are at
