Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think through this step by step.

Alright, let's start by reading the question again. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy. The options are given as A to D, so I'll have to compute both the relative speed and the total energy, then match with the options.

First, the relative speed part. I remember that in relativity, speeds don't just add up normally. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Wait, wait. Wait, so which one is v1 and which is v2 here? Oh, the problem says both are moving in the positive x-direction. So, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So if I want the relative speed of astronaut 2 from astronaut 1's frame, it's (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ). Let me compute that.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, because in relativity, the relative speed isn't just the difference; you have to consider the direction. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (v1 - v2) divided by that factor. Let me compute that.

Wait, so v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 -0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Oh, so that's about 0.14c. That looks like option C or D.

Now, the total energy part. The total energy
