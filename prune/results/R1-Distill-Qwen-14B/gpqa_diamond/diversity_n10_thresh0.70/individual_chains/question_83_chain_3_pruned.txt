Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. Let's see what's given. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid that's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, it's titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I think I should figure out the concentrations after dilution. When you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting it with 20 cm³ of water means the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

So the concentration after dilution can be calculated using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. Here, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, let's think about the titration. The NaOH is 0.1 M. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So the mole ratio is 1:1.

I need to find two pH values: at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Starting with the equivalence point. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid present.

Wait, how many moles of acetic acid do we have initially? The diluted solution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) of 0.025 M. Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:1, the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume V = n / C = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. But wait, the problem says that at 25% titration, which is a quarter of this volume, right? So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ used for the 25% point.

At equivalence, the solution will be the sodium acetate solution. Because acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base, the salt formed is CH3COO^- Na^+.

So for the equivalence point, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. The concentration can be calculated as follows.

The total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ (original solution) + 10 cm³ (NaOH added) = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

Moles of sodium acetate is 0.001 mol, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, for a solution of sodium acetate, it's a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution. The pH can be found using the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.8
