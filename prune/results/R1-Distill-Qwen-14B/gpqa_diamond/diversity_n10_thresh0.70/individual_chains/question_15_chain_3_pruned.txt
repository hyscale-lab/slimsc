Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives us their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter. So, Planet_1 orbits much faster than Planet_2.

Wait, the host stars also have different properties. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they ended up with the same size. Interesting.

The key here is the probability of a transit. I think the transit probability depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. The formula I recall is something like the probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by a factor involving the orbital inclination. But wait, since both are already detected via RV, maybe that affects the probability differently?

Wait, RV method tells us about the mass and period, but the inclination isn't known. For a transit to occur, the planet's orbital plane must be edge-on relative to us. So the probability of that is based on the star's size and the planet
