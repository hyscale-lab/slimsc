Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, harmonic oscillators are a common topic in physics. But wait, the question mentions it's relativistic, so I can't use the classical equations of motion here. I need to think about how relativity affects the oscillator's behavior.

The problem states the mass is m, maximum amplitude A, and it obeys Hooke's law F = -kx. I'm supposed to find the maximum speed v_max. The options given have different forms involving c, the speed of light, so relativity is definitely playing a role here.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs at the equilibrium point (x=0) where all the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. The maximum speed would be v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's option C. But since this is a relativistic case, option C might not be the correct answer.

In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. So the energy of the oscillator must be considered in terms of relativistic mechanics. The total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, it's (gamma -1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². But in the relativistic case, does the potential energy also get modified? Hmm, maybe not directly. Wait, but for a harmonic oscillator, the potential is quadratic, so perhaps in the relativistic scenario, when the velocity is high, the kinetic energy is treated relativistically.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think about the energy in this system. The total energy would be the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy. In the case of a harmonic oscillator, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), the potential energy is at maximum and kinetic energy is zero. At x=0, the kinetic energy is maximum, and potential is zero.

But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't the same as non-relativistic. So, let's model this. The total energy E is the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy.

At maximum displacement, x=A, all the energy
