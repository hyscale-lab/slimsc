Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. It's a bit confusing, but let's see if I can work through it. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly in all directions. The main thing I'm trying to figure out is how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power dependencies on plx.

Hmm, parallax is a measure of distance. I remember that the parallax angle is inversely proportional to the distance of the star. So a star that's closer has a larger parallax. Like, plx = 1/distance, right? So if the parallax increases, the distance decreases.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax range. So it's like, for each small change in parallax (dplx), how many stars are there? And how does that number depend on the actual parallax value.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I think that means the number density is constant. So in a volume element, the number of stars is proportional to the volume. But wait, how does parallax relate to the volume?

Let's think in terms of distance. Parallax plx is in arcseconds. The formula I remember is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So distance d = 1 / plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

If I consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume of that shell is about 4πd² dr. But since plx is 1/d, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because d = 1/plx, so dr/ddx = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx is -1/plx². So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So the volume for a given parallax range dplx (assuming positive values, so take absolute value) would be 4π (d)^2 dr. Substituting d = 1/plx and dr = (1/plx²) dplx.

So volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck that. Because dr is the change in
