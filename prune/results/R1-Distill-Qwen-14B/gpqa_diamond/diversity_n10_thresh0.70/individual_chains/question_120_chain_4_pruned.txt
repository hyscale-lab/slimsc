Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. The formula I recall is that distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax (plx), so d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes. Like, if a star is really close, its parallax is bigger.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in what sense? Oh, wait, I think it's uniform in space, meaning the number density of stars is the same throughout the volume. So, the number of stars doesn't depend on where you look in the galaxy. So, the number per unit volume is constant.

But how does this translate to the number of stars per unit range of parallax? Parallax is a measure of distance, so I think I need to relate the number of stars in a certain range of parallax to the volume they occupy.

Let me consider a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr. The volume of this shell would be the surface area of a sphere with radius d multiplied by dr. The surface area is 4πd², so the volume is 4πd² dr. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this shell would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume: n * 4πd² dr.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax, not distance. So I need to express everything in terms of parallax (plx) instead of d. Since d = 1/plx, then plx = 1/d. So, plx is inversely proportional to distance.

Let me find dr in terms of plx. Take the derivative of d with respect to plx: d = 1/plx → dr/dplx = -1/(plx²). Hmm, but I think I'll need to express the volume in terms of plx.

Wait, the thickness dr in terms of plx: if plx increases by a small amount Δplx, how does d change? Since d = 1/plx, a change Δplx will cause a change in d: Δd ≈ - (1/(plx²)) Δplx. So dr is proportional to Δplx divided by plx². But wait, I'm looking for the number per unit range of plx, so perhaps I should think about how the number of stars in a plx range Δplx relates to the volume.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to express the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx as a function of plx.

So, for a given parallax plx, the corresponding distance is d = 1/plx. The volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4πd² dr. But since dr is related to dplx, I can write dr in terms of dplx.

Let me calculate dr in terms of dplx. Starting from d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d. Differentiating both sides: d(plx) = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = - d² d(plx). Since d is positive
