Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the energy levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with stars, the photosphere is where light is emitted, and the behavior of atoms there depends on the temperature. Oh right, the question says they're in LTE, Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so that's the Boltzmann distribution stuff I need to think about.

The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, so the excitation here refers to the number of atoms in a particular energy state. So the ratio of the populations of these energy levels is 2:1 between star_1 and star_2.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, that's a specific value. I remember that the Boltzmann equation relates the population of energy levels to temperature and energy. The formula is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

In this case, since it's the same element, the statistical weights g_i and g_j might be the same, or perhaps the problem is assuming they're equal. Because if not, we wouldn't be able to solve it without more info. So I'll assume g_i = g_j, which simplifies the equation to n_i/n_j = exp( - (Î”E)/(k T) )

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So for a specific energy level, n1 is twice n2. Let me clarify: the population in the excited state for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or is it the ratio of excited to ground state? Wait, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe the ratio is n1/n2 = 2, where n1 is the number in star_1 and n2 in star_2 for the same energy level. Or perhaps it's the ratio of excited to some other state. Hmmm.

Wait, but regardless, the key is that the ratio of populations depends on temperature. So for each star, the ratio within their own photosphere would depend on their own temperatures. So for each star, the ratio n_i
