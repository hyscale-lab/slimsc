Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that means the isotope is Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus. I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed v is 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their kinetic energy increases a lot because of relativistic effects.

The formula for kinetic energy in relativity comes to mind. Oh right, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy, and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) times the rest mass energy. So the steps would be:

1. Find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus.
2. Calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.
3. Use gamma to find the total energy, then subtract the rest energy to get the kinetic energy. Or maybe the question is just asking for the total energy? Wait, the question says "energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." RHIC accelerates ions, so I think the energy refers to the kinetic energy each ion has when it reaches that speed.

Wait, but sometimes people consider the total energy when talking about particle accelerators. Hmm. Let me think. The problem says "energy of the RHIC", which is an accelerator. I think accelerators typically refer to the kinetic energy imparted to the particles. So I'll proceed with calculating the kinetic energy.

But wait, maybe the question is asking for the total energy. Let's double-check. The options are all in GeV, and for a nucleus, probably it's the kinetic energy that's significant. Because the rest energy is much smaller compared to the kinetic at such speeds. Let me think: for v=0.96c, gamma is about (1 - v²/c²)^(-1/2). Let's compute that.

Wait, let me compute gamma first.
