Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium. The problem says we have a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, so I guess that means the ratio is 1:1 between calcium and EDTA.

The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. And the formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA is given as 5x10^10. The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

Wait, I think the formation constant K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- combine to form the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The K is given as 5e10, which is a big number, meaning the reaction favors the product, so the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much. That would mean the free calcium concentration is really low.

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I thought maybe the concentration comes from the dissociation of this complex. Let me set up some variables. Let me let the concentration of Ca^2+ be x. Since the reaction is 1:1, the EDTA^4- concentration would also be x, assuming that the complex dissociates a little.

But wait, the initial concentration
