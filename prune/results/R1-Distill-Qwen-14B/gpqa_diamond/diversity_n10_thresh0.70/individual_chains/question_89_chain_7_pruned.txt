Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, and 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3. Now, when heated with excess KOH, what happens? Oh, right, that's an elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so it should promote dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromines, maybe it's a double elimination. 

Wait, but wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane... when treated with KOH, it's probably undergoing dehydrohalogenation twice. Each elimination would form a double bond. But because the two Br are on adjacent carbons? No, wait, 1 and 3 are positions on the adamantane structure. Maybe the elimination forms a bridge or a more substituted double bond. Adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so the elimination would form a conjugated diene or maybe just a single double bond somewhere.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. That makes me think of an epoxide. Because epoxides are often formed via elimination reactions, especially with two leaving groups. Oh wait, wait. No, KOH in a certain condition might form an ether. Wait, wait, another possibility: when two vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-d
