Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The initial reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

First, I think I need to figure out what each product is. Let's take each step one by one.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure. Heating this with KOH. I remember that when haloalkanes react with KOH, especially under high heat, elimination reactions can occur. So maybe it's an E2 mechanism here, leading to an elimination product.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two adjacent bromines. When KOH is present, especially in excess, this could lead to a double elimination. E2 reactions typically form alkenes when vicinal dihalides are treated with strong bases. So the product might be an alkene.

So product 1 could be 1,3-diamantadiene or something similar—maybe a diene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a monoene if only one elimination occurs, but considering excess KOH, maybe both eliminations happen. Let me think: when you have two adjacent bromine atoms on a cyclohexane-like structure, eliminating both would form a double bond. So the product would be a bicyclic diene?

Wait, the NMR of product 1 is given. Let me look at that. The 1H NMR shows four signals: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is around the carbonyl region, suggesting a ketone or maybe an ester.

Hmm, wait a minute. If the initial reaction is elimination, you'd expect alkenes, but the IR suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps product 1 isn't an alkene but a ketone. Oh, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, when dihalides are treated with KOH, especially in a strong base, sometimes they can undergo a substitution reaction, but for vicinal dihalides, elimination is more likely. But perhaps under certain conditions, substitution could form a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of an oxide, which then eliminates HBr twice. But wait, if the base is KOH, perhaps the elimination forms a ketone. Or maybe it's more about dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That suggests that product 1 has a ketone group. So the reaction must have introduced a carbonyl. How does that happen?

Wait, maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when treated with KOH, it undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation. So two HBr molecules are eliminated. Each elimination would form a double bond, but with two adjacent Br atoms, perhaps it forms a carbonyl group. Wait, how?

Wait, maybe it's a case of forming a carbonyl via elimination. Oh wait! There's a concept called the formation of ketones from geminal dihalides through double elimination. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't geminal (same carbon), but
