Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic data. Let's see, the question gives me the options with different chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one fits the given data.

The first thing I'll do is go through each piece of data one by one and analyze what they mean.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1 suggests the presence of O-H groups, like in an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, the question says it's a very broad peak, which might indicate an alcohol since carboxylic acids have a broader but sometimes lower or higher wavenumber? Or maybe it's an -OH stretch, which is usually broad in alcohols. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peakâ€”common for carbonyl groups (C=O), like in ketones, aldehydes, or esters. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ketone or conjugated carbonyl group. Or could it be an amide? No, amides usually have lower carbonyl peaks, around 1650 maybe, but I don't think the options have nitrogen. Alternatively, maybe an ester, which can have two carbonyls if it's an anhydride? Or maybe one is a conjugated carbonyl. Wait, another possibility: the 1700 could be an ester or ketone, and the 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in an aromatic ketone or an aromatic ring with substituents. Or perhaps the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like a conjugated ester or a carbonyl next to an aromatic ring.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have at least one double bond, probably in a vinyl group. That could be part of an ester group or maybe an aromatic ring, but wait, aromatic protons are usually in the 6.5-8.5 ppm region, and vinyl (olefinic) protons are around 4.5-6.5 ppm,
