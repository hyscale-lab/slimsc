Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, mathematically, that would be N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. Wait, no, actually, the formula is d = 1/plx. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. That means if distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. So we need to express N as a function of distance, not parallax.

Since N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, that means plx = 1/d → 1/plx = d. So let's substitute plx with 1/d in the equation.

So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. Taking reciprocal of that would be d^5. So 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but wait a minute.
