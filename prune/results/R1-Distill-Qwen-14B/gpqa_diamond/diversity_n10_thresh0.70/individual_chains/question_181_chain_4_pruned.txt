Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux in two different energy bands. Hmm, let me think through this. I remember that the Sun's core has these fusion processes, right? The pp chain is one of them, and there are different branches like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Wait, the question specifically mentions the pp-III branch stopping. Oh right, the pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrons by fusing three helium-4 nuclei into a carbon-12, but wait, no, wait. Actually, pp-III is part of the proton-proton chain, which is the main fusion process in the Sun. So pp-III is the branch where two protons fuse into deuterium, and then another proton fuses with a deuterium nucleus to form helium-3, and then two helium-3 nuclei combine into helium-4. Or wait, maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Oh, no, wait, the pp chain has two main branches: pp-I and pp-II. PP-I is where a helium-3 captures a proton to form carbon-12, and PP-II is where two helium-3 nuclei combine to form two helium-4 nuclei. Wait, but the question is about pp-III. Hmm, maybe pp-III is a different process. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the different fusion processes in the Sun. Oh wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Wait, the main fusion process in the Sun is the proton-proton chain, which typically has two branches: one where two protons form deuterium, then capture another proton to become helium-3 (this is the first step), and then the helium-3 can either combine with another helium-3 to make helium-4 (this is the pp-I branch) or combine with a helium-3 from another branch to form carbon-12 (the pp-II branch). Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is the one that produces neutrons, but I'm not entirely sure.

Anyway, the question states that the pp-III branch has stopped. So, all other reactions remain the same. So, what's the impact on the neutrino flux? So, I need to think about what neutrinos are produced in the pp-III process.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in the Sun primarily through the beta decay steps. In the pp chain, one
