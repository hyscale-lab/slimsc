Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think that means the ground state, right? So the lowest energy state. And we're supposed to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh wait, the next state probably refers to the next higher energy state.

The molecule is made of atoms X and Y. Their masses are given in amu—Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, so this is a non-rigid rotor model. I remember that in the rigid rotor model, the bond length doesn't change, but the non-rigid model accounts for some vibrations as well. But maybe for this question, we're dealing with both rotation and vibration transitions. Or perhaps the question is only about the vibrational part?

Wait, the question is about switching states when a photon is absorbed. So the molecule's energy increases when it absorbs a photon. So the photon's energy would match the energy difference between the current state and the next state.

Wait, but the molecule is in the fundamental state. So the next state would be the first excited state. But what exactly is the fundamental state here? In the rotation-vibration model, each state is a combination of vibrational and rotational energy levels. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0 or J=1, depending on the selection rules). Or wait, for diatomic molecules, the rotation starts at J=0, but J must be an integer, so the ground state rotational level is J=0.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is currently in the lowest energy state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next lowest state could be either increasing the vibrational state (v=1) or the rotational state (J=1), whichever requires less energy. Because if the energy required to go from J=0 to J=1 is lower than going from v=0 to v=1, then the photon would cause a rotational transition. But if the vibrational transition requires less energy, then that's what would happen.

Hmm, but how do I find which transition is lower in energy?

I think I need to calculate the energy for both possible transitions and see which one is smaller. The photon's energy must match the energy difference of the transition.

So, first, calculate the energy difference for the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1. The vibrational energy levels are given by the formula E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the energy difference ΔE_vib between v=0 and v=1 is h*w. Because (1 + 1/2) - (0 + 1/2) = 1*h*w.

Then, the rotational energy levels. The formula for rotational energy is E_rot = (J(J+1) h²)/(8 π² I), where I is the moment of inertia. The
