Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember everything about matrices and quantum stuff. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives four matrices W, X, Y, Z and asks which statement is correct among the options A to D.

First, I'll look at each matrix and see what I can figure out about them. Maybe that'll help.

Starting with the matrices:

W is:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

Hmm, I think this is a permutation matrix. Because each row and column has exactly one 1 and the rest are 0s. Yeah, I remember permutation matrices are used for swapping elements, right? Like, if you multiply a vector by W, it permutes the elements.

X is:
i   -1   2i
1    0    1
2i  -1  -i

X has complex entries. I'm not sure what kind of matrix this is. It doesn't look like a Hermitian matrix because Hermitian requires A = Aâ€ , and looking at the elements, the (1,3) entry is 2i, and the (3,1) is -i. The conjugate transpose would have (3,1) as i, but X[3][1] is -i, so not matching. So X isn't Hermitian. But wait, in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues are real (which correspond to possible measurement outcomes). So if X isn't Hermitian, maybe it can't be an observable.

Then Y is:
0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

Y looks symmetric. Let me check if it's Hermitian. Since all the entries are real, Y is symmetric if Y = Y^T. Checking the entries: Y[1][2] is 0.1, Y[2][1] is 0.1. Similarly, Y[1][3] is 0.2, Y[3][1] is 0.2. Y[2][3] is 0.1, and Y[3][2] is 0.1. So Y is symmetric and with real entries, so Y is Hermitian. That could be an observable since it's Hermitian.

Z is:
3    2i   5
-2i  -2  -4i
5    4i   4

Z has complex entries. Let's see if it's Hermitian. For Z to be Hermitian, Z must equal its conjugate transpose. The conjugate transpose would have each element as the conjugate of the transpose. Let's check some elements.

Z[1][2] is 2i, so the conjugate is -2i, and in the transpose, the element at (2,1) would need to be -2i. But in Z, (2,1) is -2i, which matches. What about (1,3)? In Z, it's 5, so in the conjugate transpose, (3,1) would be 5. Z's (3,1) is 5, so that's correct. (2,3) in Z is -4i. The conjugate is 4i, so in the transpose, (3,2) should be 4i. But Z has (3,2) as 4i, which matches. So Z seems Hermitian. Because all the necessary elements match when taking the conjugate transpose, so Z is Hermitian. So Z could be an observable.

But wait, what about X? X had (1,3) as 2i, so in the conjugate transpose, (3,1) would need to
