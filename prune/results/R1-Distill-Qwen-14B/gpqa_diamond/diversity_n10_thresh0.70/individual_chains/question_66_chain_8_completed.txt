Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, what symmetries are those?

The question lists four options: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think about each one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is constructed to include all possible operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries. The Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, so I think SMEFT must preserve that as well. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is a must.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, but isn't SMEFT built in a way that considers Lorentz symmetry but might not necessarily include Poincare? Or do I mix up some things. Oh wait, the Standard Model does respect Poincare symmetry because it's a relativistic theory. So SMEFT, extending the SM, should also respect Poincare. So option 2, Poincare, is correct. So both 1 and 2 are required.

Now, what about CP symmetry (option3)? I remember that the Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry because of the CKM problem. But wait, in SMEFT, operators can violate CP if the SM doesn't, right? No, wait, no. SMEFT is an effective theory that must respect the same symmetries as the SM unless they are explicitly broken. But wait, the SM doesn't have a symmetry if the symmetry is spontaneouly broken. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Or does SMEFT allow for operators that violate CP because the SM doesn't enforce it? Wait, no. SMEFT includes all possible operators that preserve the same gauge and global symmetries as the SM. Wait, but the SM has some symmetries that are exact. Like, for example, the SM has SU(2)_L×U(1)_Y symmetry, but not necessarily CP. But in SMEFT, the operators must transform under the SM gauge group, but what about other symmetries like CP or CPT?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. So, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So, the operators must be invariant under the SM's gauge symmetries, Lorentz, etc. But what about other symmetries like CP or CPT?

CP symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation and parity. The SM doesn't have an exact CP symmetry because processes like the CKM violation occur. So, in the SM, CP is not a good symmetry, so the SMEFT must allow for operators that can violate CP. Wait, no. Wait, no, the SMEFT is built by adding operators that are consistent with the SM's symmetries. So, if the SM doesn't have a CP symmetry, then the SMEFT can have operators that break CP. So, operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. Therefore, option 3 (CP) isn't necessarily a symmetry that must be respected.

Now, CPT symmetry. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. Any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. Because Lorentz transformations involve boosts, and for those to be consistent with quantum mechanics, CPT symmetry must hold. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must automatically respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

Putting it all together: the question is which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect. So operators must respect Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) symmetry. They don't have to respect CP (3) because the SM doesn't. But they do respect CPT (4) because it's part of Lorentz symmetry's requirements.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So that must be the correct answer.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is constructed to include all possible operators consistent with the Standard Model (SM) symmetries. Since the SM respects Lorentz symmetry, SMEFT must also preserve it. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is a required symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. The SM is a relativistic theory and respects Poincaré symmetry. Consequently, SMEFT, which extends the SM, must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, Poincaré symmetry (option 2) is a required symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to phenomena like the CKM problem. Since SMEFT is designed to include operators consistent with the SM symmetries, it does not necessarily preserve CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry (option 3) is not a required symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental requirement in quantum field theory for Lorentz-invariant theories. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry. Thus, CPT symmetry (option 4) is a required symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct answer is the option that includes these three symmetries.
