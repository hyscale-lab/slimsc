Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay, which is given as c multiplied by the matrix S. Let's break this down.

First, I remember that the intrinsic angular momentum operator components, like Sx, Sy, Sz, are related to the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, but in this case, the matrix S isn't exactly the Pauli matrices, but let me check. The problem says the first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Let me write it out:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i,  0]]

Hmm, wait, the Pauli y matrix is usually written as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so S is the Pauli y matrix, σy. So S is σy.

So the operator Ay is (h/4π) multiplied by σy. Because c is h/(4π), right? So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Wait, but wait a second. I thought that the spin matrices Sx, Sy, Sz are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Oh, but in this problem, the operator is written as c·S, with c = h/(4π). So perhaps in this case, S is scaled differently. Let me think
