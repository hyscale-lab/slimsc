Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slowly.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pH values.

First, let me think about the initial dilution. When you mix equal volumes of acid and water, the concentration should decrease by half, right? Because the volume doubles. So the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M. After adding 20 mL of water to 20 mL of acid, the total volume is 40 mL. So the new concentration is 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 M. That makes sense because the number of moles stays the same, just spread out over more volume.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we dilute it, the dissociation increases, which should lower the pH a bit more than a strong acid would. But okay, for now, I'll go with the concentration being 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. The equivalence point is when the moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid.

Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid initially. Volume is 20 mL, which is 0.02 L. Molarity is 0.05 M, so moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M, volume is 40 mL (0.04 L), so moles are 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles as well. So same number of moles as before, which makes sense.

The NaOH is 0.1 M. To find the volume needed at equivalence, moles NaOH = moles Acetic acid. So 0.1 M * V =0.001 → V=0.01 L =10 mL. Wait, but wait, the total solution was 40 mL, and we're adding 10 mL of NaOH, so the total volume at equivalence is 50 mL.

But I don't think we need that for the first part, the 25% titration. Let's think about that.

25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH have been added.

Wait, but each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid. So the initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001, and 0.00025 moles have reacted. So the moles remaining of acetic acid are 0.001 - 0.00025 =0.00075, and moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025.

But wait, the total solution when we add 25% of the required NaOH: the initial solution is 40 mL, and we add 25% of 10 mL (the equivalence volume) which is 2.5 mL. So total volume is 40 +2.5 =42.5 mL.

So the concentrations now are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 /0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, but wait, is this the correct approach? Because when we add a strong base to a weak acid, it's a buffer solution until the equivalence point. So at 25% titration, the solution is a buffer. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should work here.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa of acetic acid is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → since Ka is 1.85e-5, pKa is about 4.73 (since 1e-5 is 5, so 1.85 is closer to 4.74, but let me compute it accurately. Hmm, let's see, log(1.85)=0.267, so pKa=4.733.)

So at 25% titration, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025/0.0425) / (0.00075/0.0425) ) → 0.00025 /0.00075 = 1/3. So log(1/3) is log(0.333...)≈-0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈4.256. So approximately 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH, and option D has 4.57. So that would point towards option A or D. Let me check what the second value is.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point: total volume is 40 mL +10 mL=50 mL (0.05 L). Moles of acetate are 0.001 mol.
