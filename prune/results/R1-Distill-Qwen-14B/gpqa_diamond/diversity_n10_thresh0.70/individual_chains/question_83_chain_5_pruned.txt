Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to titrations, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is saying.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and it's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options given are A to D with different pH values. 

Hmm. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, it should be a neutralization reaction. The reaction between CH3COOH and NaOH would produce CH3COONa (sodium acetate) and water.

First, I think I need to find out the initial concentrations after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. 

The initial moles of acetic acid can be calculated using Molarity (M) = moles / volume (in liters). So moles = M × V. 

Molarity of acetic acid is 0.05 M, volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 liters. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. 

After dilution to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration would be moles / new volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, let's figure out the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001. Volume of NaOH = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. 

But the question is about 25% titration, which is a quarter of the equivalence point. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. 

Wait, no. Wait, 25% of the equivalence volume. Since the equivalence is 10 cm³, 25% is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. 

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Because the initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001. So 25% of that would be 0.00025 moles. So, NaOH added would be 0.00025 moles. 

So, after adding that NaOH, the solution will have some acetic acid left and some acetate ions (from the sodium acetate). 

So, at 25% titration, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O

So, initially, we have 0.001 moles of CH3COOH and 0 moles of CH3COO^-.

After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH:

CH3COOH moles = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

CH3COO^- moles = 0 + 0.00025 = 0.00025 moles.

The total volume at this point is the original 40 cm³ plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³). Wait, but wait, the NaOH is in solution, so the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a
