Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I need to figure out what's happening in each stage. Let's break it down into parts.

Part 1: Diluting the acetic acid.
So, initially, we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water, the volume doubles. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So, M2 would be (M1 * V1) / V2.

Let me calculate the new concentration. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40. Wait, 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So after dilution, the concentration of acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But for the initial calculation, the concentration is 0.025 M.

Part 2: Titrating with NaOH.
The next step is when we add NaOH. The reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base), producing acetate ions (CH3COO^-) and water.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially. Let's calculate the moles of acetic acid after dilution.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter. So moles = M * V (in liters). After dilution, M is 0.025 M, V is 40 cm³ which is 0.04 L. So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

The NaOH is 0.1 M. So, at equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001 moles. Volume needed is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, the problem is about the pH at 25% titration and equivalence point.

So, 25% of the titration would be 25% of the equivalence point volume. The equivalence point is 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³. So when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. Wait, when you add 25% of the titration volume, does that mean 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence point? Or 25% of the total solution volume? Wait, no, titration refers to the amount of base added as a percentage of the equivalence point volume. So in this case, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

So, let me tackle both points:

1. pH at 25% titration (2.5 cm³ of NaOH added)
2. pH at equivalence point (10 cm³ of NaOH added)

Starting with the 25% titration point.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

So, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution were 0.001 moles. Moles of NaOH added are M * V = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So, 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH have been neutralized, forming CH3COO^-.

So, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.
Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 moles.

The total volume of the solution now is original 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.73 (Wait, let me calculate it accurately.

Wait, pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute that.

1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 10^-5. The log is log(1.85) + log(1e-5). log(1.85) is approx 0.267, so pKa is 4.733, approximately 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log( (0.005882) / (0.017647) )

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. So approximately 4.25.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Hmm, close. Option D is 4.57;6.92. Option D's first value is higher. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck the moles. Original acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 moles. 25% is 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH added. So moles of HA = 0.00075, A- is 0.00025.

Wait, the ratio is A-/HA = (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is indeed approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈4.253. So approximately 4.25.

Now, looking at the options, option A gives 4.26 for the first value. So maybe that's the case.

Now, moving to the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

Sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The concentration of CH3COO^- can be calculated. The moles of acetate are 0.001 moles (same as initial moles of acetic acid). The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, so we can set up the expression.

Let x be the concentration of OH^- produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, so:

Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.
