Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because eigenvectors and eigenvalues have always been a bit tricky for me. But let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P is broken into its components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

First, I remember that for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon, the spin operator S (but here it's P) has components along the x, y, z axes. The general form for the spin operator along an arbitrary direction n is given by the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. But wait, n is in the x-z plane here, so the direction has some angle θ perhaps, but no φ since it's in the x-z plane. So φ would be zero, or maybe it's specified differently. Hmm, but the eigenvectors might not depend on the angle if we're talking about the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator given is P, but I think it's analogous to the spin operator S. So since P is the operator, and it's along an arbitrary direction n, but we're given the components of P in x, y, z, the overall operator for a direction n would be a combination of these components. So maybe the operator P in direction n is P_n = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z).

Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y must be zero. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. But wait, the direction vector n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. So, n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if we're in the x-z plane, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (cosθ, 0, sinθ) if θ is measured from the x-axis. Wait, no, wait: in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So in the x-z plane, the direction would have φ=0, so n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because when θ=0, you're along the positive z-axis, and θ=π/2, you're along positive x.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, and n_y =0.

So the operator P_n is n · P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Each of P_x, P_y, P_z is given as (ħ/2) times a matrix. So let me write those down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So putting these into P_n:

P_n = (ħ/2) [n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So substituting n_x and n_z,

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me write that matrix out:

P_n = (ħ/2) * [
  [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ]
]

Wait, matrix multiplication: first term is sinθ times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is [[0, sinθ],[sinθ, 0]], and the second term is cosθ times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]. Adding them together, the matrix becomes:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

But all multiplied by ħ/2.

So the matrix for P_n is:

P_n = (ħ/2) * [
  [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ]
]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Eigenvectors satisfy (P_n - λ I) |v> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue. So here, λ is +ħ/2.

So (P_n - (ħ/2) I) is:

(ħ/2) * [
  [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ]
]

Wait, because I is the identity matrix, so (ħ/2) I is [[ (ħ/2), 0 ], [0, (ħ/2) ]].

So subtracting that from P_n, the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ -1, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

Wait, let me double-check that. Oh yeah, because each diagonal element is (something) - (ħ/2).

But when setting up the equation, perhaps I should factor out (ħ/2) to make it easier.

So (P_n - (ħ/2) I) = (ħ/2) [ [cosθ - 1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ]

Multiplying both sides by 2/ħ to simplify, the equation is:

[ [cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ] |v> = 0 * |v>

So the matrix equation is:

[ [cosθ -1, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ] * [a, b]^T = [0, 0]^T

So we can write two equations:

(1) (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

(2) sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

We can solve these equations for a and b.

From equation (1):

( cosθ - 1 ) a = - sinθ b

=> a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] b

But cosθ - 1 equals -2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ equals 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So let's see:

sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
cosθ - 1 = - 2 sin²(theta/2)

So,

a = [ - (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) / ( - 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ] b

The 2s cancel, and one sin(theta/2) in the denominator:

= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] b

Which is cot(theta/2) * b.

So, a = cot(theta/2) * b.

Alternatively, we can express a in terms of b as (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)) b.

So, let me write the vector |v> as [
