Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again and break it down step by step. 

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their properties are given, and I need to find out by how much the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2. The options are A to D, all around 2.2 to 2.35. Hmm.

So, the details I have:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.
- Star_1's mass is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 M2.
- Both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh, that's interesting. So their peak emission wavelengths are the same.
- Radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Wait, radial velocity usually refers to the Doppler shift, right? So maybe this affects the observed wavelength. But the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same, but their actual emitted wavelengths might differ because of their velocities.

The astronomers computed the luminosities using the black body radiation formula. So I think I should use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and T is the effective temperature.

But wait, the problem says they used the wavelengths where the stars appeared brightest. The peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if their observed λ_max are the same, then their temperatures might be the same? Or perhaps not, because of Doppler shifting.

Wait, no. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, it causes a Doppler shift in its emitted wavelengths. So the observed λ would be different from the rest λ (what the star actually emits). But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. 

So let's think about that. Let's say Star_1 is stationary relative to us (radial velocity
