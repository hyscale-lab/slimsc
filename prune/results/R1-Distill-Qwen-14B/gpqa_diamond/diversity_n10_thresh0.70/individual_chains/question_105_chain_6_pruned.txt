Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. They're observing this star and noticing brightness variations because the spots are rotating into and out of view. This setup is being compared to the presence of an exoplanet, and the question is asking what the radius of such an exoplanet would need to be to cause the same brightness variation as the spots do.

Hmm. So the key here is understanding how the star's brightness changes when spots are present and then comparing that to the transit method used for detecting exoplanets. Because when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, the spots on the star would cause a dip when they're on the side facing us.

Wait, but wait. Dark spots on the star would make it appear dimmer when they're facing us, right? Because they're cooler. So as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing the observed brightness to dip periodically. This is similar to a planet transiting, which blocks some light. So the problem is asking, what size planet would cause the same dip in brightness amplitude as these spots do.

So I need to find the ratio Rpl/Rstar, where Rpl is the planet’s radius and Rstar is the star’s radius (which is same as Sun’s, so Rstar = R_sun).

First, I think I need to calculate the change in brightness caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the change caused by a planet transit.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) caused by the spots when they are fully facing the observer.
2. Compare this ΔF to the fractional change caused by a planet transiting the star.
3. Set them equal and solve for Rpl.

Wait, but brightness change due to spots isn't just about area, because the spots are cooler. So when a spot is in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light, but since the spot itself is cooler, it might actually reduce the brightness more than just the area. Or wait, no, because the spots are existing on the star's surface. So the change in flux when a spot is in front is the difference between the star's flux without the spot and with the spot (which is blocked, so maybe the spot doesn't contribute its own flux, but the surrounding area does).

Wait no, perhaps the spots are cooler regions, so when they are on the side facing us, they contribute less flux than the rest of the star. So the total flux from the star is reduced when spots are visible. 

Wait, but in the problem, the scenario is that without any spots, the same amplitude would come from a planet. So the idea is that the spots cause a dip in brightness, and the planet's transit would cause a similar dip. So the dip from the spots is being compared to the dip from the planet.

So let me model the change in flux.

When the star
