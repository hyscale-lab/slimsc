Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my theoretical physics, but let me think this through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

First, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle divergences, like infinite integrals or terms. These divergences can cause problems in calculations, so regularization helps to make sense of them by introducing a cutoff or some other method, allowing us to subtract or renormalize the infinities.

So, which theories don't need this? Let's go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. From what I recall, string theory aims to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. Strings vibrate at different frequencies, and the theory incorporates supersymmetry. But I think string theory actually deals with high energies because it's supposed to describe all fundamental forces, including gravity. Wait, but does it require regularization? I'm not sure. I think that in string theory, the concept of a "string" replaces point particles, which might help avoid some infinities. Or maybe because it's a theory of everything, it handles high energies more gracefully. Alternatively, perhaps it still requires regularization because it's a quantum theory, but maybe in a different form, like using other methods instead of the usual cutoffs.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I remember that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, which makes quarks behave almost as free particles at very high energies (or equivalently, at short distances). But because of this, when you go to low energies, the coupling becomes strong, leading to confinement. But why does this matter for regularization? Well, QCD calculations can become complicated with divergent terms, especially when dealing with things like the beta function and running coupling. So I think QCD does require regularization techniques, maybe even more so because of the non-Abelian nature of the gauge group SU(3), which can lead to more complex divergences. So I don't think B is the correct answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, handling the interaction of electrons and photons. I remember that QED has been very successful and that it's a renormalizable theory. But wait, doesn't QED require regularization? Because when you calculate loop diagrams, like the electron self-energy, you get divergent integrals. So you need to regularize them, perhaps using methods like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, etc. So QED does require regularization. So option C is out.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. This is the non-quantum version, Maxwell's equations. In classical theory, you don't have the same issues with infinities because you're not dealing with quantum fluctuations or virtual particles. For example, the classical electron doesn't have the problem of infinite charge density because of the uncertainty principle. Wait, but wait: in classical electromagnetism, if you consider point charges, you do get some infinities, like the electric field at the center of a point charge being infinite. But in reality, in classical theory, these infinities are more of a mathematical issue rather than a physical one.
