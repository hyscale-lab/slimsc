Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about selecting the suitable reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is aqueous) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations for A and B.

Hmm, so I need to break this down. Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A.

Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN is sodium cyanide, which is a source of CN- ions. So, maybe this is a nucleophilic addition where the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon.

But wait, in the product, we get 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write down the structures to visualize.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH2CH3? Wait, no, butanenitrile is four carbons, but here, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structure.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product is CH(CH2CH3)(OH)CN. Wait, but butanenitrile has four carbons, and the substituents are on the second carbon. So it's (CH3)2CH-C(OH)CN? No, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN- (from NaCN), the addition would happen. The mechanism is that the ketone's carbonyl becomes an enolate or something else?

Wait, but wait. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons in the product. Butanenitrile has four carbons, but the product is substituting the nitrile group.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it adds CN-, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, that's 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile? Or maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an example of the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right! Cyanohydrin formation. That's when a ketone reacts with CN- to form a cyanohydrin. The product is a compound where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by an -OH and -CN group on the same carbon.

So, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting
