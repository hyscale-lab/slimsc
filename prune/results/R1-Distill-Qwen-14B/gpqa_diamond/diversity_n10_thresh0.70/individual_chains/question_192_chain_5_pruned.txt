Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me read it again. Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, with r less than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor, which is a distance L from the conductor's center. Oh, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, with l and L both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. The options are four different expressions for E.

Wait, okay, so I need to find E at point P. I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges inside cavities, there are some key concepts. Right, when a conductor is uncharged, and you put a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's charges rearrange. But wait, the conductor is uncharged, so initially it has no net charge. But when you add a charge inside, like +q, the conductor's inner surface must have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q because the total charge on the conductor after induction should be +q, but wait the conductor was uncharged before. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, the conductor was neutral. So when you put a +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge of -q. Since the conductor itself was neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance it. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, but the inner has -q, so the outer must have +q. So the conductor's net charge is zero: inner is -q, outer is +q, sum is zero.

Wait, but the problem says the conductor is uncharged. So to clarify, the conductor's total charge is zero. So when you put +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q, so that the net charge is zero. Because the conductor was initially neutral.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor, which has radius R. So the field at P due to charges inside the conductor would be as if all the charge is at the center, by Gauss's law. Wait, but wait: the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. Because the inner surface has -q, and the conductor is neutral overall, so the outer surface must have +q. So from outside the conductor, the field would be the same as if the +q were at the center of the conductor. Because the Gaussian surface outside the conductor encloses only the outer charge, which is +q.

Wait, but wait. The conductor is a sphere, and the point P is outside. So by the shell theorem, the induced charges on the conductor's outer surface would distribute spherically symmetrically. So the electric field outside the conductor is the same as if the total charge on the conductor were concentrated at its center. So the conductor's outer surface has +q, so the field at P due to
