Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, A_y. It's given that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix given as:

First row: 0  -i
Second row: i  0

So, let me write that down. Matrix S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And A_y is c * S, which would make it:

[ 0   -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0 ]

Wait, because c is h/(4π), right? So each element of S gets multiplied by c. So the matrix becomes:

[ 0       -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0       ]

So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Eigenvalues are the a's in the equation A_y φ = a φ.

Since A_y is a 2x2 matrix, I can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

Let me write the matrix (A_y - a I):

[ -a       (-i h/(4π))   ]
[ (i h/(4π))    -a      ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating the determinant:

= a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h/(4π))² ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is equal to (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So,

Determinant = a² - [ 1 * (h^2)/(16 π²) ) ]

Set determinant to zero for eigenvalues:

a² - (h²)/(16 π²) ) = 0 → a² = (h²)/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π)

Wait, but wait, that's the eigenvalues? So the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4π). Hmm, looking back at the options.

Option A says the imaginary part are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real? Wait, no. Wait, wait a second. Are the eigenvalues real or complex?

Wait, the matrix A_y is a Hermitian matrix? Because S is anti-Hermitian? Wait, let me think again. S is given as:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

What's the conjugate transpose of S? It would swap the off-diagonal and take the complex conjugate. So S† would be:

[ 0   i ]
[ -i  0 ]

Which is not the same as S, so S is not Hermitian. Wait, but A_y is c multiplied by S. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are Hermitian because observables must have real eigenvalues. Oh wait, but wait, the intrinsic angular momentum operators are like spin-1/2, which are Hermitian.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the matrix S again. Oh, perhaps I messed up the multiplication. Let me re-calculate A_y.

Wait, S is:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0

So S is indeed the standard form of the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i? Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is usually:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Which matches S. So S is the Pauli Y matrix (σ_y). Oh, because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, as they should be for observables. So S is Hermitian.

Wait, let me confirm that. The conjugate transpose of S would swap the off-diagonal elements and take complex conjugates.

S is:

[
