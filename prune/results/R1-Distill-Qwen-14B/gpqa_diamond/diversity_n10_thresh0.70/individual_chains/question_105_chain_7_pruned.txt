Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as these star spots. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, what's the scenario? There's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The spots have a filling factor of 20%, which I think means they cover 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K, right?

The question is about photometric observations. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The problem says this can look like an exoplanet transiting the star. So they're asking what size planet would cause the same dip in brightness as these spots do.

Wait, but if the star wasn't spotted, what would the exoplanet's radius need to be to produce the same amplitude? So I need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the planet's transit causes the same brightness change as the spots do.

Let me think about the brightness variation caused by the spots. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears a bit dimmer. The variation in brightness depends on the area of the spots and their temperature compared to the rest of the star.

The formula for the change in brightness (delta F) when a spot is present is given by:

delta F = (F_spot - F_normal) * Area_spot / (Total Area of Star)

Wait, no. Actually, when a spot is on the visible hemisphere (like when the star rotates and the spot comes into view), the observed flux decreases because the spot is darker. The flux from a spot is less than the surrounding area. So the change in flux (delta F) would be the difference between the flux without the spot and with the spot.

The flux from a spot is F_spot = sigma * T_spot^4 * area_spot.

Similarly, the flux from the normal part is F_normal = sigma * T_normal^4 * area_normal.

But wait, the star's total flux is F_star = sigma * Teff^4 * Area_star.

Since the spots are on the star, when a spot is in view, part of the star's surface is replaced by a cooler area. So the change in flux would be the difference between the normal flux and the spot flux for the area covered.

But I think I need to model the brightness variation when the spots rotate into and out of view. But perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the relative change in brightness caused by the spots and then compare it to the change caused by a planet transit.

For the planet, the dip in brightness is when the planet passes in front of the star. The maximum dip is when the planet blocks as much light as possible. The formula for the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2, assuming the planet is a perfect disk and the star's brightness is uniform. So the fractional change is (R_p / R_s)^2.

Now, for the spots, the situation is a bit more complicated because the spots are cooler and cover a certain area. The observed flux when the spots are facing us will be less than when they're not. So the variation in brightness depends on the area of the spots and their temperature relative to the star.

Let me approach this step by step.

First, calculate the flux from the star without any spots. Then, calculate the flux when the spots are visible. The difference will give me the amplitude of the variation.

The star's total flux is F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * (4 pi Rstar^2) / (4 pi D^2) ), but wait, in terms of observed flux, it's F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * (pi Rstar^2 / D^2), because the area is the cross-section (pi R^2), but perhaps for relative calculations, the distance D cancels out.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the star's total flux. Let me model the star as a perfect blackbody. The total flux without
