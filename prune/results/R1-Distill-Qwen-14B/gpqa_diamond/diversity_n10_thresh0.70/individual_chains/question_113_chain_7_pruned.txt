Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying in hydrogen and oxygen counts. The goal is to determine which formula fits the given spectroscopic data.

First, let's break down each piece of data.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The problem states there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR typically indicate O-H stretches. A broad peak could mean an alcohol (-OH) or perhaps a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch, often around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. So that fits. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, the peak is usually a bit narrower but still broad. Another possibility is a conjugated system with hydrogen bonding, like in a carbonyl compound. Hmm, but wait, other peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹.

The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak. That's a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 cm⁻¹ peak is a bit lower than 1700. Could that be another carbonyl group, maybe conjugated? Or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds? Wait, but aromatic C=C peaks are usually around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹. So 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but the options don't include nitrogen, so probably not that.

Looking at the 1H NMR: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound probably has a double bond, either isolated or conjugated.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I need to think about what fragments would give m/z 45. Common fragments at 45 could be a CH3CO+ (acetone, 45) or perhaps a CH2CH2O group? Alternatively, maybe a (CH2)2O fragment? Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think: 45 is the molecular weight. So CH3CO is 45? Let me calculate. Carbon is 12, H is 1, O is 16. CH3CO is (12*2) + (3*1) + 16 = 24 +3 +16=43? Wait, no. Wait, CH3CO has two carbons? Wait no, CH3CO is two carbons: CH3-C=O. So that's 2 carbons. Wait, wait, molecular formula for CH3CO would be C2H3O. Wait, but the molecular weight is 2*(12) +
