Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, right.

First, I remember that for spin-½ particles like the muon (which is like a heavier electron), the spin operators have specific matrix representations. The eigenvalues for the spin operator along any direction are ±ħ/2, which makes sense.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, P is the vector operator, and the problem is to find its eigenvector when the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane.

So, the direction n is in the x-z plane. That means the direction can be described by some angle θ from the z-axis. So, the direction vector n would have components (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero or 180 degrees—wait, no, maybe I should think differently. Wait, no, since the direction lies in the x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal angle) would be zero or π, but perhaps the general case is that the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since in spherical coordinates, the azimuthal angle φ is 0 for the x-z plane along positive x, and 180 for negative x. So n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because for φ=0, sinφ is zero, so the y-component is zero.

Wait, no, wait. The spherical coordinates have the polar angle θ measured from the positive z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ around the z-axis. So for any direction in the x-z plane, φ can be 0 or π, but the direction vector can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since we're in the x-z plane, the y-component must be zero, so sinθ sinφ must be zero. So either sinθ is zero (which would mean θ=0 or
