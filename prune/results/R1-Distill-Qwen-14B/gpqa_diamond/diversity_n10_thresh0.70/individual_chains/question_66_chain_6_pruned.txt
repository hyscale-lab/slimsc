Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I need to remember what each symmetry entails and how SMEFT handles them. So, SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model's symmetries. Wait, but which symmetries must these operators respect?

Lorentz Symmetry: Oh right, Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations. I think SMEFT operators must respect this because they are part of a relativistic theory. So any operator in SMEFT should transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But wait, SMEFT operators are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory, but do they individually have to respect Poincare symmetry? Well, I'm not entirely sure. I think that in a relativistic QFT, all terms must respect Poincare because the theory as a whole is Poincare invariant. But each operator must respect Lorentz symmetry for the terms to make sense in the Lagrangian. Hmm, but wait, the question is about what operators must respect. So if the theory is Poincare-invariant, then each operator must transform correctly under Poincare. Or maybe operators in the SMEFT are written in a way that the entire Lagrangian is Poincare invariant, but individual operators don't necessarily have to obey it on their own. No, that can't be right. Each term in the Lagrangian should be a scalar (or tensor) that transforms correctly. So I think both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required for all operators.

Wait, but Poincare symmetry includes translations, which relates to momentum. So operators must respect momentum conservation. Wait, but in the effective theory, the operators are constructed as local operators, so they must be Lorentz scalars or tensors. So yes, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. But what about
