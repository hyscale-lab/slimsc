Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. The setup is a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. And the speed of light is c. The options are four different expressions for v_max.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, I remember that the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is given by v_max = Aω, where ω is the angular frequency. And ω is sqrt(k/m). So non-relativistically, v_max would be A*sqrt(k/m). But that's the non-relativistic case. However, the options here don't seem to match that exactly, so I must be missing something.

But wait, this is a relativistic problem. So relativistic effects come into play, meaning that as the mass approaches the speed of light, we can't ignore special relativity. So the equations of motion would change.

In the relativistic case, the equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator isn't the simple F = -kx anymore because F would include relativistic effects. Oh right, the force law in relativity might involve gamma factors or something else.

Wait, the force is given by F = -kx, but in relativity, the mass increases because of gamma. So the equation of motion would be more complicated. Let me think.

In the
