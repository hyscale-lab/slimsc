Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so the nucleus here is probably a heavy one. The question says that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So Li-6 has 3 neutrons because lithium has 3 protons, so 3 neutrons would make it 6 total nucleons, right? So X is Li-6.

The problem is to find the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. I think this involves relativistic mechanics because 0.96c is a significant fraction of the speed of light, so classical mechanics won't apply here. Relativistic effects are important.

So the energy in question is the total energy of the nucleus. The total energy E is given by gamma times the rest mass energy, E = gamma * mc². But wait, I need to find the kinetic energy or the total energy? The question says "energy of the RHIC," which I think refers to the total energy imparted to the nucleus. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes colliders talk about beam energy, which is the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Or maybe it's just the kinetic energy. Hmm, I need to clarify.

Wait, no. In particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a particle in a collider, it's usually the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. But sometimes, people refer to the total energy. Let me think. The rest mass energy is mc², and the total energy is gamma mc². So the given options are in GeV, which is a unit of energy. So the energy they are asking for is probably the total energy, which includes the rest mass and the kinetic part.

So first, I need to find gamma. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The velocity v is 0.96c.

Calculating gamma: v = 0.96c.

Let me compute beta first. Beta is v/c, so beta = 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2). Let me compute that.

0.96 squared is 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Because 0.28^2 is 0.0784.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 / 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, 0.28 is 28/100, so 28/100 = 7/25. So 1/(7/25) =25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the total energy E is gamma * mc². So I need m, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Li-
