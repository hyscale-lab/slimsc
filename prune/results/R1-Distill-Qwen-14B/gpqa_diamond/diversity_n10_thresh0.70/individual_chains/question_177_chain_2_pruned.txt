Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. The problem involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The question is about their luminosities based on some given parameters. Hmm.

Alright, the first part of the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So, M1 = 1.5 M2. Interesting, so both the radius and mass increase by the same factor.

Then, the problem mentions that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = (hc)/(5kT), but more commonly remembered as lambda_max * T = constant. So, if both have the same peak wavelength, then their temperatures must be the same because the product lambda_max * T is a constant.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the peak wavelength where each star emits most strongly is the same. So, using Wien's Law, which states that lambda_max is inversely proportional to temperature. If lambda_max is the same, then T1 = T2. So the temperatures of both stars are equal. That's a key point.

Next, the problem states that the radial velocities of the two stars are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. Radial velocity usually refers to the velocity along the line of sight from the observer. But how does that affect the observed wavelengths? Oh, right, Doppler shift. The star moving towards us blueshifts, moving away redshifts. But wait, radial velocity is often used in the context of determining the Doppler shift. So, if a star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shift), and if moving away, longer (red shift).

But wait, the peak wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, the rest wavelength (emitted wavelength) would be different if the stars are moving because of the Doppler effect. Or is the observed peak wavelength the same? The question says, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. But the rest wavelengths (actual emission) could be different if their velocities affect the observed wavelength.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's denote v1 and v2 as the radial velocities of Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. v1 is 0, so Star_1 is not moving (assuming radial velocity is zero). Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Hmm, but wait, radial velocity could be either away or towards us. I think in this case, it's just the magnitude, but direction matters. Wait, no, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So, Star_1 is at rest relative to us, Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But in which direction? If it's moving towards us, the observed wavelength would be shorter; if moving away, longer. But since the observed
