Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum because the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. The spectral line shifts are given as 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for #2.

Wait, what determines the Doppler shift? I think the shift depends on the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the Doppler shift. Oh right, the Doppler shift (or the shift in wavelength) is proportional to the velocity of the star.

So the shift (delta lambda) would be proportional to the velocity (v) of the star. So if delta lambda1 is 5 and delta lambda2 is 7, then v1 is 5 and v2 is 7, assuming the proportionality holds.

But wait, the formula for Doppler shift is delta lambda / lambda_0 = v / c, where c is the speed of light. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, maybe the velocities relate to the Doppler shifts directly. But the exact values of lambda don't matter because they're the same for both stars; the shifts are relative.

So v1 = (5/lambda)
