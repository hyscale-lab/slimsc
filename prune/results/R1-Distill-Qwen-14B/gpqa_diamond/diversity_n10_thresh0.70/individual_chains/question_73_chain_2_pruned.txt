Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. So relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as in classical mechanics. I remember that you can't just subtract the speeds because of the way velocities add up relativistically. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity isn't v1 - v2. Instead, it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). So I think I need to use that.

Let me jot that down. So for the relative speed, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c. Since both are in the same direction, the relative velocity of A with respect to B would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let's compute that.

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/c², which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7. Let me calculate that: 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857... so about 0.143c. Looking at the options, I see option C and D both have 0.14c. So the relative speed part points towards C or D.

Now, what about the total energy of the system? Oh, right, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each object. The energy of each is given by gamma * m * c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So I need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and add them together.

First astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):
Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2 )
0.6 squared is 0.36, so 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma1 is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 is gamma1 * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):
Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2 )
0.5 squared is 0.25, so 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. So gamma2 is 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So energy E2 is gamma2 *3m c² = 1.1547 *3 = about 3.4641 m c².

Wait, adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.4641 = approximately 5.9641 m c². Hmm, that’s about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc². So the energy part points to option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculations.

Gamma for 0.6c: 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. Correct.

Gamma for 0.5c: 1/sqrt(0.75). Let me compute sqrt(0.75) more precisely. 0.75 is 3/4, so sqrt(3/4) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So gamma is 1/(sqrt(3)/2) = 2/sqrt(3) ≈1.1547. So that's correct.

E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c². Correct.

E2 = (2/sqrt(3)) *3m c² = (2/sqrt(3)) *3 = 6/sqrt(3) = 2*sqrt(3)*3 / (sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)) )? Wait, no. Wait, 3 divided by sqrt(3)
