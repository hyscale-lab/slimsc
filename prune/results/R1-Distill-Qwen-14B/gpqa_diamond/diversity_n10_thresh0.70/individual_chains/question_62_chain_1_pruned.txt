Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target molecule. The name is a bit complex. So, looking at it: it's a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means an aldehyde group attached to a cyclohexane ring. Then, the substituent is at position 1, which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait, so that substituent is a methyl group attached to both a cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group. So, the structure would have two cyclohexane rings connected via a methylene group (CH2) which also has an OH group. So, it's like a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde (carbaldehyde) and another substituent which is a CH2OH connected to another cyclohexane.

Now, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond) attached. So structure-wise, it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Or wait, ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH? Or just C≡CH attached to the ring? Oh wait, ethynyl is the substituent, so it's cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group. Or is it CH2-C≡C-? Wait, no, ethynyl is the functional group, so it's cyclohexane attached to a C≡CH group via a single bond. So it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Our goal is to transform this into the target molecule. Let's think about what reactions are needed.

The target has an aldehyde group. Aldehydes can be formed via oxidation of ketones or alcohols. Alternatively, perhaps via some kind of oxidation or addition. Also, the substituent has a hydroxyl group attached to a methylene which is attached to a cyclohexane. So maybe that's a result of some kind of oxidation or epoxidation and
