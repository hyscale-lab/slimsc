Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Hmm, okay. So, the glass is moving, and the light is going through it. I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects the way light propagates, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the glass is moving towards me, the observer, in the same direction the light is going. Interesting. So if the glass is moving towards me, and the light is also moving in that direction, perhaps there's some effect on the observed speed of light in the glass.

I know that the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So in the glass, the speed would normally be 1/n. But wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer.

But the medium here is moving. So do I need to consider relativistic effects here? Because if the medium is moving, does it affect the observed speed of light in that medium?

Wait, but according to Einstein's theory of relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. But in this case, the light is inside a moving medium, so it's not a vacuum. So the speed might change.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the velocity addition formula in special relativity. Because the glass is moving, and the light is moving within it. So perhaps I need to calculate the velocity of the light as observed from the lab frame.

Wait, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So in the glass's rest frame, the light has velocity v_light = c/n (since inside the medium, it's slower). But then, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So I might need to apply the velocity addition formula from relativity.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u * v)/cÂ²). But here, u would be the velocity of the
