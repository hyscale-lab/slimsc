Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K, which is close to 0 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is about 4°C. So B must be a solid at that temperature.

The product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Hmm, that gives me a clue. Maybe X is something like NaOH or KOH? Because those are common reagents, especially in reactions like saponification or maybe ester hydrolysis.

Wait, but the question mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe X is a metal with a common isotope, like sodium (which has isotopes like Na-23, Na-24, etc.) or potassium? Or perhaps another metal.

Let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y violently. Liquid Y could be water, maybe. If Y is water, then X could be a metal, like sodium or potassium. For instance, sodium reacts violently with water, producing hydrogen gas (H2). But wait, the gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Hydrogen has one proton and one neutron in H2, so that's 1 each, so sum is 2. So that fits. But let me think: H2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons? No, wait, each H is H-1, which has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That can't be right. Oh wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe another gas.

Wait, let me think again. The gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule. So for each molecule, protons = neutrons. Let's think of possible gases from reactions involving metals and water.

Another possibility is O2 or O3. O2 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons per molecule? No, because O
