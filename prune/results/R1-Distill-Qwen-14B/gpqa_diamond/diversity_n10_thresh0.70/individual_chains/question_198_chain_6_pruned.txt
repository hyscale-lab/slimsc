Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see... The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved here. 

So the setup is that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, stability constants usually tell us about the formation of complexes. So each β represents the formation constant for the nth complex. 

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached, right? So that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. So I need to find the fraction of Co that's in this form.

I think I need to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and then find the percentage for the dithiocyanato one. The possible complexes are Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, and Co(SCN)_4. Wait, but wait, Co is in +2 oxidation state, so each SCN- is -1. So the complex would have a charge of +2 plus (n*(-1)), so for n=2, it's Co(SCN)_2^0? No, wait, Co^2+ and two SCN^- would make a neutral complex. Hmm, but the problem states it's a blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the common ones are [Co(SCN)_n]^m, like for n=2, it's [Co(SCN)_2]^ something? Maybe I should just proceed with the calculations.

The general approach for this kind of problem is to consider all possible complexes and calculate their concentrations based on the stability constants. But since there are four β values, we have four possible complexes. The total concentration of all cobalt species should add up to the initial cobalt concentration, which is 0.01 M.

The stability constants β are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, but wait, sometimes the order matters. Wait, β1 is
