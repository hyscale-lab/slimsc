Okay, so I need to figure out the electric field at point P outside a spherical conductor with a cavity. Let me think through this step by step.

Hmm, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor. So initially, it's neutral. But there's a small spherical cavity inside it, not at the center because the center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor, right? And the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R, the radius of the conductor.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so the conductor is uncharged, but when we put +q inside the cavity, what happens? I remember that in electrostatics, charges inside a conductor would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. But wait, the conductor was initially neutral.

So when a charge is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must develop an equal and opposite charge to cancel the electric field within the conductor. But wait, in this case, the conductor is uncharged. So the inner surface of the conductor must have a charge of -q to cancel the field from +q inside. Then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the total conductor was neutral initially, so inner surface is -q, outer surface is +q to balance.

But wait, point P is outside the conductor. The electric field at a point outside a conductor depends on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. Because the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q, the electric field outside should behave as if all the charge q were concentrated at the center. So the field should be similar to that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, right? So using Coulomb's law, E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So looking at the options, option B says E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L²
