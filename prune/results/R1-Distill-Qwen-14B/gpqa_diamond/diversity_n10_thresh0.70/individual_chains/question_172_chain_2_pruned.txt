Okay, so I have this problem about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, the question mentions that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that excitation here refers to the energy levels of the atoms. 

Wait, the problem says the energy difference between the energy levels is about 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, that's a specific value, but maybe it's related to the Boltzmann constant or something thermal. 

The stars are in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the Boltzmann factor. The formula I remember is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels. 

The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight. But in this problem, the statistical weights might be the same if we're comparing the same transition or same energy levels in both stars, so they might cancel out. 

So, in this problem, the excitation is twice as much in star_1. Let's denote the number of excited atoms in star_1 as N1 and in star_2 as N2. The problem says N1 = 2 * N2. 

Wait, no. The question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Hmm, perhaps the excitation refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy level relative to a lower one. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could be the ratio of the populations in two specific energy levels. 

So let's think. The Boltzmann factor for the ratio of populations (n_i / n_j) is (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Let's say E is the energy difference between level 2 and level 1. If E is the same for both stars, then the ratio for each star would depend on their temperatures. 

But in this problem, the atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation is the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state to a lower state. Letâ€™s say, for each star
