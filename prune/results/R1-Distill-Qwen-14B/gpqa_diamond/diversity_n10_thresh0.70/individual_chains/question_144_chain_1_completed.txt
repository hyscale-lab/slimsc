Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question states that X is a meson resonance. I need to find the mean decay distance, given the production energy, mass, and width. The options are A to D, which are all really tiny distances, probably on the order of femtometers or something like that.

Wait, I remember that the decay length of a particle depends on its lifetime and velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like decay length equals velocity multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, the lifetime is related to the width of the particle. The mean lifetime τ is given by h-bar divided by the width Γ. Oh wait, right, τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of MeV·s, so when I divide, the units take care of themselves. Okay, so first I need to compute τ.

Wait, the production energy is E_X =8 GeV, and the mass is m_X=1.2 GeV. Hmm, but wait, for a resonance, the mass is around the peak of its production. So probably the energy E is close to the mass, but I'm not sure if that's relevant for the decay length. Maybe it's not needed for the formula I need, which is the decay distance.

Wait, the formula for the decay distance is L = (v * c) * τ. Alternatively, L = (v * ħ c) / Γ. Because τ is ħ/(Γ), so L = v * ħ c/(Γ). Or wait, let's write the steps:

1. Compute the particle's velocity v. For that, I might need the energy and mass. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So relativistic equations apply here.

The energy of a particle is E = γ m c^2, where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E/(m c^2). Let's compute that.

Wait, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c², because energy and mass are related by E=mc², so m in GeV/c² would be E/(c²), but units can be a bit tricky here. Maybe I should proceed in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but then I have to remember to convert back to meters at the end.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for velocity in terms of energy and mass. I think the formula is v = [ (E² - m² c^4 )^(1/2) ] / E * c. Or wait, maybe v = c * sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, let's get this straight. The relativistic energy equation is E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So, p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2 ) ) / c². And momentum p is also gamma m v, so p = gamma m v.

Wait, maybe another approach. The velocity can be found from v = c * beta, where beta is v/c. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). Also, gamma = E/(m c²). So rearranging, beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2 ). So, v = c * sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, but the units... Let me make sure I plug in the right values. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So m c² is 1.2 GeV. So m c² = 1.2 GeV. E is 8 GeV. So m c² / E = 1.2 / 8 = 0.15. So (m c²/E)^2 is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, so v is approximately 0.9887c. So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s. But I might need to calculate it more precisely if the options are close.

But maybe it would be better to express everything in terms of natural units for calculation purposes, then convert to meters.

Wait, but perhaps I can use the formula for the decay length, which is L = (γ v c) * τ, but I need to make sure about the units.

Wait, τ is the mean lifetime, which is ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the width, and the uncertainty principle says Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Then, the decay length L is v * τ. But wait, wait, because v is in m/s, τ is in seconds, so v * τ gives meters.

Wait, but wait, no, because v is already a fraction of c, so perhaps I should express it as (beta c) * tau.

So L = beta c * tau.

Since tau is ħ/(Gamma), with Gamma in MeV.

Wait, but Gamma is given in MeV, and ħ has units of MeV·s. Let me think about the unit conversion.

So, Gamma is 320 MeV. So ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, because 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, so 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV. So 6.582e-25 GeV·s is the same as 6.582e-25 * 1e3 MeV s = 6.582e-22 MeV s. So ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Wait, but let me get the exact value. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s.

But we can express ħ in units of GeV·s. Since 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J (because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J; so 1 GeV is 1e9 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.602e-10 J), so 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J.

So ħ in J·s is 1.055e-34 J·s. To convert to GeV·s, divide by 1.602e-10 J/GeV:

ħ = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-10 J/GeV) ) = (1.055 / 1.602) * 1e-24 GeV·s ≈ 0.6587 * 1e-24 GeV·s ≈ 6.587e-25 GeV·s.

Now, Gamma is given as 320 MeV. So we need to convert this to GeV: 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Gamma = (6.587e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.587e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.058e-24 seconds.

So tau ≈ 2.058e-24 s.

Then, the decay length L is v * tau.

Wait, but v is the velocity of the meson. So I need to calculate beta, which is v/c.

Earlier, I found beta as sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E )^2 ). Wait, but E is 8 GeV, m c^2 is 1.2 GeV. So the ratio (m c^2)/E is 1.2/8 = 0.15. So (0.15)^2 is 0.0225. 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately 0.9887, so beta is about 0.9887.

So v = beta c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, L = v * tau = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.058e-24 s) = approximately 6.102e-16 meters.

Wait, but none of the options match that. Let me check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let's compute it more accurately.

Compute (m c^2 / E )^2: (1.2 /8 )^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.

1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887, but perhaps more accurately, it's about 0.9887.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more precisely. Let me see:

sqrt(0.9775) = ?

Well, 0.9887^2 = 0.9775.

Wait, 0.9887 * 0.9887 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = approx 0.9604 + 2*(0.98)(0.0087) + (0.0087)^2 ≈ 0.9604 + 0.017148 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97762369, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So perhaps the actual square root is a little less than 0.9887.

But maybe I can compute it more accurately. Let me compute 0.9887^2 = ?

Let me compute 9887 * 9887:

But perhaps an alternative approach: let x = 0.9887, x² = 0.9775.

Wait, perhaps I can compute using a calculator: sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So velocity v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.966e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.058e-24 s.

So L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.058e-24 s = Let's compute that.

2.966e8 * 2.058e-24 = (2.966 * 2.058) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = (approx 6.102) * 1e-16 = 6.102e-16 meters.

Wait, but the options are all around 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. None of the options match 6e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's go back and check each step.

First, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c².

Gamma is 320 MeV, so 0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ / Gamma = 6.587e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.058e-24 s. That seems correct.

Now, beta calculation: E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

Wait, but in this case, E is the total energy of the particle. So, E² = (pc)^2 c^2 + (m c²)^2. So, (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2. So, p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c^2.

But another way to find v is v = pc² / E. So, because p c is the momentum times c, and v = (p c²) / E.

Wait, wait, let me think. The relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v. So, p c = gamma m v c.

But E = gamma m c^2.

So, v = (p c^2) / (gamma m c^2) ) = (p c^2) / E.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The velocity v can be found as v = (p c^2) / E.

So, let's compute p c^2.

p c^2 = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) * c^2.

Wait, but that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute beta as (pc^2)/(E c).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, perhaps I should use the formula beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Yes, that's the formula I used earlier. And that gives beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) ) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ) = sqrt(0.9775), which is approximately 0.9887.

Hmm, so that's correct. So v is 0.9887c.

But when I multiply that by tau (2.058e-24 s), I get L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.058e-24 s.

Wait, let's compute that:

0.9887 * 3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.058e-24 s: 2.966e8 * 2.058e-24 = (2.966 * 2.058) * 1e8 * 1e-24.

2.966 * 2.058 ≈ let's compute:

2 * 2.058 = 4.116.

0.966 * 2.058 ≈ approx 2. (because 1 * 2.058 is 2.058, so 0.966 is about 0.966 * 2.058 ≈ 2.000 )

So total is approximately 4.116 + 2 = 6.116e-16 meters.

Wait, but none of the options are this. The options are either ~5e-15 or ~4e-15, or similar in the 1e-16 range. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(0.9775).

Let me calculate 0.9887^2: 0.98^2 is 0.9604, 0.0087^2 is ~0.000075, and 2*0.98*0.0087 is ~0.017148. So total 0.9604 +0.017148 +0.000075 is 0.977623, which is very close to 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta is 0.9887.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more precisely. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) using a better method.

Let me try to compute sqrt(0.9775):

We know that 0.9887^2 is approximately 0.9776, which is just a bit higher than 0.9775. So the actual square root is a little less than 0.9887. Let's approximate it as 0.98868, which would give (0.98868)^2 ≈ 0.9775.

So beta is approximately 0.98868.

So, v = 0.98868 * 3e8 m/s = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Tau = 2.058e-24 s.

So L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.058e-24 s = 6.10e-16 meters.

Hmm, but the options are A:5.0223e-16, B:4.0655e-15, etc.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of tau.

Wait, Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. ħ is 6.587e-25 GeV s.

So tau = ħ / Gamma = (6.587e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV ) ) = 6.587e-25 / 0.32 s.

6.587 /0.32 ≈ 20.584375. So 20.584375e-25 s = 2.058e-24 s. That's correct.

Hmm, so L is about 6.1e-16 m, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the mean decay length formula using the relation between the decay width and the decay length. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula L = c * tau * beta gamma.

Wait, beta gamma is gamma * beta. Hmm, gamma is E/(m c^2), because gamma = E/(m c^2) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.

So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

So beta gamma is 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.6 (since 6.6667 * 0.9887 is approx 6.588).

Wait, let me compute 6.6667 * 0.9887.

6 * 0.9887 is 5.9322, 0.6667 * 0.9887 is approx 0.6588. So total is approx 5.9322 + 0.6588 = 6.591.

So beta gamma is about 6.591.

Wait, so L is c * tau * beta gamma.

Tau is 2.058e-24 s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 2.058e-24 s * 6.591.

Let me compute this:

3e8 * 2.058e-24 = 6.174e-16.

Multiply by 6.591: 6.174e-16 *6.591 ≈ approx 40.7e-16 m, which is 4.07e-15 m.

Wait, that's 4.07e-15 meters. Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, so 4.07e-15 m is close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15.

Wait, so perhaps my initial approach was wrong, and the correct formula is L = c * tau * beta gamma.

Wait, why would that be the case? Because another way to write L is (v * tau) = (beta c) * tau. But beta is v/c, so (beta c) is v. So L = v * tau, which is what I calculated first.

But that gave me around 6e-16 m, but that's not matching the options. However, when I compute using L = c * tau * beta gamma, I get 4e-15 m.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity calculation. Let me re-examine the velocity formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use beta gamma as part of the equation. Because sometimes, the decay length is expressed as L = (gamma c tau) * beta. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think about the proper formula for the decay length. The mean lifetime is tau = ħ / Gamma. The velocity is v = beta c. The lifetime in the lab frame is tau (since tau is the proper lifetime, but wait, no, for a moving particle, the lifetime is longer by gamma. So the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. Because from the particle's frame, it lives for tau, but from the lab frame, it's moving, so time dilation makes it gamma tau.

Wait, so the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. Then, the decay length is L = v * (gamma tau) ). Because in the lab frame, the particle is moving at velocity v for time gamma tau.

So, L = v * gamma tau = beta c * gamma tau.

And since gamma tau = gamma * (ħ / Gamma) ), and we have L = beta c gamma (ħ / Gamma).

Hmm, perhaps I should go through the proper steps.

Let me lay out the correct formula.

The mean decay length L is given by:

L = c * beta * gamma * tau.

But tau is the proper lifetime, tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.

So, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau_0.

Thus, L = v * (gamma tau_0) ) = beta c * gamma tau_0.

So, L = beta gamma c tau_0.

So, putting it all together:

L = beta gamma c (ħ / Gamma).

Wait, but ħ has units of GeV s.

So, let's compute each part.

Compute beta gamma: beta is approximately 0.9887, gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

So beta * gamma is 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.591.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau_0 = ħ / Gamma = (6.587e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 2.058e-24 s.

So L = beta gamma c tau_0 = 6.591 * 3e8 m/s * 2.058e-24 s.

Let me compute 6.591 *3e8 = 1.9773e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.058e-24 s: 1.9773e9 * 2.058e-24 = (1.9773 * 2.058) * 1e9 * 1e-24.

1.9773 * 2.058 ≈ approx 4.07e0. So (4.07) * 1e-15 = 4.07e-15 meters.

Which is approximately 4.07e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but earlier when I used v * tau, I got 6e-16 m, which is about a factor of 7 smaller. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, because I forgot that the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So in the initial approach, I used tau_0, the proper lifetime, but the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau_0.

Thus, L = v * (gamma tau_0) ) = beta c * gamma tau_0.

Which is the same as beta gamma c tau_0.

So the correct calculation gives about 4.07e-15 m, which matches option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, so the answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the mean proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( \Gamma \) is the decay width.

### Step 1: Compute \( \tau \)
The mean proper lifetime \( \tau \) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \approx 6.587 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.587 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.058 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Given \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.667
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is calculated using:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m c^2}{E}\right)^2}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{m c^2}{E} = \frac{1.2}{8} = 0.15 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - 0.15^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus, \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \) and \( \beta \gamma \approx 0.9887 \times 6.667 \approx 6.591 \).

### Step 3: Compute \( L \)
The decay length \( L \) is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \beta \gamma \approx 6.591 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau \approx 2.058 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 6.591 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.058 \times 10^{-24}
\]

First, compute \( 6.591 \times 3 = 19.773 \), then:

\[
L = 19.773 \times 10^8 \times 2.058 \times 10^{-24} = (19.773 \times 2.058) \times 10^{-16}
\]

\[
L \approx 40.7 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} = 4.07 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 4: Match with options
The calculated decay length \( L \approx 4.07 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches closely with option **B**, \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).

Answer: B
