Okay, I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that interplanar distances relate to the crystal structure and some formulas involving the Miller indices. Let me think.

So, rhombohedral crystals. I think they have all sides equal but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. Oh wait, the question says the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral structure with a = b = c, because I think the interatomic distance is the lattice parameter. Wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. So for a rhombohedral system, if a, b, c are all equal, it's like a cube but with angles not 90. So each a, b, c is 10 Angstroms.

The formula for interplanar distance d(hkl) is given by d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 +k^2 + l^2)(cos^2 α + ... ) )). Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, the general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is d = (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - ( (h k (1 - cos α cos β) + ... )) ) ... Hmm, wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for
