Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So the reaction should be something like CH3COOH reacting with NaOH to form CH3COONa and water.

The problem says we diluted 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. So wait, the initial concentration is 0.05 M, but we're adding equal volume of water, so the concentration should be halved, right? Because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration becomes half. So 0.05 divided by 2 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid solution is 0.025 M.

Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, let's think about the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid would have reacted with NaOH to form the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base. Since it's a weak acid, the salt formed, sodium acetate, will hydrolyze in water to make the solution basic. The pH at equivalence point will be greater than 7.

But wait, how do I calculate that? I think I need to find the concentration of the sodium acetate solution at equivalence point and then find the pH from that.

So let's find out the moles of acetic acid we have initially. Volume is 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) and concentration 0.05 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol.

Then, when titrating, the NaOH will react with CH3COOH in a 1:1 ratio. At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol.

The volume of NaOH needed at equivalence point can be calculated using Molarity = moles / volume. So 0.1 M = 0.001 / V → V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 cm³.

Wait, but wait, the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³ (20 +20). So at equivalence point, the total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³. So the concentration of sodium acetate will be moles / total volume. Moles are 0.001, volume is 0.05 L. So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO- ions. The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻

The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Then, I can set up the expression for Kb. Let me think, the initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let x be the [OH-] produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO⁻] ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So equation becomes x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11. So x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is about 1.04e-5 M.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5). Let's calculate that log(1e-5)=5, log(1.04)=0.017, so pOH≈5 + 0.017=5.017. So pH = 14 - 5.017 ≈8.983. Hmm, but none of the options have 8.98. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the calculations again. Maybe I messed up the moles or
