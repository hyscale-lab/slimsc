Okay, let's tackle this Michael addition problem. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through carefully.

First, I remember that the Michael reaction is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. It's a conjugate addition, meaning the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, which is more electrophilic because of the conjugation.

The problem has three parts, A, B, and C. I'll go through each one step by step.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, a strong base, so I think it will deprotonate the malonate to form an enolate. 

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH. When the base deprotonates it, the enolate will have a negative charge on the central carbon. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which has the structure CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but the substituents on the double bond are E, so the p-tolyl group is on one end and the methyl ester on the other.

In the Michael addition, the enolate (from malonate) will attack the beta position of the acrylate. The acrylate has the structure CH2-C(O)OCH3 connected to the p-tolyl group. Wait, no, the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-p-tolyl, but wait, the structure is more accurately (p-tolyl)CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? Wait no, wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)O-. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the end. Hmm, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2-C(=O)OCH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, wait. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? Or is it CH2=CH-p-tolyl with the acrylate as the ester? Maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

The correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the acrylate group as CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but the substituent on the third carbon isn't right. Wait, maybe it's more like CH2=CH-p-tolyl, but that's not an acrylate. Hmm, perhaps I should draw it. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-. So, if it's methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, then the
