Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons, which I think makes it Li-6 because lithium typically has 3 protons and adding 3 neutrons gives a mass number of 6. So Li-6.

Wait, I should remember that in physics, when dealing with heavy ions like this, we often use their mass number as an approximation for their mass. Because protons and neutrons have similar masses, so the mass of the nucleus is roughly the mass of A nucleons, where A is the mass number. So for Li-6, A is 6, so the mass is approximately 6 times the mass of a proton.

The problem is asking for the energy of the ion in the collider. I think in these cases, the energy we're looking for is the total relativistic energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. But wait, sometimes in particle accelerators, the energy given is the kinetic energy, but I'm not sure. Let me think. The options are in GeV, which is a unit of energy. So probably, the question is asking for the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy.

Right, so the formula I need is probably the total energy E = gamma * m_0 c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma first.

So v = 0.96c. Let me plug that into gamma. Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784). What's sqrt(0.0784)? Let me compute that. Hmm, 0.0784 is 784e-4, so sqrt(784) is 28, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714286.

Wait, let me recalculate
