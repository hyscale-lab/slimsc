Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll walk through it step by step. Let me read the question again and break it down.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and we can assume local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that in LTE, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the ratio they are looking at is n1/n2. Since the question says the ratio decreases when there are spots, that means n1/n2 is lower when T is lower. So the ratio (n1/n2) without spots is higher than when spots are present. So the factor by which it changes is (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted.

Wait, no, the ratio being observed is the ratio of the number of neutral Ti in level 1 to level 2. So if the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that means (n1/n2)_spotted < (n1/n2)_unspotted. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted.

To compute this, I'll need the temperatures when the star is unspotted and when it's spotted. The unspotted Teff is 6000 K, and the spotted is 5500 K.

Wait, but wait a second. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff decreases. But how does that affect the photosphere? Well, in LTE, each region (spot or unspotted) emits according to its own temperature. But wait, in the case where spots cover a part of the star, the overall spectrum is a mix of the spotted and unspotted regions. But when the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K, that's an average. Wait, but if the star's surface is a mix of spots at a lower temperature and the rest at 6000 K, then the total flux would be a combination. However, the problem states that the overall effective temperature is 5500 K, which might be the effective temperature of
