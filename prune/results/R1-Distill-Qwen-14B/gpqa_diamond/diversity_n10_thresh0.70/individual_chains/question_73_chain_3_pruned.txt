Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics because that doesn't account for relativistic effects. So I should probably use Einstein's theory of relativity here.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So the first thing I need to figure out is their relative speed. Wait, relative to each other, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, their relative speed isn't just the difference as it would be in classical mechanics.

I think the formula for relative velocity in relativity is different. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). But wait, I need to make sure I'm plugging in the correct values. Since both are moving in the same direction, v1 is the speed of the first astronaut, 0.6c, and v2 is 0.5c. So plugging those in: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²).

Let me calculate the numerator first: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator would be 1 - (0.3c²)/c². Oh, since c squared is c², that simplifies to 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.142857c. That's roughly 0.143c, which I can round to 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Now for the total energy of the system. Each astronaut is a relativistic mass, so their energies would be their rest mass energies multiplied by the gamma factor. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c: gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So the energy E1 is gamma1 * m_rest * c². Wait, wait, the mass is 2m, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

For the second astronaut with mass 3m and speed 0.5c: gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Let me compute that. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660, so gamma2 is about 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m * c² = 1.1547 * 3m c
