Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully.

The question has two reactions, and I need to find the correct reagents A and B from the options provided.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN, with reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O), giving 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, I need to figure out what reagents A and B are.

Let me start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? When it reacts with NaCN, that's sodium cyanide. I'm trying to remember what kind of reaction that is. Oh wait, ketones reacting with CN- usually undergo nucleophilic addition. So the mechanism would be the ketone's carbonyl carbon attacking the cyanide ion. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, so the product after addition would be a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with CN- in a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, so the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The cyanide would be attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl group, which is adjacent to the methyl groups.
