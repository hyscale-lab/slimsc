Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I need to remember what each spectrograph can observe. From the question, ESPRESSO can see stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So, any star that's brighter than 17 mag would be observable by ESPRESSO, and anything brighter than 16 would be observable by HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "brighter than" so higher magnitude numbers are fainter. Oh right, because lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star's V magnitude is less than 17, ESPRESSO can see it, and less than 16 for HIRES. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes.

But wait, the question is about stars that can be detected with both. So the star's apparent V magnitude has to be less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Because if a star is brighter than 17, it can be observed by ESPRESSO. But for HIRES, it needs to be brighter than 16. So for a star to be observable by both, its V magnitude must be less than (brighter than) 16 mag, because that's the more restrictive condition. Because
