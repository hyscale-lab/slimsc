Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. When the star rotates, these spots come into view, causing changes in brightness that look like a planet transiting the star. The question is asking what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star. The options are A to D.

Hmm, so I think this is about calculating the light curve variation caused by the star's spots and comparing it to the variation caused by a planet. The key here is probably to find the fractional change in brightness in both cases and set them equal.

First, let's break down what's happening with the star's spots. The star has a radius R equal to the Sun's radius, R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, so if the star is a sphere, each hemisphere is half the surface. But the problem says one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%, so that's 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. Or wait, perhaps the total spot coverage is 20% of the entire star's surface? Because a hemisphere is half, so 20% of the entire surface would mean 40% of one hemisphere. Wait, the wording says 'filling factor of 20% for one hemisphere' — I think that means that 20% of that hemisphere is covered in spots. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (π R² / 2), since a hemisphere's area is half the total surface area.

Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of a surface area. So if the spots are covering 20% of the hemisphere, then it's 0.2 * (π R² / 2). But wait, when a star rotates, the spots come into view. Since it's only one hemisphere, when the star is viewed from Earth, as it rotates, the spots will be visible for 50% of the rotation period? So the brightness variation is due to the spots covering a certain fraction of the star's disk as seen from Earth.

But for the exoplanet case, the planet transiting the star would block a fraction of the star's light, equal to (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area blocked is π R_p² / π R_s² = (R_p/R_s)^2.

So the problem is to find R_p such that the change in brightness from the planet transit equals the change from the star's spots.

Wait, but the star's spots are cooler. So when the spots are in view, the total brightness is lower than when they're not. The star's flux when not spotted is F0 = σ Teff^4, but when the spots are visible, the flux decreases because the spots emit less.

Wait, but the way the problem is framed is that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots on one hemisphere. When the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the observed flux varies as the spots rotate in and out of view.

But the question says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the observed brightness variation is the same as that caused by a planet transiting the star. So we can model both scenarios and set their amplitude equal.

Let me think about the two cases:

1. Star with spots:
   - When the spots are on the side facing us, the observed flux is lower.
   - The change in flux is the difference between the normal flux and the flux when spots are visible.

2. Exoplanet transit:
   - The planet blocks a part of the star's disk, causing a dip in flux proportional to the area blocked.

So I need to calculate the relative change in flux (ΔF/F) for both cases and set them equal.

First, let's compute
