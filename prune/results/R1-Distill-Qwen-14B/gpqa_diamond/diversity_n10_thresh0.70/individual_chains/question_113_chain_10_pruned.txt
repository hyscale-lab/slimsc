Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The compound could be one of four options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. The data given includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.

First, I'll break down each of the spectroscopic clues and see what they tell me about the structure.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, another thing—could it be something else? Maybe an -OH group. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 peak is often a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring's C=C stretching or conjugated carbonyl. Hmm, sometimes an aromatic ring with substituents can have a peak around 1650. Wait, but if there's a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester or a ketone or something similar. Also, the 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, like in a conjugated ester or maybe an aromatic ketone.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, perhaps. So that suggests an alkene is present.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I'm trying to think what fragments have a mass of 45. Common fragments include CH3COO- (which is 45 for the molecular ion?), but wait, what's the molecular weight of that? CH3COO is C2H3O2. Let me calculate: 12*2 + 1*3 + 16*2 = 24 +3 +32=59? No, that's not
