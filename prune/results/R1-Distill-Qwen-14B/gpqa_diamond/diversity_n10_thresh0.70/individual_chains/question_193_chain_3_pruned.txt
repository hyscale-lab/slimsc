Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance. The given relationship is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle at which the position of a star appears to shift when observed from different points in Earth's orbit. The formula I recall is that distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax, so d = 1/plx. Oh wait, right, because closer stars have larger parallaxes, so the parallax decreases as the distance increases.

So, the question is about N as a function of distance. Parallax is 1/d, so plx = 1/d. Let's substitute that into the given relationship. N is proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Wait no, the given is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. So plugging plx = 1/d into that, N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 ). Let me compute that: 1 divided by (1/d)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question isn't directly asking how N changes with distance d, but how it changes per unit range of distance r. Hmm, I think that part is about the differential, like the number of stars per unit distance.

Wait, the original statement says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But the question is about the change in the number of stars with distance. Like, how does the number increase as you go further. But more importantly, it's per unit range of distance. So maybe it's about the number of stars in a shell between r and r+dr. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let's think again. The relation given is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, which is N ∝ d^5
