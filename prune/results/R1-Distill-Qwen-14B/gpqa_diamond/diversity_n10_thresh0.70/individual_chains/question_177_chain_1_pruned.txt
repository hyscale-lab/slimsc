Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I need to figure out by how much Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. 

Alright, let's break down the information given. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh wait, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. Hmm, but wait, the mass probably doesn't directly affect the luminosity here. Wait, no, because the problem says they compute the luminosity based on black body radiation, so probably using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's interesting. So they have the same peak wavelength. I remember from my studies that Wien's law relates the peak wavelength to the temperature. Wien's displacement law says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if the lambda_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda_max is the same, T is the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. Wait, but the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that would mean the same peak emission. So yes, same temperature.

So if both stars have the same temperature, then their luminosity would depend on their radius. Because the Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πR²σT
