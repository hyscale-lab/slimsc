Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, astronomers are studying a star. The star has 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, they're looking at the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition corresponds to about 1448 Ã…, and LTE is assumed.

Hmm. Okay, so I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights for each level, and E2>E1.

So, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) )

Wait, or is it n2/n1? Because if E2 is higher than E1, then when T is high, more populate the higher level. So n2 would be higher when T is higher. So the ratio depends on temperature.

But in this problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K instead of 6000 K.

Wait, but the star's photosphere might be cooler when spots are present. Wait, but spots are cooler regions. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature is 5500 K. So compared to when no spots, the star's overall T is lower.

But the question is about the ratio n1/n2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So when the star is cooler, the ratio is lower. So we need to find (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_spots.

Wait, let me think. Suppose without spots, the temperature is higher, so the ratio
