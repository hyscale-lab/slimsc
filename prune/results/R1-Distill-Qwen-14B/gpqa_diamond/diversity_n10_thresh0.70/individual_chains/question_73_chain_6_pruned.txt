Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just add them normally because of Einstein's relativity. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So I think the first step is to find the relative speed between them. But wait, relative to each other. Oh wait, no, because they're moving in the same direction. So the relative speed isn't just 0.6c minus 0.5c, which would be 0.1c. But wait, in relativity, velocities don't add like that when they're a significant fraction of c.

Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Or wait, is it (v1 + v2)/(1 + (v1 v2)/(c²)) when they're moving in opposite directions? No, in this case, same direction, so it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

So let's plug in the numbers. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So the numerator is 0.6c -0.5c=0.1c. The
