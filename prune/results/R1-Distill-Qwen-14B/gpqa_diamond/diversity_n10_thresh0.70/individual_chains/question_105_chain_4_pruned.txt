Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about a star that's similar in radius to the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler because their temperature is 1000 K less. The question is about how this setup would produce a brightness variation that looks like an exoplanet's signal. We need to find the radius of such a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star to produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Hmm, first, I think I should recall how exoplanet detection works, especially the transit method. When a planet passes in front of its star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula I remember is that the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) is approximately (Rp/Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

But wait, the star in this question isn't just being transited by a planet. Instead, it's got these dark spots. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective, causing brightness variations. But since the spots are dark, their presence would decrease the brightness when they're facing us. Or wait, no. When the spot is on the part of the star facing us (the hemisphere we're looking at), it would make the star appear dimmer because that area is cooler.

Wait, the star's one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So 20% of that hemisphere is spots. But wait, the star is a sphere, so the total area covered by spots would be 0.2 * (4π R^2 / 2), because one hemisphere is spotty? Or no, maybe the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere we see. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the star's radius is the same as the Sun's. So Rstar = R_sun. The spots are cooler; Teff is 6000 K, spots are 5000 K. The brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view as the star spins.

But the question says that this situation can be confused with an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is similar to what we'd get from a planet transiting the star.

So the problem is asking, what planet radius would cause the same dip in brightness as the star's spots do.

So first, I need to compute the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots. Then, set that equal to the fractional change caused by a planet, and solve for Rp/Rstar.

Wait, let me break it down.

When a spot is on the visible hemisphere, it contributes less to the star's total brightness. The total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the spotted regions and the unspotted
