Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K, which is about 3 degrees Celsius. Wait, which substance has a melting point around there? Hmm, maybe something like iodine? No, iodine's higher. Maybe something else... Oh, wait, maybe water? No, water freezes at 273 K, which is 0 degrees. So 277 K is a bit higher, maybe 4 degrees. Hmm, that's about normal melting point of something else. Maybe something like a solid at room temp but melting a bit higher than water?

Wait, another thought: maybe B is a compound. Or perhaps I'm thinking about the wrong substance. Let me think of the melting points. For example, maybe something like B is a solid that's just a bit above 0°C. Wait, maybe it's ammonium chloride? No, I don't know. Or maybe it's a metal, but most metals melt much higher. Hmm, I'm not sure yet, but let's move on and see if other parts give me more info.

The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, each molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about gases: common ones are H2, O2, N2, CH4, CO2, NH3, H2O, etc. Let's check their protons and neutrons.

Hydrogen gas (H2): each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So W can't be H2 because neutrons are 0, protons 1—not equal. What about O2? Oxygen has 8 protons. The isotope would be O-16, which has 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 8 protons and 8 neutrons each. So total per molecule: 2*(8 protons and 8 neutrons). Wait, but the question says the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So for O2, each molecule has (8*2) protons and (8*2) neutrons. So 16 protons and 16 neutrons per molecule. So same number. So W could be O2. Or maybe another gas.

Another possibility is CO2. Carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (if it's C-12). Oxygen has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (O-16). So CO2 would have (6 + 2*8) = 22 protons. Neutrons: (6 + 2*8)=22. So each CO2 molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that would fit. But CO2 is a gas, yes, but would it form when X reacts with Y?

Wait, but maybe another gas. Let me think of other possibilities. Maybe CH4? Let's see: C has 6 protons, H has 1. So CH4 has 6+4=10 protons. Neutrons: C is 6 (if C-12), H has 0. So neutrons are 6. So 10 protons vs 6 neutrons—nope, not equal. So that doesn't fit. What about H2O? Each H has 1, O has 8. So H2O has 2 H (each 1p, 0n) and O (8p, 8n). Total protons per molecule: 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons per molecule: 0 + 8 =8. 10 vs 8. Not equal. So no.

Wait, what about Argon? Ar is a noble gas, monoatomic. Ar has 18 protons and 18 neutrons (in Ar-40, the most common). So Ar has same number of p and n. So
