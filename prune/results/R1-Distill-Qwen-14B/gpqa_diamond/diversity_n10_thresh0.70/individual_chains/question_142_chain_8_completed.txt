Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through. The question gives me a density matrix and asks for its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are points in 3D space, which is a bit confusing because qubits are two-level systems, but I remember something about Bloch spheres and vectors in 3D.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think this is a maximally mixed state. Because each of the basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ has an equal probability, right? So the density matrix is diagonal with 1/2 on the diagonal. That makes sense for a completely mixed state, which would be represented as a point on the surface of the Bloch sphere, but where exactly?

I remember the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, any state can be represented as a vector on the unit sphere in 3D space. The state |0⟩ is at (1,0,0), and |1⟩ is at (0,0,1). But wait, what about mixed states? Oh right, the density matrix of a pure state has a trace of 1 and is idempotent (ρ² = ρ). But for a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture.

Wait, the density matrix given here is ρ = I/2, right? Because |0⟩⟨0| is a projector, same with |1⟩⟨1|. Adding them gives the identity matrix when multiplied by 2. So ρ is (I)/2. 

In terms of the Bloch sphere, each density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in 3D space (like (x,y,z)) and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if ρ = I/2, that implies that r must be zero because (I + 0)/2 = I/2. 

So the vector r is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that must be the answer. 

Wait, let me double-check. For a pure state, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. For example, |0⟩ would be [[1,0],[0,0]], which is different from ρ here. Our ρ has both diagonal elements as 1/2, so it's a mixed state, not a pure state. The Bloch vector for a mixed state would be somewhere inside the sphere, not on the surface. But since r is zero, it's the completely mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Yes, I think that's right. So the geometrical position is the origin in the Bloch sphere coordinates, which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|\right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector in 3D space. For the given \(\rho\), it is evident that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), as there is no contribution from the Pauli matrices. This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the point \((0, 0, 0)\) corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the geometrical position of the given density matrix.

Answer: C
