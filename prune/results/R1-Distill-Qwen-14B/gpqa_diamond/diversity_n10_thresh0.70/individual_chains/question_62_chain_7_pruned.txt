Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize it. So it's a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a cyclohexyl group attached to a carbon that also has a hydroxyl group and a methyl group (wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is a bit tricky). Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexane carbaldehyde, meaning there's a carbonyl group attached. The substituent is on the number 1 position, which is the same as the aldehyde. So the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH3? Or wait, no, maybe the substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw this out. So the main ring is cyclohexane. On carbon 1 (which is adjacent to the aldehyde group), there's a substituent. That substituent is a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. So it's like CH2-Cyclohexyl-OH attached to the main ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group attached to the main ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like cyclohexane with an aldehyde group (so RCO) and at the same carbon where the aldehyde is, a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH3? Wait, maybe I should look for functional groups.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (-C≡C-) attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH.

I need to get from ethynylcyclohexane to this target molecule. Let's think about the possible reactions.

The target has an al
