Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the capabilities of each spectrograph. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So if a star's V magnitude is less than or equal to 17, ESPRESSO can see it. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the star's V mag must be ≤16 to be visible.

Wait, no, wait. Because if the limit is brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO, that means m_v < 17. Similarly, for HIRES, m_v <16. So the lower the magnitude, the brighter the star. So a star that's too faint (high magnitude) won't be observable.

Now, the question is about which stars can be detected by both. So both spectrographs must be able to observe the same star. That means the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 (for ESPRESSO) and less than 16 (for HIRES). So the star's m_v needs to be ≤16 because 16 is a stricter limit than 17. Because if a star is 16 mag, it's bright enough for both (since HIRES can go to 16, ESPRESSO can go to 17, so 16 is okay for both).

But wait, no. Because if a star is exactly at 17, ESPRESSO can observe it, but HIRES can't. So for a star to be detected by both, it's m_v must be ≤16. So only stars with m_v ≤16 can be detected by both.

Now, let's look at each star:

Star1: It says absolute V magnitude (M_v) is 15.5, and distance is 10 pc. So apparent magnitude (m_v) is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d is 10, so log(1)=0. m_v =15.5 + 0=15.5. So m_v=15.5, which is
