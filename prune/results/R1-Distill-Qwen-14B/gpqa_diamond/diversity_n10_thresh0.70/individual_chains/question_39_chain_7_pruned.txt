Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand.

We have a large number of identical systems, each with a particle that's the same and under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Here, i is the square root of -1, and sqrt is the square root function.

When they measure the position of the particles, none were found at x < 1 or x > 3. So all the particles are found only between x=1 and x=3. I need to find the value of 'a' from the given options.

Hmm, wait. So the wave function is given, but I remember that for a wave function to be physically valid, it must be normalizable. That means the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Oh, wait, but wait—the wave function given is ψ(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x) - 0.5i. Wait, that can't be right... Because in quantum mechanics, the wave function can have a complex value, but the probability density must be real and non-negative. The probability density is |ψ(x)|².

Wait, but the way the wave function is written, it's a complex function. So that's okay, but the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1 because all the particles are found in that region, implying that the wave function is zero outside, and normalized within this interval.

Wait, but looking at the wave function, it's (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Wait, that seems a bit odd. Because that would imply that the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, since |a + ib|^2 is a² + b². So |ψ(x)|² would be [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

But wait, that would mean the probability density is a function of x, so when we integrate from 1 to 3, that integral should be 1.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Yes, because the wave function is given as a function that's non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

So, ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me write that down:

Integral_{1}^{3} [ (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1

I can split this into two integrals:

Integral [a²/(1 + x)] dx + Integral [0.25] dx, from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part separately.

First integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. So evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2)

Because ln(4) is ln(2²)=2 ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3.

That's 0.25*(3 - 1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So adding both parts together:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1

Solving for a²:

a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5
a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Calculate ln(2) ≈ 0.6931

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202

Taking square root: a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close to this value.

Wait, but let me double-check the initial setup. Did I correctly model the wave function and the normalization?

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Yes, that's correct because (a + ib)^2 modulus is a² + b
