Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read through it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star with some dark spots on one hemisphere. The star has the same radius as the Sun, an effective temperature of 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. The filling factor of the spots is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The setup is that when the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The problem says that this situation can look like an exoplanet causing the same brightness dip when it transits the star.

We need to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would create the same amplitude in the star's light curve as these spots do. So, essentially, comparing the effect of the spots to the effect of a planet.

Wait, but wait. The question says, "if the star was not covered by spots, what would the exoplanet's radius be to produce the same amplitude?" Hmm, no, actually, the question is phrased as: the situation (spots) can resemble an exoplanet. So, to get the same signal amplitude, what's Rpl/Rstar?

So, the approach is to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, then find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude.

I remember that the change in brightness when a planet transits a star is given by the formula delta F = (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the planet blocks a part of the star's light, and the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But wait, in this case, it's not a planet transiting, but spots on the star causing brightness variations. So, when the spots rotate into and out of view, the brightness changes. The amplitude of this variation depends on the total area of the spots and their temperature difference relative to the star.

So, the first step is to calculate the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the fractional change caused by a planet transit.

Let me break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the brightness variation due to the spots.

The star's brightness is a function of its surface area and temperature. The spots are cooler, so when they are facing us (on the hemisphere), the total brightness is
