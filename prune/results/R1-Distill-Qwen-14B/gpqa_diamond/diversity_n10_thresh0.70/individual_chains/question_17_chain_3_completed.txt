Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds to metal ions like calcium. 

The problem states that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. They also give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Wait, K here is probably the stability constant for the Ca-EDTA complex. 

So, I remember that the stability constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA²−, right? And K is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). 

But wait, in this solution, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA, but with such a high K value, the dissociation must be really low. 

So, let me think about the assumption here. Because K is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable, meaning that it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be very low. That's probably why we have to find it.

So, the initial complex concentration is 0.02 M. Let's denote the change as x. So, the complex dissociates as follows:

CaEDTA²− ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4− 

At equilibrium, the concentrations would be:

[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is small, because K is large)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x

So plugging into the K expression:

K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) 
5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x)
5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Wait, solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12 / 5e10? Wait, no, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 equals (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/(5e12)) )= 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 x10^-13, square root is 2 x10^-6.5. Oh wait, 10^-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 → about 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That matches. So the answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentrations are:
- \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since dissociation is negligible due to the large \( K \)),
- \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\),
- \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\).

The stability constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
