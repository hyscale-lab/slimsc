Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their fluxes in different energy bands. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, what's the pp-III branch again? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy for the Sun. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, then there's pp-II and pp-III. Oh right, the pp-III branch is probably the part where helium-4 captures a proton to become helium-5, which then emits a positron and turns into helium-4 again. Or wait, maybe it's the part where it goes from boron to other isotopes. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, but I think the pp-III branch is a specific part of the proton-proton cycle.

So, if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, what happens? Well, the pp-III reactions are part of the Sun's fusion processes. If they stop, that part of the energy production would cease. But how does this affect the neutrino flux here on Earth?

Neutrinos are produced in various nuclear reactions in the Sun. The main ones are the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. I think the pp chain produces more neutrinos overall, but the CNO cycle might have higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, we need to figure out how the stopping of the pp-III branch affects the number of neutrinos in these two bands.

When pp-III stops, perhaps the neutrinos produced in that process are no longer emitted. But how much of the total neutrino flux comes from that process?

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact energy ranges of the neutrinos from the different processes. Let me think. The pp chain produces lower-energy neutrinos compared to the CNO cycle. The CNO neutrinos are higher energy because the reactions involve heavier nuclei.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the production of certain neutrinos (probably lower energy) would stop. Let's assume that the pp-III neutrinos are in the lower energy bands, like maybe around a few hundred keV, but I
