Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and we can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i), where τ_i is the lifetime of state i.

So for state 1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * 1e-9). Similarly, for state 2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8).

Wait, let me compute these uncertainties. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But perhaps it's easier to work in eV·seconds. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules.

So, let me calculate ΔE for each state.

First, for state 1:

ΔE1 = ħ / (2 * τ1)
= (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s)
= 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-9
= 5.272859e-26 J.

Convert J to eV: since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so J = eV * 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 = 5.272859e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, maybe I did that calculation wrong. Let me check again.

Wait, when you have J, and you divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV, you get eV.

So 5.272859e-26 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV is:

5.272859e-26 / 1.602e-19 = approx 3.29e-7 eV. So around 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, but ħ is about 6.582e-16 eV·s. Oh, I think that's a useful number here. Because ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. So let me use that.

So ΔE1 = ħ / (2 τ1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV. Yep, same as before.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / (2 * τ2) = (6.582e-16) / (2 * 1e-8) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again. 2 * 1e-8 is 2e-8. 6.582e-16 divided by 2e-8 is 3.291e-8 eV.

So now, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, I guess. Or perhaps just larger than the individual uncertainties? Hmm. Because if they have their own uncertainties, the energy difference needs to be bigger than both to be distinguishable.

Wait, but wait, the formula is that the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Because each state has an uncertainty in its energy. So if the difference is larger than the sum, then they are clearly separate.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more about the uncertainty of the difference. Because when you measure the energy, you have uncertainties in each.

Wait, maybe the uncertainty in the energy difference Δ(E2-E1) would be the combination of the uncertainties in E2 and E1. Since the difference is E2 - E1, the uncertainty would be sqrt( (ΔE2)^2 + (ΔE1)^2 ) ), assuming the uncertainties are independent. But if one is much larger than the other, perhaps the larger one dominates.

But let's see
