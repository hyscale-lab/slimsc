Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H groups because of the hydrogen bonding. So maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid, but carboxylic acids usually have really strong and broad O-H stretches. Wait, but sometimes alcohols also show broad peaks. Hmm.

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Those are in the region of carbonyl groups. 1700 is typical for a carbonyl like a ketone or an ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be an conjugated carbonyl, like maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group such as in an ester or a ketone with some conjugation. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an amide, but amides usually have lower carbonyl absorption, like around 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an ester or a ketone with some conjugation—like maybe a ketone next to a double bond.

Looking at the NMR: several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond somewhere. So maybe an alkene is present. So maybe it's an ester with a double bond or a ketone with a double bond?

Now the mass spec: fragment peak at m/z 45. I know that m/z 45 is a common fragment, especially for things like (CH3)2O, but wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. So what has a molecular ion fragment at 45? Let me think—common fragments include (CH3)2CO (which is 58), or maybe CH3COO- (which is 60), but wait, 45 is maybe (CH3)2O is 45. But wait, (CH3)2O is 45. Alternatively
