Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax of a star is the apparent shift in its position relative to background stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. The formula I think is parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance.

Wait, right. So if a star is closer, it has a larger parallax. As distance increases, parallax decreases. So high parallax means nearby stars, low parallax means far away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Oh, I think it probably means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So the number of stars per cubic parsec is the same everywhere. So n(r) = constant.

Wait, but how does that relate to parallax? Because parallax depends on distance. So I need to find how the number of stars in a given parallax range (like between plx and plx + dplx) depends on plx.

So let's think about the volume of space corresponding to a certain parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d is 1/plx. So for a given plx, the distance is d = 1/plx. If I consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume would be 4
