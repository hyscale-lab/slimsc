Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using a formula involving the unit cell parameters and the plane's Miller indices. 

Wait, rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal but the angles are not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, all angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. Oh right, a rhombohedral unit cell has a = b = c, but angles can vary. So the lattice is rhombohedral, and the given interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the lattice parameter 'a' in such a structure, right? So a = 10 Å.

The interplanar distance formula for a crystal is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + kl + lh) * cos terms... Wait, no, wait. There's a general formula for any crystal system. Oh right, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) * (1 - 2*cos α + cos² α) ) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, for a rhombohedral system, there's a specific formula. I think the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l
