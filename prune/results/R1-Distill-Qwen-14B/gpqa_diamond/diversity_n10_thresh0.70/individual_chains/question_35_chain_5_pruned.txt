Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me think. I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. The question gives me the form of the operator Ay as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. 

Wait, the first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. Oh right, that looks familiar. I think S is similar to the Pauli matrices. Let me recall: the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S must be the Pauli Y matrix. 

So the operator Ay is given by c * S, which is (h/(4π)) multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix. 

The problem is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. I need to find the correct statement among the options.

First, let's find the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of a matrix are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So, Ay is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out. Since Ay = c * S, and S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], then Ay becomes [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]. 

The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ, but wait, no. Wait, the Pauli Y matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But here, Ay is scaled by c. 

Wait, the eigenvalues of S (Pauli Y) are ±1. Because S^2 = I. So the eigenvalues of S are ±1. Therefore, when you multiply by c, the eigenvalues of Ay are c*(±1). So a = c*1 and a = c*(-1). 

What's c? c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). 

So looking at the options, which one says that? Option A says the imaginary part is ±2π h and real part ±h/(4π). Wait, that doesn't make sense. The eigenvalues are real or imaginary? Wait, no, the Pauli matrices have real eigenvalues. Oh wait, S is the Pauli Y, which has eigenvalues ±1, which are
