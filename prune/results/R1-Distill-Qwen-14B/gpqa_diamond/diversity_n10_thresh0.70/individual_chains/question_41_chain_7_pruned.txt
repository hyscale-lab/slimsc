Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, there are some principles from special relativity that might come into play, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking, what's the speed of the light relative to the observer?

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. Interesting. So the glass is moving along with the light, but it's also moving towards the observer. Hmm, not sure how that affects things yet.

I recall that in a medium at rest, the speed of light is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But what happens when the medium itself is moving?

Wait a second, I think this has to do with how velocities add according to special relativity. Because when you have a medium moving, the speed of light in that medium might not just be a simple addition of velocities.

Wait, but wait. The glass is moving at velocity v. The light is propagating through the glass, so in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. But how does that translate when the glass is moving?

Alternatively, maybe we can use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula for
