Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I remember that metrics in general relativity describe the geometry of spacetime, but here maybe it's a 2-dimensional space since the metric has dx² and dy² terms.

The given metric is ds² = (32) / (4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like the metric for a sphere but scaled somehow. Oh right, because when I think about the metric for a sphere of radius a, it's usually something like (a²/(x² + y² + z²)) or something similar, but in spherical coordinates. Wait, but this seems to be in Cartesian coordinates.

Wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². Hmm, 4 is a square of 2, so maybe this is related to a sphere of radius 2? Because if x² + y² + z² = 4, that's a sphere with radius 2. But here, the metric is only in dx² and dy² terms, so maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in 3D. Oh wait, perhaps it's a 2D space, but the denominator 4 - x² - y² suggests that x² + y² <4, so the region is inside a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Wait, but then what's the area?

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, but I'm not sure. Or wait, in general relativity, a pseudosphere could be a surface with a specific metric leading to certain properties.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is that of a hyperbolic space or something similar. Wait, but the denominator here is 4 - x² - y², which would be positive if x² + y² <4, so it's a positive function. So the metric is ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). So the line element is scaled by this factor.

I'm trying to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, a pseudosphere might be a type of surface in geometry. Or maybe it's a sphere with imaginary radius, which would have a hyperbolic geometry?

Wait, the area of a sphere in 2D (a circle) is 4πr². But
