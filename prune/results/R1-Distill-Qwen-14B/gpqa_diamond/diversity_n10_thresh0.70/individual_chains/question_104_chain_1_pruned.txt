Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet, and both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The planets' orbits are circular.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom periodic shift in the spectral lines of its host star. Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift in the spectral lines of its host. The question is how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum as it moves due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit (which is usually assumed to be 90 degrees for maximum effect, I think). Also, the star's mass comes into play because a more massive star wouldn't move as much for the same planet.

Wait, the formula for the Doppler shift (or the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve) is something like K = (v) where v is the velocity. But I think the formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (P * (1 day)) )^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something else? No, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to recall the formula that relates the semi-amplitude of the RV signal (K) to the orbital period (P), the mass of the planet (M_p), the mass of the star (M_*), and other constants. I think the formula is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) / ( (P)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term becomes 1. Also, since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so the denominator simplifies.

Wait, maybe
