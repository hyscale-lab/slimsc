Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The question says it's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the concentration of that complex is 0.02 M. The temperature is 25 degrees Celsius, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant (Kf) is given, which tells us how strong the complex is. A high Kf means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

The formula for the formation constant is probably important here. I think the reaction is something like Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, and the Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Oh wait, but in the problem, the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex, so the concentration given is the total concentration of the complex, which is 0.02 M.

Wait, but I think the total concentration is the sum of the complex and any dissociated ions. But since Kf is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable. That means the dissociation into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- is minimal. So the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions should be very low.

So, the idea is that the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is approximately equal to the total concentration of Ca-EDTA, which is 0.02 M. Because the complex doesn't break apart much, the free Ca^2+ comes almost entirely from this dissociation.

But wait, the problem states it's a stoichiometric solution. Oh, right, stoichiometric usually means that the molar ratio is 1:1. So for every mole of CaEDTA^2-, there's one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA^4- in the complex.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But some of it dissociates. Let me set up the variables.

Let’s let x be the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions that dissociate from the complex. So [Ca^2+] = x. Similarly, [
