Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. Okay, so the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage structure. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure.

The first step is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. Oh right, when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. Wait, but in this case, it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Wait, vicinal is 1,2, so if it's 1,3, that's not vicinal. Oh wait, maybe that's not the case. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a neighboring group participation or some cage effect because adamantane is a rigid structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination. Oh wait, when a dihalide is treated with KOH, especially in a strong base condition, if it's a 1,3-dihalide, perhaps it can eliminate two equivalents of HBr to form a diene? Or maybe a cyclic compound?

Wait, but looking at the product description, it's a light yellow solid. Also, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone. So, maybe the product is a ketone. How does that happen?

Wait, if KOH is in excess, perhaps we're looking at a dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a carbonyl. Oh wait, the Hofmann elimination? No, Hofmann is more about amines. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 elimination to form an alkene, but then what gives a carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps it's a di-elimination. Let me think: 1,3-dibromo... if both Brs are eliminated, then we lose two HBr molecules. So, if we have two adjacent Brs, but in 1,3 positions, maybe the structure allows for the elimination of both, leading to a conjugated diene. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's not a diene.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I don't think KOH would do that. Wait, maybe it's more about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has four equivalent chair-like positions. So, maybe the 1 and 3 positions are such that elimination would form a bridgehead double bond, which isn't allowed due to Bredt's rule. So, perhaps the base induces a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: when two adjacent bromides are present, perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbocation, but that's more for formation of alkenes. Alternatively, maybe the base induces a rearrangement.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So, perhaps the product is an epoxide? No, epoxides don't have a strong carbonyl peak. Alternatively, a ketone. How could dihalide become a ketone upon treatment with KOH? Maybe a pinacol rearrangement? But that's for diols, converting them into ketones.

Wait, another thought: maybe the base induces an elimination followed by a cyclization. Wait, but in what way would the elimination form a carbonyl?

Wait, let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid with four cyclohexane rings fused together. Each bridgehead carbon is connected to two rings. So, 1 and 3 positions are adjacent bridgeheads. When KOH is added, maybe each Br undergoes elimination, but how?

Wait, perhaps each Br is removed, and the adjacent carbons form a double bond. But wait, bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to Bredt's rule. So maybe this isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure allows for a different elimination.

Wait, wait a second. Maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and when KOH is added, it abstracts a hydrogen from a neighboring carbon. Let me imagine the structure.

Adamantane has four chair-like cyclohexane rings. The bridgeheads are connected in a way that each bridgehead carbon is connected to two adjacent bridgeheads. So, if 1 and 3 are bridgeheads, then perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from each adjacent carbon, leading to two E2 eliminations, forming a ring contraction or expansion.

Alternatively, maybe it's more likely that the two bromides are on adjacent carbons that are not bridgeheads. Wait, but the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a loss of HBr from each bromide, but in a way that forms a carbonyl group. Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the NMR data. The product 1 has an NMR with a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe oxygen. The 1.94 ppm (2H) is maybe another CH2 group, and the 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) suggests a lot of CH groups in a rigid structure, maybe adamantane's characteristic peaks.

Wait, the triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, maybe an ether or an ester. But the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, which is more like a ketone or an ester. If it's a ketone, then maybe the product is adamantanone. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol that's been oxidized, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, wait, another approach: if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules and forming a conjugated diene. But then, why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the reaction conditions. KOH in excess and high temperature. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Wait, how? Oh, wait! Maybe it's a case of the formation of a ketone via elimination of two equivalents of HBr.

Wait, that would require that each elimination forms a double bond but in a way that leads to a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a double bond, but in a way that results in a ring expansion or contraction, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a case of the formation of a geminal di-elimination. For example, if two adjacent carbons each lose a Br and a hydrogen, forming a double bond. But if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, that could form a double bond between them. However, for bridgehead carbons, that's not allowed, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure allows for a rearrangement such as a pinacol-like elimination. Wait, pinacol rearrangement is when a 1,2-diol is treated with acid to form a carbonyl. But we're dealing with dihalide and a base.

Wait, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation forming an olefin, but the structure of adamantane makes it so that the olefin is not possible, leading to a different product. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a ring contraction, forming a ketone.

Wait, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination of two HBr molecules, forms a bicyclic structure with a ketone. For example, if the two Brs are on adjacent positions, their elimination would form a bridge, but that might not directly form the ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. Wait, but I'm not sure how that would work with two Brs.

Wait, perhaps each Br is removed, but instead of forming a double bond, the elimination leads to a carbonyl. So, maybe each Br is replaced by an oxygen group, but that doesn't seem likely.

Wait, another approach: the product after KOH treatment is a light yellow solid, which is often the case with ketones. So, maybe the product is 1,3-diketone adamantane, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Or perhaps it's a single ketone.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. The triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, perhaps as an ether or an ester. The 10H between 2.41-2.23 ppm are probably the adamantane's CH groups. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be another CH2 group adjacent to the oxygen.

Wait, another possibility: the product is an epoxide. But epoxides typically have a triplet for the CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen. But in this case, the triplet is at 4.79, which is more downfield, which is more in line with an ether or a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol, but the IR doesn't show OH stretches, but the IR does show a strong carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. So, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and after elimination, we have a ketone. How?

Wait, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and upon elimination, the structure forms a bridge that includes a ketone group. For example, perhaps each bridgehead Br is replaced by a carbonyl group, but that would require two ketones, which would complicate the IR. Alternatively, perhaps only one Br is eliminated, but that doesn't fit with the NMR data.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is not acting as a base but as a nucleophile. But in that case, substitution would give a product with K. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would suggest a potassium-containing compound.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantanone. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, loses two HBr to form a double bond, but due to the structure, that double bond might not be possible, leading to some rearrangement that forms a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the base causes a neighboring group participation, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. For example, if a hydride is shifted during elimination.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on this first step, but perhaps I should move forward. Once I have product 1, which is a ketone, then product 2 is made by heating with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, since product 1 has a ketone, perhaps it's involved in some kind of acylation.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone, so if it's reacted with a Friedel-Crafts reagent, perhaps it's used to form another ketone or an ester. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction, but that typically requires a diene and a dienophile.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diene, and the aluminum isopropoxide is used as a catalyst in some cycloaddition. Hmm. I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, product 1 is a ketone, so maybe when it's heated with aluminum isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a formation of an enol ether or some kind of ring-opening.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but earlier I thought that the IR didn't support that. Alternatively, maybe it's a diketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction forms a cyclohexenone structure, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide could undergo some kind of Diels-Alder reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but the IR doesn't show broad peaks for OH.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and the IR's 1720 cm-1 is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the IR indicates an ester. Because esters have carbonyl around 1720-1740 cm-1.

Wait, in the first step, perhaps the product is an ester. How would that happen? Maybe the KOH is not a base but a nucleophile, but in that case, we'd need a good leaving group. Wait, but dibromides are good di-leaving groups. Oh, wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but with two substitutions. But that would lead to a diol, which wouldn't have a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules and forming a conjugated diene. But then, why the IR shows a carbonyl? Maybe that's a wrong assumption.

Alternatively, maybe the product isn't a conjugated diene but a ketone. Perhaps the reaction is a double elimination followed by a rearrangement to form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl via a cyclic transition state. For example, in some cases, when vicinal dihalides are treated with a strong base, they can eliminate both X groups and form a carbonyl if there's a possibility for a more stable carbocation or through some rearrangement.

Wait, for example, in the case of 1,2-dibromoethane, treatment with KOH would form ethylene. But if the structure is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl, perhaps via a conjugated diene or some rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to each Br, leading to two adjacent carbocations, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the next steps and see if that helps.

So, product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is commonly used as a Lewis acid catalyst for Friedel-Crafts reactions. So, if product 1 contains a carbonyl group, perhaps it's undergoing a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone, so if it undergoes a Friedel-Crafts acylation, that would require an acylium ion, but product 1 itself is a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is acting as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and when treated with a Lewis acid, it undergoes a [2+4] cycloaddition with another dienophile.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the next step. Product 2 is then treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis of alkenes, breaking double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So, product 2 must have at least one double bond, as ozonolysis acts on that. So, product 2 is likely an alkene. Therefore, the reaction of product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide must form an alkene.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene, perhaps product 1 undergoes some kind of elimination to form the alkene. How?

Wait, product 1, after KOH treatment, is a ketone. Then, when treated with a Lewis acid like Al-isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but no, the IR shows a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diepoxide. But then, the IR would show the epoxide's C-O-C peak, which is around 1200-1300 cm-1, but the specific peak here is at 1720, which points more towards a ketone or ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction produces a ketone, and the second step is a dehydration to form an alkene. Wait, but Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, which can help in the removal of water. So, if product 1 is a diol, heating with a Lewis acid could dehydrate it to form an alkene. But earlier, the IR didn't show OH peaks, so maybe product 1 isn't a diol.

Hmm. Alternatively, product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes a Claisen rearrangement or some other pericyclic reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a conjugated diene, and the Lewis acid helps in some cycloaddition.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is a di-substituted alkene, and product 2 is a tri- or tetra-substituted alkene after some addition.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction (with KOH) forms a diene, which is then hydrogenated or something, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the ozonolysis step. Ozone cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. The ozonolysis is done at -78°C, which is a low temperature, so it's likely a standard ozonolysis without any rearrangements, leading to the formation of carbonyl compounds.

So, product 3 is the result of ozonolysis of product 2. So, product 2 has a double bond that, when cleaved, produces product 3.

Now, looking at product 3's NMR, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, which isn't exchanging with the solvent.

The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

So, the most deshielded proton is likely to be near an electronegative group, such as a carbonyl. So, perhaps it's adjacent to a carbonyl, making it a vinylic proton that's part of a conjugated system.

Wait, but if product 3 is the result of ozonolysis, it would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were. So, perhaps product 3 is a diketone or has two ketone groups.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of a proton in product 3. So, perhaps in product 3, there are protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups, which are coupled with neighboring protons.

Wait, for example, if product 3 has an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, then the vinylic protons could couple with adjacent protons. Or if the structure is such that a proton is split by two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

But wait, the question says to exclude protons that exchange with the solvent. So, it's not OH protons but maybe some methyl or methylene protons.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a symmetrical compound, and the most deshielded proton is in a specific environment. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, let's backtrack. Let's try to outline all the steps:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with IR carbonyl) upon heating with KOH.

2. Product 1 → product 2 upon heating with excess Al isopropoxide.

3. Product 2 → product 3 upon ozonolysis followed by dimethyl sulfide.

So, product 3 is the ozonolysis product of product 2.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene, product 3 would be a di-ketone or other carbonyl compounds.

Now, considering the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded proton is likely near a carbonyl.

Wait, if product 3 has a structure like a diketone, maybe with adjacent CH2 groups, the coupling could be a doublet of doublets or something else.

But the options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

Wait, another angle: in ozonolysis, the double bond breaks, and each fragment gets an O from ozone, forming carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has a symmetrical double bond, product 3 might have two identical carbonyl compounds.

Alternatively, if the double bond is unsymmetrical, the ozonolysis products would be different.

Wait, maybe product 2 is an alkene that, upon ozonolysis, forms two identical carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is a cyclic diene, ozonolysis would break it into a diketone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a simple alkene, and ozonolysis gives two aldehydes or ketones.

But then, product 3's NMR would have protons adjacent to carbonyls. If one of them is a CH2 group next to a ketone, the protons would couple with adjacent protons.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. The CH2 groups next to carbonyls have protons that couple with each other.

In that case, the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would each be adjacent to two protons on the neighboring CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, because each proton on a CH2 would be split by the two neighboring protons on the adjacent CH2. So, each proton would have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is next to another CH2, each proton would have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in that case, the protons on each CH2 would be equivalent, so their coupling would be a triplet.

But the question is about the most deshielded proton. The deshielded protons are usually those near electronegative groups, like carbonyls. So, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have protons that are more deshielded.

So, in product 3, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would have protons that are deshielded, and their coupling would be a triplet.

But wait, in such a case, each CH2 would have two neighboring Hs from the adjacent CH2 group. So, each H would couple with two Hs, resulting in a triplet.

But wait, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, each CH2 group's protons are split by the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So, each H on the first CH2 would see two Hs on the second CH2, leading to a triplet. Similarly for the second CH2.

But in that scenario, each of those Hs would be a triplet.

So, in the NMR, those Hs would appear as triplets.

But wait, the question is about the most deshielded H. Which would be the ones next to the carbonyl. So, perhaps those are the ones in question.

So, for the most deshielded H (those on the CH2 next to carbonyl), each H is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the next CH2. Wait, no, the same CH2 has two Hs, but each H is next to two Hs on the adjacent group.

Wait, perhaps each H on the CH2 would have coupling with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs (on the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if each H is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the next CH2, that would be more splitting. But that's not the case because each CH2 is only bonded to the next CH2.

Wait, let me think again. The structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Each CH2 is connected to the next. So, each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. So, for the first CH2, each H is next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H on the first CH2 would be split by two Hs, giving a triplet.

Similarly, the second CH2's Hs would also be split by two Hs from the first CH2, leading to a triplet.

So, the Hs on both CH2 groups would be triplets. Therefore, in product 3's NMR, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would show as triplets.

But wait, the question is about the most deshielded H. Those would be the Hs closest to the carbonyl groups. So, the Hs on the first CH2 group (next to the carbonyl) would be more deshielded than the Hs on the second CH2 group.

So, those Hs would be in a triplet coupling pattern.

So, the answer would be option A) triplet.

Wait, but wait another thing. If the structure is more complex, such as a ring, the coupling could be different. Alternatively, if the ozonolysis breaks a ring and forms a chain, the protons could have different coupling.

But given the information, I think the most straightforward answer is that the most deshielded H is a triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, is treated with excess KOH at 240°C.  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group.  
   - The NMR data for product 1 includes a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), suggesting a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom (likely oxygen). The 2.41-2.23 ppm region (10H) corresponds to the adamantane framework, and the 1.94 ppm (2H) likely represents another CH₂ group.  
   - Based on the IR and NMR data, product 1 is identified as a ketone, likely adamantanone.

2. **Reaction with aluminum isopropoxide**:  
   - Product 1 (adamantanone) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a strong Lewis acid.  
   - This step likely facilitates a rearrangement or elimination reaction, forming product 2, which contains a double bond (alkene). This is inferred because the subsequent ozonolysis step cleaves double bonds.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   - Product 2, containing a double bond, undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyls deshield nearby protons.

4. **Coupling pattern in product 3**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This proton is coupled with two equivalent protons on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.  
   - The triplet arises because each hydrogen on the CH₂ group is split by two neighboring hydrogens.

Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

Answer: A
