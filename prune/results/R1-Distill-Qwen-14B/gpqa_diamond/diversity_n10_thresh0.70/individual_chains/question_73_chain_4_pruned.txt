Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out. The question is about finding the relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction, right? Oh right, because at speeds close to the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula I remember is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait—if both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't simply subtracted. Let's think. So the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c, so from the first's perspective, the second is moving at (0.6c -0.5c)=0.1c? But that's only in classical mechanics. Relativity would say it's different because of the factors involved.

So the correct formula for relative speed between two objects moving along the same line is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me plug in the values. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

So the numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1-0.3=0.7.

So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel around 0.14c. So that's the relative speed part.

Now, the total energy of the system. The system consists of two astronauts, so the total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies. Each astronaut’s energy is their rest mass energy multiplied by gamma, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Let's compute gamma for him.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy E1 is 2m * c² * gamma1 = 2m * c² * 1.25 = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, energy is gamma * m c². So for the first astronaut, it's gamma1 multiplied by 2m c²? Or wait, wait: the rest mass energy is m c², so when you have a mass of
