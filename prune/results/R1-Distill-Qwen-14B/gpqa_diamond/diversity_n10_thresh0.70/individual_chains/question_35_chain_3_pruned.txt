Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The problem says Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I remember that angular momentum operators often involve Pauli matrices, so maybe S is related to that.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The σy matrix looks exactly like S here because σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So yeah, S must be σy. So, Ay = c * σy. And c is h/(4π), so let's plug that in.

So Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Eigenvalues come from solving (Ay - aI)φ = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So let's write the matrix equation. The matrix Ay - aI would be:

[ (h/(4π))*0 - a, (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*(i), (h/(4π))*0 - a ]

Which simplifies to:

[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero for non-trivial solutions. The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = a² - [ (i * (-i) ) (h²/(16 π²)) ) ].

Wait, i times (-i) is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So the determinant becomes a² - (h²/(16 π²)) * 1 = 0. So a² = h²/(16 π²). 

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π). Oh wait, but wait a second. Since these are eigenvalues for angular momentum, which is quantized, I think they should be ± ħ/2, where ħ is h/(2π). Because for spin-1/2 particles, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Hmm, let me check.

Wait, the operator here is Ay = c S, where S is like σy. S is usually the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, because S = (ħ/2) σ. So if S is (ħ/2) σy, then c S would be (h/(4π)) * (ħ/2) σy? Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. Wait, c is h/(4π), and S is σy. But wait, S here is actually (ħ/2)σy because the Pauli matrices are scaled by ħ/2 to get the spin operator. Oh, because the spin operator S is (ħ/2) * σ, right? So if S is σy, then the actual spin component would be (ħ/2) σy. But wait, in this problem, Ay is c * S, and S is given as σy. So perhaps c is (h/(4π)) which would be (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2? Wait, because h = 2π ħ. So h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2). Oh! So c is ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) σy, which is the standard spin operator S_y. So the eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So when we compute the eigenvalues, a should be ± ħ/2. Let me plug in the value I found earlier. Earlier, I found a² = [ h/(4π) ]², so a would be ± h/(4
