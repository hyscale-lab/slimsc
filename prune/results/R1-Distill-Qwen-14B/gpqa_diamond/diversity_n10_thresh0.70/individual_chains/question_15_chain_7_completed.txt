Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should prioritize observing that one. Both planets are Earth-like, detected via the RV method, meaning we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The key here is to calculate the transit probability for each planet.

Wait, transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But since the planets' masses are the same, their radii might be similar too? Or maybe not, because the host stars have different masses but same radii. Hmm.

Wait, the host stars have the same radii, but different masses. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But same radius means their densities are different. But I'm not sure if planet radius matters here directly.

Transit probability formula. I remember that the probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2, but that's when the orbit is edge-on. Wait, actually, the transit probability is R_p / R_s (the ratio of planet radius to star radius) multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned. Oh wait, the real formula is (R_p + R_s) / a, but actually, it's more about the relative size and the inclination.

Wait, I think the transit probability for a planet is roughly (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e^2))) ), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that term is 1. So the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) multiplied by something else. Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_p / a) * (R_s / R_p) )? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's the ratio of the areas. The planet must pass in front of the star, so the area is a factor. The probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) squared. No, wait, the probability is based on the chance that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet crosses our line of sight. That's a factor of (R_p / R_s), because it's the ratio of the size of the planet's disk to the star's disk. But actually, the probability is given by (R_p / R_s) multiplied by the probability that the orbital inclination is such that the transit occurs, which is a function of the Hill sphere or something else.

Wait, no, I think the transit probability is (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (1 + (M_p/M_s)^{1/3}))) ). No, maybe that's not right. Or perhaps the transit probability is (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e^2))) ) but e is zero here.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think differently. The transit probability depends on two main factors: the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. The closer the planet is, the higher the chance of transiting because the orbital plane is more likely to be aligned edge-on when the planet's orbit is tight.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned so that it transits is actually a function of the orbital distance. The formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a (1 - e^2)^0.5)), but since e=0, that simplifies. Wait, maybe not. Let me recall: The probability of a transit is the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can block to the area of the star itself, but it's actually more about the alignment.

Wait, another approach: The probability of a transit is (R_p + R_s) / (a) but actually, the correct formula is (R_p / R_s) * ( (R_s) / a ), but I'm probably mixing things up.

Wait, I found an equation from my notes: The probability of a transit is (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a / (R_s * (1 - e^2)^0.5)))) )? No, that's getting me confused.

Let me look for a better approach. The transit probability is given by P ≈ (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a)) ) * something else. Hmm. Maybe I should think in terms of the geometry. The planet's orbit must be edge-on for a transit. The probability that the orbital inclination is such that the transit occurs is P_inclination = (R_p / R_s) / a * ... wait, no.

Wait, I think the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s) * ( (R_s) / a ) )

Because the area of the star is π R_s², and the effective area the planet can transit is related to the orbital distance a. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, wait, the probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size, multiplied by the ratio of the star's size to the orbital distance. So P = (R_p/R_s) * (R_s/a) ) = R_p/(a).

Wait, that would mean the transit probability is R_p/a. But since the stars have same radius R_s, but the planets have same mass but perhaps different radii? Or is R_p same? The problem says both planets have the same mass but perhaps different radii because the host stars have same radius but different masses. Wait, but the problem doesn't state that the planet's radii are same. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says the host stars have same radii, but the planets have same masses. Since the planets have same masses but orbit different stars, their radii could be same or different. Wait, planet radius is not given, so maybe it's the same for both? Because the question says both are Earth-like, which suggests similar radii. So I think R_p1 ≈ R_p2.

But wait, the host stars have same radius but different masses. Star1 (Planet_1's host) has mass twice that of Star2 (Planet_2's host). Since same radius, their densities are different.

But back to the transit probability. If the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) * (R_s / a ), then it's R_p / a. Because R_s cancels out.

Wait, that would be P = R_p / a. So the probability is R_p divided by the orbital distance a.

But if both planets have same R_p, then the probability is inversely proportional to a.

Wait, because a is the orbital period related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. So a is related to the period and the mass of the star.

But wait, the period is given. Planet_1 has a period 3 times shorter than Planet_2. Because orbital period of Planet_1 is P1 = (P2)/3.

Wait, using Kepler's third law: (a^3) / (P^2) = G(M_s + M_p) / (4π²). But since M_p << M_s, we can approximate a^3 ∝ P^2 M_s.

So a^3 = (G M_s) (P^2)/(4π²), so a = [ (G M_s P^2) / (4π²) ]^{1/3}.

So for Planet_1, M_s1 = 2 M_s2. P1 = P2 /3.

So a1 = [ (G * 2 M_s2 * (P2/3)^2 ) / (4π²) ]^{1/3}.

And a2 = [ (G * M_s2 * P2^2 ) / (4π²) ]^{1/3}.

So a1/a2 = [ (2 * (1/3)^2 ) ]^{1/3} = [ (2 /9) ]^{1/3}.

Wait, 2/9 is about 0.222. Cube root of that is approximately 0.6. Let me calculate it more accurately.

The cube root of (2/9) is the same as (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3). 9 is 3², so 9^(1/3)=3^(2/3)≈2.08. 2^(1/3)≈1.26. So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.605. So a1 is about 0.605 times a2.

So a1 ≈ 0.605 a2.

Now, transit probability P = R_p / a (assuming R_p same for both).

So P1 = R_p / a1 ≈ R_p / (0.605 a2) ≈ 1.65 * (R_p / a2) ) = 1.65 P2.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2. That would mean Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

Wait, but wait, is the transit probability directly R_p / a? Or is there another factor?

Wait, another formula I remember: The probability of a transit is (R_p / R_s) * [ (R_s) / (a (1 - e²)^0.5) ) ] because the planet has to pass in front of the star. But since e=0, and R_s is same for both stars (as given), this simplifies to (R_p / R_s) * (R_s / a) ) = R_p / a. So yes, same as before.

So P1 = R_p / a1, P2 = R_p / a2.

But since a1 is smaller, P1 is bigger. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher.

Wait, but wait, R_p could be different if the stars are different. But the problem says both are Earth-like, which suggests similar R_p. But the problem doesn't specify the planet radii. Oh wait, the problem says same masses, but if the stars have different masses, the planets' radii might vary due to other factors, but since the question doesn't give that, I think we can treat R_p as same for both. So P1 is higher.

Wait, but the transit probability also depends on the inclination. Wait, the probability that the inclination is right is actually a function of the Hill sphere or something else. No, wait, the probability isn't just about the distance, but also the angle. The probability for a transit is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance at which the planet's orbit is viewed edge-on. Hmm, maybe I got the formula wrong.

Another approach: The transit probability is the area of the star divided by the area of the planet's orbit as seen from Earth. Wait, no, that's not it. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability of that is 1/(a) * something.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p + R_s) / (a), but adjusted for the orbital distance. Alternatively, I think the main formula is (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a / R_s )), because a is the semi-major axis, which is in the same unit as R_s. So a is in terms of R_s, perhaps.

Wait, another formula: The probability that a randomly oriented orbit will produce a transit is (R_p / R_s) * (1/(a / R_s)) ). Hmm, but that would be (R_p / R_s) * (R_s/a) ) = R_p/a, same as before.

So, with that, I think the transit probability is proportional to R_p/a.

Since both planets have same R_p, and a1 is smaller than a2, then P1 is larger than P2.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the star's mass for Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2's star. But Kepler's law relates a^3 ∝ (M_s) P^2. So for Planet_1, a1^3 = (2 M_s2) (P1^2) / (M_sun terms)... but perhaps I should express a in terms of P and M.

Given that P1 = P2 /3, and M_s1 = 2 M_s2.

So a1^3 = (2 M_s2) * (P1^2) / (4π² G) )

Similarly, a2^3 = (M_s2) * (P2^2) / (4π² G) )

Dividing a1^3 by a2^3:

(a1/a2)^3 = [ 2 M_s2 * (P1^2) ] / [ M_s2 * P2^2 ] ) = 2 * ( (P1/P2) )^2.

Since P1 = P2/3, (P1/P2) = 1/3 → (P1^2)/(P2^2)=1/9.

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2 * (1/9) )= 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.605. So a1 is 0.605 times a2.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is P1 = R_p/(a1) = R_p/(0.605 a2) ≈ 1.65 * (R_p/a2) ) = 1.65 P2.

So Planet_1 has about 1.65 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

Therefore, the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1 because it has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says ~2.7 times. So I think the correct answer is C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_p}{a} \), where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of its orbit. Since both planets are Earth-like, we assume their radii (\( R_p \)) are similar. Thus, the probability depends primarily on the semi-major axis (\( a \)).

From Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_s P^2 \), where \( M_s \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period. For Planet_1, the host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\( M_{s1} = 2M_{s2} \)), and the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter (\( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the ratio of semi-major axes
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_{s1} P_1^2}{M_{s2} P_2^2} = \frac{2M_{s2} \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_{s2} P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]
Taking the cube root:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605.
\]
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.605a_2 \).

### Step 2: Compare transit probabilities
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_p}{a} \). Since \( R_p \) is the same for both planets, the probability ratio is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_p}{a_1}}{\frac{R_p}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65.
\]
This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher transit probability.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The probability ratio is not 2.7.

### Conclusion
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a higher probability of transiting due to its smaller orbital distance.
