Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated gives B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs.

Hmm. Let's break this down piece by piece.

First, I need to figure out what substance X is. The clues about the reaction with Y and the product might help.

So, the reaction between X and Y produces gas W. W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of neutrons and protons? That would mean the molecule is made of elements where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Or maybe the molecule itself has an equal number of protons and neutrons in total.

Wait, no, the question says "each molecule" contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for example, if the molecule is H2O, the total would be (1+1) H (each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons) and O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons would be 2 (from H) + 8 (O) = 10. Total neutrons would be 8. So that's not equal. Maybe another example.

What about NH3? Let's see. NH3 has 1 N and 3 H. Nitrogen has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (I think), and each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So total protons: 7 + 3*1 = 10. Total neutrons: 7. Not equal.

Wait, maybe the molecule is something like O2. O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. O2 would have 2 O atoms, so protons=16, neutrons=16. Oh wait, that's possible. Or maybe CO2? Let me see. CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and two O (each 8p,8n). So total protons:6+ 2*8=22. Neutrons:6 + 2*8=22. Oh! So that's equal. So CO2 could be gas W.

But wait, what's the reaction that produces CO2? Maybe X is a carbonate reacting with acid? Because carbonates reacting with acids produce CO2 gas.

Alternatively, another possibility: gas W could be something like CH4. Let me check: CH4 has C (6p,6n) and 4 H (each 1p,0n). So total protons:6 +4=10. Neutrons:6. Not equal. So no.

Wait, another thought: gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So if it's a molecule like CO, let's see. CO has C (6p,6n) and O (8p,8n). So protons:6+8=14, neutrons:6+8=14. So that works. So CO could be the gas.

But CO isn't a common gas released in reactions. More likely, CO2 is. Wait, but earlier calculation shows that CO2 has equal protons and neutrons. So maybe that's the case.

So, going back, if gas W is CO2, what reaction would produce that? Carbonates reacting with acids give CO2. So if Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate.

Wait, but wait, X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X might be something like carbon dioxide, but no, because in that case, it's reacting with something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X is sodium bicarbonate (but that's a carbonate), but when it reacts with an
