Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me break it down.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in this structure.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is typical for a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester). In the NMR, there's a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H, which might be a methylene (CH₂) group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or something else. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) region suggests a lot of equivalent CH₂ groups, maybe in a bridged structure. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH₂. So considering the reaction with KOH, which is a strong base, I think this is an elimination reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would undergo dehydrohalogenation. Since the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, eliminating them would form an alkene. Wait, but wait, in the presence of KOH, maybe it's a double elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else, but since KOH is a base, probably E2 mechanism.

Wait, but the product is a carbonyl. If the IR shows a carbonyl, maybe it's a ketone. Oh, right! When two vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromoadamantane) react with a strong base, they can eliminate twice, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So, each elimination removes H and X, so eliminating two X's would give a carbonyl. So for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination would form 1,3-diketone? Or wait, no, because if you eliminate two HBr molecules, the structure would lose two Brs and form a double bond. Wait a second, no—wait, 1,
