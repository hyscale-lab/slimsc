Okay, I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let's start by understanding the target molecule and the starting material.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Breaking that down, it looks like there's a cyclohexane ring attached to a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde). Also, there's another substituent attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. That substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group. Wait, no, wait, the structure is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, the carbon attached to the cyclohexane ring has both a hydroxyl group and a methyl group (maybe a cyclohexyl substituent on the methyl? Or perhaps the methyl is attached to the cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl? Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is further attached to the main cyclohexane ring. So the structure is cyclohexane with a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group and an aldehyde group on the same carbon. Wait, no. Let me draw it mentally.

Let me imagine the target. It's cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a CH₂CHO group. But wait, the substituent at position 1 is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So the structure would be cyclohexane where one carbon (position 1) has a group that's a cyclohexyl attached to a CH₂OH, but that's not exactly right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) attached as a substituent on the cyclohexane that's also attached to the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent on the same carbon as the aldehyde. So the carbon adjacent to the aldehyde is substituted with a hydroxymethyl group that is also connected to a cyclohexyl group. So, that would be like (cyclohexyl)(CH₂OH) attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde.

Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1, which is a hydroxymethyl group (CH₂OH) that's connected to a cyclohexyl group. So, that substituent is (cyclohexyl)(CH₂OH). So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group at position 1 and another group that's a cyclohexyl connected via a CH₂OH.

Wait, no, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So maybe it's CH₂OH where one of the hydrogens is replaced by a cyclohexyl. So, it's (cyclohexyl)(OH)CH₂ attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)–CH2– group. Or perhaps it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH₂– group that also has an OH group. So the substituent is –CH₂–OH where the CH₂ is connected to a cyclohexyl group. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the starting material and the possible reactions.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond) attached. So it's cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡CH, right? Or wait, ethynyl is –C≡C–, so it's cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is –C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohex
