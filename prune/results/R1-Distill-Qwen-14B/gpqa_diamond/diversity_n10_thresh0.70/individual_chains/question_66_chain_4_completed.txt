Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these, labeled as options A to D.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it incorporates the Standard Model (SM) and adds higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond-SM physics. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 7, etc.

Wait, but what about symmetries? Effective theories usually respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory they're effective for. The Standard Model is a Lorentz invariant theory, so SMEFT, being an effective version of it, must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a yes.

Poincaré symmetry is a bit trickier. Poincaré includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. The SM is Poincaré invariant. So would SMEFT operators preserve that? I think yes. Because SMEFT is built from the SM fields and interactions, which already respect Poincaré, the added operators must too. Because if they didn't, they'd break the fundamental symmetries of the SM. So option 2 (Poincaré) is also something the operators must respect.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetry? I recall that the SM isn't CP symmetric in general. For example, there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So does SMEFT require operators to respect CP symmetry? I think not. Because the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, the effective theory shouldn't either. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, meaning they don't have to respect it. So option 3 (CP symmetry) is not a must.

CPT symmetry is different. I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because in relativity, you can't have a theory that doesn't respect CPT. If SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, which it does, then it must automatically respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 (CPT) is a must.

Putting it all together: the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincaré (2), and CPT (4). So the required symmetries are 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the options, option C says 1,2,4. So the answer should be option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model (SM) by including higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond-SM physics. SMEFT respects the same symmetries as the SM, as its operators are constructed from SM fields and interactions.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT, being an effective theory derived from the SM, must also respect Lorentz symmetry. This ensures that the theory remains consistent with special relativity.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations in space and time. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, SMEFT operators must also preserve this symmetry to maintain consistency with the SM framework.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry, as evidenced by CP violation in processes like the CKM matrix. Therefore, SMEFT operators are not required to preserve CP symmetry, as this is not a feature of the underlying SM.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: All Lorentz-invariant theories, including SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for any relativistic quantum field theory.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct option is:

Answer: C
