Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics and boson decay. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The question gives me a Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that. So the interaction term involves the field X coupling to fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decay channels at the lowest order.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the energy must be sufficient for the decay products to form. So, for each possible decay, the rest mass of the boson (X) must be greater than or equal to twice the mass of the decay products, right? Because particles are created in pairs, so each pair's combined rest mass must be less than or equal to the mass of X.

But wait, in the problem, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair that we're considering must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Let me recall the masses of the known fermions.

The fermion masses (approximate, in GeV) are:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0
