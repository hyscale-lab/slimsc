Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, the question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's about the time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So any changes in the Sun's core would take that time to reach us. So if the pp-III branch stopped, the neutrinos we detect now would reflect that change.

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the flux in each band is affected by the pp-III branch stopping.

I remember that different neutrino production processes in the Sun produce neutrinos at different energies. The primary sources are the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. The pp chain has different branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each produces neutrinos at different energies.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I think the pp chain has multiple steps. The pp-I branch is the main one, which produces neutrinos around 400 keV. The pp-II and pp-III are side reactions. Oh, right, pp-III produces higher-energy neutrinos. Because it involves more energetic processes, maybe the neutrinos are higher in energy than the main pp neutrinos.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of high-energy neutrinos would drop. But what energies are we talking about here?

I think the main pp neutrinos (from pp-I) are around 250-300 keV. Then pp-II produces higher, maybe up to 500 keV, and pp-III even higher, maybe around 700-800 keV or more. But I'm not exactly sure of the exact energy ranges. Or perhaps I should think about the specific neutrino energy distributions.

Wait, I recall that the pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos with energies around 700-800 keV. If that's the case, and the pp-III stopped, then the flux in band 1 (
