Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. So, a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and toward the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. And they've given some options.

Hmm. I remember that the index of refraction affects the speed of light in a medium. The formula for the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer, right? But in this case, the medium (the glass) is moving. So I think I need to consider how the motion of the glass affects the observed speed of light.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. Because the glass is moving, but the light is inside the glass. So the light's speed relative to the glass is c/n, but how does the glass's motion affect the speed as observed in the lab frame?

I think I remember something about Galilean transformations or maybe relativistic additions, but since the speed v of the glass is much less than the speed of light, maybe we can use non-relativistic (Galilean) addition here.

Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v. So the glass is moving in
