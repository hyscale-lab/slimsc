Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question says that the operator is P_vec, which has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Oh wait, and the eigenvector is for the operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So that direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which probably means it's a combination of x and z components, no y. So n could be written as (something, 0, something) if I'm thinking in 3D, but wait, the question is in terms of 2x2 matrices, so maybe it's a spin-1/2 system?

Right, because spin operators in quantum mechanics are often represented by 2x2 matrices. So the operator P is likely the spin operator, and the eigenvector would correspond to the spin-up or spin-down state along a particular direction. The eigenvalue given is +ħ/2, which makes sense because the spin-up state for a spin-1/2 particle has eigenvalue ħ/2.

Wait, no, actually the eigenvalues of the spin operator S are ± ħ/2. So if the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, that's the spin-up state along the direction of n.

But the operator in question is P, not S. But I think the components are given similar to the Pauli matrices. Let me look at the given components.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix times ħ/2. And P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix times ħ/2.

So the operator P for an arbitrary direction n would be the combination of these components. Since n is in the x-z plane, its direction can be described by some angles. Let's see, the direction vector n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So θ is the angle from the z-axis, I think. Or maybe θ is from the x-axis? Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the positive z-axis. So yes, n would have components (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0, so n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or (cosθ, 0, sinθ) depending on how θ is defined. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so we can write it as n = (a, 0, b). But since it's a unit vector, a² + b² = 1. So the operator P along n
