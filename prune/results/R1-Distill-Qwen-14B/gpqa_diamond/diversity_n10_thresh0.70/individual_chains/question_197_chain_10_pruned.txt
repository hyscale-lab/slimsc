Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out the final product based on the given IR and NMR data. The options are A to D, each a different compound.

First, I should recall what red phosphorus and HI do in a reaction. I remember that when alkenes react with phosphorus and iodine (like HI), it's a halogenation reaction, probably an addition. Red phosphorus is often used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, especially in the phosphorus pentachloride or HI reactions. Wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus is used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, typically in a mechanism that leads to the most stable carbocation. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. I know that when an alkene reacts with HI in presence of red phosphorus, it's a radical addition, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Wait, another approach. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrohalogenation, but with anti-Markovnikov addition. Because red phosphorus is used in the Markovnikov addition, but in some cases, maybe it leads to anti-Markovnikov? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, perhaps I should focus more on the initial structure of compound X.
