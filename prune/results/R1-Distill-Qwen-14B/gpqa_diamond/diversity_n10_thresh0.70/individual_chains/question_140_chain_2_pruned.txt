Okay, let's try to tackle this question. Hmm, it's a bit complicated, but I'll break it down step by step.

So, the question talks about a substance X reacting violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has molecules with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Then, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Lastly, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

I think I should start by figuring out what each of these substances could be.

First, the reaction between X and Y releasing gas W. W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So each molecule has the same number. Let me think about gases that are common in such reactions. Maybe CO2? Wait, but CO2 has 22 neutrons (for carbon-12) and 18 protons (since O has 8 each, so 8+8=16; wait, no, CO2 is C:6 protons, O:8 each. So CO2 has 6 + 8 + 8 = 22 protons. The neutrons would be: Carbon-12 has 6 neutrons, each O-16 has 8, so total 6 + 8*2 = 22. Oh wait, that would make the molecule have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So yes, same number. So W is CO2.

Wait, but another possibility: H2O? No, because H2O has 2 H (1 proton each) and 1 O (8), so total protons 10, and neutrons would be (assuming H is 1H, O is 16O): 0 (for H) + 8 each for O. So 8*1=8, so total neutrons 8. But 10 protons vs 8 neutrons—no, not same. So maybe CO2 is correct.

Next, precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, and B's melting point is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. Hmm, which substance has a melting point around there? Maybe ammonium chloride? No, that
