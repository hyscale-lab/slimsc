Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid and then dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to calculate both values and match them.

Wait, let me start by understanding the problem. So, first, the initial solution is made by mixing equal volumes of acetic acid and water. That would dilute the concentration of the acetic acid. Then, when titrated with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction will neutralize the acetic acid (a weak acid) to form acetate ions.

I remember that for weak acids, the pH calculations involve the acid dissociation constant, Ka. The formula for Ka is [H+][A-]/[HA], where HA is the acid and A- is the conjugate base.

Let me outline the steps I need to take:

1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.
2. Determine the volume of NaOH added at 25% titration and at equivalence.
3. For each point (25% and equivalence), calculate the pH using the appropriate method (maybe the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or the approximation method).

Starting with step 1: The initial concentration is 0.05 M, and we're diluting it with equal volume. So, the new concentration should be half, since concentration is inversely proportional to volume when moles are constant. So, 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M acetic acid.

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, let's compute the moles. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 L), and after dilution, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the moles of acetic acid initially are 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. So after diluting to 40 cm³, the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, which matches what I thought earlier.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added should equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added? Because 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

So, at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. Let's compute the moles of NaOH added: 0.0025 L * 0.1 M = 0.00025 moles.

Since the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid to form acetate. So, after adding 0.00025 moles NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH will decrease by 0.00025, and the moles of CH3COO^- will increase by the same amount.

Let me compute the moles in the diluted solution. The total volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). The moles of CH3COOH initially are 0.001, so after adding NaOH, CH3COOH will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of CH3COO^- will be 0.00025.

Wait, but when we add NaOH, the total volume increases. Let me think: the initial solution is 40 cm³. Adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH solution makes the total volume 42.5 cm³
