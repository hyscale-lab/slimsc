Alright, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, okay, I need to think through this step by step. Let me try to break it down.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics usually describe the geometry of a space, like how distances are measured. So this must be a two-dimensional metric since it's in terms of dx and dy.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, wait. I'm a bit confused between pseudosphere and regular sphere. From what I recall, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, kind of like a hyperbolic sphere. But I'm not entirely sure how that ties into the metric here.

Wait, the metric given looks like it might be conformally flat. Because it's written as (32)/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²), which is like a scale factor multiplied by the standard Euclidean metric. So, the line element is conformally related to the flat metric.

I think the general form for a conformally flat metric in 2D is ds² = f(x,y) (dx² + dy²). In this case, f(x,y) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So, how does this relate to the geometry?

The next thing I remember is that for a metric in two dimensions, the Gaussian curvature can be found using the
