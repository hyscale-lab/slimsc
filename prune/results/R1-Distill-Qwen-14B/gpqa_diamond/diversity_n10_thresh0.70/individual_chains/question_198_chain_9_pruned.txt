Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. Hmm, let's see. I remember that stability constants are involved here. 

The problem says we have Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) in solution. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, wait. Typically, stability constants increase with the formation of complexes. But here, β4 is 16, which is less than β2 and β3. That's a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe the complexes are ordered as Co(SCN)n where n is the number of SCN- attached. So the complexes would be Co(SCN)0, Co(SCN)1, Co(SCN)2, etc., up to maybe four ligands.

The stability constant, βn, for a complex with n ligands is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex. So for the first complex, β1 = [Co(SCN)] / ([Co][SCN]). Similarly, β2 would be for the di-substituted complex, and so on. 

But wait, the problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands, right? Because di- means two. So the Co(SCN
