Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, okay, let's see. 

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Oh wait, X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li has 3 protons normally, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6, I think. Because lithium usually has isotopes like Li-6 and Li-7.

So, I need to find the energy of the nucleus in the collider when its speed is 0.96 times the speed of light. Okay, so this is a relativistic problem because the speed is a significant fraction of c.

I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Oh right, so gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

But wait, the problem is about the kinetic energy or the total energy? Hmm, the question says "energy of the nucleus", and in collider contexts, usually, when they talk about energy, it's the kinetic energy. Or wait, sometimes they refer to the total energy. Hmm, I need to clarify that. Let me think. The question says, "what is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." Well,
