Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? And they give some options.

Hmm, right. So, the setup is a light beam moving through a glass slab that's itself moving. The glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light in the glass as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, but wait. When a medium is moving, how does that affect the speed of light in that medium? I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly because of the velocity addition formulas, but wait, this is about a medium moving through the lab frame. So maybe it's a case of considering relative motion.

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. But here, the medium (glass) is moving. So when the glass is moving, does that affect the observed speed of light in it?

I'm a bit confused. Let me think. In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. But when the glass is moving relative to the lab, how does that affect the light's speed as measured in the lab?

Wait, but in special rel
