Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about a star with certain parameters and how the presence of dark spots on its surface affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. I remember that this has to do with the Boltzmann equation and maybe the Saha equation, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. Hmm, wait, does the spots affect the overall temperature? I think dark spots are cooler regions, so when part of the surface is covered, the average temperature of the visible surface decreases. But how does that tie into the ratio of Ti levels?

The key point is that the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and 2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, no, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. Therefore, the factor would be the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots. So higher ratio when no spots.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the population of energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is given by (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the transition is between two energy levels, and the wavelength is 1448 Å. That's in the ultraviolet, I think. But maybe that's just the line being observed. So the energy difference between the two levels is related to the photon's energy: E = hc/λ. That could be useful.

But wait, in the problem, we're looking at the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So the ratio is (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

But when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature changes. However, wait, starspots are cooler, but the surrounding areas are hotter? Or when spots cover part of the surface, the observed Teff from the combined surface is lower, but during the calculation of the line ratios, which part matters?

Wait, the problem states that the ratio is observed in the photosphere. So when the star has spots, the photosphere's overall effective temperature is 5500 K. So the temperature used in the Boltzmann equation would be 5500 K in that case.

So let's model this. Without spots, Teff is 6000 K. With spots, Teff is 5500 K.

The ratio without spots is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(
