Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, I can't just use classical mechanics because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I'll need to use special relativity principles here.

First, I think I need to find the relative speed of the two astronauts. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as subtracting their velocities because of the way velocities add in relativity. Oh right, the formula for the relative velocity is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Let me make sure I remember that correctly. So v1 is the speed of the first astronaut, and v2 is the speed of the second. But wait, wait—since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute the numerator first: 0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. So approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, the relative speed options are either 0.14c or 0.1c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c, which would eliminate options A and B, which have 1.1c and 0.1c. So the possible options are C and D.

Next, I need to calculate the total energy of the system. Oh wait, the total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for each astronaut, I need to find their individual energies and add them together.

Let me compute each energy separately. For the first astronaut with mass 2m and velocity 0.6c:

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = Gamma1 * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait. I think I made a mistake here. Wait, the mass is 2m, so E should be 2m multiplied by gamma and c². So Gamma1 is 1.
