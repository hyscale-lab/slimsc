Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when atoms are excited, it has to do with their energy levels and temperature. The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Oh wait, no, more precisely, the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere have twice the excitation in a specific energy level compared to star_2. 

Wait, but what does it mean for atoms to be more excited? Oh right, the excitation level refers to the population of atoms in higher energy states. So if star_1 has twice as many iron atoms in a particular excited state, that suggests the excitation is higher there. 

The problem also gives an energy difference between the energy levels as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Saha equation or Boltzmann distribution probably applies here. 

I think the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the ratio of excitation (n_upper) for star_1 is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level. Wait, no, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice
