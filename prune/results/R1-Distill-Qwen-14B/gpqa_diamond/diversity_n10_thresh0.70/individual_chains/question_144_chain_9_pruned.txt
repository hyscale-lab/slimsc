Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think through it step by step.

First, the question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are particles that don't exist long enough to be observed directly; they decay quickly. Their properties are determined by their production energy, mass, and width.

The given values are:
- Production energy, E_X = 8 GeV
- Mass, m_X = 1.2 GeV
- Width, Γ_X = 320 MeV (which is 0.32 GeV)

We need to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, I think the mean decay distance depends on how long the particle lives on average before decaying, which is the lifetime, and then multiplied by the speed. But wait, how do I calculate that?

Oh right! The mean lifetime (τ) of a particle is related to its width (Γ) by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. In particle physics, the width Γ is the energy uncertainty, so Γ = ħ / τ. Solving for τ, τ = ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, the mean decay distance (L) is the product of the particle's velocity (v) and the lifetime (τ). So L = v * τ.

Wait, but what about the velocity? How do I find that? Since the meson has a high energy, maybe I should use relativistic mechanics. The production energy E is given as 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the energy E is much larger than the mass, which means the meson is moving at a speed close to the speed of light.

In high-energy physics, the energy E is often the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The relation between energy, momentum, and mass is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Since E is much larger than m c², we can approximate E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/(c). And the velocity v can be approximated as c, since the momentum is so high. But wait, let me think if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the velocity more precisely. Let me try that. The relativistic momentum p is gamma * m * v. The total energy E is gamma * m c². So, E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v. Then, since E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², dividing both sides by (m c²)² gives (E/(m c²))² = (p c / (m c²))² + 1. Let me rearrange that.

Let me denote gamma as γ. Then E = γ m c², and p = γ m v. So, E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. Substituting p, we get (γ m c²)^2 = (γ m v c)^2 + (m c²)^2. Dividing both sides by (m c²)^2 gives γ² = (γ² v²) + 1. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me rearrange:

γ² - γ² v² = 1 → γ² (1 - v²) = 1 → since (1 - v²) is (1 - v²/c²) because we have c² terms. Wait, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of v.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the velocity using E = gamma m c² and p = gamma m v. So, v = (p c²) / E. Since E = gamma m c² and p = gamma m v, substituting v into p gives p = gamma m (p c² / E) → p = (gamma m p c²) / E → which seems to complicate. Maybe a different approach.

Alternatively, using the relation E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ), so:

E² = (
