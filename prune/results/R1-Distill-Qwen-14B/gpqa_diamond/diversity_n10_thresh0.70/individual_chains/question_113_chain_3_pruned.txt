Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are different chemical formulas, and I need to pick the right one based on the data provided.

Okay, let's break down each piece of information from the question.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since it's very broad, maybe it's an alcohol, but carboxylic acids can also have broad peaks. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH group in a ketone or something else, but I'm more inclined to think alcohol or acid because of the broadness.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The peak at 1650 is a bit lower, which might suggest something like an aromatic ring (maybe conjugated carbonyl?), or perhaps an amide. Wait, but the question says several peaks in NMR include vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are part of a double bond, perhaps in an alkene. 

So, putting that together, maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond. If there's a carbonyl and a double bond, what functional groups could that be? Maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, like in a ketone with an adjacent double bond, or an ester with a double bond nearby. Alternatively, could it be a conjugated ester or a conjugated acid?

Next, looking at the 1H NMR: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So, the compound must have a double bond, as vinyl hydrogens are those attached to sp² carbons. So, that makes sense with the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650, maybe the 1650 is from conjugation with the double bond, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or ester
