Okay, so I've got this question about stars' distribution in the sky and how the number of stars per unit parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Alright, parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy. The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance of a star. So, a smaller parallax means the star is farther away. Wait, no, wait. Parallax is how much the star's position shifts as the Earth moves around the Sun. The formula I remember is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), right? So if plx is small, the distance is large. So stars with larger plx are closer to us.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, how does the density of stars change as we look at different parallax ranges.

Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, which I think means that the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. So the number of stars in a given volume depends on that volume.

But how does this translate into parallax? Parallax relates to distance, so let's think in terms of spherical shells. Like, imagine concentric spheres around the Earth. Each shell has a certain thickness (a range of distances), and the number of stars in each shell depends on the volume of the shell.

Wait, the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. If the number density (n) is constant, then number of stars N is n * volume.

Each shell between distance d and d + dd has a volume of 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a thin shell is the surface area (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness (dd). So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4πd² dd.

But parallax plx is 1/d (in arcseconds). So d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that.

So, d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Hmm, wait, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of plx.

So, the number of stars per unit plx would be the number of stars in a thin shell when plx changes by d plx. Let's think about the differential.

From N = n * 4π d² dd.

But since d = 1/plx, d² = 1/plx². And dd is the change in d, which is - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, because plx = 1/d → d plx = - (1/d²) dd. So, d plx = -dd/(d²) → dd = -d² d plx. Since we're dealing with differentials, the negative sign just indicates direction, but when considering the magnitude, we can ignore it for now.

So substituting:

N = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (d plx) * (d²) ) ?

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try again.

Since d = 1/plx, then dd (change in d) is -1/(plx²) * d plx.

So substituting into N, we have:

dN = n * 4π d² * |dd|

But |dd
