Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So I suppose the first thing is to normalize this state because probabilities are based on squared magnitudes. But wait, the question says it's proportional, so maybe I need to normalize it myself.

Then, the operator's matrix elements are given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm. So this is a 2x2 matrix because the basis states are |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So for a 2x2 matrix, the operator would look like:

[ 0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0  ]

Because when i≠j, it's ħ/2, and diagonal elements (i=j) are zero. Wait, let me think again. The matrix is zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

The question is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. And also find the average value of the operator.

Wait, but the operator's eigenstates are different from the |up> and |down> states because the operator isn't the same as the spin-z operator. So I think I need to find the eigenstates of matrix A, then express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the expectation value without diagonalizing the operator. But the problem also asks for the probability of measuring each eigenstate, so I think diagonalizing is the way to go.

Let me outline the steps I need to take:

1. Normalize the state |alpha>.
2. Diagonalize the operator A to find its eigenstates and eigenvalues.
3. Express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.
4. The probabilities are the square of the coefficients' magnitudes.
5. Then, find the expectation value of A, which is the sum of eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The operator A is given, and we're to measure in the eigenbasis of A. So the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the components of |alpha> in those eigenstates.

So first, let me normalize |alpha>.

The state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's find the normalization factor. The norm is the inner product of the state with itself.

So, let me compute |1+i|^2 and |2 -i|^2. 

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

Wait, but wait. The coefficients are [1+i, 2 - i]. So the inner product is (1+i)(2+i) + (2 - i)(1 + i)? Wait, no, because it's the sum of the squares of the magnitudes. So |a|^2 + |b|^2. So |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, and |2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So now, the state is normalized.

Next, I need to find the eigenstates and eigenvalues of operator A. The matrix A is:

0   ħ/2
ħ/2 0

So, to find the eigenvalues, we solve det(A - λ I)=0.

Which is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (ħ/2)^2 = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0.

So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Now, to find the eigenvectors. For λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2)I) x = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   - ħ/2 ]

The equations are:

- (ħ/2) x1 + (ħ/2) x2 =0 → x1 = x2.

So the eigenvector is (1,1), but normalized. The norm is sqrt(1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvectors are (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)) and (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)) for the other eigenvalue.

Wait, wait, no. Because for λ = -ħ/2, the matrix becomes:

[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]

Which gives the equation (ħ/2)x1 + (ħ/2)x2=0 → x1 = -x2. So the eigenvector is (1, -1), normalized to (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstates for A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

Now, the state |alpha> is expressed as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

I need to express this in terms of |+> and |->.

So let's write |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

Let me compute the coefficients.

Let me write |alpha> = a |+> + b |->.

So,

|alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Let me group terms:

= [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

But we have |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So equating coefficients:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7) → equation 1.

( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7) → equation 2.

Let me multiply both equations by sqrt(2):

Equation 1: a + b = (1 + i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) → (1+i) sqrt(2/7)

Equation 2: a - b = (2 - i) sqrt(2/7)

Now, adding the two equations:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] sqrt(2/7 )

= (3) sqrt(2/7 )

So a = (3/2) sqrt(2/7 ) → 3 sqrt(2/(7*4)) ) → sqrt( (9 * 2) / (4 *7) ) ) → sqrt( 18 / 28 ) → but not sure, maybe better to compute numerically.

Wait, sqrt(2/7) is around 0.5345, but maybe we can proceed without approximations.

Similarly, subtracting the two equations:

2b = [ (1 + i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7 )

= (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7 )

So b = [ (-1 + 2i) / 2 ] * sqrt(2/7 )

Hmm, perhaps it's better to find a and b.

Alternatively, let me compute a and b:

From equation 1: a + b = (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7 )

From equation 2: a - b = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7 )

Adding:

2a = (3 + i) sqrt(2/7 )

So a = (3 + i) * sqrt(2) / (2 * sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = (1 + i - 2 + i ) sqrt(2/7 )

= (-1 + 2i ) sqrt(2/7 )

So b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) / ( 2 sqrt(7) )

But perhaps it's better to compute the coefficients a and b and then find their magnitudes squared to get the probabilities.

The probability of measuring +ħ/2 is |a|^2, and the probability of measuring -ħ/2 is |b|^2.

So let's compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

First compute a: (3 + i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

Compute |a|^2: [ (3)^2 + (1)^2 ] * (2) / (4 *7 )

The numerator is (9 +1) * 2 = 20.

Denominator is 4 *7=28.

So |a|^2=20/28 =5/7 ≈0.714.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because 5/7 is about 0.714, but looking at the answer options, they have probabilities like 0.64, 0.54, 0.28, etc. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's recheck the calculation.

a = (3 + i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

So |a|^2 = (3^2 +1^2) * (2)/( (2 sqrt(7))^2 )

Wait, wait. The expression is (3 + i) multiplied by sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

So the magnitude squared is |3 + i|^2 * [ (sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7))) ]^2.

|3 +i|^2 is 3^2 +1^2 =10.

The term [ sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ]^2 is (2)/(4 *7) )= 2/(28)=1/14.

So |a|^2 =10 * (1/14) )=10/14=5/7 ≈0.714.

Similarly, compute |b|^2.

b= [ (-1 +2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)).

|b|^2= [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] * (2)/( (2 sqrt(7))^2 )

= (1 +4 ) * (2)/(4*7) )

=5 * (2)/(28)=10/28=5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but 5/7 is about 0.714 and 5/14 is about 0.357. So the probabilities would be 5/7 and 5/14.

Wait, but 5/7 +5/14 = (10 +5)/14=15/14, which is more than 1. That can't be right.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Because the sum of probabilities can't exceed 1.

Ah, I see the mistake. Let me re-calculate |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Wait, the expression for a is (3 +i) multiplied by sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

So |a|^2 = |3 +i|^2 * [ sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ]^2.

|3 +i|^2 is 3^2 +1^2= 10.

[ sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ]^2 = (2)/(4 *7) )= (2)/(28)=1/14.

So |a|^2=10 * (1/14) )=10/14=5/7≈0.714.

Similarly, |b|^2.

b is [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)).

|b|^2= | -1 +2i |^2 * [ sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ]^2.

| -1 +2i |^2 is (-1)^2 +2^2=1+4=5.

So |b|^2=5 * (1/14)=5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but 5/7 +5/14= (10 +5)/14=15/14=1.071, which is more than 1. That's impossible. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Ah, wait a second. Because I think I made a mistake in setting up the equations when expressing |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

Wait, let me go back. I think I made a mistake in setting up the equations.

Wait, the eigenstates of operator A are |+> and |->, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), correct?

So, when I express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->, it's |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

Which, when expanded, is:

c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

= [ (c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) ] |down>.

Now, comparing to the given |alpha> which is a |up> + b |down>, where a is (1+i)/sqrt(7) and b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So,

(c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1 +i)/sqrt(7) → equation 1.

(c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7) → equation 2.

Let me solve these equations for c_+ and c_-.

Multiply equation 1 by sqrt(2):

c_+ + c_- = (1 +i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) → (1 +i) sqrt(2/7) → equation 1a.

Multiply equation 2 by sqrt(2):

c_+ - c_- = (2 -i) sqrt(2/7) → equation 2a.

Now, adding equation 1a and 2a:

2 c_+ = [ (1 +i) + (2 -i) ] sqrt(2/7 ) = (3) sqrt(2/7 )

So c_+ = (3) sqrt(2/7 ) / 2 → 3/(2) * sqrt(2/7 )

Similarly, subtracting 2a from 1a:

2 c_- = [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ] sqrt(2/7 ) = (-1 + 2i ) sqrt(2/7 )

So c_- = [ (-1 + 2i ) sqrt(2/7) ] / 2.

Now, let's compute |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2:

c_+ = (3/2) sqrt(2/7 )

So magnitude squared is (3^2)/(2^2) ) * (2/7) = (9/4) * (2/7) )= 18/(28) =9/14 ≈0.6429.

Similarly, compute |c_-|^2.

c_- = [ (-1 + 2i ) sqrt(2/7) ] / 2.

So the magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] * (2/7) ) / (2^2) )

= (1 +4) * (2/7) ) /4 →5 * (2)/(7*4) )=10/(28)=5/14≈0.357.

So the probabilities are |c_+|^2 =9/14 ≈0.643 and |c_-|^2=5/14≈0.357.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7 for the average.

Wait, but the average value is the sum of eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So average = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) )= [ (9/14) - (5/14) ] (ħ/2 ) = (4/14)(ħ/2 )= (2/7)( ħ/2 )= ħ/(7).

So average is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14=0.643 (approx 0.64) and 5/14=0.357 (approx 0.36), and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7, which matches.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option D says 0.61, 0.29, which doesn't match.

So the correct option should be A.


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of the operator must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize it, compute the norm:

\[
\text{Norm}^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down⟩.
\]

### Step 2: Diagonalize the operator A
The operator A is represented by the matrix:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of A are found by solving the characteristic equation:

\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = \lambda^2 - \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^2 = 0.
\]

This gives the eigenvalues:

\[
\lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

The corresponding eigenvectors are:

\[
|+⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ + |down⟩), \quad |−⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ - |down⟩).
\]

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in terms of |+⟩ and |−⟩
The state |α⟩ can be written as:

\[
|α⟩ = c_+|+⟩ + c_-|−⟩.
\]

Expanding |+⟩ and |−⟩ in terms of |up⟩ and |down⟩:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{c_+ + c_-}{\sqrt{2}}|up⟩ + \frac{c_+ - c_-}{\sqrt{2}}|down⟩.
\]

Comparing coefficients with the normalized |α⟩:

\[
\frac{c_+ + c_-}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad \frac{c_+ - c_-}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Solving these equations:

\[
c_+ + c_- = (1+i)\sqrt{\frac{2}{7}}, \quad c_+ - c_- = (2-i)\sqrt{\frac{2}{7}}.
\]

Adding and subtracting these equations:

\[
2c_+ = (3)\sqrt{\frac{2}{7}}, \quad 2c_- = (-1+2i)\sqrt{\frac{2}{7}}.
\]

Thus:

\[
c_+ = \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{\frac{2}{7}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1+2i}{2}\sqrt{\frac{2}{7}}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute probabilities
The probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues \(+\frac{\hbar}{2}\) and \(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\) are \(|c_+|^2\) and \(|c_-|^2\), respectively.

\[
|c_+|^2 = \left|\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{\frac{2}{7}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left|\frac{-1+2i}{2}\sqrt{\frac{2}{7}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately:

\[
P(+\frac{\hbar}{2}) \approx 0.64, \quad P(-\frac{\hbar}{2}) \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the average value of A
The average value of A is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)P(+\frac{\hbar}{2}) + \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)P(-\frac{\hbar}{2}).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)\frac{9}{14} + \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)\frac{5}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{2}\left(\frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{2}\cdot\frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is \(\frac{\hbar}{7}\). This matches **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
