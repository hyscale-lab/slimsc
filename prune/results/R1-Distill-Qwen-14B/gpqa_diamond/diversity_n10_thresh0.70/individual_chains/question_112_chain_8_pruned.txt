Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The states |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I'm dealing with spin-½ systems here.

The task is to calculate two things: the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and then find the average value of that operator. The operator's matrix representation has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and zero otherwise. Hmm, wait, that sounds familiar. Let me think about what kind of operator that is.

So, the matrix elements are zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. For a 2x2 matrix, because the state is in spin space (two states), the matrix would look like:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Wait a second, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So A = (ħ/2) * σ_x. That makes sense. So the operator is proportional to the Pauli X matrix.

But wait, the question is about the eigenstates of this operator. The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. So the eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), I think.

So, to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates of A. Then the probabilities would be the square of the absolute values of the coefficients.

But first, I need to normalize |alpha> because it's given that it's proportional to that expression. So let's compute the normalization factor.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The inner product <alpha|alpha> is (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i) [Wait, no, more accurately, since |up> and |down> are orthogonal, the inner product is the
