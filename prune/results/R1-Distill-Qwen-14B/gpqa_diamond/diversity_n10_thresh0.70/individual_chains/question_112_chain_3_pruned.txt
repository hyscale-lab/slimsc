Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, not normalized. So the first step is probably to find the normalization constant.

The eigenstates |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. That's the standard basis for spin-1/2 particles, I think. So |up> is (1,0) and |down> is (0,1) in vector terms.

So the state vector is (1+i, 2-i)^T. To normalize, I need to calculate the inner product, which is the sum of the absolute squares of the components.

Let me compute that: |1+i|^2 is (1^2 +1^2)=2. Then |2-i|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2)=4+1=5. So the total squared magnitude is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh, wait, the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so the vector is [1+i, 2-i], right.

So the normalized state is |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * (1+i, 2-i).

Next part: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. The matrix representation of A is given as A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix, right? Because |up> and |down> are two states.

So the matrix A looks like:

[0       hbar/2 ]
[hbar/2  0    ]

Because for a 2x2, the diagonal elements are 0 when i=j, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So A is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal is zero and the off-diagonal are hbar/2.

Hmm, what does this operator represent? Oh, wait, the spin matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0 1],[1 0]]. But wait, our A is hbar/2 times the Pauli X matrix. Because Pauli X has 1s off-diagonal, and A has (hbar/2) there.

Wait, the spin operator S_x is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So S_x = (hbar/2) * σ_x. So the operator A is S_x. So to find the eigenstates of A, I need to find the eigenstates of S_x, which are the eigenstates of σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are (1,1)/sqrt(2) and (1,-1)/sqrt(2) respectively. So these are the eigenstates we
