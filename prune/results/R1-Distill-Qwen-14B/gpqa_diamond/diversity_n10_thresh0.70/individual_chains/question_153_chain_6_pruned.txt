Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. It's about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. So the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate, right?

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to find the major products for each and match them with the options given.

Let's take it step by step.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). I think that sodium ethoxide is a base, so it probably deprotonates something to form an enolate. 

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. Its structure is like CH2(COOEt)2. When it reacts in a Michael addition, the enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Looking at methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be at position 3, so perhaps it's CH2CH2 with substituents? Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is on the acrylate. So the acrylate part is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. But the p-tolyl group would be attached where? Maybe the acrylate is CH2=CH- group attached to the CO-OCH3 and a p-tolyl group on the same carbon? Or wait, no, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. So, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 (if the acrylate is at position 1), but the structure might be CH2=CH-p-tolyl? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Hmm, perhaps the structure is COOCH2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, perhaps I should draw it mentally as CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with the p-tolyl group on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond. Or perhaps it's (E)-configured, so the substituents are on opposite sides.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COO
