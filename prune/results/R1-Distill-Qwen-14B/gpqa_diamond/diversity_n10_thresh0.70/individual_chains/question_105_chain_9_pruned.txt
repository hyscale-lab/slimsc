Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how their effect on the brightness is similar to an exoplanet. The task is to find the radius of such a planet relative to the star that would produce the same brightness variation.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So when the star rotates, these spots come into view, causing the observed brightness to dip periodically. But the question says that this setup can look like an exoplanet transit. So, the way the brightness changes when the spots rotate into view is similar to when a planet transits in front of the star, blocking some light.

Wait, but the problem is asking what's the radius of a planet that would cause the same amplitude in the star's light curve if there were no spots. So, the amplitude here is the change in brightness when the star's brightness dips due to the spots.

I remember that the change in brightness when a planet transits a star is given by the formula: ΔF = (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the planet blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to the square of their radii ratio. So, the dip in brightness is (Rp/R*)^2.

But in this case, the star has spots, so the dip isn't just from an area being blocked but from the spots being cooler. So the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view. Let me think about how that works.

The star's total brightness without spots would be uniform. When spots are present, their lower brightness causes a dip when they're in the observed hemisphere. The brightness change is a combination of the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

The filling factor is 20%, meaning that 20% of one hemisphere is covered by spots. So for one hemisphere, the area covered is 0.2 * (π R_star^2 / 2) )? Wait, no, because the area of a hemisphere is 2π R^2, but I'm not sure. Wait, the star's total surface area is 4π R^2
