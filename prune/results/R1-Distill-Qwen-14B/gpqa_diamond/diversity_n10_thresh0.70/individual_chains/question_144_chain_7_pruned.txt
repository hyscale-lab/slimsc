Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and they can decay into other particles. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of this meson X. 

The given data are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in terms of meters, and the numbers look like they're on the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, how do I find the mean decay distance? I think it involves the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the mean decay length is the product of the lifetime (τ) and the speed (v) of the particle. So, mean decay distance L ≈ v * τ.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime τ? I remember that the natural linewidth Γ is related to the lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. 

But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and the other constants are in SI units, so I need to convert units properly. Let me think: ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. But since Γ is in MeV, I should convert everything to consistent units.

Wait, let me make sure. GeV is 1e3 MeV, so
