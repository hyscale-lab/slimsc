Alright, so I have this physics problem about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Okay, let me read the question again. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f bar (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I remember that the Lagrangian describes how particles interact. So, the boson X is interacting with fermions, right?

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out what particles X can decay into, considering their masses and the conservation laws.

Wait, the boson X is a boson, so it's a force carrier, maybe like a photon or W boson. Since it's interacting with fermions, perhaps it's a gauge boson. But the problem gives the Lagrangian, so maybe X is similar to a scalar boson like the Higgs? Hmm, but in this case, the interaction term seems more like Yukawa coupling, which involves fermions and a scalar.

In the Lagrangian, the term is -λ f (ψ_f bar) (υ + X) ψ_f. So, when X couples to fermions, each fermion ψ_f has a coupling proportional to λ f. So, X can decay into pairs of fermions. The decay products would be a fermion and its antiparticle.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, the decay products must each have a mass less than 3 GeV (since each fermion's mass has to be less than half of 6 GeV for the decay to be possible). Wait, wait, no, because when a particle at rest decays, each product must have energy, so the sum of their rest masses must be less than the mass of X. Wait, no, because for a fermion pair, the total rest mass would be 2m, so 2m < M_X.

Wait no, that's not correct. The condition is that the rest mass of each decay product must be less than or equal to M_X/2. Because the combined rest mass must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle. For example, if X
