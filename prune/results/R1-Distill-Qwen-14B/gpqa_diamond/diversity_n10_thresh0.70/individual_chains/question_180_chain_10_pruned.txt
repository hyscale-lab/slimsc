Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem here. Let's read it again carefully.

We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. So each charge is twice the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. But wait, e is 1.602176634e-19 C, right?

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 13th is at the center, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. I think each of the 12 is equally distant from P, but they might form a regular structure. But since the problem is about the potential energy, maybe their exact arrangement doesn't matter because potential energy depends on distances.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given in Joules, so I guess we're calculating the potential energy.

Wait, potential energy is a scalar quantity. So for a system of point charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. But since the system is isolated, we need to calculate the potential energy of each pair.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So how does that affect the potential energy? Let's think.

Each of the 12 charges at 2m from P would interact with the central charge. Also, each of the 12 charges would interact with each other. So the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 and the central one, plus the potential energies between each pair of the 12.

But wait, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So each of the 12 is 2m away from the central charge. What about the distance between the 12 charges themselves? Since they are all at 2m from P, their positions relative to each other could vary, but if they're all on a sphere of radius 2m, the minimum energy configuration would involve minimum repulsion. Wait, but no, because all of them are of the same charge, so they repel each other. To minimize the total potential energy, which is due to their mutual repulsion, perhaps the charges arrange themselves as far apart as possible. But wait, in this problem, the problem states that they're constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their mutual distances are fixed? Or is their mutual distance variable, but they are all at 2m from P?

Wait, the problem says that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So each is 2m away, but their positions relative to each other can vary. But for potential energy, the distances between the charges matter. So if all the 12 are at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not specified, perhaps we can consider that the system's potential energy depends on both the central charge interactions and their mutual interactions.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps we need to find the configuration where the potential energy is minimized. Because if the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes their mutual potential energy, that would contribute to the total minimum.

Wait, but each charge is 2e. So the central charge is 2e, and the 12 others are each 2e as well. So each of the 12 charges will contribute a potential energy term with the central charge.

So first, let's compute the potential energy of the central charge with each of the 12. Then, compute the potential energy between each pair of the 12.

But wait, the problem says the system is isolated, so the potential energy is the sum of all the pairwise interactions.

Wait, the formula for the electric potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So, for each of the 12 charges:

Each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the central charge is 2e. So for each pair (central and one of the 12), the potential energy is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m). Wait, distance is 2 meters.

So each such pair contributes (k * (2e)^2) / (2). And there are 12 such pairs, so 12 * [k * (4e²)/(2)] which simplifies to 12 * [2 k e²] = 24 k e².

Wait, wait, let's compute that.

(2e)*(2e) = 4e²; divided by 2 meters, multiplied by Coulomb's constant k. So each pair contributes (k *4e²)/(2
