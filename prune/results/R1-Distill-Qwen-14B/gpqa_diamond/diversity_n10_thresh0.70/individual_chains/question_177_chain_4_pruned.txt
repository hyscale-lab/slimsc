Okay, so I have this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Hmm. Let me try to break it down.

So, the problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. I remember that mass and radius aren't directly proportional in stars, but maybe that's just extra info here.

The key thing is that the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So both stars have the same temperature.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, so it's not moving towards or away from us much. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. I'm thinking Doppler shift might come into play here. But wait, the peak wavelengths were determined through spectroscopy. Oh wait, no, because the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe the Doppler shift doesn't affect this particular measurement. Or maybe it does. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So maybe the observed wavelengths are the same, but their actual emission peaks could be different if there's a Doppler shift. Hmm, that's a tricky part.

Wait, let me think: If a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted. For Star_2, moving at 700 km/s, maybe that's a significant velocity. So the observed wavelength would be shorter than the actual emission peak. Conversely, if Star_1 is stationary, its observed peak is its actual peak. But the problem states that the observed peaks are the same. So perhaps that tells us something about their actual temperatures, considering Doppler shifts.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's denote the temperature of each star as T1 and T2.

The observed wavelength for Star_1 is λ1, and for Star_2, it's λ2. But according to the problem, λ1 = λ2. But considering Doppler effect, the observed wavelength λ is
