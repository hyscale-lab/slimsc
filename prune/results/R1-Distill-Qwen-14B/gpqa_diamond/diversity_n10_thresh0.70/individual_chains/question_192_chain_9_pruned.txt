Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I need to figure out the electric field at a point outside a spherical conductor with a cavity. Let me try to visualize the setup first.

Alright, so there's a big spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a smaller cavity. The cavity isn't at the center of the big sphere; it's off by a distance s. The radius of the cavity is r, and since r < R, it's entirely inside the conductor. I remember that when a conductor has a cavity, charges redistribute in a certain way.

Now, someone placed a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. I'm supposed to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to P is L. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. The angle between l and s is theta. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.

Wait, so the setup is that the conductor itself is uncharged, right? Because it says uncharged. So, the conductor initially has no net charge. But when we put +q inside the cavity, I recall that the charges in the conductor will redistribute.

In a conductor, charges reside on the surface. But with a cavity, if it's uncharged, the charges inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Oh right, when you have a charge inside a cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So, in this case, the inner surface will have -q, because the charge inside is +q.

But wait, the conductor itself was neutral. So, the inner surface has -q, which means the outer surface must have +q to balance it out. Because the total conductor's charge is zero, the sum of inner and outer surface charges should be zero. So inner is -q, outer is +q.

But wait, no. Wait, the conductor is uncharged. The charge inside the cavity is +q. So the inner surface of the conductor must have -q due to induction. Then, the outer surface would have +q to make the total charge of the conductor zero (because the conductor was initially uncharged). Wait, no, the conductor's total charge is
