Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty on adamantane structures, but I remember it's a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together into a very rigid molecule. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on the first and third positions of the adamantane.

The first reaction is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and in such conditions, especially with vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons), I think an elimination reaction is likely. Vicinal dihalides reacting with a strong base like KOH typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. Since there are two bromines on different carbons, they might eliminate to form a double bond.

Wait, but adamantane is a diamondoid structure. So the 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the two Br atoms on adjacent carbons if it's a 1,2-dibromo, but 1,3 would be a bit farther apart. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Oh wait, no, in adamantane, the positions are such that 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbons of a cyclohexane-like ring. So maybe elimination is possible.

So when KOH is used, two elimination steps would occur. Each Br leaves, and adjacent H's are abstracted, forming a double bond. But wait, we have two Brs, so perhaps two eliminations happen. Wait, no—elimination of two molecules of HBr would lead to the formation of a diene maybe? Or maybe a single elimination for each Br.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. That makes me think of an epoxide. Oh wait, no, epoxides are usually formed when there's an adjacent dihalide and an acid or base. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide elimination to form an alkene, but the color suggests something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination reaction leading to a conjugated diene. Or perhaps a cyclic ether? Wait, no, KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in this case,
