Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch reaction stopping. Hmm, I need to figure out the ratio of the flux in two energy bands. Let me think step by step.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, mainly the proton-proton chain. The pp-III branch is one part of that chain. I think the pp chain has multiple branches: I, II, and III. Each produces different neutrino energies.

Wait, right, pp-I produces 1 MeV neutrinos, pp-II around 0.8 MeV, and pp-III, which I think is higher, maybe around 1.4 MeV? Or is it the other way around? No wait, the main neutrinos are the pp-I and pp-II. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me get this right.

The pp chain: the initial stage is pp-I, where two protons fuse into deuterium, releasing a positron and a neutrino. Those neutrinos have energies around 0.42 MeV. Then, in the pp-II branch, if the conditions are right, another proton fuses with the deuterium nucleus, producing helium-3 and more neutrinos. Those are higher energy, around 0.8-1.0 MeV maybe? Or wait, I think the main neutrinos from the Sun are the 0.42 MeV (pp-I), then the 0.8 MeV (pp-II), and then the 1.4 MeV from the
