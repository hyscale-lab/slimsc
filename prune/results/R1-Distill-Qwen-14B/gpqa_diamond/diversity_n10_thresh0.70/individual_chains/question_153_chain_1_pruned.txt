Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. Hmm, I remember that Michael addition involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them with the options given.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH). I think dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate. The other compound is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, so it's the Michael acceptor. The sodium ethoxide is a base, which would deprotonate the malonate to form the enolate, which then attacks the beta position of the acrylate.

So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of the acrylate is something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the substituent is p-tolyl. So the structure is more like CH2=C-(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. When the enolate attacks the beta position, it would add to the middle carbon, the one next to the p-tolyl group.

After the addition, the product would have the two malonate groups attached to the same carbon where the attack happened. Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH, so when the enolate attacks, the structure would become something like (CH3COO)2C-CH2-C-(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again.

Actually, the malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2. When it forms the enolate, the negative charge is on the alpha carbon, which is the central carbon. The enolate attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the acrylate is CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with the p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Or wait, maybe it's (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-CO-OCH3? No, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So substituting at position 3: that would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, maybe it's CH2=
