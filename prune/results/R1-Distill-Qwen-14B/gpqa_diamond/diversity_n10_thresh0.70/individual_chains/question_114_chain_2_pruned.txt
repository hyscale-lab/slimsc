Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different reagents A and B. So I need to figure out what reagents are needed for each step.

Let me start with the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, what's that structure? Let's see: butane is four carbons. The nitrile group (-CN) is on carbon 1, I think. Wait, no, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw it.

Butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CN, but wait, butane has four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Or is it CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. Wait, no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Or is it CH3CH2CH2CN? Wait, maybe better to think the product is (CH3)2CH(OH)CN? Wait, no.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butane is four carbons. The nitrile is at position 1. So the structure would be:

CN-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, no, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have four carbons in the chain. The nitrile is on C1, then C2 has the hydroxyl and methyl groups.

So
