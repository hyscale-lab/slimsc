Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum mechanics models. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says we're dealing with a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, what's the fundamental state here? Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the next state would be the first excited state. But wait, in the rotational-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized both for rotation and vibration. So transitions can occur in either or both.

I think when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can change its vibrational and/or rotational state. But the question is about the lowest possible energy increase. So probably the next state is the next energy level, which could be the next rotational state, or the next vibrational state, whichever requires less energy.

But the problem is asking for the photon that switches the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I need to find the photon that causes the smallest possible energy jump. Wait no, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, maybe that means the next higher energy state, the smallest possible step. So I need to find the minimal energy photon that can cause a transition from the ground state to the next possible state, which is the first excited state, but not higher.

So in
