Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them to the given options.

Starting with part A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate or can form an enolate, right? And the other compound is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is the electrophile.

So in the Michael reaction, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta position of the acrylate. Wait, since the acrylate is E, the substituents are on opposite sides. But in the product, the tolyl group would be attached where? The malonate has two methyl groups and two COOEt groups. When the attack happens, the enolate's carbanion would add to the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So the product would have the malonate's R groups (methyl and COOEt) connected to the acrylate's R groups. The structure would be a tricarboxylate because dimethyl malonate has two ester groups, and adding another would add another. Let me think about the connectivity. The malonate is (CH3COO)2CH-. When it adds to the acrylate, which is CH2=CH-CO-OEt, but wait, the acrylate is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OEt, but the (E) configuration. The attack is at the beta (CH2) position.

So after the Michael addition, the product would be a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's alpha carbon and the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the product would be (COOEt)2CH-CH2-C(O)OEt, but wait, no, because the acrylate is E. Wait, the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OEt, and the substituents on the double bond are the p-tolyl group and the methyl group. Wait, no, the acrylate is methyl, so the structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)OEt. No, wait, the acrylate is 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The structure of
