Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on SMEFT, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. And the choices are combinations of these. 

Wait, what's the deal with SMEFT operators? I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible Lorentz-invariant operators of higher dimension (like dimension 6, 8, etc.) that respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. But I'm not exactly sure about all the details.

So, Lorentz symmetryâ€”right, that's a big one. All terms in the Lagrangian must be Lorentz scalars, so Lorentz symmetry must be respected. So option 1 is a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, meaning the theory is invariant under changes in position and momentum. But wait, in the SMEFT, the operators are local, so they should respect local Lorentz symmetry, but does that necessarily include Poincare symmetry? Or is Poincare more about the whole spacetime shifts? I'm a bit confused here. Oh, wait, Poincare symmetry includes both translations and Lorentz transformations. So if the theory has a Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian, it's already Poincare-invariant because the Lagrangian density is a scalar, and when you integrate over spacetime, it's invariant under translations. So Poincare is automatically satisfied if Lorentz symmetry holds. So would that mean that operators must respect Poincare symmetry? Or is it more that Poincare is a broader symmetry, but the SMEFT already incorporates it through Lorentz invariance.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must all operators respect. So if Lorentz symmetry is already a requirement, does that imply Poincare as well, since Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations? Or perhaps the SMEFT specifically requires Lorentz symmetry, and the Poincare is a separate requirement. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the SMEFT doesn't require Poincare symmetry explicitly because it's already implied by having a Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian. But I'm not sure. Let me think: The SMEFT is formulated as
