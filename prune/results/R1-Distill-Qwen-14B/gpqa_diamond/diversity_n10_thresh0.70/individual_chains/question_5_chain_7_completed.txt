Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, okay, so P is a vector operator, right? It has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

The operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, so that direction can be described using polar coordinates or something. Since it's in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis, I think. And phi would be zero because it's in the x-z plane, so phi is the angle around the z-axis, but if it's in x-z, phi is 0 or pi maybe? Wait, no, because in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or 180 degrees, but the direction could be any angle between x and z.

So the operator along direction n would be a combination of P_x, P_y, and P_z. Oh wait, no, since n is in the x-z plane, the direction is (x, 0, z). So the direction vector would be something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because when θ is 0, we're along z, and when θ is 90 degrees, we're along x.

So the operator P along n would be P · n_hat. Which is P_x * (n_x) + P_y * (n_y) + P_z * (n_z). But since n is in x-z, n_y is zero. So P · n_hat = P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z.

Substituting n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So the operator becomes (P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ) multiplied by ħ/2, because each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by their matrices.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each component is already (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix. So P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So when I combine them as P · n, the matrix would be [ (ħ/2) (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) ].

Wait no, the operator would be the sum of the components multiplied by their respective direction cosines. So actually, the total operator P_n is given by n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n_y is zero here, because n is in x-z plane, so P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Each P component is (ħ/2) times their respective matrices. So substituting, P_n = (ħ/2) (n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Since n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, this becomes:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

The first matrix is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]], and the second is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]. Adding them together:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the entire operator is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix.

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector of P_n corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let's denote the eigenvector as |v> = [[a],[b]]. The eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So let's set up the equation:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a'; b']

Which simplifies to:

[ (cosθ a + sinθ b), (sinθ a - cosθ b) ] = [ a, b ]

Wait, because the right-hand side is (ħ/2) times [a; b], but when I factor (ħ/2) out from both sides, they cancel, so you end up with the matrix multiplied by [a;b] equals [a; b].

So:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a
sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me write these as equations:

1: cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
2: sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a = (1 + cosθ) b

Let me look at equation 2. I can rearrange it to find a in terms of b. So a = [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] b.

Wait, but what if sinθ is zero? Hmm, but if sinθ is zero, then θ is 0 or pi, which would be along the z-axis. Let me think about that case separately.

But for now, let's proceed. So substituting a = [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] b into equation 1.

Equation 1: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0.

Substitute a:

(cosθ -1) * [ (1 + cosθ)/sinθ ] b + sinθ b = 0.

Let's compute (cosθ -1)(1 + cosθ) = (cos^2θ -1) = - sin^2θ.

So:

[ (- sin^2θ ) / sinθ ] b + sinθ b = 0 → [ - sinθ + sinθ ] b = 0 → 0 = 0.

Okay, so the substitution works. So the equations are consistent, and we can express a in terms of b as a = [ (1 + cosθ)/sinθ ] b.

So let's set b = sinθ, then a = (1 + cosθ). But wait, let me see. Alternatively, to make it general, perhaps express in terms of some parameter.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express the components as a ratio. Let me consider the ratio a/b.

From equation 2:

a/b = (1 + cosθ)/sinθ.

Hmm, I remember that (1 + cosθ) = 2 cos^2(theta/2), and sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So,

a/b = [2 cos^2(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ) ] = [cos(theta/2)] / [sin(theta/2)] ) = cot(theta/2).

So a = b cot(theta/2).

So let me write the eigenvector as [a, b], where a = b * cot(theta/2).

To find the normalized vector, we can set b to some value. Let's let b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2), because cot(theta/2) = cos/(sin), so a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2).

So the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, wait, let me check that. If a = cos(theta/2) and b = sin(theta/2), then a/b = cot(theta/2), which matches.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, that's for the eigenvalue +ħ/2? Let me think. Because when theta is 0, n is along z, and the eigenvector for P_z would be [1, 0], which matches cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0. And for theta = 90 degrees (pi/2 radians), n is along x, and the eigenvector would be [0, 1], which is cos(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2? Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait if theta is 90 degrees, then theta/2 is 45 degrees, so cos(theta/2)= sqrt(2)/2, sin(theta/2)= sqrt(2)/2. So the eigenvector would be [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which is the same as [1,1] up to normalization. Oh, right, because when theta is 90 degrees (along x), the eigenstate is the |+x> state, which is (1,1)/sqrt(2), so the eigenvector in this case would be [1,1], but our solution gives [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which is correct.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, wait, the problem says "the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in x-z plane", so our calculation shows the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but the options don't seem to have this. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) (sqrt(2/3)ħ, sqrt(1/3)ħ) → This looks like it's scaled with ħ, but I don't see ħ in the eigenvectors because the eigenvectors are dimensionless. Hmm, maybe the options are written with some scaling factors.

Wait, no, wait. The given options have terms like sqrt(2/3) ħ etc. But eigenvectors are usually treated as unit vectors, so I'm a bit confused about the presence of ħ here. Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are state vectors, which are dimensionless, with the operator having units of energy or action.

Wait, but the operator P is given as having components multiplied by ħ/2. So perhaps the vectors are written in terms of ħ, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the options are not correctly normalized.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization. Let me check. The eigenvector I derived is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is already normalized because cos^2 + sin^2 =1.

Wait, but the options are in terms of sqrt(2/3), etc. So maybe I should look for an option that matches this form.

Looking at option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). Hmm, that's exactly what I got. But wait, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which would be a possible answer. But let me check the other options.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ). Hmm, that's a scaled version of our vector. But why would it have a sqrt(2/3) factor?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Because in the problem statement, the operator P is along a direction n in the x-z plane, which is arbitrary. So perhaps the eigenvector's direction depends on theta and phi, but since n is in x-z, phi is zero. So the eigenvector should have components expressed in terms of theta/2.

Wait, but in the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is what I derived. So that would make sense. But let me look at the other options.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is the spherical harmonics expression for a state in the x-z plane, but that's for the angular part, but not the eigenvector.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and 1/3 factors, which suggests a specific direction. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong in thinking that the eigenvector is simply [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the problem. Let me go through the steps again.

The operator P_n is (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

The eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So the matrix equation is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0 → equation (1)

sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a = (1 + cosθ) b → equation (2)

From equation (2), a = [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] b.

Substituting into equation (1):

(cosθ -1) [ (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ ] b + sinθ b = 0.

Compute (cosθ -1)(1+cosθ) = cos^2θ -1 = - sin^2θ.

So:

[ (- sin²θ ) / sinθ ] b + sinθ b = 0 → [ - sinθ + sinθ ] b = 0 → 0=0.

So the solution is a = [ (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ ] b.

Let me express this as a ratio a/b = (1 + cosθ)/(sinθ) = [ 2 cos²(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2).

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2) * b, b ].

Factor out b: b [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But b can be any non-zero scalar, so we can set b = sin(theta/2), which gives a = cos(theta/2), because cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, yes, that's correct. So the eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which is option C.

But wait, looking back at the options:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me check the other options. For example, option D has sqrt(2/3) factors multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but that would imply a different normalization.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm missing a normalization factor somewhere. Wait, the eigenvector I derived is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is a unit vector, because cos^2 + sin^2 =1.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the components in terms of some other basis, like maybe in the x-y plane or something else. Hmm, but no, the eigenvector is in the two-level system, so it's a spin-1/2 state.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the components after considering the direction n. Wait, I think I'm correct, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] when the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Because when theta is 0, the eigenvector is [1, 0], which is correct for the +z eigenstate. When theta is 180 degrees, it's [cos(90), sin(90)] = [0,1], which is the +x state.

So yeah, the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as follows:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be expressed as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta
\]

Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right)
\]

Simplifying the matrix:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]

Substituting the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n}$:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]

This gives two equations:

1. $\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a$  
2. $\sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b$

From equation (2), solving for $a$ in terms of $b$:

\[
a = \frac{(1 + \cos\theta)}{\sin\theta} b
\]

Substituting $a = \frac{(1 + \cos\theta)}{\sin\theta} b$ into equation (1) confirms consistency. The ratio $a/b$ simplifies to $\cot(\theta/2)$, so:

\[
a = \cos(\theta/2), \quad b = \sin(\theta/2)
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

This matches option **C**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **A** and **D** include unnecessary factors of $\hbar$, which are not part of the eigenvector (eigenvectors are dimensionless).  
- **B** represents a general spherical coordinate form but does not match the derived eigenvector for the given eigenvalue.  

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
