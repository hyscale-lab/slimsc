Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so M1 = 1.5 * M2. 

But wait, I'm not sure if the mass is relevant here. The question is about luminosity, which I think relates more to the star's radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the luminosity L is proportional to R² multiplied by T⁴. So L = 4πσ R² T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both are black bodies, this should apply.

The problem says the stars appeared brightest at the same wavelength. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (about 2.9×10^-3 m·K). So if their λ_max are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. That makes sense.

So T1 equals T2. So when we calculate the luminosities, since T is the same for both, the luminosity ratio will depend on the R squared ratio.

Wait, but let's double-check. The problem says the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ_max1 = λ_max2. So, according to Wien's Law, T1 = b / λ_max1 and T2 = b / λ_max2. Since λ_max1 = λ_max2, then T1 = T2.

So, T1 = T2.

So, L1 / L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, the temperature terms cancel out, and it's just (R1/R2)².

R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. So the ratio is 2.25, right?

But wait, the options have some other numbers. Let me check the options: A is ~2.25, B is ~2.32, C ~2.35, D ~2.23.

Wait, but wait a minute. Is that all? Because the problem also mentions the radial velocities being 0 and 700 km/s. How does that factor in?

Hmm, radial velocity... oh, I think that affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the wavelengths shift.

Wait, but in the problem, the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe the emitted λ_max is the same, but due to Doppler shift, the observed λ_max could be different.
