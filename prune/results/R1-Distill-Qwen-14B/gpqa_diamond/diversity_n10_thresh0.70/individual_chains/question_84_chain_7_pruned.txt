Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one when solving higher-dimensional heat equations using higher-order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting. The key factor involved is the matrix exponential function approximation using a fractional approximation. So, the main point is about the conversion step.

The options are A to D. Let's think about each one.

Option A: Stability analysis. Stability is important in numerical methods to ensure that the errors don't grow without bound. But how does that relate to converting a sequential algorithm to parallel? I'm not sure. Stability might be a factor in the method's correctness but maybe not the key for parallelism.

Option B: Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal conditions refer to boundary conditions that depend on the solution at other points, not just the boundaries. I'm not certain, but I don't see the direct connection to parallel algorithms. Maybe if the conditions are nonlocal, it affects how you split the problem, but I'm not sure if that's the key factor here.

Option C: Complex roots of fractional approximation. Fractional approximation methods, like Pad√© approximants, are used to approximate functions. If the approximation has complex roots, that could complicate the splitting. Wait, in parallel splitting methods, like in some time-stepping schemes, the idea is to split the problem into parts that can be computed independently. If the approximation leads to factors that have complex roots, maybe that affects how the matrix can be diagonalized or decomposed, making parallel computation possible. Or perhaps the presence of complex roots allows for certain decompositions that enable parallelism.

Option D: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Partial fractions are used to decompose complex expressions into simpler terms. If the approximation can be broken down into linear partial fractions, that might facilitate parallel computation because each term could be handled separately on different processors. This seems plausible because linear splitting often allows for parallel execution.

Wait, the question is about the key factor in converting to a parallel algorithm. So, how does fractional approximation play into this?

In the context of matrix exponentials for solving PDEs, methods like the exponential time differencing (ETD) methods use approximations of the matrix exponential. When splitting into parallel steps, the approximation might need to be factorizable. If the approximation can be split into terms that can be computed independently, then it's possible to parallelize.

If the fractional approximation allows for a linear partial fraction decomposition, that might split into multiple terms that can each be processed in parallel. So option D could be the key.

Alternatively, if the approximation has complex roots, maybe it's easier to diagonalize the matrix, making it possible to compute each eigenvalue's contribution in parallel. But I'm not too confident about that.

Wait, another approach: In parallel algorithms, especially for time-dependent PDEs, methods like the parallel time integration methods (such as those using waveform relaxation or parallel-in-time methods) might require the time discretization to be split into independent parts. For these, the matrix exponential's properties, such as whether it can be decomposed into terms that can be computed in parallel, are crucial.

Fractional approximation methods might involve approximating the exponential function as a sum of terms, each involving different powers of the matrix
