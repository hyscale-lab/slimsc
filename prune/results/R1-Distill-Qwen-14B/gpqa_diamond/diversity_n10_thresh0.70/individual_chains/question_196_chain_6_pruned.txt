Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, right, a harmonic oscillator usually obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. But wait, this is the relativistic version, so I guess I can't just use the classical equations of motion directly. I remember that in the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But with relativity, things get more complicated, right?

So the problem gives me a mass m and maximum amplitude A. I need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions involving c, k, m, and A.

Let me think about the classical case first. In classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is (1/2)kA². At maximum displacement (amplitude A), all the energy is potential. When the mass passes through the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy becomes kinetic. So the maximum speed v_max is sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so that formula might not hold.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy is not (γ-1)mc², right? And the total energy is γmc². So I need to set up the energy conservation in the relativistic scenario.

The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². But wait, in relativity, are we still using the same form for potential energy? I think so because the force is given by F = -kx, which is the same as in classical mechanics. So the potential energy V(x) is (1/2)kx².

At maximum amplitude x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². At maximum speed, which occurs at x=0, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. Wait, no, actually, in the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but I have to be careful.

Wait, no. The total mechanical energy E is the sum of the potential energy and the total relativistic energy. Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Let me clarify.

The total energy E is the
