Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected the planets. RV detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble.

So, for Planet #1, the spectral line shift is 5 milliangstroms (that's 5e-3 angstroms?), and for Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

I remember that the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude, which is the maximum velocity of the star, is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p^3) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2) ) )^(1/3) ) / (c * sqrt(1 - e^2)) )

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I think there's a simplified version when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's. Since Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun, M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so maybe we can ignore M_p in the denominator.

I think the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) * (1 - e^2) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / c) ) * ( (1) / sqrt( (1 - e^2) ) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should recall another approach. The RV method relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. I also remember that the maximum velocity of the star is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

The formula for K is:

K = [ (2πG) / (c T) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )

But since both planets have similar masses and the stars are the same, and the orbits are circular (e=0), so (1-e^2)=1. So that simplifies things.

Wait, but in this problem, the semi-amplitude K is given as the wavelength shift. Wait, no, the question says the periodic shift is in wavelength. So I think the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity.

Wait, velocity can be found from the Doppler shift. The formula for velocity is v = (λ_observed - λ_rest) / λ_rest * c. But since both shifts are given in the same units (milliangstroms), perhaps the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2 is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts, given that the rest wavelength is the same.

So K1 is 5 milliangstroms, and K2 is 7 milliangstroms. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1
