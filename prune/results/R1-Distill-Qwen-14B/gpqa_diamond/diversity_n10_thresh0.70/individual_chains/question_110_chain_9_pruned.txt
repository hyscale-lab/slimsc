Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and the spectrographs that can detect them. Hmm, let me see. The question is asking which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. 

I remember that each spectrograph has different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can go down to 16 V mag. So the star's apparent magnitude has to be below (brighter than) 16 for HIRES and below 17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, actually, wait—ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, so any star with V mag less than or equal to 17 can be seen. No, wait, I think I might be getting this wrong. Oh right, the higher the magnitude number, the fainter the star. So if a star is brighter than 17, that would be magnitude less than 17, like 16 or lower. So the cutoff is: ESPRESSO can see down to 17, and HIRES to 16. So a star needs to be brighter than (apparent magnitude less than) 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES. So both would need the apparent magnitude to be ≤16 for both to detect it? Or am I mixing up? Wait, no. Because if ESPRESSO can detect stars brighter than 17, that means any star with V mag ≤17 can be observed. Similarly, HIRES can detect stars with V mag ≤16. So a star must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO, but wait no—wait, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because in astronomy, lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag in V, that means its apparent magnitude is less than 17. So, for a star to be detectable by ESPRESSO, its apparent V mag must be ≤17. Similarly, for HIRES, it must be ≤16. So a star needs to be within the apparent magnitude range that is bright enough for both. So, the apparent V mag of the star must be ≤16, because that
