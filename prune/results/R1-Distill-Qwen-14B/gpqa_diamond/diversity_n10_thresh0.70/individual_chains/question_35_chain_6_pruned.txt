Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Ay is given as c multiplied by matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). 

Wait, so first, I need to figure out what the matrix Ay looks like. Let me write down the matrix S. So S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Then, multiply each element by c. So Ay = c*S. Since c is h/(4π), that's a real number. So each element of S is multiplied by h/(4π). So the matrix becomes:

[ 0       -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0 ]

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay. The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue. 

Wait, I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix (like S here, which looks like the Pauli Y matrix) are ±1. But wait, S is scaled here because Ay is c multiplied by S. Let me think. The Pauli Y matrix usually is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which has eigenvalues ±1. So when we scale it by c, the eigenvalues would be scaled by c as well. 

So the eigenvalues of S are 1 and -1 because it's a Pauli matrix. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c*(1) and c*(-1). Let me calculate that. c is h/(4π), so a = ±h/(4π).

Wait, but wait, the options don't seem to have that. Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, and real part ±h/(4π). But that doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues should be real or imaginary? Wait, no, in this case, the matrix is Hermitian? Wait, no. Wait, matrix S: is it Hermitian? Let me check. The conjugate transpose of S would be [[
