Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules have both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, because the bond length isn't fixed, so the rotor model isn't rigid.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So when it absorbs a photon, it will transition to the next possible state with the lowest energy. Wait, but which quantum numbers change? Oh, because in such models, transitions can involve both vibrational and rotational changes. But maybe in the fundamental state, the vibrational quantum number is at its minimum, so maybe the photon causes a vibrational transition. Or perhaps it's a rotational transition. Hmm, not entirely sure.

The question is about the momentum of the photon. Oh right, because the photon's momentum is related to its energy. The energy of the photon should match the energy difference between the two states. So I need to find the energy difference and then calculate the photon's momentum.

Wait, the options are given as momentum (p) values. So the energy of the photon E = pc, where p is the momentum and c is the speed of light. Oh, that makes sense because for photons, E = pc. So once I find the energy difference ΔE, I can find p by dividing by c.

But how do I find ΔE? The molecule is in the fundamental state, which would be the lowest energy state. So perhaps the next state is the first excited state. But what's the nature of the transition? If it's a diatomic, I think the fundamental vibrational state is v=0, and the next would be v=1. But wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, probably the lowest energy transition available, which might be a vibrational transition because rotational transitions require higher energy sometimes?

Wait, the energy levels for rotation are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The energy levels for vibration are quantized as E_vib = (1/2) m ω² + h ω (n + 1/2), or something like that. But the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational level, n=0, and the ground rotational state, J=0. So when
