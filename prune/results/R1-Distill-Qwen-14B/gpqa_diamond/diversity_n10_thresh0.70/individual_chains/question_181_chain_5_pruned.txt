Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux question. Let me start by understanding what's going on here. The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core has suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, and we're looking at the flux ratio of two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are given as A to D, with some ratios.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several proton-proton (pp) chains. The main pp-I chain is the dominant one, but there's also pp-II and pp-III branches. Oh wait, the question specifies that it's the pp-III branch that's stopped. So I need to think about what the pp-III branch contributes to neutrino production.

From what I recall, the pp-III branch involves the reaction where a helium-3 nucleus (He-3) captures two protons to form a boron-5 nucleus, which then decays into two helium-4 nuclei and emits a positron and a neutrino. The neutrinos produced here are the high-energy ones, I think. So when the pp-III branch stops, the production of these high-energy neutrinos would stop as well.

Wait, but how much do these different branches contribute to the neutrino flux we observe on Earth? I remember that the majority of solar neutrinos come from the pp-I branch, which produces lower-energy neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III branches are less significant but contribute higher-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos from that branch would stop, but the others continue.

But wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two bands. So, the pp-III neutrinos are in the higher energy range. If pp-III stops, then the neutrino flux in the higher band (like 800-900 keV) would drop, but the lower band (700-800) would still have contributions from other processes, like pp-I and maybe pp-II.

Wait, the pp-III neutrinos are high-energy. So the band 1 is 700-800, which is medium, and band 2 is 800-900, which is higher. If pp-III is stopped,
