Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors can be expressed in terms of basis states. Here, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard spin-up and spin-down states for a spin-½ particle.

First thing I need to do is normalize the state |alpha>. Because the coefficients given are (1+i) and (2-i), but normalization is crucial for probabilities. The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

So the coefficients are:
c_up = 1 + i
c_down = 2 - i

The magnitude of c_up: |1+i| = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)
The magnitude of c_down: |2 - i| = sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5)

So the normalization factor squared is |c_up|^2 + |c_down|^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 + (sqrt(5))^2 = 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part of the question is about the operator whose matrix elements A_ij are given. The matrix is such that A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, for a 2x2 matrix, that would make it:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because when i ≠ j, A_ij is ħ/2, and diagonal elements (i=j) are 0. So yeah, that's a 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

I think this operator is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]] and this A is A = (ħ/
